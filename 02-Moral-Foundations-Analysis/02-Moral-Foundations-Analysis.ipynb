    "Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) hypothesizes that people's sensitivity to the foundations is different based on their political ideology: liberals are more sensitive to care and fairness, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five. Here, we'll explore whether we can find evidence for MFT in the campaign speeches of 2016 United States presidential candidates. For our main analysis, we'll go through the data science process start to finish to recreate a simplified version of the analysis done by Jesse Graham, Jonathan Haidt, and Brian A. Nosek in their 2009 paper [\"Liberals and Conservatives Rely on Different Sets of Moral Foundations\"](http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/GHN2009.pdf). Finally, we'll explore other ways to visualize and use this data in rhetorical analysis.\n",
