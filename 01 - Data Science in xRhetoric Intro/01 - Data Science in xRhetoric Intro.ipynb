    "Data Science is a fast-growing discipline with applications in many fields. Over the course of the next week, these modules will explore the use of Data Science in Rhetoric. Module 01 introduces the Python programming language and the Pandas DataFrame table structure and shows how to apply coding skills exploratory analysis for text data. Module 02 walks through the data science process start to finish to test Moral Foundations Theory. Finally, Module 03 examines data science as a rhetorical tool: how human biases, conscious or unconscious, affect how data is processed and perceived. \n",

    "Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics studies how to make robust conclusions with incomplete information. Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real-world applications. Domain knowlege is the most important compoent among above. Domain expertise is perhaps most relevant in the interpretation of insights. Without knowlege in the domain of the subject, we can't decide what to analyze."

Within just six hours of the announcement going live on her campaign web site, Senator Clinton\\'s candidacy attracted thousands of messages of support, and widespread accolades online. Overwhelming Response Within Hours of Going Live:  SIGN UPS = 100 per minute MESSAGES OF SUPPORT = 10,000 VIDEO WEBCAST SIGN-UPS = 7,700 BLOG CONTEST SUBMISSIONS = 2,200  Bloggers Give Clinton Announcement Rave Reviews: MYDD (Jerome Armstrong) - \"And as blogger savvy as John Edwards was in outreach, Clinton internet team had the emails of bloggers to notify them separate from the press (no such outreach from the Obama camp). The website has the clean, Kerry-2004 look about it. A smart \"write our first post\" call to action on the website. The announcement of \"an unprecedented series of video webcasts beginning Monday, January 22nd at 7pm EST for three nights\" creates a quick narrative of interaction and response around Bush\\'s SOTU address.\" DAILY KOS DIARY (nyceve) - \"I\\'m an open and honest person, and I\\'m profoundly moved by her announcement. What was unimaginable just a few decades ago, is now something we can almost touch.\" THE CARPETBAGGER REPORT - \"Clinton enters the race, without a doubt, at the top of the top tier. I\\'ve heard all the various concerns about her candidacy, but I don\\'t have any doubt that she has what it takes to win. Indeed, Clinton brings an enormous amount of talent, experience, and intelligence to the table.\" TAYLOR MARSH - \"Sitting in a living room setting, Senator Hillary Clinton made one simple statement that changed the landscape of the \\'08 presidential tournament to come. (To add, I got an email about this event this morning just after 6:00 a.m.) Because when the first woman to run for president, with an actual chance of winning, puts her name and reputation on the line, it becomes news of the day, week, even a generation.\" TALK LEFT - It is exciting to have a serious female candidate for President. OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY - After nearly eight years of speculation, Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for president.... she has done a remarkable job these past several years getting out of her husband\\'s shadow, positioning herself as more moderate than previously thought, and garnering bipartisan praise for collegiality and hard work in the Senate. DAILY KOS DIARY (Yellow Dog Blue) - \"How has she survived and thrived? Not by heavying up her armor. Not by engaging and overwhelming her opponents. Not even by appealing for public sympathy. Instead Hillary has just gone her business being a Senator, building personal relationships and support, getting and using power. And I really admire that.\" SEEING THE FOREST (Dave Johnson) - \"People say Hillary Clinton has \"baggage\" and is \"divisive.\" Actually she has been investigated more thoroughly than almost anyone in the country\\'s history and they found nothing at all. It isn\\'t Hillary who is divisive, it\\'s the people making all the accusations.\"'"
