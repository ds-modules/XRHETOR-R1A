       "'b\\'Campaign web site signs up 100 new members per minute, racks up 10,000 messages of support within 6 hours of announcement  Clinton candidacy hailed online as \"profoundly moving\"; \"top tier\"; \"exciting\"; \"remarkable\"; \"smart\"; and \"news of a generation\" Demonstrating the groundswell of enthusiasm generated by her historic candidacy, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\\\\\\'s announcement for President lit up the internet today, garnering rave reviews in the blogosphere, and thousands of supporters flocking to her web site each hour. Within just six hours of the announcement going live on her campaign web site, Senator Clinton\\\\\\'s candidacy attracted thousands of messages of support, and widespread accolades online. Overwhelming Response Within Hours of Going Live:  SIGN UPS = 100 per minute MESSAGES OF SUPPORT = 10,000 VIDEO WEBCAST SIGN-UPS = 7,700 BLOG CONTEST SUBMISSIONS = 2,200  Bloggers Give Clinton Announcement Rave Reviews: MYDD (Jerome Armstrong) - \"And as blogger savvy as John Edwards was in outreach, Clinton internet team had the emails of bloggers to notify them separate from the press (no such outreach from the Obama camp). The website has the clean, Kerry-2004 look about it. A smart \"write our first post\" call to action on the website. The announcement of \"an unprecedented series of video webcasts beginning Monday, January 22nd at 7pm EST for three nights\" creates a quick narrative of interaction and response around Bush\\\\\\'s SOTU address.\" DAILY KOS DIARY (nyceve) - \"I\\\\\\'m an open and honest person, and I\\\\\\'m profoundly moved by her announcement. What was unimaginable just a few decades ago, is now something we can almost touch.\" THE CARPETBAGGER REPORT - \"Clinton enters the race, without a doubt, at the top of the top tier. I\\\\\\'ve heard all the various concerns about her candidacy, but I don\\\\\\'t have any doubt that she has what it takes to win. Indeed, Clinton brings an enormous amount of talent, experience, and intelligence to the table.\" TAYLOR MARSH - \"Sitting in a living room setting, Senator Hillary Clinton made one simple statement that changed the landscape of the \\\\\\'08 presidential tournament to come. (To add, I got an email about this event this morning just after 6:00 a.m.) Because when the first woman to run for president, with an actual chance of winning, puts her name and reputation on the line, it becomes news of the day, week, even a generation.\" TALK LEFT - It is exciting to have a serious female candidate for President. OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY - After nearly eight years of speculation, Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for president.... she has done a remarkable job these past several years getting out of her husband\\\\\\'s shadow, positioning herself as more moderate than previously thought, and garnering bipartisan praise for collegiality and hard work in the Senate. DAILY KOS DIARY (Yellow Dog Blue) - \"How has she survived and thrived? Not by heavying up her armor. Not by engaging and overwhelming her opponents. Not even by appealing for public sympathy. Instead Hillary has just gone her business being a Senator, building personal relationships and support, getting and using power. And I really admire that.\" SEEING THE FOREST (Dave Johnson) - \"People say Hillary Clinton has \"baggage\" and is \"divisive.\" Actually she has been investigated more thoroughly than almost anyone in the country\\\\\\'s history and they found nothing at all. It isn\\\\\\'t Hillary who is divisive, it\\\\\\'s the people making all the accusations.\"\\''"

       "'\\'Campaign web site signs up 100 new members per minute, racks up 10,000 messages of support within 6 hours of announcement  Clinton candidacy hailed online as \"profoundly moving\"; \"top tier\"; \"exciting\"; \"remarkable\"; \"smart\"; and \"news of a generation\" Demonstrating the groundswell of enthusiasm generated by her historic candidacy, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\\\\\\'s announcement for President lit up the internet today, garnering rave reviews in the blogosphere, and thousands of supporters flocking to her web site each hour. Within just six hours of the announcement going live on her campaign web site, Senator Clinton\\\\\\'s candidacy attracted thousands of messages of support, and widespread accolades online. Overwhelming Response Within Hours of Going Live:  SIGN UPS = 100 per minute MESSAGES OF SUPPORT = 10,000 VIDEO WEBCAST SIGN-UPS = 7,700 BLOG CONTEST SUBMISSIONS = 2,200  Bloggers Give Clinton Announcement Rave Reviews: MYDD (Jerome Armstrong) - \"And as blogger savvy as John Edwards was in outreach, Clinton internet team had the emails of bloggers to notify them separate from the press (no such outreach from the Obama camp). The website has the clean, Kerry-2004 look about it. A smart \"write our first post\" call to action on the website. The announcement of \"an unprecedented series of video webcasts beginning Monday, January 22nd at 7pm EST for three nights\" creates a quick narrative of interaction and response around Bush\\\\\\'s SOTU address.\" DAILY KOS DIARY (nyceve) - \"I\\\\\\'m an open and honest person, and I\\\\\\'m profoundly moved by her announcement. What was unimaginable just a few decades ago, is now something we can almost touch.\" THE CARPETBAGGER REPORT - \"Clinton enters the race, without a doubt, at the top of the top tier. I\\\\\\'ve heard all the various concerns about her candidacy, but I don\\\\\\'t have any doubt that she has what it takes to win. Indeed, Clinton brings an enormous amount of talent, experience, and intelligence to the table.\" TAYLOR MARSH - \"Sitting in a living room setting, Senator Hillary Clinton made one simple statement that changed the landscape of the \\\\\\'08 presidential tournament to come. (To add, I got an email about this event this morning just after 6:00 a.m.) Because when the first woman to run for president, with an actual chance of winning, puts her name and reputation on the line, it becomes news of the day, week, even a generation.\" TALK LEFT - It is exciting to have a serious female candidate for President. OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY - After nearly eight years of speculation, Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for president.... she has done a remarkable job these past several years getting out of her husband\\\\\\'s shadow, positioning herself as more moderate than previously thought, and garnering bipartisan praise for collegiality and hard work in the Senate. DAILY KOS DIARY (Yellow Dog Blue) - \"How has she survived and thrived? Not by heavying up her armor. Not by engaging and overwhelming her opponents. Not even by appealing for public sympathy. Instead Hillary has just gone her business being a Senator, building personal relationships and support, getting and using power. And I really admire that.\" SEEING THE FOREST (Dave Johnson) - \"People say Hillary Clinton has \"baggage\" and is \"divisive.\" Actually she has been investigated more thoroughly than almost anyone in the country\\\\\\'s history and they found nothing at all. It isn\\\\\\'t Hillary who is divisive, it\\\\\\'s the people making all the accusations.\"\\''"

Within just six hours of the announcement going live on her campaign web site, Senator Clinton\\\\\\'s candidacy attracted thousands of messages of support, and widespread accolades online. Overwhelming Response Within Hours of Going Live:  SIGN UPS = 100 per minute MESSAGES OF SUPPORT = 10,000 VIDEO WEBCAST SIGN-UPS = 7,700 BLOG CONTEST SUBMISSIONS = 2,200  Bloggers Give Clinton Announcement Rave Reviews: MYDD (Jerome Armstrong) - \"And as blogger savvy as John Edwards was in outreach, Clinton internet team had the emails of bloggers to notify them separate from the press (no such outreach from the Obama camp). The website has the clean, Kerry-2004 look about it. A smart \"write our first post\" call to action on the website. The announcement of \"an unprecedented series of video webcasts beginning Monday, January 22nd at 7pm EST for three nights\" creates a quick narrative of interaction and response around Bush\\\\\\'s SOTU address.\" DAILY KOS DIARY (nyceve) - \"I\\\\\\'m an open and honest person, and I\\\\\\'m profoundly moved by her announcement. What was unimaginable just a few decades ago, is now something we can almost touch.\" THE CARPETBAGGER REPORT - \"Clinton enters the race, without a doubt, at the top of the top tier. I\\\\\\'ve heard all the various concerns about her candidacy, but I don\\\\\\'t have any doubt that she has what it takes to win. Indeed, Clinton brings an enormous amount of talent, experience, and intelligence to the table.\" TAYLOR MARSH - \"Sitting in a living room setting, Senator Hillary Clinton made one simple statement that changed the landscape of the \\\\\\'08 presidential tournament to come. (To add, I got an email about this event this morning just after 6:00 a.m.) Because when the first woman to run for president, with an actual chance of winning, puts her name and reputation on the line, it becomes news of the day, week, even a generation.\" TALK LEFT - It is exciting to have a serious female candidate for President. OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY - After nearly eight years of speculation, Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for president.... she has done a remarkable job these past several years getting out of her husband\\\\\\'s shadow, positioning herself as more moderate than previously thought, and garnering bipartisan praise for collegiality and hard work in the Senate. DAILY KOS DIARY (Yellow Dog Blue) - \"How has she survived and thrived? Not by heavying up her armor. Not by engaging and overwhelming her opponents. Not even by appealing for public sympathy. Instead Hillary has just gone her business being a Senator, building personal relationships and support, getting and using power. And I really admire that.\" SEEING THE FOREST (Dave Johnson) - \"People say Hillary Clinton has \"baggage\" and is \"divisive.\" Actually she has been investigated more thoroughly than almost anyone in the country\\\\\\'s history and they found nothing at all. It isn\\\\\\'t Hillary who is divisive, it\\\\\\'s the people making all the accusations.\"\\'',\n",
       "       'b\\'The new Washington Post-ABC poll out this afternoon shows Senator Clinton with a wide lead in the 2008 primary campaign. Go to the following link for more details: http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/01/postabc_poll_clinton_giuliani.html \\\\nPost-ABC Poll: Clinton, Giuliani Lead Primary FieldsOn the day that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton officially entered the 2008 presidential sweepstakes, a new Washington Post-ABC News survey shows her with a wide lead over her potential Democratic rivals. Clinton took 41 percent in a hypothetical primary field against 12 other Democrats, far ahead of Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) at 17 percent, former Sen. John Edwards (N.C) at 11 percent and former Vice President Al Gore at 10 percent. The party\\\\\\'s 2004 nominee -- Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) -- received 8 percent support. No other candidate crested three percent. Those numbers are virtually unchanged from a Post-ABC survey in December that showed CLinton at 39 percent, Obama at 17 percent and Edwards at 12 percent. \"This poll confirms Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s early frontrunner status among likely contenders for the Democratic nomination,\" said Post polling director Jon Cohen. \"It also indicates how little the intense media speculation and intrigue about Barack Obama\\\\\\'s candidacy over the past month has increased his standing among Democrats nationally.\" On the Republican side, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani held a 34 percent to 27 percent lead over Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), with no other potential candidate registering in double digits. Former Gov. Mitt Romney (Mass.) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) took nine percent each. Sen. Sam Brownback, who formally entered the race today, stood at one percent in the poll. The poll was in the field from Jan. 16-19. It tested 561 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 344 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.

       "       'b\\'Calls on Trump to Release at Least 2015Yesterday, theNew York Timespublished new documents that showed Trump engaged in \"legally dubious\" schemes to avoid paying millions in federal income taxes, even as his own lawyers made clear they likely would not hold up to IRS scrutiny. Trump\\\\\\'s campaign claims the reporting is not true, yet they refuse to produce the only evidence that could prove the Times wrong: Trump\\\\\\'s tax returns.In response to the new report, Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement:\"In the wake of a blockbuster report showing that even Trump\\\\\\'s own lawyers thought the IRS would likely find the \"legally dubious\" scheme he used to avoid taxes was against the law, the Trump campaign still refuses to release his tax returns. While breaking a precedent running for 40 years, Trump has clung to the excuse that he is under audit, despite no proof that he is and no prohibition for releasing returns under audit. Given that Trump was required to file his 2015 taxes recently, he has no reason to withhold it since it is too soon for him to possibly be under audit for those year. There\\\\\\'s no excuse left for Trumpif he\\\\\\'s not still using these \"dubious\" schemes to avoid paying taxes, he needs to prove it with his most recent tax returns.\"Trump and his campaign continue tododge disclosureof these critical documents that could shed light on important issues including his wealth, his questionable charitable giving, his foreign and domestic business entanglements, his personal tax rate and more.

Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire  loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. \"Why didn\\\\\\'t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn\\\\\\'t use them?\" Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.Thanks to this one maneuver  which was later outlawed by Congress  Mr. Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. \"Whatever loophole existed was not \\\\\\'exploited\\\\\\' here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\" said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people\\\\\\'s money  in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City.As that empire floundered in the early 1990s, Mr. Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay. While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s casinos, it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service. In the eyes of the I.R.S., a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income. This meant Mr. Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income.But Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s audacious tax-avoidance maneuver gave him a way to simply avoid reporting any of that canceled debt to the I.R.S. \"He\\\\\\'s getting something for absolutely nothing,\" John L. Buckley, who served as the chief of staff for Congress\\\\\\'s Joint Committee on Taxation in 1993 and 1994, said in an interviewThe new documents, which include correspondence from Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers and bond offering disclosure statements, might also help explain how Mr. Trump reported a staggering loss of $916 million in his 1995 tax returns  portions of which were first published by The Times last month.United States tax laws allowed Mr. Trump to use that $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income. But tax experts have been debating how Mr. Trump could have legally declared a deduction of that magnitude at all. Among other things, they have noted that Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s huge casino losses should have been offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income he surely must have reported to the I.R.S. in the form of canceled casino debt.By avoiding reporting his canceled casino debt in the first place, however, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s $916 million deduction would not have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. He could have preserved the deduction and used it instead to avoid paying income taxes he might otherwise have owed on books, TV shows or branding deals. Under the rules in effect in 1995, the $916 million loss could have been used to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income for 18 years.Mr. Trump declined to comment for this article.\"Your e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\" Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"Your thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe. Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation. There is no news here.\"Mr. Trump financed his three Atlantic City gambling resorts with $1.3 billion in debt, most of it in the form of high interest junk bonds. By late 1990, after months of escalating operating losses, New Jersey casino regulators were warning that \"a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.\" By 1992, all three casinos had filed for bankruptcy and bondholders were ultimately forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to salvage at least part of their investment.The story of how Mr. Trump sidestepped a potentially ruinous tax bill from that forgiven debt emerged from documents recently discovered by The Times during a search of the casino bankruptcy filings. The documents offer only a partial description of events, and none of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers agreed to be interviewed for this article.At the time, Mr. Trump would have been hard-pressed to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes. According to assessments of his financial stability by New Jersey casino regulators, there were times in the early 1990s when Mr. Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts. He was so strapped for cash that his creditors were apoplectic when they learned that Mr. Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250,000.It is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr. Trump to dodge a huge tax bill. But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt.The strategy  known among tax practitioners as a \"stock-for-debt swap\"  relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.Best of all, it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt. (Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque, rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations, this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear.Alarmed by the obvious potential for abuse, Congress and the I.R.S. made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993. But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy, the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban, this time through the use of partnerships.This was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr. Trump. Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations. Mr. Trump, for example, owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships, an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good.But what if times were bad? What if Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldn\\\\\\'t that force the partnerships  i.e., Mr. Trump  to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?Enter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping \"partnership equity\" for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt.True enough, the I.R.S. and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept. Fred T. Goldberg, who was the I.R.S. commissioner under George Bush, recalled in an interview that the I.R.S. frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps. \"The fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt,\" he said. Lee A. Sheppard, a contributing editor to Tax Notes, wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving \"the existence of the Loch Ness monster.\"On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code. This background, he argues with evident disgust, gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system  just as, he claims, they rig elections.That insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear.Before proceeding with his plan, Mr. Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do  he sought a formal tax opinion letter. Such letters, typically written by highly-paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10,000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code, can provide important protection to taxpayers. As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter, the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S. ultimately rules the strategy was improper.The language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals. So, for example, when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is \"more likely than not\" going to be approved by the I.R.S., this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny. (This is known as an \"M.L.T.N.\" letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A \"should\" letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S. will not object. The gold standard, a \"will\" letter, means the I.R.S. is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy.But the opinion letters Mr. Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard. The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax gambit. \"Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,\" his lawyers wrote, \"substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.\"One letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s proposed tax maneuver. It found only \"substantial authority\" for six of the components. In the stilted language of tax opinion letters, the phrase \"substantial authority\" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S. can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time. In other words, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S. would likely cry foul if he were audited. In anticipation of that possibility, the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr. Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S. ultimately balked.It is unclear whether the I.R.S. ever challenged Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s use of this specific tax maneuver. According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s accountants, he was under audit by tax authorities as of 1993, only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic. But the results of that audit are unknown and the agency declined to comment on Monday.Regardless of whether the I.R.S. objected, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law, said Mr. Buckley, the former chief of staff for Congress\\\\\\'s Joint Committee on Taxation who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\"He deducted somebody else\\\\\\'s losses,\" Mr. Buckley said. By that Mr. Buckley means that only the bondholders who forgave Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes. That Mr. Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else, Mr. Buckley explained. \"He is double dipping big time.\"In any event, Mr. Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver. Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations, it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships.Among the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York.\\'',\n",

Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that, if elected, he would have created a federally qualifying blind trust.A President Trump \"would not be involved in the business,\" said Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten. \"His focus obviously would be on the office of the presidency, and Don, Ivanka and Eric would run the company.\" Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s campaign referred questions to Mr. Garten.

How can you insulate it?\"This would also likely come up as an issue for Mr. Trump if he stays involved in politics, Mr. Friedberg said. \"It seems to me that a number of questions have been raised that have not been answered,\" he said. \"It\\\\\\'s not going to go away.\"Mr. Friedberg is among former Republican national-security officials who signed a letter stating they wouldn\\\\\\'t vote for Mr. Trump because they didn\\\\\\'t believe he was qualified from a foreign-policy perspective. Mr. Trump called the signatories \"the failed Washington elite\" and released a list of military leaders who support him.The letter Mr. Friedberg signed didn\\\\\\'t mention Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s foreign business ties, but he and several other signatories said those ties contributed to their reservations. The Trump children would be doing business with companies that might assume they have unique access to the president, Mr. Friedberg said, and with companies whose interests might differ from the national interests their father would be representing.Those potential conflicts are similar to those that have arisen from the Clinton Foundation\\\\\\'s foreign donors, said Eric Edelman, who directed Defense Department policy under President George W. Bush and signed the letter opposing Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump and others have called those Clinton Foundation donations a \"pay-for-play\" arrangement, suggesting foreign contributors to the Clinton family charity may have expected to gain access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.\"They are slightly different cases,\" said Mr. Edelman, \"but both raise very serious concerns about influence peddling and conflicts of interest.\"The Clinton Foundation, whose donations go into charity work, said it has stopped accepting most foreign donations and would stop taking all such donations if Mrs. Clinton became president. It said her daughter Chelsea Clinton would remain involved with the foundation.Trump Organization\\\\\\'s Mr. Garten acknowledged that the extent of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s international business connections is unique for a presidential nominee. \"I respect that this is different,\" he said. \"It is a new situation. I don\\\\\\'t believe it presents a conflict.\"Mr. Garten and the Trump campaign didn\\\\\\'t respond to subsequent inquiries as to Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s plans beyond the presidential race.Among potential conflicts is the Trump company\\\\\\'s relationship with Turkey\\\\\\'s Dogan Holding, said Mr. Edelman, the former Bush-administration official and onetime ambassador to Turkey. Dogan operates oil companies, a real-estate empire and media properties in Turkey.Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s May 2016 federal disclosure reports income to one of his companies in the range of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from Dogan related to Istanbul towers bearing Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s namea deal involving Ivanka Trump early on, according to a 2012 Trump press release. She and her father visited the tower a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the official opening of its associated mall.The night of the failed coup, Dogan\\\\\\'s flagship television network became the venue through which Mr. Erdogan appealed to citizens to oppose the putsch. That was a turnabout for Dogan, whose chairman and other executives this year were charged in Turkey with criminal tax evasion, widely seen as retaliation for a perceived antigovernment slant by Dogan media outlets. A person close to the Dogan family said there has been no wrongdoing.Since the failed coup, Dogan\\\\\\'s media group has taken on a more pro-government line, including broadcasts supporting Mr. Erdogan\\\\\\'s claim that Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was responsible for the putsch.Turkey has asked the U.S. to extradite Mr. Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and has denied the allegation. The U.S. Justice Department has said it is reviewing that request; privately, many senior U.S. officials have said they are skeptical of Turkey\\\\\\'s claims against Mr. Gulen.The next American president will likely inherit that thorny bilateral dispute.Mr. Garten said the Dogan relationship wouldn\\\\\\'t be a problem because the Trump Organization would be separate from Mr. Trump. The person close to Dogan said the company would prefer to remove the Trump name from its buildings based on the candidate\\\\\\'s \"anti-Muslim rhetoric.\"When Donald Trump Jr. sought a few years ago to expand his father\\\\\\'s real-estate empire in Latin America, he turned to businessman Camilo Benedetti, brother of a Colombian senator.Mr. Benedetti took the younger Mr. Trump around Mexico in 2010 and Colombia in 2011, where Mr. Benedetti had relationships with top government officials, Mr. Benedetti said. One meeting was with Colombia\\\\\\'s leader at the presidential palace, Casa de Nario. \"I asked him as a favor,\" Mr. Benedetti said of the president. The meeting didn\\\\\\'t result in any active business developments, said Mr. Benedetti and Mr. Garten.\"There\\\\\\'s no question that whenever the Trump Organization looks into a project or enters a new market, there is often excitement both from the business sector and maybe even, in some countries, the government,\" Mr. Garten said of the meeting and others like it that the Trump children have had with foreign leaders.One of the newest Trump partners, Indonesian media magnate Hary Tanoesoedibjo, had business ties with family members of Suharto, the country\\\\\\'s late dictator. He ran unsuccessfully for vice president in the most-recent national election and formed a political party critical of the current government.Last year, Trump Organization announced a deal to manage a Bali resort owned by Mr. Tanoesoedibjo\\\\\\'s company, PT Global Mediacom Tbk, and to develop a golf resort in West Java with him. Mr. Trump reported a range of $2 million to $10 million income to his companies from the projects since the beginning of 2015 in his May 2016 federal disclosures. Donald Trump Jr. was involved in the deals, according to news releases announcing them. Mr. Garten declined to comment on the Indonesian project. Mr. Tanoesoedibjo\\\\\\'s assistant didn\\\\\\'t respond to requests for comment.In Mumbai, India, the Trump Organization has a brand-licensing deal for a condo tower with Lodha Group, whose founder, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, is among India\\\\\\'s wealthiest property owners and a member of his state\\\\\\'s legislature from India\\\\\\'s ruling party.Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s May 2016 federal disclosure shows income to a Trump Organization company of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from the licensing deal. A Lodha spokeswoman said both companies \"work with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\" Mr. Garten said that Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. worked on the project and that he isn\\\\\\'t concerned that Mr. Lodha is a politician.\"There\\\\\\'s a great relationship between Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s children and the principals of that project,\" he said. \"I don\\\\\\'t see the potential issue.\"In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s July 2015 federal disclosure reports that a company owned by Mr. Trump had received $2.5 million in income since the beginning of 2014 in a deal that includes management services for a hotel and condo tower being developed by Anar Mammadov, whose father is the country\\\\\\'s transportation minister. Ivanka Trump\\\\\\'s website says she oversaw the project \"since its inception.\" Mr. Garten said the project is on hold.The Azerbaijan America Alliance, in a press release, listed Mr. Mammadov as its founder. The group spent $12.6 million between 2011 and 2015 on federal lobbyists to promote Azerbaijan interests in Washington, according to federal filings compiled by Center For Responsive Politics. Calls to the number given on Mr. Mammadov\\\\\\'s company website weren\\\\\\'t answered. Calls to the Azerbaijan America Alliance\\\\\\'s number were answered by a lobbying firm that said it didn\\\\\\'t represent the alliance anymore.\"It\\\\\\'s not unusual for people around the world successful in a business to play some role in government,\" Mr. Garten said of Trump Organization\\\\\\'s dealings with politically connected foreign businesses. \"That doesn\\\\\\'t mean there\\\\\\'s anything wrong or inappropriate.\"\\''], \n",

Go to the following link for more details: http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/01/postabc_poll_clinton_giuliani.html \\\\nPost-ABC Poll: Clinton, Giuliani Lead Primary FieldsOn the day that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton officially entered the 2008 presidential sweepstakes, a new Washington Post-ABC News survey shows her with a wide lead over her potential Democratic rivals. Clinton took 41 percent in a hypothetical primary field against 12 other Democrats, far ahead of Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) at 17 percent, former Sen. John Edwards (N.C) at 11 percent and former Vice President Al Gore at 10 percent. The party\\\\\\'s 2004 nominee -- Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) -- received 8 percent support. No other candidate crested three percent. Those numbers are virtually unchanged from a Post-ABC survey in December that showed CLinton at 39 percent, Obama at 17 percent and Edwards at 12 percent. \"This poll confirms Hillary Clinton\\\\\\'s early frontrunner status among likely contenders for the Democratic nomination,\" said Post polling director Jon Cohen. \"It also indicates how little the intense media speculation and intrigue about Barack Obama\\\\\\'s candidacy over the past month has increased his standing among Democrats nationally.\" On the Republican side, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani held a 34 percent to 27 percent lead over Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), with no other potential candidate registering in double digits. Former Gov. Mitt Romney (Mass.) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) took nine percent each. Sen. Sam Brownback, who formally entered the race today, stood at one percent in the poll. The poll was in the field from Jan. 16-19. It tested 561 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 344 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. The Democratic numbers have a four percent margin of error; the Republican side has a 5 percent margin of error. The topline information on the two 2008 primary questions is on the next page. 24.

Trump\\\\\\'s campaign claims the reporting is not true, yet they refuse to produce the only evidence that could prove the Times wrong: Trump\\\\\\'s tax returns.In response to the new report, Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement:\"In the wake of a blockbuster report showing that even Trump\\\\\\'s own lawyers thought the IRS would likely find the \"legally dubious\" scheme he used to avoid taxes was against the law, the Trump campaign still refuses to release his tax returns. While breaking a precedent running for 40 years, Trump has clung to the excuse that he is under audit, despite no proof that he is and no prohibition for releasing returns under audit. Given that Trump was required to file his 2015 taxes recently, he has no reason to withhold it since it is too soon for him to possibly be under audit for those year.

Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire  loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. \"Why didn\\\\\\'t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn\\\\\\'t use them?\" Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.Thanks to this one maneuver  which was later outlawed by Congress  Mr. Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. \"Whatever loophole existed was not \\\\\\'exploited\\\\\\' here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\" said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people\\\\\\'s money  in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City.As that empire floundered in the early 1990s, Mr. Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay. While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s casinos, it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service. In the eyes of the I.R.S., a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income. This meant Mr. Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income.But Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s audacious tax-avoidance maneuver gave him a way to simply avoid reporting any of that canceled debt to the I.R.S. \"He\\\\\\'s getting something for absolutely nothing,\" John L. Buckley, who served as the chief of staff for Congress\\\\\\'s Joint Committee on Taxation in 1993 and 1994, said in an interviewThe new documents, which include correspondence from Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers and bond offering disclosure statements, might also help explain how Mr. Trump reported a staggering loss of $916 million in his 1995 tax returns  portions of which were first published by The Times last month.United States tax laws allowed Mr. Trump to use that $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income. But tax experts have been debating how Mr. Trump could have legally declared a deduction of that magnitude at all. Among other things, they have noted that Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s huge casino losses should have been offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income he surely must have reported to the I.R.S. in the form of canceled casino debt.By avoiding reporting his canceled casino debt in the first place, however, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s $916 million deduction would not have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. He could have preserved the deduction and used it instead to avoid paying income taxes he might otherwise have owed on books, TV shows or branding deals. Under the rules in effect in 1995, the $916 million loss could have been used to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income for 18 years.Mr. Trump declined to comment for this article.\"Your e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\" Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"Your thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe. Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation. There is no news here.\"Mr. Trump financed his three Atlantic City gambling resorts with $1.3 billion in debt, most of it in the form of high interest junk bonds. By late 1990, after months of escalating operating losses, New Jersey casino regulators were warning that \"a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.\" By 1992, all three casinos had filed for bankruptcy and bondholders were ultimately forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to salvage at least part of their investment.The story of how Mr. Trump sidestepped a potentially ruinous tax bill from that forgiven debt emerged from documents recently discovered by The Times during a search of the casino bankruptcy filings. The documents offer only a partial description of events, and none of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers agreed to be interviewed for this article.At the time, Mr. Trump would have been hard-pressed to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes. According to assessments of his financial stability by New Jersey casino regulators, there were times in the early 1990s when Mr. Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts. He was so strapped for cash that his creditors were apoplectic when they learned that Mr. Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250,000.It is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr. Trump to dodge a huge tax bill. But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt.The strategy  known among tax practitioners as a \"stock-for-debt swap\"  relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.Best of all, it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt. (Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque, rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations, this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear.Alarmed by the obvious potential for abuse, Congress and the I.R.S. made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993. But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy, the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban, this time through the use of partnerships.This was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr. Trump. Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations. Mr. Trump, for example, owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships, an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good.But what if times were bad? What if Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldn\\\\\\'t that force the partnerships  i.e., Mr. Trump  to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?Enter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping \"partnership equity\" for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt.True enough, the I.R.S. and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept. Fred T. Goldberg, who was the I.R.S. commissioner under George Bush, recalled in an interview that the I.R.S. frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps. \"The fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt,\" he said. Lee A. Sheppard, a contributing editor to Tax Notes, wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving \"the existence of the Loch Ness monster.\"On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code. This background, he argues with evident disgust, gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system  just as, he claims, they rig elections.That insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear.Before proceeding with his plan, Mr. Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do  he sought a formal tax opinion letter. Such letters, typically written by highly-paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10,000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code, can provide important protection to taxpayers. As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter, the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S. ultimately rules the strategy was improper.The language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals. So, for example, when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is \"more likely than not\" going to be approved by the I.R.S., this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny. (This is known as an \"M.L.T.N.\" letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A \"should\" letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S. will not object. The gold standard, a \"will\" letter, means the I.R.S. is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy.But the opinion letters Mr. Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard. The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax gambit. \"Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,\" his lawyers wrote, \"substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.\"One letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s proposed tax maneuver. It found only \"substantial authority\" for six of the components. In the stilted language of tax opinion letters, the phrase \"substantial authority\" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S. can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time. In other words, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S. would likely cry foul if he were audited. In anticipation of that possibility, the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr. Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S. ultimately balked.It is unclear whether the I.R.S. ever challenged Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s use of this specific tax maneuver. According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s accountants, he was under audit by tax authorities as of 1993, only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic. But the results of that audit are unknown and the agency declined to comment on Monday.Regardless of whether the I.R.S. objected, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law, said Mr. Buckley, the former chief of staff for Congress\\\\\\'s Joint Committee on Taxation who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\"He deducted somebody else\\\\\\'s losses,\" Mr. Buckley said. By that Mr. Buckley means that only the bondholders who forgave Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes. That Mr. Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else, Mr. Buckley explained. \"He is double dipping big time.\"In any event, Mr. Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver. Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations, it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships.Among the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York.\\'',\n",
       "       'b\\'In response to new reporting from theWall Street Journalon Donald Trump\\\\\\'s dangerous and unprecedented foreign business entanglements, Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement:\"Donald Trump has business all around the world, and while he has failed to disclose full details of his business record, what we know is truly disturbing. The idea of a President Trump trying to negotiate with foreign leaders while having his business at stake is simply unacceptable and raises real questions about how he would handle matters of national security. This is just one more reason why he cannot be president.\"IN CASE YOU MISSED ITKEY POINT:\"Those whom Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have worked with abroad include: the family of a developer in India who is a ruling-party politician, an Azerbaijani government minister\\\\\\'s son and a media company that became the Turkish president\\\\\\'s outlet of choice during the July 15 coup attempt.No recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr. Trump\\\\\\'sor as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring, who have also played a role in his campaign.\"Trump\\\\\\'s Foreign Business Entanglements Would Create Unparalleled ConflictsWall Street JournalBy Alexandra BerzonNovember 1, 2016His adult children, who would run operations if their father becomes president, have long dealt with politically connected firms and individuals, an overlap of business and politics unseen in the modern White HouseDonald Trump\\\\\\'s adult children have spent a decade doing business with politically connected foreign firmsa role that will present potential conflicts of interest whether he wins on Nov. 8 or continues to pursue politics if he loses.Those whom Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have worked with abroad include: the family of a developer in India who is a ruling-party politician, an Azerbaijani government minister\\\\\\'s son and a media company that became the Turkish president\\\\\\'s outlet of choice during the July 15 coup attempt.No recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr. Trump\\\\\\'sor as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring, who have also played a role in his campaign.U.S. law exempts the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest rules that require many federal employees to recuse themselves from decisions involving their financial interests. Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan voluntarily put most assets in blind trusts. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that, if elected, he would have created a federally qualifying blind trust.A President Trump \"would not be involved in the business,\" said Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten. \"His focus obviously would be on the office of the presidency, and Don, Ivanka and Eric would run the company.\" Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s campaign referred questions to Mr. Garten. The three Trump children didn\\\\\\'t respond to requests for comment sent through the campaign and the company.Trump Organization is the umbrella company operating the family\\\\\\'s businesses, including real-estate assets and units that manage hotels and condo towers around the world. Much of that is domestic, but its new business in recent years has been heavily overseasthe last 10 new real-estate or real-estate branding deals it has announced are all abroad.That business largely consists of licensing deals, and in some cases management deals, with foreign developers building condo and hotel towers. Clients include wealthy business people and politicians who buy Trump-branded condos. Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s adult children have in recent years taken over day-to-day management of much of the business.The filial arrangement would raise questions about potential conflicts of interest in a Trump presidency, especially in dealings abroad, said Aaron Friedberg, a national-security adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president.\"The fact is that his family is involved in business with a list of playersI don\\\\\\'t assume we know them allin all kinds of places, in many of which the distinction between politics and business is blurry,\" said Mr. Friedberg. \"Anybody you\\\\\\'re dealing with in those places that has a lot of money is involved in politics in some way. How can you insulate it?\"This would also likely come up as an issue for Mr. Trump if he stays involved in politics, Mr. Friedberg said. \"It seems to me that a number of questions have been raised that have not been answered,\" he said. \"It\\\\\\'s not going to go away.\"Mr. Friedberg is among former Republican national-security officials who signed a letter stating they wouldn\\\\\\'t vote for Mr. Trump because they didn\\\\\\'t believe he was qualified from a foreign-policy perspective. Mr. Trump called the signatories \"the failed Washington elite\" and released a list of military leaders who support him.The letter Mr. Friedberg signed didn\\\\\\'t mention Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s foreign business ties, but he and several other signatories said those ties contributed to their reservations. The Trump children would be doing business with companies that might assume they have unique access to the president, Mr. Friedberg said, and with companies whose interests might differ from the national interests their father would be representing.Those potential conflicts are similar to those that have arisen from the Clinton Foundation\\\\\\'s foreign donors, said Eric Edelman, who directed Defense Department policy under President George W. Bush and signed the letter opposing Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump and others have called those Clinton Foundation donations a \"pay-for-play\" arrangement, suggesting foreign contributors to the Clinton family charity may have expected to gain access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.\"They are slightly different cases,\" said Mr. Edelman, \"but both raise very serious concerns about influence peddling and conflicts of interest.\"The Clinton Foundation, whose donations go into charity work, said it has stopped accepting most foreign donations and would stop taking all such donations if Mrs. Clinton became president. It said her daughter Chelsea Clinton would remain involved with the foundation.Trump Organization\\\\\\'s Mr. Garten acknowledged that the extent of Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s international business connections is unique for a presidential nominee. \"I respect that this is different,\" he said. \"It is a new situation. I don\\\\\\'t believe it presents a conflict.\"Mr. Garten and the Trump campaign didn\\\\\\'t respond to subsequent inquiries as to Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s plans beyond the presidential race.Among potential conflicts is the Trump company\\\\\\'s relationship with Turkey\\\\\\'s Dogan Holding, said Mr. Edelman, the former Bush-administration official and onetime ambassador to Turkey. Dogan operates oil companies, a real-estate empire and media properties in Turkey.Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s May 2016 federal disclosure reports income to one of his companies in the range of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from Dogan related to Istanbul towers bearing Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s namea deal involving Ivanka Trump early on, according to a 2012 Trump press release. She and her father visited the tower a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the official opening of its associated mall.The night of the failed coup, Dogan\\\\\\'s flagship television network became the venue through which Mr. Erdogan appealed to citizens to oppose the putsch. That was a turnabout for Dogan, whose chairman and other executives this year were charged in Turkey with criminal tax evasion, widely seen as retaliation for a perceived antigovernment slant by Dogan media outlets. A person close to the Dogan family said there has been no wrongdoing.Since the failed coup, Dogan\\\\\\'s media group has taken on a more pro-government line, including broadcasts supporting Mr. Erdogan\\\\\\'s claim that Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was responsible for the putsch.Turkey has asked the U.S. to extradite Mr. Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and has denied the allegation. The U.S. Justice Department has said it is reviewing that request; privately, many senior U.S. officials have said they are skeptical of Turkey\\\\\\'s claims against Mr. Gulen.The next American president will likely inherit that thorny bilateral dispute.Mr. Garten said the Dogan relationship wouldn\\\\\\'t be a problem because the Trump Organization would be separate from Mr. Trump. The person close to Dogan said the company would prefer to remove the Trump name from its buildings based on the candidate\\\\\\'s \"anti-Muslim rhetoric.\"When Donald Trump Jr. sought a few years ago to expand his father\\\\\\'s real-estate empire in Latin America, he turned to businessman Camilo Benedetti, brother of a Colombian senator.Mr. Benedetti took the younger Mr. Trump around Mexico in 2010 and Colombia in 2011, where Mr. Benedetti had relationships with top government officials, Mr. Benedetti said. One meeting was with Colombia\\\\\\'s leader at the presidential palace, Casa de Nario. \"I asked him as a favor,\" Mr. Benedetti said of the president. The meeting didn\\\\\\'t result in any active business developments, said Mr. Benedetti and Mr. Garten.\"There\\\\\\'s no question that whenever the Trump Organization looks into a project or enters a new market, there is often excitement both from the business sector and maybe even, in some countries, the government,\" Mr. Garten said of the meeting and others like it that the Trump children have had with foreign leaders.One of the newest Trump partners, Indonesian media magnate Hary Tanoesoedibjo, had business ties with family members of Suharto, the country\\\\\\'s late dictator. He ran unsuccessfully for vice president in the most-recent national election and formed a political party critical of the current government.Last year, Trump Organization announced a deal to manage a Bali resort owned by Mr. Tanoesoedibjo\\\\\\'s company, PT Global Mediacom Tbk, and to develop a golf resort in West Java with him. Mr. Trump reported a range of $2 million to $10 million income to his companies from the projects since the beginning of 2015 in his May 2016 federal disclosures. Donald Trump Jr. was involved in the deals, according to news releases announcing them. Mr. Garten declined to comment on the Indonesian project. Mr. Tanoesoedibjo\\\\\\'s assistant didn\\\\\\'t respond to requests for comment.In Mumbai, India, the Trump Organization has a brand-licensing deal for a condo tower with Lodha Group, whose founder, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, is among India\\\\\\'s wealthiest property owners and a member of his state\\\\\\'s legislature from India\\\\\\'s ruling party.Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s May 2016 federal disclosure shows income to a Trump Organization company of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from the licensing deal. A Lodha spokeswoman said both companies \"work with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\" Mr. Garten said that Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. worked on the project and that he isn\\\\\\'t concerned that Mr. Lodha is a politician.\"There\\\\\\'s a great relationship between Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s children and the principals of that project,\" he said. \"I don\\\\\\'t see the potential issue.\"In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump\\\\\\'s July 2015 federal disclosure reports that a company owned by Mr. Trump had received $2.5 million in income since the beginning of 2014 in a deal that includes management services for a hotel and condo tower being developed by Anar Mammadov, whose father is the country\\\\\\'s transportation minister. Ivanka Trump\\\\\\'s website says she oversaw the project \"since its inception.\" Mr. Garten said the project is on hold.The Azerbaijan America Alliance, in a press release, listed Mr. Mammadov as its founder. The group spent $12.6 million between 2011 and 2015 on federal lobbyists to promote Azerbaijan interests in Washington, according to federal filings compiled by Center For Responsive Politics. Calls to the number given on Mr. Mammadov\\\\\\'s company website weren\\\\\\'t answered. Calls to the Azerbaijan America Alliance\\\\\\'s number were answered by a lobbying firm that said it didn\\\\\\'t represent the alliance anymore.\"It\\\\\\'s not unusual for people around the world successful in a business to play some role in government,\" Mr. Garten said of Trump Organization\\\\\\'s dealings with politically connected foreign businesses. \"That doesn\\\\\\'t mean there\\\\\\'s anything wrong or inappropriate.\"\\''], \n",
