    "This module explores how data science can persuade or mislead through intentional or unintentional decisions at every step of the data science process. First, we'll how human judgment still plays a part in seemingly unbiased, 'automated' programming processes by picking apart how Module 2's Wordnet dictionary was compiled. Then, we'll discover how some common cognitive biases are exploited in charts and graphs to emphasize a particular mesage.\n",
