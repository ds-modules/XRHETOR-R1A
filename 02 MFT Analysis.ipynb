    "Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) hypothesizes that people's sensitivity to the foundations is different based on their political ideology: liberals are more sensitive to care and fairness, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five. Here, we'll explore whether we can find evidence for MFT in the campaign speeches of 2016 United States presidential candidates. For our main analysis, we'll go through the data science process we learned in Day 1 to recreate a simplified version of the analysis done by Jesse Graham, Jonathan Haidt, and Brian A. Nosek in their 2009 paper [\"Liberals and Conservatives Rely on Different Sets of Moral Foundations\"](http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/GHN2009.pdf). In part 3, we'll look at other NLP techniques that might be useful in applying this theory.\n",

In the expansive phase Jesse Graham and five research assistants generated as many associations, synonyms, and antonyms for the base foundation words as possible, using thesauruses and conver- sations with colleagues. This included full words and word stems (for instance, nation  covers national, nationalistic, etc.). The resulting lists included foundation-supporting words (e.g., kind- ness, equality, patriot, obey, wholesome), as well as foundation- violating words (e.g., hurt, prejudice, betray, disrespect, disgust- ing). In the contractive phase, Jesse Graham and Jonathan Haidt deleted words that seemed too distantly related to the five foun- dations and also words whose primary meanings were not moral (e.g., just more often means only than fair).\n",
