Ben Carson,R,s,"July 14, 2015",Statement by Ben Carson: Iran Nuke Deal is Recipe for Disaster,"The Iran deal announced today with fanfare and another heaping dose of false hope is almost certain to prove an historic mistake with potentially deadly consequences.A careful review of the 100-plus pages is in order to fully understand the lengths to which the negotiators were willing to stoop to secure a deal at any cost with the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and a regime dedicated in word and deed to bringing Death to America. Without anywhere anytime surprise inspections, a full accounting of Iran's past secret nuclear arms pursuits, elimination of Iran's uranium stockpiles and the lifting of any sanctions only upon verification of Iranian compliance this is not a good deal, but a recipe for disaster and the first fateful step toward a frenzied nuclear arms race in the Middle East."
Ben Carson,R,s,"November 28, 2015",Statement by Ben Carson on His Trip to Visit Syrian Refugees,"Amman, Jordan  Just over two months ago I began planning a trip over the Thanksgiving Weekend to visit with Syrian Refugees, Jordanian Government Officials, and NGO's. I wanted to come to see with my own eyes this great human tragedy.Today I listened to the life struggles of many Syrians who were forced to flee their own homes. I met with medical professionals, humanitarian workers, and government officials. I saw pain on the faces of mothers and children.They came to Jordan for safety. Jordan is doing an amazing job opening its doors and extending a hand in relief. The rest of the world could be doing so much more.These brave people want nothing more than an end to the war in Syria. They want to go back to their lives. We must find a political end to this conflict.Millions of refugees have now been waiting years for the end of the war to come in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Some are giving up hope that they will ever be able to return to the country. We must keep their hope alive. Until it is safe for them to return home, Jordan is a safe place for them to wait. The kingdom has welcomed them with open arms. But Jordan is a small country. They need the world's help to feed, educate, and care for these refugees until the war ends.The United States must do more. We can do our part to help this crisis without bringing 10-25,000 refugees to the United States. Jordan already houses 1.4 million refugees. Jordan needs and deserves our logistical help and financial support.In the coming days I will offer what I believe are real solutions to the problems created in part by the Obama-Clinton Administration's failed policies.

Ben Carson,R,s,"December 11, 2015",Statement by Ben Carson on Party Boss Insider Meeting Reported in Washington Post,"If the leaders of the Republican Party want to destroy the party, they should continue to hold meetings like the one described in the Washington Post this morning. If this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite, I assure you Donald Trump will not be the only one leaving the party.I pray that the report in the Post this morning was incorrect. If it is correct, every voter who is standing for change must know they are being betrayed. I won't stand for it.This process is the one played out by our party. If the powerful try to manipulate it, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next summer may be the last convention. I am prepared to lose fair and square, as I am sure is Donald. But I will not sit by and watch a theft. I intend on being the nominee. If I am not, the winner will have my support. If the winner isn't our nominee then we have a massive problem. My campaign is about 'We the People' not 'They the Powerful.'"
Ben Carson,R,s,"January 16, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson Expressing Relief Over the Release of Five American Prisoners from Iran; Denounces Iran Nuclear Agreement,"I am very pleased that five American citizens, who were illegally imprisoned by Iran in flagrant violation of longstanding international human rights norms, have finally been released. I am overjoyed for the families and friends of Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmat, Saeed Abedni and two additional, unidentified Americans.However, the fact remains that President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world. Furthermore, the disastrous agreement will release more than $100 billion to Iran and allow it to continue exporting terrorism around the world and threaten the United States and its allies. If I am elected President, I will withdraw from this dangerous agreement on Day One."
Ben Carson,R,s,"January 19, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on the Passing of Campaign Volunteer Braden Joplin,"One of the precious few joys of campaigning is the privilege of meeting bright young men and women who are so enthusiastic about their country that they will freely give of their time and energy to work on its behalf. America lost one of those bright young men today. I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing. While we mourn this profound loss, I am thankful that our other campaign colleagues, Drew McCall, Aaron Ohnemus and Ryan Patrick Shellooe, have all been treated and released from the hospital.A presidential candidate asks a lot of his or her volunteers, working long hours in the cold, under-appreciated. They are the unsung heroes of the political process. The outpouring of support for Braden and his family from fellow candidates, as well as their staffs and volunteers, demonstrates that life will always transcend politics, and I thank them for their kind words. Please continue to keep Braden's family and friends in your prayers as they struggle through this difficult time.Even after more than 30 years experience counseling parents and family members in the most difficult of times, it never gets easier. But I find solace in the knowledge of God's redeeming grace, and I pray that Braden's family finds comfort in the mercy of the Lord. Across America today, I ask everyone to take a moment to reflect on the preciousness of life and remember and honor the memory of Braden Joplin."
Ben Carson,R,s,"February 1, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on Iowa Caucus Results; Candidate Condemns Opponent's Dirty Tricks,"I am grateful for the confidence Iowans have placed in me, as tonight we defeated three former sitting governors and two previous Iowa Caucus winners. Regardless of how the media has attempted to marginalize me and my campaign, I still have the highest favorability rating and have remained among the leading candidates in every major survey.For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it. Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign - in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes.One of the reasons I got into this race was to stop these deceptive and destructive practices, and these reports have only further steeled my resolve to continue and fight for 'We The People,' and return control of the government back to them.I want to thank Ryan Rhodes, Iowa State Director, who has led an incredible team of staff and volunteers. His leadership and their commitment to building a strong ground game will provide the momentum needed to move forward to the next state contests, in New Hampshire, South Carolina - and beyond."
Ben Carson,R,s,"February 13, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on the Death of Justice Antonin Scalia,"I am saddened to hear the news about Justice Antonin Scalia. We have lost a great man and a great Supreme Court Justice. For the past three decades, his towering intellect and trenchant wit has characterized the deliberations and decisions of the high court. He made Americans proud, not only because he gave to the court the power and persuasion of his brilliant legal mind, but because he defended the Constitution with an unshakeable commitment to the text and to the intent of the Founders. In an age where it is popular to subscribe to a ""living Constitution"" and during a time when political and judicial leaders prefer legal decisions that are politically convenient, Justice Scalia always dutifully carried out his responsibilities to interpret the law, not to make new ones. Time and again, he ruled based on where the black letter of the law led him, not according to the politics of the moment. For that reason, he has angered Americans on both the left and the right, but he has never wavered in his dedication to the Constitution.It is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish Justice Scalia's legacy by trying to nominate an individual who would carry on the President's wishes to subvert the will of the people. Given the dire condition our democracy currently finds itself under Obama's lack of leadership, I call on the Senate to stop any attempts to fill this crucial seat until We The People elect a strong Constitutionalist this November.We will miss him sorely. We pray for his family and friends, and we pray for America, which today lost a patriot and a faithful servant."
Ben Carson,R,s,"February 18, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on the Deployment of Air Defense Missiles on Disputed Woody Island,"China has deployed sophisticated air defense missiles on a contested island near the coast of Vietnam in the South China Sea. The missiles could threaten aircraft flying over the strategically significant body of water, through which more than $5 billion in commerce passes annually. China's action is the latest in a series of provocations from Beijing, which has created worrisome, potential impediments to the world's access to vital shipping lanes and air corridors, and has threatened the interests of America's allies, partners and friends in Asia.Unfortunately, the Obama administration has stood by as China has undertaken large-scale construction and purposeful militarization of hotly disputed maritime territory throughout the South China Sea. The President has registered feeble protests against Chinese provocations, while failing to reassure anyone that America would safeguard peace and security in Asia.President Obama's failures of leadership threaten to undermine the U.S.-led order in Asia and emboldens China to assert its dubious territorial claims in even more aggressive and potentially threatening ways. Even some of the Obama administration's recent operations to uphold the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea have been undermined by apologies for other lawful U.S. military actions in the region.As President, I will replace such weakness with firm resolve and global leadership, including ordering our Navy and Air Force to routinely conduct robust freedom of navigation operations throughout the region. Unlike President Obama, I will not apologize for conducting America's military operations according to international law; and freedom of navigation will be asserted by the full might of the United States Navy and Air Force. To counter China's rising influence, I will maintain a strong U.S. military presence in the region, and will strengthen America's military cooperation with friendly Asian countries, while promoting their cooperation with each other.Under a Carson administration, friends and foes alike will know that the United States will ensure access to the global commons and defend its interests and its allies around the world."
Ben Carson,R,s,"March 2, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on Future Campaign Activities,"I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit. Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America. I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening's Super Tuesday primary results. However, this grassroots movement on behalf of ""We the People"" will continue. Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to Saving America for Future Generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation.I appreciate the support, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America. Gratefully, my campaign decisions are not constrained by finances; rather by what is in the best interests of the American people.I will discuss more about the future of this movement during my speech on Friday at CPAC in Washington, D.C."
Ben Carson,R,s,"March 4, 2016",Statement by Ben Carson on Leaving the Campaign Trail,"I have lived a blessed life and achieved more success than I ever dreamed was possible. Running for President was never on my bucket list, and when I was drafted by a grassroots movement asking me to do so, it was not a decision that I made lightly and saw as an act of service.However, I believed that my values, life experience and common sense solutions put me in a position to help get our nation back on track for the sake of our children and grandchildren. This grueling endeavor would not have been worth it for any other reason.When I began exploring a run for President as a private citizen detached from the political class, I had neither a political team nor a national network of wealthy donors standing by waiting to support me.We had to build a grassroots campaign from scratch by reaching out to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible and through every means possible, resulting in indisputable success. This movement consistently outraised the entire Republican field, got onto every ballot and built a 50-state, bricks-and-mortar campaign infrastructure to share my story, values and solutions. It was an historic feat, and I'll be forever grateful to my team and my incredible supporters, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America, on behalf of the best interests of the American people.I hope my presence added a measure of civility to the race, raised issues that would not otherwise have been discussed and had an overall positive impact. While our political efforts must come to a close, gratefully, the grassroots movement that has given new voice to ""We the People"" and inspired millions will continue.I may be departing the campaign trail, but I will not be departing the scene. Instead, for the rest of my life, I will continue to work tirelessly to do everything I can to save America for the next generation.I will be working on a number of initiatives, including serving as honorary chair of My Faith Votes, a non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing the 25 million Evangelicals who didn't vote in the last election. The twin pillars of faith and family are under attack, and I will endeavor to strengthen our nation by preserving them both.I have committed to not endorse a specific individual, but rather ""We the People."" Though many today are making decisions based on fear and anger, I trust their judgment to logically examine the candidates and make the right decision by looking at:whether they have demonstrated significant accomplishments over their lives and careers;if they have ideas that are clear and policies that are easy to find;how they treat their family and others, as that is how they will lead the country;what they have done to improve the lives of Americans;the people they are with, what they are saying and how they collaborate with others;their ethics, because what America needs is ""Trickle-down ethics.""Conservatives should not be embarrassed by capitalism, but must couple it with compassion, to lift people out of a culture of dependency and provide ladders of opportunity for all Americans to be a part of the fabric of society.People need to understand this is a most important election, in which we are deciding whether we allow the government to dictate our rights and take care of our needs, or whether individuals will rise up and take responsibility in an atmosphere of opportunity for all.The bottom line is, ""We the People"" are the ones making the decisions; but in order to do that, we must become active and informed, not manipulated by the political classes and media.Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to saving America for future generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation.Equally important, we need to understand that Republicans are not each others' enemies. We need to engage in conversation and challenge each others' positions, not fight each other. Conservatives need to unify together so that that we do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and put another secular progressive in the White House."
