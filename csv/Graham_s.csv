Lindsey Graham,R,s,"June 18, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on the Shooting in Charleston,"Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the people of Charleston. We are all heartbroken by this tragedy.To the families of the victims, please know that you are being prayed for and loved by so many in the community and across the nation. I pray that God will provide you healing in the coming days.There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts.Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"June 20, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Charleston,"Our nation needs to come together as a whole and pray for the victims of the tragic shooting in Charleston. This weekend, I have been in South Carolina praying with my friends and neighbors. I ask you to do the same.There can be no doubt that the shooting on Wednesday nightwas racially motivated and signals to all of us that the scars of our history are still with us today. Throughout our country, we still have much to do in the name of equality. I want to talk about those issues on the campaign trail. I want to find ways to bring our country together, to work with democrats and republicans, and everyone of any racial, ethnic, religious or political background to solve the massive challenges we face. This is something I don't just talk about, it is something I have done and will continue to do.This murderer said he wanted to start a race war; he has failed miserably. In Charleston this weekend, I saw a community coming together. I saw people seeking solace in what they share together, not in what makes them different.I'm from South Carolina. My state, like our nation, has a difficult history of race relations. We have tried to address it through compromise and working together. There is no doubt we have made great progress, but Charleston reminds us there is still much to do. The shooting was a tragic event and the fact that one person could act with such hatred and disregard for human life sickens me. We must learn from this disaster and we must all strive to do better in the memory of the nine victims. Let us ensure South Carolina, and our nation, is always represented by those nine, not by that one.At an appropriate time, we will move forward to have a discussion on a variety of fronts about what will make us stronger as a nation and what solutions need to be found to achieve that goal. But now, please join me in continuing to pray for the victims, for the citizens of Charleston, of my home state, and of our nation. Let's find the strength and wisdom, together, to make sure this never happens again."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"June 25, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Today's Supreme Court Decision on Obamacare (King v. Burwell),"This case was brought before the Supreme Court because President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress rammed through their hastily and deeply flawed legislation to create Obamacare, apparently without even proofreading their own bill. The result has been a disaster from day one. Today's decision only reinforces why we need a president who will bring about real reform that repeals Obamacare and replaces it with a plan that expands consumer choice, increases coverage, delivers better value for the dollar, and gives states more control, without stifling job creation. As president, this is the kind of reform I would put in place."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"June 26, 2015","Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Terrorist Attacks in France, Tunisia, Kuwait, and Somalia","The world is exploding in terror and violence and today's attacks in France, Tunisia, Kuwait, and Somalia are the latest tragic examples. The innocent lives lost today while working, vacationing, and worshipping show that these Islamic extremists are willing to kill anyone, anywhere, anytime.There exists a power vacuum in the Middle East created by America failing to provide leadership in the regions of the world that needs it most. As Commander-in-Chief, I will restore American leadership around the world and implement a real strategy to protect our nation and put radical Islam in a box. This will require regional partnerships, a sustained effort and rebuilding our own military and intelligence capabilities which are being degraded by severe budget cuts. As president, these will be my priorities."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"June 26, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Today's Supreme Court Ruling on Same-sex Marriage,"I am a proud defender of traditional marriage and believe the people of each state should have the right to determine their marriage laws. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that state bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional, and I will respect the Court's decision.Furthermore, given the quickly changing tide of public opinion on this issue, I do not believe that an attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution could possibly gain the support of three-fourths of the states or a supermajority in the U.S. Congress.Rather than pursing a divisive effort that would be doomed to fail, I am committing myself to ensuring the protection of religious liberties of all Americans. No person of faith should ever be forced by the federal government to take action that goes against his or her conscience or the tenets of their religion.As president, I would staunchly defend religious liberty in this nation and would devote the necessary federal resources to the protection of all Americans from any effort to hinder the free and full exercise of their rights. While we have differences, it is time for us to move forward together respectfully and as one people."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"July 1, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on the President's Decision to Open the Embassy in Cuba,"As president, I would not honor this decision with Cuba and I would close the embassy until the Castro brothers actually change their behavior. By suggesting the dictatorship in Cuba is an acceptable or normal government, we are sending the worst possible message at the most critical time.Today's announcement makes it harder for us to get a good deal with the Iranians and harder for the next president to reset world order. I fear Assad, Putin, the Chinese, and terrorists who wish to do us harm take this as yet another sign of continued American weakness.""President Obama is truly writing new chapters in American foreign policy. Unfortunately, these latest chapters are ones of America and the values we stand for  human rights, freedom, and democracy  in retreat and decline."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"July 6, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Iran Pushing to End Arms Embargo in Iranian Nuclear Negotiations,"Iran's demands that restrictions on arms sales be lifted as part of the ongoing nuclear talks show just how far afield these negotiations have gone under President Obama's failed leadership. What started as an effort to dismantle Iran's nuclear program has turned into a disastrous plan that will immediately enrich the Ayatollahs in Tehran, expand their ability to support violence and chaos throughout the region, and leave them as a nuclear threshold state. Every new detail to leak out of the negotiating room makes the situation look more grim. President Obama should immediately suspend these talks. The United States should have a very clear message for Iran and the rest of the world: we will never lift sanctions or the arms embargo until Tehran abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions and support for terrorists."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"July 7, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Today's Deadline Extension of the Iranian Nuclear Negotiations,"Today's decision to effectively pause the clock on nuclear negotiations gives us an opportunity to take stock at how far from Obama's initial negotiating positions the talks have gone. No longer are we talking about dismantiling the nuclear program or ending enrichment activities. Instead the focus has shifted to lifting non-nuclear sanctions such as the UN arms embargo and on how limited our access to suspected nuclear sites will be. All of this comes at a time when Iran is expanding its support for terrorism throughout the entire region, effectively controlling the capitals in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. How can there be any doubt that these negotiations have gone off the rails under Obama's weak leadership?I have been very clear in my warnings all along: the results of a bad deal will be greater violence and chaos throughout the region, more power for the Ayatollahs in Tehran, and a very dangerous nuclear arms race in the Mideast. In the interest of our nation's security, it is time for the Obama Administration to walk away (suspend talks) and make clear that we will never lift sanctions unless Iran is fully ready to abandon its nuclear program."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"August 3, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on the Senate's Vote to Defund Planned Parenthood,"I wholly support the defunding of Planned Parenthood today and in the future. As president, I pledge I would never send a budget to Capitol Hill that contains a penny of funding for Planned Parenthood. Abortion related services comprise over 94 percent of Planned Parenthood's business. We can kill their funding while maintaining a robust commitment to providing access to important preventative medicine and prenatal services.Organizations that harvest body parts from unborn children is neither Planned Parenthood nor right and should not receive any support from the Federal Government. I'm running for president to create a culture of respect for human life and look forward to not only eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, but also ending abortions at 20 weeks when a child can feel pain. The United States is one of seven nations that allows such a practice and as President I would make sure we are no longer part of that club."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"August 8, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Donald Trump's Offensive Comments About Megyn Kelly,"Due to Donald Trump's unrelenting and offensive attack on Megyn Kelly and others, we are at a crossroads with Mr. Trump. I applaud Erick Erickson for doing the right thing when he disinvited Donald Trump from a gathering of Republican activists. As a party, we are better to risk losing without Donald Trump than trying to win with him. Enough already with Mr. Trump.These statements are not worthy of the office he is seeking nor consistent with the leadership we should expect from a Commander-in-Chief in these dangerous times."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"August 11, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on China's Act to Lower the Value of the Yuan,"Today's provocative act by the Chinese government to lower the value of the yuan is just the latest in a long history of cheating to gain an unfair advantage in the world economy.I have been at the forefront of the fight against Chinese currency manipulation and a vocal advocate for making China play by the rules.Whether it is currency manipulation or cyber attacks, President Obama seems unwilling or incapable of standing up to the Chinese when they cheat. As president, that's exactly what I'll do."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"August 12, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham On The Necessity Of Ground Forces In The Fight Against ISIL,"The goal of degrading and destroying ISIL will never be achieved with the current Obama-Clinton 'strategy.' It is good that Governor Bush understands we need to do more to destroy ISIL. Unfortunately, his proposal is woefully inadequate when it comes to the U.S. ground component needed to destroy ISIL.With mere incremental changes to the failed Obama policy, the best we could hope for would be the dangerous status quo. Make no mistake, the fight against radical Islamic terrorism is a regional problem which must be addressed on all fronts at once to be successful.Without a substantial U.S. presence in Syria and Iraq, it is just a matter of time before ISIL further destabilizes the Middle East and launches an attack against our homeland. There are not enough individuals in Syria that can be efficiently trained to successfully destroy ISIL and topple Assad, which are necessary objectives if we hope to stabilize the region.While a no fly zone in Syria is a step in the right direction, without a ground component it is doomed to fail. It is imperative that regional ground forces be formed in large numbers to destroy ISIL and push Assad aside. For this regional force to be effective and successful, it will require integration of American troops. The American component could range from 5,000 to 10,000 depending on how the force is formed.I have learned from President Bush's mistakes, President Obama's mistakes, and certainly, my own mistakes, that these are difficult truths. It is disappointing that the president and so many candidates running for the office are unwilling to take these necessary and bold steps before it is too late. In my view, those reluctant to call for boots on the ground, the only strategy that ensures a stable Middle East and a secure America, are not prepared to be Commander-in-Chief."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"August 19, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham On The IAEA & Iran Side Deal Allowing Tehran To Inspect Its Own Sites,"Allowing the Iranians to inspect their own nuclear sites, particularly a notorious military site, is like allowing the inmates to run the jail. The inspections won't happen, can't be trusted, and clearly, put America at risk. This revelation is yet another example of how this deal, negotiated by the Obama Administration, is a dangerous capitulation to the Iranian regime. It will ensure that, within a very short amount of time, Iran becomes a nuclear threshold state.The president said, 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' I respectfully ask, how exactly will the world know when Tehran cheats, if we are dependent on the Iranians to tell us?As a senator today, I will continue to fight to stop this bad deal, including by withholding money to the IAEA, if necessary. As president, I will negotiate a better deal with Iran that will truly protect our national security and the stability of the region."
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"September 9, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham in Response To Hillary Clinton's Remarks On Obama-Clinton Iran Deal,"Alexandria, VA  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham released the following statement in response to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's remarks on the Obama-Clinton Iran deal and her plan to deal with Iran beyond the agreement:""Today, Secretary Clinton outlined a proposal that she believes would put the Iranian regime, with its leader just today referring to our nation as 'Satan' and claiming it has 'ousted' America, back in the box should they break-out. This nuclear deal gives the Iranians a knife and she is proposing a plan to stop them from using it. It is nothing short of absurd to give Iran the knife in the first place and as president, I would restore the type of strong American leadership we need to be able to get a better deal. The bottom line is that this Obama-Clinton Iranian nuclear deal puts an enormous amount of trust in a dangerous regime and those who support this deal are putting America, and our allies, at grave risk."""
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"September 18, 2015","Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham: ""Only Candidate With the Experience, Will, and Uncompromising Determination to Win the War Against Terrorism""","Today, Senator Graham released the following statement responding to remarks made by a Trump supporter at a recent event stating that Muslims were ""a problem in this country"":""If I had had the opportunity to respond to this gentleman, I would have told him that he was absolutely wrong in his sentiment and he doesn't know a thing about the war against radical Islam. After more than 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, I have learned that the overwhelming majority of the people in the faith are not buying what ISIL and other terrorist organizations are selling. To win this war, we need to build strong relationships with people of all faiths, including Muslims who reject the perversion of their faith that ISIL represents. Together, and with the right American leadership, we will win the fight against our common enemy: radical Islam.""I can only assume, based on Mr. Trump's deafening silence yesterday, that he too does not understand this war, much less how to defeat radical Islam. As I discussed at Wednesday's debate, I'm the only candidate with the experience, will, and uncompromising determination to win the war against terrorism."""
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"September 22, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham in Response to Hillary Clinton Opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline,"Alexandria, VA  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham released the following statement in response to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline:""In opposing the Keystone oil pipeline, Hillary Clinton once again shows that she intends to continue the failed policies and poor decisions of the Obama Administration. ""Building this pipeline is essential to our national security by reducing our dependence on oil from countries that hate us. Keystone represents sound environmental policy that will move the American economy in the right direction and strengthen our national security. ""As president, I would immediately approve Keystone XL."""
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"October 13, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Iran's Apparent Test Launch of New Ballistic Missile,"Alexandria, VA  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham responded to reports of Iran's apparent test launch of a new ballistic missile capable of reaching Israel and other U.S. allies:""Iran's apparent test launch of a new precision-guided ballistic missile capable of hitting Israel and other U.S. allies is dangerous new evidence of President Obama's disastrous policies and complete lack of leadership in the Middle East. After capitulating to Iran on every major negotiating objective in his nuclear deal, which is set to release over $100 billion in funds to the Iranian regime, the Ayatollah has demonstrated exactly how he will use that money: building its war machine and strengthening its capacity to wreak havoc in the Middle East, terrorize our allies, and directly threaten the security of the United States. Just as Vladimir Putin has exposed President Obama's weakness by sending troops into Syria, the Ayatollah is demonstrating to the world that U.S. leadership under Obama is in retreat. I am running for president because we need a Commander in Chief who understands this region, will rebuild our capability and capacity to secure our homeland, and has the will to take the fight to our enemies when they directly threaten our safety and our interests."""
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"October 15, 2015","Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Obama's Decision to Withdraw Down to 5,500 Troops in Afghanistan","Alexandria, VA  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham made the following statement in light of President Obama's decision to withdraw down to 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan:""As always, President Obama, through stubbornness and a general lack of appreciation for what is necessary to win a war, is putting our gains in Afghanistan in jeopardy by insisting on a withdrawal down to 5,500 U.S. troops. President Obama is implementing a policy that will require our men and women in uniform to accept an incredibly high risk, with little support, simply because he's the president who promised to end wars.""President Obama does not follow sound military advice. He seems to have learned nothing from his past mistakes. As president, I will follow the advice of my commanders and require a conditions-based withdrawal  not an artificial timeline. I view a residual force in Afghanistan as protection against 9/11; President Obama views this force as a broken campaign promise.""<"
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"November 13, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham on Terror Attacks in Paris,"Alexandria, VA  Today, Senator Lindsey Graham made the following statement in response to reports of terror attacks in Paris, France:""This is not just an attack on the French people, it is an attack on human decency and all things that we hold dear. My heart breaks for the families of those killed, the hostages, and the injured.""There is a sickness in the world that has to be dealt with and the civilized world must come together to confront it. America should lead that unity."""
Lindsey Graham,R,s,"November 16, 2015",Statement by Senator Lindsey Graham Responding To President Obama's Remarks On ISIL,"Walking faster in the wrong direction is not redoubling our efforts; it's just going the wrong way."" - Senator Lindsey Graham, CNN, 11/16/15Today, Senator Lindsey Graham responded to comments made by President Obama stating that it would be a ""mistake"" to put troops on the ground in Syria and that our current strategy is the ""right strategy and we're going to see it through"":""I was incredibly disappointed to hear President Obama reject the introduction of American ground forces as part of a regional force to destroy ISIL, which is a growing threat to the American people. The president's policies are failing and ISIL is getting stronger. The president seems to have learned nothing from the recent attacks against a Russian airliner, bombings in Lebanon, and the wholesale slaughter in Paris.""President Obama is holding on to a failing construct that ISIL can be destroyed from the air and that there is an army inside of Syria that can do the job without substantial regional and American support. The statements made by President Obama today will be disheartening to all those in the region who are looking for American leadership.""President Obama is doubling down on a failed strategy that is inevitably going to lead to a second 9/11. He just doesn't seem to understand that we only have two choices regarding ISIL - fight them in their backyard or fight them in ours. I choose to fight them in their backyard."""
