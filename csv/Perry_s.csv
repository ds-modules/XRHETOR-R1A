Rick Perry,R,s,"August 13, 2011","b""Statement by Gov. Rick Perry: Why I'm Running""","b""What I learned in my 20's traveling the globe as an Air Force pilot, our current president has yet to acknowledge in his 50's  that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. As Americans, we believe freedom is a gift from God, and government's prime function is to defend it. We don't see the role of government as a nanny state, and we recognize there is no government money that wasn't once earned through the sweat and toil of private citizens. That's why we object to an Administration that sees its role as spending our children's inheritance on failed economic theories that have given us record debt and left far too many unemployed, threatening not only our economy, but our security. Our reliance on foreign creditors and sources of energy not only compromises our national sovereignty, but jeopardizes our national future. America's place in the world is in peril, not only because of disastrous economic policies, but from the incoherent muddle known as our foreign policy. Our president has thumbed his nose at traditional allies such as Israel and Great Britain. We will not sit back and accept our current misery...because a great country requires a better direction...because a renewed nation requires a new president. That's why, with faith in God, the support of my family, and an unwavering belief in the goodness of America, I am a candidate for President of the United States. And I will work every day to make Washington, D.C. as inconsequential in your lives as I can. As governor of Texas I have led based on a few guiding principles. One, don't spend all the money. Two, keep taxes low and under control. Three, keep regulations fair and predictable. And four, reform the legal system so frivolous lawsuits don't paralyze employers that are trying to create jobs. Over ten years, we have followed this recipe of fiscal restraint to produce the strongest economy in the nation. While millions of jobs have been lost over the last decade nationwide, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been added in Texas. Texas is home to one in 12 Americans, and yet since June of 2009, we have created more than four in ten American jobs. The change we seek will never emanate out of Washington...it must come from the windswept prairies of Middle America...the farms and factories across this great land...the hearts and minds of God-fearing Americans who will not accept a future that is less than our past...who will not be consigned a fate of less freedom in exchange for more government. It is up to us...to this present generation of Americans...to take a stand for freedom...to send a signal to Washington that we are taking the country back from the grips of central planners who would control our healthcare, spend our treasure and micro-manage our businesses. My mission as your president will be to get America working again! With God's help, and your courage, we will take our country back. I hope you will take a moment to join the team and consider a donation to the campaign.  Thank you, and God bless America. Rick Perry"""

The death of American-raised al Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki is an important victory in the war on terror. Ten years after 9/11 the brave men and women of our military and intelligence services continue to take the fight to the enemy. Al-Awlaki was the next generation of al Qaida who spread his message of violence and hate over the Internet. His death will be a serious setback for their organization. Al-Awlaki was instrumental in the radicalization of Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, as well as other domestic terror plots. We must remain vigilant, and make sure we bring every resource and tool to bear in the fight to keep Americans safe."""
Rick Perry,R,s,"October 3, 2011",b'Statement by Gov. Rick Perry on Impending Execution of Pastor Youssef Nadarkhani',"b'AUSTIN - The following statement was issued by Gov. Rick Perry on the impending execution of Pastor Youssef Nadarkhani: ""The Iranian government\'s recent decision to execute Pastor Youssef Nadarkhani for his refusal to \'recant\' his faith is unacceptable. There is no shade of gray or room for equivocation here: Freedom to worship is a basic human right, and the charges against Pastor Nadarkhani are an affront to the essential principles of the civilized world. ""We can only hope that President Obama, along with the United Nations, will work toward securing the release of Pastor Nadarkhani. Becoming a martyr for religious freedom should not be the only path out of Iran. ""President Obama has insisted that Iran\'s leadership was about to unclench its fist so it could hold our hand. But Iran only unclenches its fists to strangle freedom and the dissidents who dare to practice it. ""This administration\'s silence during the \'Green Revolution,\' when Iranian dissidents took to the streets, stands out as one of its greatest failures. That silence was interpreted by government authorities as indifference, and a brutal crackdown followed. Now, a regime responsible for complicating our efforts in Iraq, that has pledged to destroy Israel, that pursues nuclear weapons, and that turns its military against its own people, is once again reminding the world of its intolerance for any who do not adhere to its extremist, repressive ideology. ""I encourage the American people to contact their U.S. Senators and express their support for Pastor Nadarkhani, as well as their desire for the Obama Administration to work to secure his release.""'"

The President was slow to engage the Iraqis and there\'s little evidence today\'s decision is based on advice from military commanders. ""America\'s commitment to the future of Iraq is important to U.S. national security interests and should not be influenced by politics. Despite the great achievements of the U.S. military and the Iraqi people, there remain real threats to our shared interests, especially from Iran.

American workers and taxpayers need a president committed to private sector job creation and fiscal sanity in Washington, D.C.

Rick Perry,R,s,"November 9, 2011",b'Statement by Gov. Rick Perry on Iran',"b'AUSTIN - Gov. Rick Perry today issued the following statement on the recently released International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report: ""The new IAEA report is the latest indicator that the regime in Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. Evidence that this includes work on a nuclear warhead design is particularly alarming - and again puts the lie to Tehran\'s claim that its nuclear program is for peaceful, energy-related purposes. ""President Obama\'s policy on Iran, based on outreach and limited sanctions, has failed. This administration has labored under the misconception that Iran\'s nuclear program could be negotiated away. But the plain truth revealed in the IAEA report is that despite years of negotiations, Tehran\'s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons continues. ""A nuclear-armed Iran would pose grave threats to not only American interests abroad, but also to our security at home. Iranian misconduct has met with little if any response from the Obama administration, and has included targeting Americans in Iraq and throughout the Middle East, supporting terrorist groups, threatening our allies, and even plotting to assassinate a foreign ambassador in Washington, D.C. ""This activity will only increase if Tehran obtains a nuclear weapon and feels it has impunity to act as it pleases. ""Working with our allies, the U.S. should act to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability. We must revisit the options President Obama has taken off the table, including tough sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank. And to protect the vital U.S. interests at stake, a responsible commander in chief must be prepared in a worst-case scenario to use military force to destroy key Iranian nuclear sites ""The U.S. should also act with renewed vigor to support those seeking freedom in Syria, Iran\'s critical Arab ally, as well in Iran itself, where millions were repressed in 2009 when President Obama tragically ignored the Green Movement to pursue the folly of engagement. Our policy toward the Iranian regime should be based not on hope or on steps that have failed repeatedly, but on thwarting this dangerous regime that pursues nuclear weapons as we help the Iranian people choose their own destiny. Unlike President Obama\'s failed approach, this would be a realistic and principled policy to keep America safe.""'"
Rick Perry,R,s,"November 12, 2011",b'A Veterans Day Message from Rick Perry',"b'Today we celebrate the courage and sacrifice of all living veterans. They are the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage, love and devotion. They served something greater than themselves. They served the cause of freedom. And many to this day bear the scars of freedom, suffered on foreign battlefields, on the high seas and at high altitudes. I served my country from 1972 to 1977 as a C-130 pilot in the United States Air Force. But I will be the first to tell you that my country has done more for me than I could ever offer in return. I never experienced the great horrors of war, though many I served with did. To me, they were the true heroes - not just those who gave their lives, but all who gave themselves in service to our country. Today another generation of Americans have answered the call of duty  in Afghanistan, Iraq, and on missions we don\'t even know about today. Many have returned from those two conflicts forever changed by the experience of war. And today we are surrounded by generations of Americans who fought in previous conflicts: the first Persian Gulf War, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, and throughout the Cold War. And though their numbers are dwindling, we still have with us the heroes of the Second World War. They include my father Ray Perry, and my father-in-law Dr. Joe Thigpen. One relative on my wife Anita\'s side of the family I never had the honor of meeting - Captain Jack Golden - fought in World War II. Fortunately, though Jack is not with us anymore, we have his many letters written from battlefields overseas. And on this special day, I wanted to share a few excerpts with you, so we can all get a small glimpse into the life of one of our nation\'s many warriors. Five days after landing in Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, Jack writes home with pride about the success of his Regiment at Omaha Beach, a tank destroyer division of the First Army, 16th Regiment in the First Division: ""We landed in France and I guess you have heard that we did a good job. We really did. Our Regt. Fought better than I have ever seen them fight before. I am still giving them hell dad."" - June 11, 1944 But almost four months to the exact day after landing in France, following a long spell of inclement weather, and reports from home about production shortages, frustration is clearly starting to build in Jack\'s mind, and likely amongst all the men: ""What is this stuff I read in the paper about the people at home getting ready for V-Day? If they were here with us they could understand just how long it will be before V-day...I will say that if production slows down and shipment slows down much more we will be having another D-Day and not a V-Day."" - October 5, 1944 The emotions seem to vary greatly after four months of war in France. The bitterness of two weeks ago is replaced by the poignant expression of love from a son to his father - a reminder that while he had experienced what no man should experience at any age, he was still just a 23-year old young man. Jack writes to his father: ""Dear Dad: I received your letter of Oct 2 and was really glad to hear from you. Even though you don\'t write very often the letters you write do me a world of good. It makes me feel good all over... ""...I am getting very anxious to see you too daddy. It has been nearly two years since I last saw you. I have been a lot of places and had lots of experiences but I have never forgotten what you once told me about praying. I have had lots of chances since that time. I think perhaps it has saved my life a few times. I also have not forgotten that I have the best mother and dad in the world. Anything I do is done because of the things you have taught me to do and to do the best I can to make you glad I am your son."" - October 20, 1944 Jack\'s reminiscing about home, and the recognition of his own mortality create a spiritual experience common among soldiers at war, as he prays for his own survival. And yet nothing can prepare a soldier for the loss of those close to you, as Jack wrote about in a letter soon after: ""I had my heart torn out an(d) thrown at me a few days ago. Capt. O\'Brien was killed. Dave told me about it over the radio and I wouldn\'t believe it. I took command of the company and am really having my hands full. I thought I was busy when I was Exec. Of the company, but I have twice as much to do now."" - November 25, 1944 Several months and a lot of action later, as reports reach home and loved ones read with excitement how close their sons are to victory, a hint of trepidation appears in a late-March dispatch from Jack. No one wants to get killed so close to the end of the war, and yet they continue to get the tough duties: ""No, mother we weren\'t the first ones across the Rhine, but it didn\'t take us long to get us over here. We haven\'t got many divisions in the American Army I don\'t guess. We are getting a little tired of hearing \'Send the First, they are tried troops with experience.\'"" - March 24, 1945 Jack\'s last letter is as reflective as any sent from the battlefield. He is fearful that not enough precautions are being taken prior to the assault on German towns. But he fears not just for his own life, but future generations of Americans unless there is a political and cultural shift back home, and a permanent commitment to a well-built, professional and lethal military. He writes: ""We are going to town again. There is only one thing wrong. There are too many German towns that we haven\'t had time to fire our artillery into. I think we should fire about a thousand rounds into every town...Someday I will tell you why I think my children and possibly yours will have to fight over the same ground I did and it will be a different and harder war. We have got to have military training in America for years and years to come. We have got to be so powerful that we can strike and strike hard in a very short time. We have got to build our character, maybe I should say get hard and tough. Enough. Enough. After that outburst I had better tell my sweetheart that I still love her."" - April 3, 1945 I wish I could say this was Jack\'s last letter before he caught the big boat home. But instead he died at the hands of a German sniper just weeks before the Germans surrendered. Jack Golden would never make it home and see his ""daddy"". He would never see his sweet cousin - my mother-in-law - whom he affectionately called Sister. His remains are buried in an American cemetery in Germany. And his family would experience the great grief of another letter, this time from the commanding officer of the 16th Infantry:  30 April, 1945 Mrs. Reta M. Golden Box 824 Seymour, Texas Dear Mrs. Golden: Please accept the sincere condolences of the officers and men of the 16th Infantry, on the death of your son, Captain Jack L. Golden, 0465929, who was killed in action on 15 April 1945 in Germany... ...Jack, at all times, was a good soldier and was well liked by both officers and men. He continually displayed the habits and bearing of an officer and gentleman, and he had the real respect and friendship of all who knew him. He died as he lived, courageously; in the performance of a difficult mission. Sincerely yours, FREDERICK W. GIBB Col, 16th Infantry Commanding When I read Jack\'s letters, as I am prone to do from time to time, I wonder if we have truly honored the depth of his sacrifice, and the sacrifice of so many who never made it home from places we recognize first and foremost because of the horrors of war: Normandy, Guadalcanal, Pearl Harbor, Anzio, North Africa, Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Baghdad, Kabul, and a thousand places in between. It\'s not just those who made the ultimate sacrifice that we must honor as Americans. It is also the heroes who made it home. This day - Veterans Days  we honor our living heroes. We do so this year on 11/11/11. Our veterans have served and protected the greatest nation on the face of the earth. They are the greatest American ambassadors of freedom. They gave their all so we would not have to. They freed millions from tyranny and oppression, arriving not as conquerors but liberators. The freedom of a great many is a tribute to the courage of so few. Today another generation of Americans is at war. One by one the survivors return home, their lives forever changed. Many are so young their best days should be ahead of them. But only if we honor their sacrifice with deeds and not just words...only if we ensure they have transitional training to fill good jobs, access to quality health care because of the injuries and trauma they have sustained, and support to finish their education, afford a home and get on with their lives. The valor of our veterans can never be captured fully in ceremonies or tributes - and certainly not in a single letter. But it can be recognized, celebrated and remembered nonetheless by all of us who breathe the air of freedom they so heroically defended. To all veterans, we offer the gratitude of a great nation, and our best wishes for a long and happy life lived forevermore in peace. God bless,  Rick Perry'"

In 2003, as Solicitor General of New York, Halligan attempted to hold gun manufacturers liable for criminal acts committed with handguns. She filed briefs in federal court arguing for the unconstitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which the National Rifle Association described as providing ""essential protectionfor the Second Amendment rights of honest Americans[.]""Halligan also filed an amicus brief in arguing that federal RICO laws should be used against pro-life groups.

He reiterated his requirement to lift sanctions immediately upon signing a deal. These statements come just days after the Ayatollah and the Iranian parliament again refused IAEA inspections of Iranian military sites. This is consistent with a long pattern of Iran stonewalling the IAEA. The hard truth, which President Obama consistently refuses to see, is that since April 2 the Iranians have rejected the parameters for a joint framework and they continue to reject the only rationale for negotiations: ending their nuclear weapons program in exchange for the easing of sanctions and diplomatic isolation.In reckless pursuit of any agreement, President Obama has conceded point after point after point. Iran has used deadlines and extensions as a tactic for eliciting still more concessions from the U.S. We are well past the time where further concessions are tolerable if we still intend to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapons capability rather than manage its breakout time. This agreement is shaping up to spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and increase the odds of a devastating and catastrophic military conflict in the future.

It\'s not fair that some people try to jump the immigration line by coming across our border illegally. One of the core responsibilities of the federal government is to secure the border. As the recent tragedy in San Francisco has shown us, it\'s important for the federal government and local governments to be able to cooperate to apprehend illegal immigrants with criminal histories. San Franciscoand many other cities in America run by left-wing governmentshave become \'sanctuary cities\' that choose to openly defy U.S. immigration law and prevent cooperation with federal authorities. Perversely, the federal government subsidizes this behavior by sending Justice Department funds to cities that intentionally harbor illegal immigrants in their jails. This has to end.""""Today, I am proposing to pull funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Programor SCAAPfrom sanctuary cities. States with sanctuary cities will lose a proportionate amount of their SCAAP funding as well. SCAAP funding will also be restricted to jurisdictions that actively participate in immigration law enforcement programs.

Now that the UN Security Council has approved the deal, our system of extensive, multilateral sanctions on Iran will unravel.Even if Congress can muster a veto-proof majority to reject this deal, it now cannot stop the process of loosening international sanctions, and the next president will be faced with an enormous challenge to re-build an international cooperative effort of the same magnitude. As the deal reads, even if the United States considers imposing/re-imposing sanctions on Iran for any reason, Iran will have a pathway to exit the agreement, escape limitations on its nuclear program, and dash towards a bomb. These kind of problematic provisions that handicap future policy options for the president and Congress stand as the primary reason for full Congressional review.The president and Secretary Kerry have now fully traded not only the legal right of Congressional examination, but also the long-term peace and stability of the Middle East in favor of a nave diplomatic \'victory.""'"
Rick Perry,R,s,"July 23, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Perry on Trump Border Visit',"b'AUSTIN  Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement on Donald Trump\'s visit to Laredo to tour Texas\' border with Mexico:""Unlike Donald Trump, I have been battling the federal government over border security for years. Border security is a federal responsibility, but when it became clear Washington wouldn\'t act, I told President Obama if he wouldn\'t secure the border, Texas would. During my time in office, Texas dedicated nearly $1 billion to border security, and we focused our resources on the areas that needed it most  like the Rio Grande Sector, which accounts for more than 50 percent of illegal crossings on the entire U.S.-Mexico border, and more than 70 percent of illegal border crossings in Texas alone.After weeks of talk, today Donald Trump will finally make his first trip to the Texas-Mexico border to see Texas\' work to fill in the gaps left in border security by the federal government. While he is there, I hope he will explain to the people of Laredo why he thinks they should be on the hook to secure our country\'s border with Mexico, rather than the federal government. I hope he will explain to the Hispanic Americans he meets why he thinks they are rapists and murderers. And I hope he will apologize for ridiculing the selfless work of the men and women of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Rangers, Texas Game Wardens and Texas National Guard to protect our communities in the face of the federal government\'s failure to secure the border.As a known employer of illegal immigrant labor, Donald Trump\'s record on border security is non-existent at best and a farce at worst. It\'s going to take more than a day trip for him to convince the American people he is anything but a hypocrite when it comes to border security.""Texas Under Gov. Perry Appropriated Over $900 Million On Border Security Between 2008-2015 And Surged The National Guard To The Border:Between 2008 And 2014 Texas Appropriated More Than $900 Million On Border Security Efforts, Including Airplanes, Helicopters, Armed Patrol Boats And Surveillance Cameras. ""Since 2008, Texas has spent more than $900 millionon airplanes, helicopters, armed patrol boats and surveillance cameras, among other thingsto spot illegal activity along the Rio Grande.

That is why today, I am calling for the revocation of the federal nonprofit charters of the Planned Parenthood Federation Of America and its political wing, Planned Parenthood Action.""The Obama Administration targets groups with the word \'patriot\' in their name but does nothing to an organization that cuts apart and sells the body parts of dead babies.
