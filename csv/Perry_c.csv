Rick Perry,R,c,"August 13, 2011","Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Charleston, South Carolina","Howdy. Thank you, Erick (Erickson, editor of RedState). It is great to be at RedState. And I'll tell you what, it's even better to be governor of the largest red state in America.It's sure good to be back in the Palmetto State, in South Carolina. I enjoy coming to places where people elect folks like Nikki Haley, true conservatives. And also where they love the greatest fighting force on the face of the earththe United States Military.And I want to take a moment and ask you to just take a silence, think about those young Navy SEALs and the other special operators who gave it all in the service of their country. Just take a moment to say Thank you, Lord, that we have those kind of selfless, sacrificial men and women. Their sacrifice was immeasurable, their dedication profound, and we will never, ever forget them.I stand before you today as the governor of Texas. But I also stand before you the son of two tenant farmers, Ray Perry, who came home after 35 bombing missions over Europe to work his little corner of land out there, and Amelia who made sure my sister Milla and I had everything that we needed, including hand-sewing my clothes until I went off to college.I am also the product of a place called Paint Creek. Doesn't have a zip code. It's too small to be called a town along the rolling plains of Texas. We grew dryland cotton and wheat, and when I wasn't farming or attending Paint Creek Rural School, I was generally over at Troop 48 working on my Eagle Scout award.Around the age of 8, I was blessed  didn't realize it, but I was blessed to meet my future wife, Anita Thigpen, at a piano recital. We had our first date eight years later. And she finally agreed to marry me 16 years after that. Nobody says I am not persistent.There is no greater way to live life than with someone you love, and my first love is with us today, my lovely wife Anita. We're also blessed to have two incredible children, Griffin and Sydney, and they are also with us today, and our wonderful daughter-in-law Meredith. I'd just like to introduce those two. Thank you.What I learned growing up on the farm was a way of life that was centered on hard work, and on faith and on thrift. Those values have stuck with me my whole life. But it wasn't until I graduated from Texas A&M University and joined the United States Air Force, flying C-130's all around the globe, that I truly appreciated the blessings of freedom.To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, I realized that the United States of America really is the last great hope of mankind. What I saw was systems of government that elevated rulers at the expense of the people. Socialist systems cloaked maybe in good intentions but were delivering misery and stagnation. And I learned that not everyone values life like we do in America, or the rights that are endowed to every human being by a loving God.You see, as Americans we're not defined by class, and we will never be told our place. What makes our nation exceptional is that anyone, from any background, can climb the highest of heights. As Americans, we don't see the role of government as guaranteeing outcomes, but allowing free men and women to flourish based on their own vision, their hard work and their personal responsibility. And as Americans, we realize there is no taxpayer money that wasn't first earned by the sweat and toil of one of our citizens.That's why we reject this President's unbridled fixation on taking more money out of the wallets and pocketbooks of American families and employers and giving it to a central government. Spreading the wealth punishes success while setting America on course to greater dependency on government. Washington's insatiable desire to spend our children's inheritance on failed stimulus plans and other misguided economic theories have given us record debt and left us with far too many unemployed.But of course, now we're told we are in recovery. Yeah.But this sure doesn't feel like a recovery to more than nine percent of Americans out there who are unemployed, or the sixteen percent of African Americans and 11 percent of Hispanics in the same position, or the millions more who can only find part-time work, or those who have stopped even looking for a job.One in six work-eligible Americans cannot find a full-time job. That is not a recovery. That is an economic disaster.If you think about it, for those Americans who do have full-time jobs, they aren't experiencing economic recovery with the rising fuel costs and the food prices that are going up. Recovery is a meaningless word if the bank has foreclosed on your home, if you are under water on your mortgage, or if you are up to the max on your credit card debt. Those Americans know that this President and his big-spending, big-government policies have prolonged our national misery, not alleviated it.And what do we say to our children? Y'all figure it out? Don't worry, Washington's created 17 debt and entitlement commissions in 30 years, but the fact of the matter is they just didn't have the courage to make the decisions to allow you to have the future that you actually deserve? That Washington wouldn't even make modest entitlement program reforms in this last debate? And the President even refused to lay out a plan, for fear of the next election? How can the wealthiest nation in the history of civilization fail so miserably to pay its bills? How does that happen?Well, Mr. President, let us tell you something: you cant win the future by selling America off to foreign creditors.We cannot afford four more years of this rudderless leadership. Last week, that leadership failed, and the tax and spend and borrow agenda of this President led to the first ever downgrade of the credit rating of the United States of America.In reality though, this is just the most recent downgrade. The fact is for nearly three years President Obama has been downgrading American jobs. He's been downgrading our standing in the world. He's been downgrading our financial stability. He's been downgrading our confidence, and downgrading the hope for a better future for our children. That's a fact.His policies are not only a threat to this economy, so are his appointees  a threat. You see he stacked the National Labor Relations Board with anti-business cronies who want to dictate to a private company, Boeing, where they can build a plant. No president, no president should kill jobs in South Carolina, or any other state for that matter, simply because they choose to go to a right-to-work state.You see, when the Obama Administration is not stifling economic growth with over-regulation, they are achieving the same through their reckless spending. Debt is not only a threat to our economy, but also to our security.America's standing in the world is in peril, not only because of disastrous economic policies, but from the incoherent muddle that they call foreign policy. Our president has insulted our friends and he's encouraged our enemies, thumbing his nose at traditional allies like Israel. He seeks to dictate new borders for the Middle East and the oldest democracy there, Israel, while he is an abject failure in his constitutional duty to protect our borders in the United States.His foreign policy seems to be based on alienating our traditional allies, while basing our domestic agenda on importing those failed Western European social values. We don't need a president who apologizes for America. We need a president who protects and projects those values.Look, it's pretty simple: we're going to stand with those who stand with us, and we will vigorously defend our interests. And those who threaten our interests, harm our citizens  we will simply not be scolding you, we will defeat you.Our nation cannot and it must not endure four more years of aimless foreign policy. We cannot and must not endure four more years of rising unemployment, rising taxes, rising debt, rising energy dependence on nations that intend us harm.It is time to get America working again. To get citizens  to get our citizens working in good jobs and getting the government to working for the people again.Page one of any economic plan to get America working is to give a pink slip to the current resident in the White House.Listen, we just got to get back to the basic truths of economic success. As Governor, I've had to deal with the consequences of this national recession. In 2003, and again this year, my state faced billions of dollars in budget shortfalls. But we worked hard, we made tough decisions, we balanced our budget. Not by raising taxes, but by setting priorities and cutting government spending. It can and it must be done in Washington, DC.Dr. Schwertner (State Representative, R-Williamson County, TX), we have led Texas based on some just really pretty simple guiding principles. One is don't spend all of the money. Two is keeping the taxes low and under control. Three is you have your regulatory climate fair and predictable. Four is reform the legal system so frivolous lawsuits don't paralyze employers that are trying to create jobs.Over the years, we have followed this recipe to produce the strongest economy in the nation. Since June of 2009, Texas is responsible for more than 40 percent of all of the new jobs created in America.Now think about that. We're home to less than 10 percent of the population in America, but forty percent of all the new jobs were created in that state.I've cut taxes. I have delivered historic property tax reductions. I was the first governor since World War II to cut general revenue spending in our state budget. We passed lawsuit reform, including just this last session a loser pays law to stop the frivolous lawsuits that were happening.And I know I've talked a lot about Texas here in the last little bit. I'm a Texan and proud of it. But first, and foremost, I'm an incredibly proud American.And I know something: America is not broken. Washington, D.C., is broken!We need balanced budgets. We need lower taxes. We need less regulation. And we need civil justice reform  those same four principles. Our country's most urgent need is to revitalize our economy, stop the generational theft that is going on with this record debt.I come to South Carolina because I will not sit back and accept the path that America is on. Because a great country requires a better direction. Because a renewed nation needs a new president.It is time to get America working again. And that's why, with the support of my family, and an unwavering belief in the goodness of America, I declare to you today as a candidate for President of the United States.It's time for America to believe again. It's time to believe that the promise of our future is far greater than even our best days behind us. It's time to believe again in the potential of private enterprise, set free from the shackles of overbearing federal government. And it's time to truly restore our standing in the world, and renew our faith in freedom as the best hope for peace in this world that's beset with strife.The change we seek will never emanate out of Washington, D.C. It will come from the windswept prairies of Middle America, the farms and factories across this great land, from the hearts and minds of the goodhearted Americans who will accept not a future that is less than our past, patriots  patriots who will not be consigned to a fate of less freedom in exchange for more government.We do not have to accept our current circumstances. We will change them. We are Americans. That's what we do. We roll up our sleeves. We go to work. We fix things.We stand up and proudly proclaim that Washington is not our caretaker and we reject the state that, in Margaret Thatcher's words, she said a state that takes too much from us in order to do too much for us. We will not stand for that any longer.We're dismayed at the injustice that nearly half of all Americans don't even pay any income tax. And you know the liberals out there are saying that we need to pay more. We are indignant about leaders who do not listen and spend money faster than they can print it.In America, the people are not subjects of government. The government is subject to the people. And it is up to us, to this present generation of Americans, to take a stand for freedom, to send a message to Washington that we're taking our future back from the grips of central planners who would control our healthcare, who would spend our treasure, who downgrade our future and micro-manage our lives.It is time to limit and simplify the taxes in this country. We have to quit spending money we don't have. We need to get our fiscal house in order and restore our good credit. And we will repeal this President's misguided, one-size-fits-all government healthcare plan immediately.We'll create jobs. We'll get America working again. We'll create jobs and we'll build wealth, we'll truly educate and innovate in science, and in technology, engineering and math. We'll create the jobs and the progress needed to get America working again.And I'll promise you this: I'll work every day to make Washington, D.C. as inconsequential in your life as I can. And at the same time, we'll be freeing our families and small businesses and states from the burdensome and costly federal government so those groups can create, innovate and succeed.I believe in America. I believe in Her purpose and Her promise. I believe Her best days have not yet been lived. I believe Her greatest deeds are reserved for the generations to come. With the help and the courage of the American people, we will get our country working again. God bless you and God bless the United States of America."
Rick Perry,R,c,"September 20, 2011",Remarks at Israel-Palestine Press Conference in New York City,"Thank you. Let me begin by thanking Dr. Solomon Frager and Aron Hirtz for helping us organize this press conference today. I am joined today by a diverse group of Jewish leaders from here and abroad who share my concern that the United Nations could take action this week to legitimize the Palestinian gambit to establish statehood in violation of the spirit of the 1993 Oslo Accords. We are indignant that certain Middle Eastern leaders have discarded the principle of direct negotiations between the sovereign nation of Israel and the Palestinian leadership, and we are equally indignant that the Obama Administration's Middle East policy of appeasement has encouraged such an ominous act of bad faith. Simply put, we would not be here today at the precipice of such a dangerous move if the Obama Policy in the Middle East wasn't nave, arrogant, misguided and dangerous. It must be said, first, that Israel is our oldest and strongest democratic ally in the Middle East and has been for more than 60 years. The Obama Policy of moral equivalency, which gives equal standing to the grievances of Israelis and Palestinians, including the orchestrators of terrorism, is a dangerous insult. There is no middle ground between our allies and those who seek their destruction. America should not be ambivalent between the terrorist tactics of Hamas and the security tactics of the legitimate and free state of Israel. By proposing 'indirect talks"" through the U.S. rather than between Palestinian leaders and Israel, this administration encouraged the Palestinians to shun direct talks. Second, it was wrong for this Administration to suggest the 1967 borders should be the starting point for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. When you consider this suggestion was made on the eve of the Israeli Prime Minister's visit, we see in this American Administration a willingness to isolate a close ally and to do so in a manner that is insulting and nave. Third, by injecting the issue of 1967 borders in addition to a construction freeze in East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements, the Obama Administration has put Israel in a position of weakness and taken away their flexibility to offer concessions as part of the negotiation process. Indeed, bolstered by the Obama Administration's policies and apologists at the U.N., the Palestinians are exploiting the instability in the Middle East hoping to achieve their objective without concessions or direct negotiations with Israel. The reason is simple: if they perceive they can get what they want from the U.N. without making any concessions why should they negotiate with Israel? While the administration is right to finally agree to fight the Arab resolution at the U.N., it bears repeating that we wouldn't be here today if they had stuck to some basic principles concerning Palestinian statehood: First, Palestinian leaders must publicly affirm Israel's right to exist, and to exist as a Jewish state; Second, President Abbas must persuade all factions including Hamas to renounce acts of terrorism and release kidnapped Israeli Gilad Shalit, and; Third, Palestinian statehood must be established only through direct negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the nation of Israel. By not insisting on these principles, the Obama Administration has appeased the Arab Street at the expense of our own national security interests. They have sowed instability that threatens the prospects of peace. Israel's security is critical to America's security. We must not forget it was Israel that took out the nuclear capabilities of Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. In both instances, their actions made the free world safer. Today, the greatest threat to the security of Israel and, by extension, a threat to America, is the Iranian government developing a nuclear arsenal. One thing is clear: we must stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Economic sanctions must be tightened and increased and all options must remain on the table to stop a brutally repressive regime from acquiring a nuclear capability. To date, we have fumbled our greatest opportunity for regime change. As average Iranian citizens were marching on Tehran in the Green Revolution in 2009, America was wasting precious time on a nave policy of outreach to both the Iranian and Syrian governments. Who knows what the leadership of Iran would look like today if America had done everything in its power to provide diplomatic and moral support to encourage the growing movement of dissidents who sought freedom. Our actions in recent years have destabilized the Middle East. We have been complacent in encouraging revolt against hostile governments in Iran and Syria and we have been slow to recognize the risks posed by the new regime in Egypt and the increasingly strained relationship between Israel and Turkey. It is vitally important for America to preserve alliances with moderate Muslim regimes and Muslim leaders who seek to preserve peace and stability in the region. But today, neither adversaries nor allies alike, know where America stands. Our muddle of a foreign policy has created greater uncertainty in the midst of the ""Arab Spring."" And our policy of isolating and undermining Israel has only encouraged our adversaries in their aggression. With the end-run on Palestinian statehood imminent before the U.N., America must act swiftly. First, every nation within the U.N. must know America stands with Israel and the Oslo accord principle of direct negotiations without equivocation. Second, America must make it clear that a declaration of Palestinian Statehood in violation of the spirit of the Oslo accords could jeopardize our funding of U.N. operations. Third, the Palestinians must know their gambit comes with consequences in particular that America will have to reconsider the $4 billion in assistance we have provided to the Palestinians over the last 17 years. Fourth, we should close the PLO office in Washington if the U.N. grants the standing of a Palestinian state. And fifth, we must signal to the world, including nations like Turkey and Egypt whom we have considered allies in recent years, that we won't tolerate aggression against Israel. Israel is our friend and ally. I have traveled there several times, and met with its leaders. It is not a perfect nation, but its existence is critical to America's security in the world. It is time to change our policy of appeasement toward the Palestinians to strengthen our ties to the nation of Israel, and in the process establish a robust American position in the Middle East characterized by a new firmness and a new resolve. If America does not head off the aggression of forces hostile to Israel we will only embolden them. That would be a tragic mistake."
Rick Perry,R,c,"September 30, 2011",Remarks to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation in Atlanta,"Good morning. Before I get started this morning, I want to congratulate the United States military and intelligence communities, and President Obama, for sticking with the government's longstanding and aggressive anti-terror policies in getting another key international terrorist. The death of American-raised al Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki is an important victory in the war on terror. Ten years after 9/11 the brave men and women of our military and intelligence services continue to take the fight to the enemy. Al-Awlaki was the next-generation of al Qaida who spread his message of violence and hate over the Internet. His death will be a serious setback for their organization. Al-Awlaki was instrumental in the radicalization of Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, as well as other domestic terror plots. We must remain vigilant, and make sure we bring every resource and tool to bear in the fight to keep Americans safe. I'm pleased to be with you for a few minutes this morning. Over the next several weeks, I will be laying out important public policy initiatives to get America working again. Today, I want to spend a few minutes updating you on the state of our nation and this critical race for the White House. It is great to be in Georgia with men and women who are helping to advance the conservative movement in America today. It is good to be with your fine speaker of the House, David Ralston. I spoke to my wife, Anita, on the way over here, and she told me to avoid saying anything controversial. I told her, ""don't worry honey, I don't plan to discuss my Aggies joining the SEC."" And I'm certainly not going to brag on the Texas Rangers in front of Braves fans. But hey, in my home state, we have two teams, not one, and neither of them have won a World Series title. I want to commend the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, and your president Kelly McCutchen, for taking such a proactive role in developing research-based, conservative public policy. What we are seeing in America today is a conservative awakening  a revival born out of a deep concern that liberals have used the machinery of the federal government to impose a nanny state that limits our freedom and that targets free enterprise. Americans are tired of command and control government from central planners in Washington, and they are tired of the empty promises about creating jobs and cutting the deficit. We were promised the stimulus plan would create three and a half million jobs, but the harsh reality is we have lost two and a half million jobs. We were told by Candidate Obama that previous deficits were unpatriotic. But since then he has doubled them. Now the president is offering a second round of massive spending cloaked as stimulus, expecting better results with the same strategy. But we know the definition of insanity is doing the same thing all over again and expecting different results. You don't stimulate the economy by growing bureaucracy. You stimulate the economy by growing the take-home pay of American workers and American enterprise. What this economy needs at this moment in time is investor confidence. But employers are smart enough to know that temporary tax relief paid for with permanent tax hikes will not lead to greater economic certainty, but instead a larger permanent bureaucracy that ""spreads the wealth."" And employers know that the promise of temporary tax relief does nothing to relieve them of the growing regulatory burden of this Administration's policies. In 2010, the Obama Administration implemented 43 new regulations that cost businesses more than $26 billion in this country. A story came out this week that major American employers find it easier to do business in China than America. Think about that. When a communist country has less bureaucratic red tape than America, our nation is off track. The problem we confront today is a Washington that is broken. One in six work-eligible Americans cannot find a full-time job. Forty-five million Americans are on food stamps. Our credit has been downgraded. And our debt has exploded. It's time for a change. And when I say change, I don't mean the rhetoric of change, but a record of change. I believe I have that record. My home state has not only created forty percent of the new jobs in America since June 2009, but our credit rating went up that year too. As governor I have led based on a few guiding principles. Don't spend all the money. Keep taxes low. Keep regulations fair and predictable. And reform the legal system to create jobs. In 2003, our state was hemorrhaging doctors because of medical malpractice suits. So we put forward a reform plan that included $250,000 caps on non-economic damages in medical liability suits. Today I am proud to say Texas has licensed more than 23,000 new doctors. Pregnant women have better access to OB-GYNs. People in need of trauma care have better access to neurosurgeons and other specialists. We spread lawsuit reform across all economic sectors. Our class action reforms now require lawyers to be paid in coupons if the plaintiffs are paid in coupons. And just this last session, we passed a new ""losers pay"" law to further clamp down on frivolous lawsuits. Eliminating the hidden tax posed by lawsuit reform is critical to economic growth. Perhaps nothing could do more to give employers certainty, however, than to stop the mad dash of federal regulations that kill jobs in America today. If President Obama is serious about improving the job climate, he will do more than intervene on a few EPA rules, he will freeze all proposed federal regulations for six months starting today. If this president wants to get America working again, he will junk the maze of new regulations, agencies and programs created under Obamacare. As Republican voters decide who is best suited to lead this country in a new direction by stopping the spending spree and scrapping Obamacare, I am confident they will choose a nominee who has governed on conservative principles, not one whose healthcare policies paved the way for Obamacare, a path blazed with higher premium costs and thousands of lost jobs. I have a lengthy record, and it has sometimes ruffled feathers. But sometimes you have to shake up the system. I'm not running from my record. Take the issue of environmental policy. In Texas, we've cleaned the air while creating jobs and adding millions in population. Another state - Massachusetts - was among the first states to implement its own cap and trade program, which included limits on carbon emissions for power plants. The former Executive Officer for Environmental Affairs in Massachusetts today oversees air quality in President Obama's EPA. A Harvard professor who helped draft carbon reduction rules in Massachusetts is today the ""science czar"" for President Obama. I knew when I got into this race I would have my hands full fighting President Obama's big government agenda. I just didn't think it would be in the Republican Primary. Americans are clamoring to hit the reset button. They don't want more of the same, they want a new direction. We don't have to settle for our current circumstances. We will change them. We're Americans! We will roll up our sleeves and get America working again! And before I leave, I will make you two promises. One, on my first day in office I will repeal as much of Obamacare as possible by executive order. And two, I will make Washington as inconsequential in your lives as I can! Let's take our country back, not by compromising our principles, but by advancing them. Thank you, and God bless you all."
Rick Perry,R,c,"October 7, 2011","Remarks at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.","Ah, thank you. Oh, my goodness. Thank you all for that very powerful welcome.And Pastor Jeffers, I want to thank you for a rousing introduction. Hehe knocked it out of the park, as wewe like to say. Andand a fellow who on any given Sunday is working with 10,000 Texans in hisin his church. So I just again want to say thank you to quite a leader.I'm also proud to be joined today by my best friend, someone who has done more to enrich my life than any other person, an individual who will be a fabulous first lady for the United States of America, my wife, Anita. [cheers and applause]And it is good to be with all of you. I want to thank Tony Perkins for the invitation to speak at theat the event today andandand for his work in advancing the conservative constitutional principles that have built the greatest nation in the history of civilization. Tony, thank you. [applause]You know, so many of you have comeso many have come to this gathering of value voters, you know, and it really strikes me asas interesting. There is no voter in America who is not a value voter. It's just a question of whose values that they share. [laughter][chuckles] You know, you think about that. You know, some hold this worldview that government must be central in ourin our lives and serve as our caretaker. They seek more than equal opportunity, they seek equal outcomes. And you know, those in the White House today don't believethey don't believe in American exceptionalism. They'd rather emulate the failed policies of Europe.But we see what their policies have led to: 14 million Americans out of work, 45 million Americans on food stamps. And according to Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, Bob, nearly half of Americans now receive government benefits.You know, in response to this economic misery, you know, liberals are now pointing the finger of blame at successful employers under the guise of fairness. But when they utter phrases like ""fair share,"" you just know[chuckles]they're once again playing fast and furious with the truth. [laughter] [chuckles] And the truth is you can't rev up the engine of an economic growth by heaping higher taxes on job creators. You can't spread success by punishing it. You can't unite our country by dividing it.The answer to our troubles lies in a positive, optimistic vision, with policies rooted in American exceptionalism. See, American exceptionalism is the product of unlimited freedom. And there is nothing troubling our nation today that cannot be solved by the rebirth of freedomnothing. [cheers and applause]I happen to believe in this great country of ours. I believe in the capacity of our people to create prosperity through private ingenuity. I believe in the values of the American people. Americans know anything worth achieving in life requires hard work, not government's handouts. And this present generation of Americans, they're not looking for government to lead the way. They're looking for America to get out of the way so that they can make the most of the freedom for their families.But you can't live free if you can't find a job. You can't live free if you inherit $46,000 bill in the federal debt. You can't live free when the government gets between you and your doctor.I believe it's time to revive freedom for our families and our employers. If we're going to get entrepreneurs and small businesses off the mat and on their feet again, we need to freeze all of the pending federal regulations that are out there for the next six monthsfreeze them all. [cheers and applause] We need to cut taxes for families and employers because the only kind of stimulus that will work is the kind that puts more money in your pocket, not government's. [applause]Wewe need to repeal the job-killing bureaucratic nightmare that's known as ""Obamacare.""AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! [cheers and applause]GOV. PERRY: You know, there are three pillars that serve as the foundation of our country: strong economy, strong families and a strong military.In my home state, we have created about 40 percent of all American jobs since June of 2009. Our success is based on four rather simple principles. One is, don't spend all the money.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah~!GOV. PERRY: And number two is, keep the taxes low. Three is, provide a fair and predictable regulatory climate, and four, stop the frivolous lawsuits. [applause]AUDIENCE MEMBER: [Amen]!GOV. PERRY: They kill jobs.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah~!GOV. PERRY: So that we passed the most sweeping tort reform in the nation andwhich, I might add, includes a new loser pay law in the state of Texas. [applause]You know, at the same time as the Fed chairman warns that the recovery is close to faltering, just yesterday the Texas comptroller's office said our tax revenues have rebounded to pre-recession levels. [applause]Our Augustour August home sales rose. Our employment expanded. Our exports increased. Manufacturing activity started climbing again.And yet there was President Obama, standing in front of the White House press corps, doubling down on the same failed strategy that had worsened our economic crisis and doubled our deficits. It just goes to show you that those blinded by tax-and-spend big-government ideology will never see the truth.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.GOV. PERRY: Every dayevery dayit is clear that the United States economy, for it to grow and to succeed, we need new leadership. [applause]AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!GOV. PERRY: President Obama's commitment to the same old pro-tax, pro-government, pro-regulation policiesthey failed our nation. America needs a new leader, with a proven record of job creation and sound economic policies.You know, Texas is not immune to the effects of the national economic environment, but recent reports show that low, flat and fair taxes; reasonable and predictable regulations; restrained government spending is a proven recipe for job creation. The key to prosperity is liberty. Yet the larger government grows, the smaller our circle of freedoms. The most basic unit of government is family. And as a conservative, I believe with all my heart that the government closest to the people is the best for the people. There should not be a single policy coming out of Washington, D.C., that interferes with decisions best made by the family.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! [applause]GOV. PERRY: I'm proud to be the son of two tenant farmers. Where I grew up, we didn't have much in the way of material goods, but we were sure rich. We were rich in spirit. We were abundant in faith. And we were devoted to family. Happiness wasn't a product of what we had but what we believed.And we believed we were blessed to live in the freest nation on this earth, that were fortunate to grow up where there was a strong sense of community, that there was nothing that we couldn't achieve in ""the land of the free and the home of the brave.""In fact, my little country school where I grew up and graduated had a motto. It said: No dream too tall for a school so small. [laughter][chuckles] You know, there are millions of Americans that are born into less than ideal circumstances. Maybe they were born into poverty, born without a parent. But as a society, we must stand for the principle that every lifeevery lifeis worth living, regardless of the circumstance. In America[applause]in America it's not where you come from that matters, but where you're going. As Americans, we must affirm the value of life, not just in our Declaration of Independence, but in the way that we live.For some candidates, pro-life is an election-year slogan to follow the prevailing political winds. To me it's about the absolute principle that every human being is entitled to life. All human lifeall human lifeis made in the image of our creator. [cheers and applause] And every innocent life must be protected, from the most frail, who are elderly, to the most vulnerable, who are unborn.That's why as governor I have consistently worked for pro-life legislation, policies such as parental consent for minors seeking an abortion, a ban on third tri-semester abortions, an informed consent law. And I'm proud to fight for and was proud to sign a budget that defunded Planned Parenthood in Texas. [cheers and applause]Our obligation is not only to protect life and bestow freedom on future generations, but it's also to instill character. Young Americans must never be taught about rights without also learning about responsibilities. We must not[applause]we must not proclaim the responsibilities of a free society and ignore the responsibilities of free individuals. We must never mistake liberty for license. One's a right; the other leads to bondage.For more than a generation, our culture has emphasized a message of self-indulgence at the expense of social obligation. We have reaped the consequencesin the form of teen pregnancies, divorced and broken families, the cycle of incarceration that joins young men with their fathers behind bars. The fabric of our society is not government, or individual freedom; it is the family. And the demise of the family is the demise of any great society. [applause]This great country of ours has never been steered off-course when we have advocated policies that expand freedom and promote strong families. But neither can it be preserved without an unwavering commitment to our national security. You know, as Americans, we're blessed to have the greatest fighting force for freedom in this entire world: our men and women of the United States military. [applause]You know, there are some out there, some misguided souls that just say you can't find heroes anymore. My, my, are they ever wrong. We have heroes today. They're fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan and sands of Iraq. They're those on covert missions, in places we don't even know about, to find and destroy the enemies of this country. They put their lives on the line every day so that we don't have to.Over the years I've been so honored to have met a great many of those American heroes as I've traveled to their outposts in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I've signed letters to their loved ones who have made the ultimate sacrifice.I consider myself so fortunate to have been able to wear the uniform of our country. And that experience, it informs my perspective about our defense policies. Specifically, I believe we must never put the military on a chopping block for arbitrary budget cuts as part of some political horse trade. [cheers and applause] Never.The question we must ask is not what we can afford to spend on our military, but what it costs to remain secure and free. You see, a real key component of keeping America secure is keeping Israel secure. [cheers and applause] We can never forgetwe can never forget that it was Israel that took out the nuclear capability of Iraq in 1981, and of Syria in 2007. Israel is our ally. They're our friend. And when I'm president of the United States, America will again stand with our friend. [cheers and applause]We're not going to compromise when it comes to our national security, and that is true when it comes to defense spending, and it is also true when it comes to border security. And let me say this about border security. I have lived and breathed this issue for over a decade as a border governor. I've signed budgets that contain a total of $400 million of state security operations along that border. I've dealt with the carnage caused by those who traffic in drugs and weapons and people. As a border governor, I know firsthand the failures of our federal border policies. And I know the answers to those failures is not to grant amnesty to those who broke the laws to come into this country. [cheers and applause]I was proud to sign legislation requiring a photo ID to vote in order to protect the integrity of our elections. [applause] And for the obvious security reasons, I vetoed legislation to give drivers licenses to illegal aliens. [applause] There is no homeland security without border security. Let me repeat that. There is no security without border security.And make no mistake about it. What we are seeing south of our border is nothing short of a war being waged by these narcoterrorists. They represent a clear and a present danger to our country. They are spreading violence to American cities. They are peddling poisons to our children.In the face of this threat, we shouldn't take any options off the table, including security operations in cooperation with the Mexican government, as we did with Colombia some years ago. You can't have liberty, you can't have opportunity, you can't have prosperity without security. The issue before our leaders of both parties is securing a better future for all Americans.You see, economic security is a topic of discussion at millions of dinner tables all across this country of ours. In the past two months I've had the great privilege to travel across this country. And I've listened to thousands of Americans, and they're not under any illusions about the current state of our country.They've never mistaken hope for a handout because they want to earn their keep. They aren't looking for soaring speeches. They're looking for common-sense solutions. And they know our first order of business to getting America working again is sending our current president to the private sector. [laughter, cheers, and applause]You know, like all of you in here, I still believe in the exceptionalism of America. And to paraphrase both Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, America remains the last best hope of mankind. We must never forget that the exceptionalism of America can be traced right into our founding principles, the fact that the framers of our Constitution were the first in the history to declare that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.The hand of providence has guided America throughout our history, from those first colonists to arrive in the New World to the courage of George Washington during those darkest hours of Valley Forge to the defeat of tyranny during two world wars and the Cold War. Time and time again America has been the source ofof light in a world that's been beset by darkness.And like a lighthouse perched on the shore, we have provided this safe harbor to millions who have been adrift in a sea of economic misery. We can still be the country we aspire to, a source of light and hope to all who live here and those who come here. Anchored by ourour ideals, we can rebuild on the solid foundation of truth instead of the shifting sands of moral relativism. We can restore hope at home while projecting our values abroad. We can be the freest, most prosperous people to ever occupy the planet if we remain one nation under God.God bless you, and thank you all for coming and allowing me to participate today. God bless you. [cheers and applause]"
Rick Perry,R,c,"October 14, 2011","Remarks at the U.S. Steel Mon Valley Irvin Plant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Thank you for joining me today. I want to say a special thanks to Jim Garraux and the men and women of US Steel for having us here today. It is great to be on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, a city built on the work, hopes and dreams of blue-collar American workers. The central issue facing Americans is a lack of jobs. Fourteen million Americans are without work. One in six Americans cannot find a full-time job. Forty-five million Americans are on food stamps. And 48 percent of American households have at least one resident receiving government benefits. Though our president has labeled Americans as soft, I believe our people have toughed it out the best they can. But they are looking for leadership and optimism, which are all too rare in Washington today. What I am proposing today is the first part of an economic growth package that will rebuild the engine of American prosperity. The plan I present this morning, Energizing American Jobs and Security, will kick-start economic growth and create 1.2 million jobs. It can be implemented quicker and free of Washington gridlock because it doesn't require congressional action. Through a series of executive orders, and other executive actions, we will begin the process of creating jobs soon after the inauguration of a new president. There is, of course, an important role for Congress to play. And in a matter of days I will offer to the American people a broader package of economic reforms that I will take to Congress when I am elected President. My complete economic growth package will tackle tax reform, entitlement reform and real spending reductions in order to address our growing debt crisis. But today I offer a plan that will create more than a million good, American jobs across every sector of the economy and enhance our national security, and the best news is it can be set in motion in my first 100 days. My plan is based on this simple premise: Make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world. We are standing atop the next American economic boom...energy. The quickest way to give our economy a shot in the arm is to deploy American ingenuity to tap American energy. But we can only do that if environmental bureaucrats are told to stand down. My plan will break the grip of dependence we have today on foreign oil from hostile nations like Venezuela and unstable nations in the Middle East to grow jobs and our economy at home. America has proven but untapped supplies of natural gas, oil and coal. America is the Saudi Arabia of coal with 25 percent of the world's supply. Our country contains up to 134 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas. We have the resources we need to fuel our cars, our homes and our power plants. They can be found in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Alabama, Kentucky throughout the American West and, of course, Alaska. But President Obama and his over-reaching Environmental Protection Agency won't allow American businesses and American labor to draw on even a fraction of this domestic energy from reserves on government-owned lands. On one hand, the Obama Administration opposes fossil fuel development at home, and then on the other hand encourages countries like Brazil to drill offshore and sell it to American consumers, creating foreign jobs and foreign profits That's wrong. That's hypocritical. That's unfair. America should not be, and when I am president will not be, held hostage by foreign oil and federal bureaucrats. The American economy should not be beaten into the ground when greater energy independence and lower energy costs lie right under American soil. My plan will create jobs in every sector, revitalize manufacturing, and contain the cost of electricity and fuel through four concrete actions. First, we will open several American oil and gas fields for exploration that are currently off limits because of political considerations. The current administration has restricted exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the mid-Atlantic. In the Gulf of Mexico, the median time for review of permits for combined deepwater exploration and development has increased 400 percent, while deepwater exploration and development plan approvals have dropped by nearly 80 percent. The Department of Interior has stopped off-shore exploration off the coast of Virginia over the objections of the Virginia congressional delegation, which has passed a bill in the House to achieve the will of their people. That bill is also supported by their Democratic senators, Webb and Warner. With a series of executive orders and other executive actions, I will authorize the following: I will work to open up Alaska's abundant resources to oil and gas exploration, including the ANWR Coastal Plain and the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. In this one instance, we will need congressional authorization. But it is worth it when you consider we will create 120,000 jobs. We will initiate off-shore exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas off the northern and western coasts of Alaska. This will create 55,000 jobs. We will resume pre-Obama levels of exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and create another 230,000 jobs. I will support the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to take Canadian Crude to coastal refineries, which would create 20,000 direct jobs for American workers. We will begin tapping the energy potential of the American West, opening up federal and private lands for exploration in states like Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado and Utah. Collectively, our western states have the potential to produce 1.3 million barrels of oil per day by 2020 and contain 87 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. They can produce more energy than what we import from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela and Russia combined! And right here in Pennsylvania, and across the state line in West Virginia and Ohio, we will tap the full potential of the Marcellus Shale and create another 250, 000 jobs by getting the EPA out of the way. While Marcellus shale is today's opportunity, the deeper Utica shale formations offer equally vast potential with more jobs over the horizon for Pennsylvania and its neighbors. The benefits of the boom in American natural gas production are also demonstrated in manufacturing and production. We see that right here at U.S. Steel's Mon Valley Works Plant that employs more than three thousand workers, many of whom make the steel products other companies use to develop the Marcellus Shale today. The face of manufacturing in industrial states has changed rapidly. Natural gas exploration is a game-changer that can bring new opportunities to replace the ones that have been lost. Development of natural gas will create jobs in the supply chain and lead to lower energy costs for manufacturers. Western Pennsylvania is known for producing great quarterbacks I want Western Pennsylvania to Quarterback a new energy revolution that creates jobs all across America. Not only will we create jobs by expanding energy exploration, we will use the revenues generated to pay down the deficit. At the same time, where America has ecological treasures, like the Everglades or Yellowstone National Park, we will not explore for energy. As we roll back federal control, we seek greater cooperation with the states. And if states oppose energy exploration, we will respect that decision. But these instances represent the exception, not the rule. It is equally important that we take a second step: eliminate activist regulations already on the books and under consideration by the Obama Administration. While President Obama has been very public about his newest jobs proposal, behind the scenes the permanent bureaucracy is working to grind the economy to a halt in pursuit of activist regulations. A raft of new rules and foot-dragging by the EPA and Interior Department are killing job creation. Examples include the Utility Maximum Available Control Technology rule, the Boiler MACT rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, the proposed Coal Combustion Residuals regulation and Section 316 (b) of the Clean Water Act. These new rules alone could destroy up to 2.4 million American jobs by 2020 and add $127 billion in costs to electric providers and consumers. Under my plan, each of these rules would be subject to an immediate review with a cost-benefit analysis to determine the impact on American employers and the environment. If we face the facts, we know that none of these rules were needed to reduce emissions of the six principal pollutants by 50 percent since 1980. And they are not needed now, especially as our economy hangs in a fragile balance between recovery and recession. I will take another step important to economic growth: I will stop the EPA's draconian measures related to the regulation of greenhouse gases. When you consider that any carbon reduction will be offset by the increase of carbon emissions by developing nations like China and India, the EPA would tie our economy in knots and advantage our global competitors while realizing no global environmental benefits in the process. The third part of my plan is to reform the bureaucracy, in particular the EPA, so that it focuses on regional and cross-state issues, providing scientific research, as well as environmental analysis and cost-comparison studies to support state environmental organizations. We will return greater regulatory authority to the states to manage air and water quality rather than imposing one-size-fits-all federal rules. I reject the notion that Washington is more committed to environmental stewardship than state and local officials who must live with the consequences of their own environmental policies. The fourth component of my plan is to level the competitive playing field among all energy producers. As the governor of the nation's leading producer of wind energy, I clearly believe there is an important role for green sources of energy as a part of our generation mix. The fact is, every energy producer receives incentives and subsidies that cost taxpayers and distort the marketplace. My plan will stop the practice of Washington writing subsidy checks to any and all sectors of the energy industry. It will also stop industry-specific tax credits, phasing out both over a period of time, allowing the market time to adjust. We will, however, preserve tax incentives for research and development. We believe the best way to invest in emerging technology is to allow private industry the freedom to develop it. The shocking reality concerning Obama energy policy is high energy prices are not an accident, but intentional. From an energy secretary who said he wanted European prices for fuel, to a president who said it was necessary to raise the price of electricity, this Administration has intentionally sought to make conventional generation from coal and natural gas more costly, taking more out of the pockets of American families. And the reason why is they want to drive consumers to green energy. But we don't produce enough green energy to fill the void, so the result is greater reliance on foreign sources of energy. Increasing the use of green energy is a laudable goal. We have done it successfully in my state. But we have used renewable sources to expand the energy supply not replace conventional generation. Natural gas and coal are responsible for roughly two-thirds of the electricity generated in this country. How can we have stable and affordable electricity when federal agencies target America's top two fuel generation sources for electricity? Hostility to coal is not confined to this Administration, it has wrongly been targeted by some members of my own party. I take a different view: I welcome the continued development of coal as an important part of job creation in America. Allowing industry to invest in research and development is the best way to pursue clean coal technology. I do not accept the false choice that we must pick between energy and the environment. It is time for a balanced, pro-American, pro-jobs energy policy. Technologies in place today, and under development, can ensure cleaner development of conventional sources. The EPA's war on American fossil fuel production comes despite the fact they can't point to a single incident of unsafe hydraulic fracturing of natural gas. If they have their way in shutting down gas and coal production, the Obama legacy will be more than 2.4 million energy jobs lost in oil, gas and coal. The choice this election is between two very different visions for our country. When it comes to energy, the President would kill domestic jobs through aggressive regulations, while I would create 1.2 million American jobs through safe and aggressive energy exploration at home. President Obama would keep us more dependent on hostile sources of foreign energy, while my plan would make us more secure by tapping America's true energy potential. His energy policies are driven by the concerns of activists in his party, my policies are driven by the concerns of American workers without jobs. We must get America working again. A big part of the solution is under our feet and off our coast. It can be done without being mired in Washington gridlock, because a president has all the authority he needs to rollback intrusive regulations, create energy jobs, and make our nation more secure. Creating jobs in America is as simple as changing presidents. That is the choice facing Americans. America needs jobs. America needs energy. America needs a ""made in America"" energy revolution. I have the long-time experience and track record of success in this critical area for American jobs and economic growth to create a new wave of American independence  energy independence. End the over-regulation. End the excess litigation. End the bureaucratic intimidation. Let's get back to what works to get America working again. Make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world.  #####"
Rick Perry,R,c,"October 19, 2011","Remarks at the Western Republican Leadership Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada","Thank you Senator Huffman (Joan Huffman, TX). It is special honor to be introduced by a state senator who has been a part of creating policies in Texas that have led to jobs and opportunity, including the sponsoring of a very important tort reform, our Loser Pays law. I am joined today by my best friend and partner in life, someone who will make a tremendous First Lady for this country, Anita Perry. And we are proud to be joined today by our daughter, Sydney. Being in the Venetian, I am reminded of the opening act of the Mark Wahlburg movie ""The Italian Job,"" where enterprising thieves escaped through the canals of Venice after ransacking a safe full of gold... but enough about The Federal Reserve. As Republican voters weigh the choice for president, they have an opportunity to put forward a clear contrast with our current president. This is not an election about small differences, it is about nothing less than a new direction for our country. I would suggest the best antidote to the Obama economic failures is a candidate with the best record in America when it comes to job creation. A change election requires a new direction, not more of the same. I come by my conservatism authentically, not by convenience. And I offer the American people a new direction. My economic plan is rooted in what has worked in my home state for ten years: lower taxes that are simple and fair; balanced budgets that cut unnecessary spending; and a regulatory climate that is friendly to small businesses and all employers attempting to create jobs in this country. The first pillar of my plan is a ""Made in America"" energy policy that makes our nation more secure and creates American jobs by reducing our reliance on foreign oil. America has proven but untapped supplies of natural gas, oil and coal. America is the Saudi Arabia of coal, with 25 percent of the world's supply. Our country contains up to 134 billion barrels of oil, and nearly 1.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas. We have the resources we need to fuel our cars, our homes and our power plants. They can be found in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, North Dakota, Alabama, Kentucky, throughout the American West, and, of course, Alaska. But President Obama and his over-reaching Environmental Protection Agency won't allow American businesses and American labor to draw on even a fraction of this domestic energy from reserves on government-owned lands. On one hand, the Obama Administration opposes fossil fuel development at home, and then on the other hand encourages countries like Brazil to drill offshore and sell it to American consumers, creating foreign jobs and foreign profits. That's wrong. That's hypocritical. That's unfair. In my first days in office, I will reverse Department of Interior policies that prohibit exploration on federal lands and in federal waters. We will work with Congress to open up ANWR; we will resume pre-Obama levels of exploration in the Gulf; and we will allow our Western States to tap into the massive supply of energy they possess so the West Coast isn't so dependent on hostile sources of foreign energy. We will review and put a halt to job-killing EPA rules that are grinding our economy to a halt. We will remake the EPA, focusing that agency on regional issues while returning state environmental issues to state policy-makers. And we will stop the subsidies and stop the tax credits for specific industries so we have a true energy marketplace with a level playing field. America needs jobs. America needs energy. America needs a ""made in America"" energy revolution. It's time to end the over-regulation. End the excess litigation. End the bureaucratic intimidation. Let's get back to what works...to get America working again. Let's make what Americans buy. Buy what Americans make. And sell it to the world. The fastest way to get our economy going is to expand energy exploration because for the most part, it can be done without congressional gridlock. A president can make these changes through executive orders and executive actions. But our long-term growth strategy requires fundamental reform of our tax code, the spending culture, and the way business is done in Washington. In six days, I will release the details of an economic growth package that will create jobs, create growth, and create investor confidence in America again. It starts with scrapping the three million words of the current tax code, and starting over with something much simpler: a flat tax. I want to make the tax code so simple that even Timothy Geithner can file his taxes on time. The second part of my plan involves a serious commitment to spending cuts, realizing the alternative is the path of Greece and other European nations that have been sunk by sovereign debt. We will reform entitlements, while preserving benefits for today's retirees and those close to retirement. We will put forward a plan that balances the budget, and to keep our country on course to future balanced budgets, I will barnstorm all fifty states to generate support for a balanced budget amendment that will require the necessary tough choices year after year. Lastly, we will change the way business is done in Washington, and it will start by ending the ""do as I say, not as I do"" entitlement mindset where Congress borrows from future generations to fund lavish pet projects that are non-essential. But let me be even more clear: my plan ends earmarks for good. It's time to bring tough medicine to Washington. No longer will policy be set by K Street, it will be dictated by Main Street. As I travel across this country, and look voters in the eye, I find that the American people, though bruised, are not broken. They remain optimistic about our country if we get Washington out of their way. And if the pundits and the establishment think they choose our president, primary and caucus voters haven't gotten the memo. The American people are not going to trim around the edges in 2012, they are going to turn Washington inside out. I am not the candidate of the Establishment. You won't hear a lot of shape-shifting nuance from me. I am going to give the American people a huge helping of unbridled truth: that we can't continue to spend what we are spending, that we can't avoid entitlement reform because we are afraid of third rail politics. The fact is we can't spend our way to prosperity. And we can't grow the bureaucracy in order to grow the economy. There is a better way. It is to restore freedom to entrepreneurs, to our small businesses...to limit government in order to create unlimited opportunity. We will reverse course on the heavy hand of regulation, discarding Dodd-Frank and any other regulations that advance a political agenda at the expense of jobs and investment on Main Street. It is time to let America be America again. To return freedom to the people. To stand on our founding principles and reject the cynical politics of the Nanny State. To paraphrase President Reagan, Washington isn't the answer to our challenges, it is part of the problem. It is time to get Washington out of the way in order to preserve the American Way. Thank you, and God bless you all."
Rick Perry,R,c,"October 25, 2011","Remarks in Greenville, South Carolina","Thank you. It is great to be in the stomping grounds of a great conservative senator, Jim DeMint. I want to thank ISO Poly Films CEO John McClure for opening his business as we discuss my plan to get America working again. Today I lay before the American People my cut, balance and grow plan. It cuts taxes and spending. It balances the budget by 2020. And it grows jobs and the economy. It neither reshuffles the status quo, nor does it expand the ways Washington can reach into our pocketbooks. It reorders the way they do business in Washington by reinventing the tax code and restoring our nation to fiscal health through balanced budgets and entitlement reform. Central to my plan is giving every American the option of throwing out the three million words of the current tax code, and the costs of complying with that code, in order to pay a 20 percent flat tax on their income. The size of the current code, which is more than 72,000 pages, is represented by this pallet and its many reams of paper. The best representation of my plan is this post card, which taxpayers will be able to fill out to file their taxes. Each individual taxpayer will have a choice: you can continue to pay taxes, as well as accountants and lawyers under the current system, or, you can file your taxes on a postcard, with deductions only for interest on a mortgage, charitable giving, and state and local tax payments. Under my plan, you will no longer have to worry about paying taxes on social security when you retire, or your family members paying the death tax when you die. And you can wave goodbye to the capital gains tax, as well as the tax on dividends. We will increase the standard exemption for individuals and dependents to $12,500, meaning families in the middle on the lower end of the economic scale will have the opportunity to get ahead. Taxes will be cut across all income groups in America. The net benefit will be more money in Americans' pockets, with greater investment in the private economy instead of the federal government. On the corporate tax side, I am offering equally bold reform. My plan closes corporate loopholes, ends the special breaks for special interests, and stops the gravy train of lobbyists and tax lawyers at the Washington trough. In exchange for a corporate tax free of carve-outs and exclusions, I offer a much lower rate of 20 percent that represents the average corporate rate among the developed nations, and that will make our corporations more competitive on a global scale. We will shut down the cottage industry of corporate tax evasion by creating a tax that is broad, fair and low. And my plan offers incentives for corporations to invest in America again, with two major reforms. First, we will transition to a territorial tax system on corporate income earned overseas. This means companies pay the appropriate corporate tax in the country where income was earned, but aren't taxed a second time when that income is moved back into the United States. Second, for all corporate profits currently languishing overseas, I will offer a one-time reduced tax rate of five and a quarter percent for a limited period of time on repatriated earnings. The U.S. Chamber estimates this one-time tax reduction would bring more than $1 trillion in capital back to the U.S, create up to 2.9 million jobs, and increase economic output by $360 billion. In other words, it's the kind of economic stimulus President Obama could have achieved if he wasn't hell-bent on passing big government schemes that have failed American workers. Today, America's combined corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent is the second highest in the developed world. It is time to overhaul our tax code so companies like ISO Poly Films can invest more in their people and their products. Tax rates have consequences. The liberals myopically ignore the realities of human nature. They think in raising rates they will raise revenue. But they don't understand large employers have choices, as do wealthy individuals, and that includes moving money off-shore. When they try to take too much, they end up hurting the very people they seek to help: the working class. We need tax policy that embraces the world as it is, and not what liberal ideologues wish it to be. The goal of my cut, balance and grow plan is to unleash job creation to address the current economic crisis, while generating a stable source of revenue to address our record deficit and put our fiscal house in order. My plan should not be viewed in a vacuum, but in comparison to the continuation of the status quo. It provides employers and investors certainty, which is critical to getting capital back into the economy. The president's plan provides temporary tax relief, which does nothing to encourage long-term investment because it doesn't provide the private sector certainty. The way to stimulate the economy is not through temporary tax relief or government spending; it is to stimulate private spending through permanent tax relief. The flat tax will unleash growth. But growth is not enough. We must put a stop to the entitlement culture that risks the financial solvency of this country for future generations. The red flags are alarming. Our children are born into $46,000 of federal debt. Our credit was downgraded for the first time this past August, in part because of a lack of seriousness about deficit reduction. According to the White House Office of Management and Budget, by year's end our debt will exceed the size of America's economy for the first time in 65 years. We are on the road to ruin paved by state serfdom. Freeing our children from financial disaster requires the courage to reform entitlements. My plan establishes firm principles to preserve Medicare and Social Security for today's beneficiaries, while saving it for tomorrow's. I am putting forward five principles to save Social Security for the long-term. First, we will protect existing benefits for current retirees, and work with Congress on the exact age where those nearing retirement are grandfathered out of changes to the program. Second, we will end the current pillaging of the Social Security Trust Fund by Washington politicians. Here is the hard truth: the trust fund is full of IOU's, without a single dime of money left over from what workers have paid in. The politicians have borrowed against it for years. And in order to redeem the IOU's in the fund, they will have to either raise taxes or cut spending on other programs to replenish it. Here is the other hard truth: if we don't act, in 25 years benefits will be slashed 23 percent overnight. Protecting Social Security benefits begins with protecting the solvency of the fund, and stopping all current borrowing from the fund, just as we have done with the highway trust fund. The third principle of reform is to allow young workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes into private accounts if they so choose. I am not nave. I know this idea will be attacked. But a couple of facts are worth stating: one, the return on investment in Social Security is so small it is like an interest bearing savings account. Over the long-term, the markets generate a much higher yield. Second, opposition to this simple measure is based on a simple supposition: that the people are not smart enough to look out for themselves. The liberals think the American people cannot be trusted to safeguard even a portion of their own retirement dollars. It is time to end the nanny state and empower our people to exercise greater control over their money. The fourth principle is to return to pre-1983 law and allow state and local governments to newly opt out of Social Security and instead allow their employees to pay solely into state or locally run retirement programs. This has been done around the country, with better results. We ought to allow it again. Lastly, we ought to work to raise the retirement age for younger workers  on a gradual basis  to reflect the longer life-span of today's Americans. I will work with Congress to determine the right formula, beginning at the right age. But this is common sense, and it can help save Social Security for future generations. We will also reform Medicare to save it for future generations of Americans. We will do this by working with Congress on several options, including giving patients greater flexibility in choosing the plan that best fits their unique needs through bundled premium support payments to the individual, or as a credit against purchase of health insurance. Second, we should look at gradually raising the age of Medicare eligibility. Third, we should consider adjusting Medicare benefits to be paid on a sliding scale based on the income of the recipient. And lastly, we must tackle the $100 billion in annual waste and fraud to save this valuable program as Americans live longer. My plan also restructures Medicaid, returning control over the program and the dollars needed to administer it to states. One-size-fits-all health care doesn't work for people on private plans in the form of Obamacare, and it doesn't work with public plans, such as Medicaid. Washington has broken it, and shown no will to fix it. We must give state leaders the flexibility to fix Medicaid and control its costs. These reforms are essential to balancing the budget. My plan balances the budget as fast as any serious plan offered, in the year 2020, with reforms to entitlements, with greater economic growth, and with cuts to discretionary spending. I do not take the tack of the current President, with arbitrary cuts to defense spending. The question we must ask is not what we can afford to spend on our national defense, but what does it cost to keep America secure. At the same time, we will reform the way we spend money in Washington so we can balance the budget in eight years. But to truly protect taxpayers, we need the extra protection of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution. I will reduce spending in the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the EPA, and a whole host of other agencies, returning greater control to the states. My plan reduces non-defense discretionary spending by $100 billion in year one, and builds on those savings in the years to come. I will also institute several principle reforms to the budgetary process, which are contained in my Cut, Balance and Grow Plan on my website. It is not the length of a ""War and Peace"" novel, and is easy to understand, yet bold in its approach. Included in my budget reforms are elimination of baseline budgeting that assumes previous expenditures are sacrosanct, an end to non-emergency spending in emergency bills, and a permanent stop to ""bridge to nowhere"" projects through the elimination of earmarks. I will couple these budgetary reforms with an overhaul of the regulatory process. When federal agencies like the NLRB are dictating to companies where they can create jobs and where they cannot, they have over-stepped their bounds and undermined our free market system. On my first day in office, I will freeze all pending federal regulations and immediately begin a review of all new regulations since January of 2008. Today the Federal Register contains 165,000 pages. The index alone is eleven hundred pages long. And somehow, despite not having any of these new regulations for our first 219 years, America not only survived, we thrived. The federal nanny state's heavy-handed regulations are keeping our economy in the ditch. It is time to review and scrap regulations that harm jobs and growth. Lastly, one of the greatest impediments to investment in America are the Dodd-Frank banking regulations, and I will lead the charge to eliminate them. Dodd-Frank is killing small banks, and freezing access to credit just when small businesses need it most. It enshrines bailouts and the notion of ""too big to fail"" in federal law, benefitting Wall Street while killing Main Street. It's wrong. It's unfair. It must go. My plan does not trim around the edges. And it does not bow down to the established interests. But it is the kind of bold reform needed to jolt this economy out of its doldrums, and renew American prosperity. Those who oppose it will wrap themselves in the cloak of the status quo. America is under a crushing burden of debt, and the president simply offers larger deficits and the politics of class division. Others simply offer microwaved plans with warmed-over reforms based on current ingredients. Americans, however, aren't searching for a reshuffling of the status quo, which simply empowers the entrenched interests. This is a change election, and I offer a plan that changes the way Washington does business. The great issue facing this nation is whether we have the courage to confront spending and the vision to get our economy growing again. We need a tax code that unleashes growth instead of preventing it; that promotes fairness, not class warfare; that sparks investment in America instead of overseas interests. It is time to create incentives for American companies to invest in American workers. It is time to end the corporate loopholes, end the special tax breaks for special interests, end the gravy train for lobbyists and tax lawyers. It is time to pass a tax that is flat and fair, that frees our employers and our people to invest, grow and prosper. We will set our employers and our people free by slashing the cost of government, cutting taxes for middle class families, balancing our budget and growing our economy. The future of America is too important to be left to the Washington politicians. To get America working again, we must cut taxes and spending, balance the federal budget, and grow our economy and jobs. My plan unleashes American ingenuity for a new American Century. Restores the hopes and dreams of our people. Renews our great promise. And entrusts the fate of this nation into the hands of our People, setting them free. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Rick Perry,R,c,"November 15, 2011","Remarks in Bettendorf, Iowa","Thank you. It is great to be here at Schebler in Bettendorf, Iowa.I want to say a special thanks to Jim Anderson, your president, for opening your facility to us, and letting us meet the hardworking men and women of this plant. And I am especially delighted to be joined by the governor of a nearby Midwestern state, Kansas governor Sam Brownback.Governor Brownback not only has the perspective of a leader in America's heartland, but was a United States Senator, where he had an up-close view of just how broken Washington is, and has witnessed Washington's encroachment on the 10th Amendment from both perspectives. He shares my desire for fundamental reform in Washington, and I am delighted to be joined by him today here in Iowa.The issue this election is not whether Washington is broken, but how we go about fixing it. There are two approaches, and even my own party is split.There are some who want to tinker with the status quo. They want to work within the current system to achieve marginal change. Then there are those who believe, as I do, that Washington is too broken to be fixed by tinkering on the margins.I do not believe Washington needs a new coat of paint, it needs a complete overhaul. We need to uproot, tear down and rebuild Washington, D.C. and our federal institutions.We should apply the wisdom of Solomon to Washington. Ecclesiastes, Chapter 3, says, ""there is a time to plant and a time to uproot, there is a time to tear down and a time to build.""It is time to tear down the monuments to bureaucratic failure, and in their place build a smaller, more efficient federal government that puts the American People first.The Washington Insiders won't address Beltway decay, they won't try a totally new way, because they like things as they are.The lobbyists make their living on protecting corporate loopholes, and securing earmarks for the special interests they represent.The status quo is good to the Washington Insiders. It's good to the overpaid bureaucrats. It's good for the power-players who can trade favors to build fiefdoms of influence.While the rest of America remains mired in the ruin caused by Washington's out-oftouch, big government economic policies, Washington is doing fine.In fact, the Washington metro area is now the most affluent metropolitan area in the country. That's because all the lobbyists, contractors and over-paid czars and bureaucrats haven't suffered one bit in the worst economy in 70 years. While Main Street's windows have been boarded up, the cash continues to flow to Wall Street financiers and Beltway profiteers.Let me ask you a question: if you found out the house you built had crumbling walls, faulty wiring, and a leaky roof, would you call in the original incompetent builder to fix it?And if it was fundamentally flawed, would you add on to the same faulty structure, or would you tear it down, and re-build again with a totally new crew?Our country's foundation  the American people and the United States Constitution  is still strong.It's what the politicians and bureaucrats have built upon that foundation, on the backs of American taxpayers, that must be replaced and rebuilt.Those who got us into this mess will not get us out. Those who increased the debt $4 trillion in three years cannot be trusted to bring in a new era of fiscal austerity. Those who made the economic crisis worse do not have the capacity to make it better.In recent weeks our president has taken to pointing the finger of blame instead of taking responsibility. He has called us soft and lazy, and he has said Americans lack ambition and imagination.Mr. President, Americans aren't soft or lazy, and Americans do not lack ambition of imagination, Washington has failed us.We need new leadership. We need a new builder. We need a Washington Outsider.Unique to the Republican field, I have never been an establishment figure, have never served in Congress or part of an Administration, and have never been a paid lobbyist. My career has been that of a Washington Outsider.Here is my plan to fix our three broken branches of government.Part one of my plan is to reform the federal judiciary by ending life terms for unelected federal judges. Too many federal judges rule with impunity from the bench, and those who legislate from the bench should not be entitled to lifetime abuse of their judicial authority.Under my plan, future appointees to the federal bench will not receive a lifetime appointment.Part two involves deconstructing the permanent political class in the legislative branch. Congress is out of touch because Congressmen are overpaid, over-staffed and away from home too much. Americans have had enough.It's time to create a part-time Congress where their pay is cut in half, their office budgets are cut in half, and their time in Washington is cut in half.And if they do not submit a budget that balances by 2020, as my plan calls for, we should cut their pay in half again.And when I take office, we will work to freeze congressional and agency salaries until the budget is balanced.We have a lot of well-intentioned members of Congress. But they have become creatures of Washington. They get paid more than three times the average American Family, and they have doubled their own budgets in the last decade.They are completely detached from the people, who are struggling to get by, and can't vote to raise their own pay.Some have even abused the public's trust, trading on inside information to pad their stock portfolios. Congress has proven it can't be trusted to watch our money, and now its clear they can't be trusted with theirs'.Any Congressman or Senator that uses their insider knowledge to profit in the stock market ought to be sent to jail  period.And my plan makes that clear. But in reality, they shouldn't wait until we have a new president, they ought to pass a law right now that criminalizes Insider Trading in Congress, no ifs, ands or buts.We send members of Congress to look out for America, not enrich themselves. But too often, they are taken captive by the Washington culture.That's why we need a part-time Congress. I say send them home to live under the laws they pass among the people they represent.Further, we must change the spending culture in Congress.No more bailouts of bankers, no more earmarks for pet projects, and no more spending beyond our means.I will bring spending down to 18 percent of GDP, the average amount of the last 50 years. And I will fight in every corner of this country for a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution.And two more points on spending: no longer will we prop up failed entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were at the heart of the economic collapse because of mortgage financing policies that gave false confidence to homebuyers who have now defaulted or are under water.We will privatize Fannie and Freddie so politicians can no longer politicize them, and taxpayers will no longer be fleeced by them.And lastly, we will put a permanent stop to federal funding of Planned Parenthood because our tax dollars should never be used in taking an innocent, unborn life.The third part of my plan involves the dismantling and rebuilding of the permanent bureaucracy.We will eliminate agencies that perform redundant functions. I will get rid of the Commerce Department, the Department of Education, and the Department of Energy.We will downsize and re-task the EPA so it no longer torments job creators or gives an official stamp to phony science.We will end the TSA's harassment of law-abiding travelers and return transportation security to the private sector.And we will restructure the behemoth that has become the Department of Homeland Security.We will perform a full audit of the Federal Government, and there will be no sacred cows, including wasteful spending at the Department of Defense, where every dollar we spend should support our warfighters around the world.We will put a moratorium on every pending federal regulation, and order a full audit of the last five years of new regulations, repealing those that are not affordable, effective or that kill jobs.And we will say to every bureaucrat except our military and law enforcement: no salary increases until the federal budget is balanced. And because a president must lead by example, we should cut his salary in half until the budget is balanced.Washington is so broken, Americans will accept nothing less than a complete overhaul of the way business is done in America.Americans know there is a season for everything under the sun. And this is the season for tearing down and rebuilding again, for uprooting the broken branches of government in Washington, and building a new government that is smaller and more humble, so America can be stronger and freer again."
Rick Perry,R,c,"November 30, 2011",Address to the New Hampshire State House in Concord,"Thank you Speaker O'Brien. It is an honor to speak to the nation's largest state legislature, the New Hampshire State House of Representatives. I am truly honored to speak in this historic setting, the oldest capitol building in the nation where legislators occupy the original chambers. Like you, I come from a state with a citizen-legislature. We meet 140 days every two years. Some Texans think we should meet two days every 140 years.I am reminded of the great history of our nation in your midst today. Behind me are five portraits that paint a picture of brave and virtuous leadership, of individuals who remind me of one of my state's own legendary figures: Sam Houston, who lived by the motto, ""do right, and risk consequences.""You have a portrait of our nation's first president, George Washington, who not only led us to victory in the American Revolution, but who voluntarily relinquished power after two terms in the vein of a true statesman.New Hampshire's one and only native president adorns these historic walls: Franklin Pierce, who became president just eight years after my home state joined the union.There is Daniel Webster, whose statue in Scott Circle in Washington, D.C. contains an inscription that reads, ""Liberty and Union, Now and Forever, One and Inseparable.""A voice of conscience is also displayed in this historic setting: Senator John P. Hale, the first United States Senator to speak out against the sin of slavery.And finally, perhaps our nation's greatest president, who preserved the union and set the slaves free. Abraham Lincoln looks down upon us today.They all sought a more perfect union, and leave legacies that transcend time because they stood on the foundation of moral courage.Washington will always be remembered for leading us to our freedom, Hale for speaking out on the side of truth and justice more than 100 years before Congress truly established equal rights, and Lincoln, for liberating a people who had been deprived the freedom to live according to the ideals of our Constitution.We are not a perfect union, but we are a more perfect union because all citizens regardless of tribe or tongue are given the promise of opportunity in America today.However, I would not be running for president if I thought all is well with America today.In fact, I am running because the promise of our founders is currently being wasted by Washington.I am running because today's Washington politicians have acted like Black Friday consumers engaging in a spending spree that puts our children's future on layaway. We buy now, they pay later.And I am running because we must no longer tolerate an America in which Main Street is allowed to crumble while Wall Street financiers and Beltway profiteers bilk the taxpayers.What is wrong with America can be diagrammed on a map with one straight line connecting two dots between Washington and Wall Street.The Washington politicians pressured Fannie, Freddie and the banks to provide easy lending to put more Americans in homes they could not afford. The sub-prime market exploded with risky loans. Americans were snookered into deals with zero down and balloon payment notes.Regulators fell asleep at the switch. No one was watching as the rating agencies gave Triple A ratings to complex securities filled with high-risk loans. And the Wall Street high rollers hatched get rich schemes where they profited from betting against America. When the market crashed, those on Wall Street who saw it coming made millions, and those who did not got bailed out.This week we learned that the $700 billion TARP bailout was paltry compared to secret loan guarantees of $7.7 trillion.Those paying the price are not the large banks who were over-leveraged, not the insurance companies that took on too much risk, not even the executives who continued to reap large bonuses even after the walls came tumbling down.No, the people who are paying the price are average Americans, Main Street businesses, and our children, who stand to inherit the worst fiscal mess of our lifetime. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's unjust.We shouldn't be awarding taxpayer-funded bonuses to Wall Street executives who defrauded those very same taxpayers. We should be locking them up. And when I am president, we will clean up corruption from K Street to Wall Street so they can't gamble with our children's future again.It starts with a simple promise. No more bailouts, whether we are talking about bankers in America or in Europe.  It continues with my pledge to end wasteful earmarks. And I won't stop until Congress and the American People pass a balanced budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.I believe there is a model for good governance that Washington should emulate. It is the model of the citizen-legislature that you have in New Hampshire today.You take care of the people's business, pass a budget, and then go home and live under the laws you pass. Washington is broken because the professional political class consolidates more and more power and leaves the rest of us less freedom.Our debt is now $15 trillion. 14 million Americans are out of work. One in eight Americans are on food stamps. And Washington's only answer is to spend more money and become more central in our lives.As the state that lives by the motto, ""live free or die,"" you have demonstrated a better way where spending is kept under control, budgets are balanced and residents are freed from the burden of paying either a state income tax or a state sales tax. And if you ever doubt the power of taxation to dictate consumer decisions, look at how many Boston workers have moved their homes across the border to the Granite State.If you pass into law a right to work law, you may just join my home state in creating more jobs than any other state in America.Unions have a proper role in America, but you shouldn't be forced to join one to feed your family.I am here to say to every American frustrated by the excess spending, by this faltering economy, by the Washington and Wall Street Corruption: you have a choice this election.You don't have to sit back and take it anymore. You don't have to resign yourself to choosing between Washington Insiders. You don't have to settle for modest reform that amounts to a reshuffling of the status quo. You can reach beyond the confines of the Beltway and choose bold change from a true Washington Outsider.We don't need to tinker around the margins as our country drowns in debt and unemployment. We need to overhaul Washington. To me, it starts with creating a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, cut their office budgets in half, and cut their time in Washington in half.Let's free up employers from the heavy hand of regulation. I will freeze every pending regulation and review every enacted one since 2008. And if they kill jobs, they are gone.To jolt our economy, let's stop debating temporary tax cuts financed by permanent tax hikes to the same failed system. Let's give Americans the option of junking the tax code and paying a simple flat tax.My plan is so simple you can file it on a postcard. In fact, it's so simple Timothy Geithner can pay his taxes on time.And my plan goes further. It closes the corporate loopholes, ends the corporate carve-outs and stops the gravy train of tax lawyers and lobbyists at the Washington trough.The premise of my plan to uproot and overhaul Washington goes back to our founders and the notion that the people are not the subjects of government but instead government should be subject to the people.In his eulogy to John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Webster said, and I quote:""And now, fellow-citizens, let us not retire from this occasion without a deep and solemn conviction of the duties which have developed upon us. The dear purchase of our fathers are ours. Ours to enjoy, ours to preserve, ours to transmit. Generations past and generations to come hold us responsible for this sacred trust. Our fathers, from behind, admonish us. Posterity calls out to us. All conjure us to act wisely and faithfully in the relation which we sustain. We can never, indeed, pay the debt which is upon us, but by virtue, by morality, by religion, by the cultivation of every good principle and every good habit we may hope to enjoy the blessing through our day and to leave it unimpaired to our children.""Daniel Webster knew that responsibility implicit to every generation of Americans, to leave a country better, stronger and freer than the one given to them at great cost. The future of America is too important to be left in the hands of the Washington politicians.I have talked a lot about the mess we are in, but I want you to know I remain an optimist at heart. Washington may be broken, but the American People are not. I know, because I have traveled this country. I have spoken to the corn farmers in Iowa, to the blue collar manufacturing workers in South Carolina, to the town hall inquisitors in New Hampshire. Yes, they can be pretty direct.These Americans haven't quit. They aren't buying into the idea that our best days are behind us. They simply want their country back.I know this is still the America where the son of tenant farmers can become governor of our second largest state and run for president. This is still the America I volunteered to serve in the United States Air Force in 1972, the greatest force for freedom the world has ever known.This is still the America where there are no artificial barriers posed by class, but an all-encompassing promise to those who dream big and work hard that you can achieve success, and most certainly significance. What's wrong with America has nothing to do with the idealism and values of the American People, which remain virtuous.It is about how broken Washington is. If we clean up our nation's capital, America will get off the mat again. Our people will dream again. Employers will invest again. Our economy will grow again.The America I learned to love on that small cotton farm is still there ready to be awakened once again. The freedoms written into this Constitution are not just words on paper. They are ideals inscribed on the hearts of every American who yearns to be free.Let's set them free. Let's make America, America again. Let's rein in Washington.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Rick Perry,R,c,"January 3, 2012",Remarks in West Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucus,"[remarks joined in progress]He said it brought me to tears to see a man who feared the war. And when you told that soldier, or you called him your Christian brother, he said, blew me away. He said I want so much for me to know that -- he said I want you to know that I got to know your son and I got to meet your wife, Anita. Your family is wonderful. I've enjoyed my visits with your staff along the way. Ray Sullivan and Joe, they are great people. Basically, I want you to know you matter and are making a difference. I visited a thousand homes today, and you better -- you matter to them also. This has to be the greatest honor of my life. And you need more volunteers to help you in South Carolina, count me in. I'll be happy to serve you again. Thank you! Colton Smith from Texas. [applause]I wanted to read that to you. [applause]And he P.S.'d it by saying, sorry about rambling so much, but he said I've been out. It's 1:30 in the morning, and I've been out putting out signs, 400 signs. That's what it's all about, folks. That is what this has all been about. And I just want to say thank you to everyone who's come and volunteered and worked and made the most incredible experience for myself and for the woman that I've been so blessed to have by my side all these many years, for 30 years of my life of wedded Bliss. [applause]There's not anybody that's fought any harder, that's been a greater partner than my wife, Anita, and my sweetheart, and the love of my life. And we're blessed tonight to be standing on this stage and representing the state of Texas, and frankly, representing America. And I think the values that are so important to our country, and to be here with my children, Griffin and Meredith and Sydney.You know when I began this campaign a little more than four months ago. I didn't do it because it was a lifelong ambition to be the president of the United States. I did it because our country's in trouble. Many of you have heard the story of us, Anita sitting on the couch and talking about that this wasn't my purpose in life.But our country was in trouble. And it was my duty to serve my country one more time. And this campaign's never been about me. It's about a movement of Americans who see our country that's really not on the track that most of us want it to be on. $15 trillion of debt, some 50 million Americans that are on food stamps, 13 million of us, 13 million of our fellow citizens that are out of work. They don't see a Washington that's willing to make hard decisions, to help them, to get them back on their feet again. They're looking for people to make some right decisions. They're looking for someone that will stand up and give them hope that we can get this country back on track again.But with the voters' decision tonight in Iowa, I decided to return to Texas, assess the results of tonight's caucus. Determine whether there is a path forward for myself in this race. I believe that this is the greatest nation on the face of the earth. A nation that I was blessed to serve as a pilot in the United States air force, a nation that has been and will continue to be a beacon for freedom around the world.And Dan Marin, you, marines like yourself, soldiers that are serving still today and airmen, sailors around the world, you've made every minute of this worth it for ourselves and with a little prayer and reflection, I'm going to decide the best path forward. But I want to tell you, there has been no greater joy in my life than to be able to share with the people of Iowa and of this country that there is a model to take this country forward, and it is in the great state of Texas. God bless you and thank you all for being with us."
Rick Perry,R,c,"January 19, 2012",Remarks Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities,"Thank you. As I have stated numerous times on the campaign trail, this campaign has never been about the candidates.I ran for President because I love America, our people and our freedom. But the mission is greater than the man. As I have traveled across this great country: from New Hampshire to California, from Iowa to Florida, and to numerous states in between, I have discovered a tremendous purpose and resiliency in our people. They have never lost hope despite current circumstances.They haven't stopped believing in the promise of America or the American Dream.Americans are down, but we can never be counted out. We are too great a people. What is broken in America is not our people, but our politics.And what we need is a Washington that is humbler, with a federal government that is smaller so our people can live freer.I entered this campaign offering a unique perspective: a governor who has led a large state leading the nation in job creation, an executive leader who has implemented conservative policies, a son of tenant farmers born with little more than a good name, but who has experienced the great possibilities of freedom.But I have never believed that the cause of conservatism is embodied by any one individual. Our party, and the conservative philosophy, transcends any one individual. It is a movement of ideas that are greater than any one of us, and that will live beyond our years.As a former Air Force pilot, I know we can't lose track of the ultimate objective in carrying out our mission, and that objective is not only to defeat President Obama, but to replace him with a conservative leader who will bring about real change.Our country is hurting with more than 13 million unemployed, nearly 50 million on food stamps and a debt of more than $15 trillion and growing.We need bold, conservative leadership that will take on the entrenched interests and give the American People their country back.I have always believed the mission is greater than the man.As I have contemplated the future of this campaign, I have come to the conclusion that there is no viable path to victory for my candidacy in 2012.Therefore, today I am suspending my campaign and endorsing Newt Gingrich for president.I believe Newt is a conservative visionary who can transform our country.We have had our differences, which campaigns inevitably bring out. And Newt is not perfect, but who among us is?The fact is, there is forgiveness for those who seek God and I believe in the power of redemption, for it is a central tenet of my own Christian faith.And I have no question Newt Gingrich has the heart of a conservative reformer, the ability to rally and captivate the conservative movement and the courage to tell the Washington interests to take a hike if it's what is best for the country.As a Texan, I have never shied away from a good fight, especially when the cause was right.But as someone who has always admired a great Texas forefather  Sam Houston  I know when it is time for a strategic retreat.So I will leave the trail, return home to Texas and wind down my 2012 campaign organization. And I will do so with pride knowing I gave myself fully to a cause worthy of our country.And as I head home, I do so with the love of my life by my side, a woman who makes every day a good one when she is by my side, my wife Anita.Thank you Anita for all you have done.I also want to thank my son Griffin, my daughter Sydney, and my daughter-in-law Meredith for standing with us in this great effort.With a good wife, three wonderful children, and a loving God in my life, things will be good no matter what the future holds.I'm proud of the policies we put forward to the American people and believe they provide the right path forward for our party and our nation: overhauling Washington and returning power to state and local governments and to the people, creating energy jobs and energy security, cutting spending and eliminating unnecessary federal agencies and cutting taxes to a flat, fair 20 percent. And I will continue to fight for these conservative reforms because the future of our country is at stake and the road we are traveling today  President Obama's road  endangers our future.I want to thank some wonderful individuals who have stood by my side in this state: Katon Dawson, Ambassador Wilkins, and a strong and good man serving you in Congress, Mick Mulvaney.I want to thank all my supporters from across the country, in particular Governor Bobby Jindal, Steve Forbes and Governor Sam Brownback, as well as Senator Jim Inhofe, Congresswoman Candice Miller and Congressman Sam Graves.And I want to say a special thanks to three distinguished veterans who have joined me on the campaign trail: Medal of Honor awardee and Navy SEAL Mike Thornton, Navy Cross recipient Marcus Luttrell and Purple Heart recipient, Marine Captain Dan Moran.I began this race with a sense of calling.I felt led into this arena to fight for the future of this country.I feel no different today than I did then, knowing a calling never guarantees a particular destination, but a journey that tests one's faith and character.So now the journey leads us back to Texas, neither discouraged nor disenchanted, but instead rewarded for the experience and resolute to remain in the arena and in the service of a great nation.Our country needs bold leadership and a real transformation.We must rise to the occasion and elect a conservative champion to put our nation back on the right track. And this I know, I am not done fighting for the cause of conservatism. In fact I have only begun to fight.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Rick Perry,R,c,"June 4, 2015","Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Dallas, Texas","Thank you. I was born five years after the end of a global war that killed more than 60 million people.I am the son of a veteran of that war, who flew 35 missions over war-torn Europe as a tail gunner on a B-17.When dad returned home, he married mom, and they started a life together.They were tenant farmers.They were raised during a time of great hardship, and had little expectation beyond living in peace, putting a roof over our heads and putting food on our table.Home was a place called Paint Creek. Too small to be called a town, but it was the center of my universe.For years we had an outhouse, and mom bathed us in a number two washtub on the back porch. She also hand-sewed my clothes until I went off to college.I attended Paint Creek Rural School, grades one through 12. I played 6-man football. I was a member of Boy Scout Troop 48, became an Eagle Scout, and went off to Texas A&M; where I was a member of the Corps of Cadets and an animal science major.I was proud to wear the uniform of our country as an Air Force officer and aircraft commander.After serving, I returned home to the rolling plains and big skies of West Texas, and I returned to farming.There is no person on earth more optimistic than a dryland cotton farmer. We always know a good rain is just around the corner, no matter how long we'd been waiting.The values learned on my family's cotton farm are timeless: the dignity of work, the integrity of your word, responsibility to community, the unbreakable bonds of family, and duty to country.These are enduring values. Not the product of some idyllic past, but a touchstone of American life in our small towns, our largest cities, our booming suburbs.I have seen American life from the red dirt of a West Texas cotton field, from a campus in College Station, from the elevated view of a C-130 cockpit, and from the Governor's office of the Texas Capitol.I served a small rural community in the Texas Legislature, and I led the world's 12th largest economy.I know that America has experienced great change, but what it means to be an American has never changed: we are the only nation in the world founded on the power of an idea that all ""are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""Our rights come from God, not from government, and our people are not the subjects of government, but instead government is subject to the people.It has always been the case that there has been a social compact between one generation of Americans and the next: to pass along an inheritance of a stronger country full of greater promise and possibility.And that social compact has been protected at great sacrifice. This was never more clear to me than when I took my father to the American cemetery that overlooks the bluffs at Omaha beach.On that peaceful, wind-swept setting, there lie 9,000 graves, including 45 pairs of brothers, 33 of whom are buried side by side, a father and a son, two sons of a president. They all traded their future for ours in a final act of loving sacrifice.In that American Cemetery, it is no accident each headstone faces west: west over the Atlantic, towards the nation they defended, the nation they loved, the nation they would never come home to.It struck me as I stood in the midst of those heroes that they look upon us in silent judgment. And that we must ask ourselves: are we worthy of their sacrifice?The truth is we are at the end of an era of failed leadership.We have been led by a divider who has sliced and diced the electorate, pitting American against American for political purposes.Six years into the so-called recovery, and our economy is barely growing. This winter, it actually got smaller.Our economic slowdown is not inevitable, it is the direct result of bad economic policy.The president's tax and regulatory policies have slammed shut the door of opportunity for the average American trying to climb the economic ladder, resigning the middle class to stagnant wages, personal debt, and deferred dreams.Weakness at home has led to weakness abroad.The world has descended into a chaos of this president's own making, while his White House loyalists construct an alternative universe where ISIS is contained and Ramadi is merely a ""setback""  where the nature of the enemy can't be acknowledged for fear of causing offense, where the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran, can be trusted to live up to a nuclear agreement.No decision has done more harm than the president's withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.Let no one be mistaken, leaders of both parties have made grave mistakes in Iraq. But in January, 2009  when Barack Obama became Commander-in-Chief  Iraq had been largely pacified.America had won the war. But our president failed to secure the peace.How callous it seems now as cities once secured with American blood are now being taken by America's enemies, all because of a campaign slogan.I saw during Vietnam a war where politicians didn't keep faith with the sacrifices and courage of America's fighting men and women, where men were ordered into combat without the full support of their civilian commanders.To see it happen again, 40 years later, because of political gamesmanship and dishonesty, is a national disgrace.But my friends, we are a resilient country. We have been through a Civil War, we've been through two world wars, we've made it through a Great Depression  we even made it through Jimmy Carter. We will make it through the Obama years.The fundamental nature of this country is our people never stay knocked down. We get back up, we dust ourselves off, and we move forward. And we will again.I want to share some important truths with my fellow Americans, starting with this truth: we don't have to settle for a world in chaos or an America that shrinks from its responsibilities.We don't have to apologize for American exceptionalism, or western values.We don't have to accept slow growth that leaves behind the middle class, and leaves millions of Americans out of work.We don't have to settle for crumbling bureaucracies that target taxpayers and harm our veterans.And we don't have to resign ourselves to debt, decay and slow growth.We have the power to make things new again. To project American strength again, to get our economy going again.And that is why today I am running for the presidency of the United States of America.It is time to create real jobs, to raise wages, to create opportunity for all. To give every citizen a stake in this country. To restore hope, real hope to forgotten Americans, millions of middle class families who have given up hope of getting ahead, millions of workers who have given up hope of finding a job.Yes, it's time for a reset, time to reset the relationship between government and citizen.Think of the arrogance of Washington, DC, representing itself as some beacon of wisdom, with policies smothering this vast land with no regard for what makes each state and community unique. That's just wrong.We need to return power to the states, and freedom to the individual.Today our citizens and entrepreneurs are burdened by over-regulation and unspeakable debt.Debt is not just a fiscal nightmare, it is a moral failure. Let me speak to the millennial generation: massive debt, passed on from our generation to yours, is a breaking of the social compact.You deserve better. I am going to offer a responsible plan to fix the entitlement system, and to stop this theft from your generation.To those forgotten Americans drowning in personal debt, working harder for wages that don't keep up with the rising cost of living, I come here today to say your voice is heard.I know you face rising health care costs, rising child care costs, skyrocketing tuition costs, and mounting student loan debt. I hear you, and I am going to do something about it.To the one in five children in families on food stamps, to the one in seven Americans living in poverty, to the one in ten workers who are unemployed, under-employed or given up hope of finding a job: I hear you, you are not forgotten.I am running to be your president.For small businesses on Main Street struggling to just get by, smothered by regulations, targeted by Dodd-Frank: I hear you, you're not forgotten. Your time is coming.The American People see a rigged game, where insiders get rich, and the middle class pays the tab.There is something wrong when the Dow is near record highs, and businesses on Main Street can't even get a loan.Since when did capitalism involve the elimination of risk for the biggest banks while regulations strangle our community banks?Capitalism is not corporatism. It is not a guarantee of reward without risk. It is not about Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.The reason I am running for president is I know for certain our country's best days lie ahead. There is nothing wrong in America today that cannot be fixed with new leadership.We are just a few good decisions away from unleashing economic growth, and reviving the American Dream.We need to fix a tax code riddled with loopholes that sends jobs overseas and punishes success.We have the highest corporate tax rate in the western world. It is time to reduce the rate, bring jobs home and lift wages for working families.By the time this Administration has finished with its experiment in big government, they will have added more than 600,000 pages of new regulations to the Federal Register.On my first day in office, I will issue an immediate freeze on all pending regulations from the Obama administration. That same day, I will send to Congress a comprehensive reform and rollback of job-killing mandates created by Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and other Obama-era policies.Agencies will have to live under strict regulatory budgets. And health insurers will have to earn the right to your money, instead of lobbying Washington to force you to hand it over.On day one, I will also sign an executive order approving the construction of the Keystone Pipeline.Energy is vital to our economy, and to our national security. On day one, I will sign an executive order authorizing the export of American natural gas and oil, freeing our European allies from dependence on Russia's energy supplies.Vladimir Putin uses energy to hold our allies hostage. If energy is going to be used as a weapon, I say America must have the largest arsenal.We will unleash an era of economic growth, and limitless opportunity. We will rebuild American industry. And we will lift wages for American workers.It can be done because it has been done in Texas.During my 14 years as governor, Texas companies created almost one-third of all new American jobs.In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. Without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.We were the engine of growth because we had a simple formula: control taxes and spending, implement smart regulations, invest in an educated workforce, and stop frivolous lawsuits.Texas now has the second highest high school graduation rate in the country and the highest graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students.We led the nation in exports, including high-tech exports. We passed historic tax relief, and I was proud to sign balanced budgets for 14 years.We not only created opportunity, we stood for law and order.When there was a crisis at our border last year and the president refused my invitation to see the challenge that we faced, I told him, ""Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will.""Because of the threat posed by drug cartels and trans-national gangs, I deployed the Texas National Guard.The policy worked. Apprehensions declined by 74 percent. If you elect me your president,I will secure this border.Homeland security begins with border security. The most basic compact between a president and the people is to keep the country safe.The great lesson of history is strength and resolve bring peace and order, and weakness and vacillation invite chaos and conflict.My very first act as president will be to rescind any agreement with Iran that legitimizes their quest to get a nuclear weapon.Now is the time for clear-sighted, proven leadership. We have seen what happens when we elect a president based on media acclaim rather than a record of accomplishment.This will be a ""show-me, don't tell me"" election, where voters look past the rhetoric to the real record.The question of every candidate will be this one: when have you led? Leadership is not a speech on the senate floor, it's not what you say, it's what you do.And we will not find the kind of leadership needed to revitalize the country by looking to the political class in Washington.I have been tested. I have led the most successful state in America. I have dealt with crisis after crisis  from the disintegration of a space shuttle, to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike, to the crisis at the border, and the first diagnosis of Ebola in America.I have brought together first responders, charities and people of faith to house and heal vulnerable citizens dealing with tragedy.The spirit of compassion demonstrated by Texans is alive all across America today. While we have experienced a deficit in leadership, among the American People there is a surplus of spirit.And among our great people, there is a spirit of selflessness  that we live to make the world better for our children, and not just ourselves.It was said that when King George the Third asked what General Washington would do upon winning the war, he was told he would return to his farm and relinquish power. To that, the monarch replied, if he did that, he would be the greatest man of his age.George Washington lived in the service of a cause greater than self.If anyone is wondering if America still possesses the character of selfless heroes, I am here to say, ""Yes, I am surrounded by such heroes.""They are of different generations, but they are woven together by the same thread of selfless sacrifice.They are heroes like Medal of Honor Recipient Mike Thornton, who survived an ambush by enemy forces in Vietnam, and made it back to the safety of a water rescue, only to find out a fellow team member had been left behind, presumed dead.He didn't leave though, he returned through enemy fire and retrieved Lieutenant Norris who was still alive  and then swam for two hours keeping his wounded teammate afloat until they were rescued.Heroes like Marcus Luttrell, who survived a savage attack on the side of a mountain in Afghanistan, losing his three teammates and 16 fellow warriors shot down trying to rescue him.He is not just the lone survivor, to Anita and me he is a second son.And Taya Kyle, who suffered the deep loss of her husband Chris, an American hero. When I think of Taya Kyle, I think of a brave woman who carries not just the lofty burden of Chris' legacy, but the grief of every family who has lost a loved one to the great tragedy of war, or its difficult aftermath. Anita and I want to thank her for her tremendous courage.America is an extraordinary country. Our greatness lies not in our government, but in our people.Each day Americans demonstrate tremendous courage. But many of those Americans have been knocked down and are looking for a second chance.Let's give them that chance. Let's give them real leadership. Let's give them a future greater than the greatest days of our past.Let's give them a president who leads us in the direction of our highest hopes, our best dreams and our greatest promise.Thank you, and God bless you."
Rick Perry,R,c,"July 2, 2015","Remarks to the National Press Club in Washington, DC","Ninety-nine years ago  on May 15, 1916  at a courthouse in Waco, Texas, a mentally disabled 17-year-old boy named Jesse Washington was convicted of raping and murdering the wife of his employer.He pled guilty and was sentenced to death. But Jesse died no ordinary death. Because he was black.After the death sentence was issued, Jesse was dragged out of the McLennan County Courthouse and into a crowd of hundreds.Thanks to the advent of a new technology called the telephone, word quickly spread as to what was about to happen, and soon 15,000 people were watching Jesse Washington be tortured, mutilated, and tied over the branch of a tree.Someone lit a fire under Jesse, and raised him up into the air.Jesse tried to climb up the chains to avoid the fire.Someone started cutting off Jesse's fingers, so he couldn't keep climbing.One man castrated him, while another used a pole to prevent Jesse from escaping the fire.A prominent local photographer took pictures of Jesse's charred remains and sold them as souvenirs, on postcards.Even today, we Texans struggle to talk about what happened to Jesse Washington. We don't want to believe that our great state could ever have been the scene of such unimaginable horror.But it is an episode in our history that we cannot ignore. It is an episode we have an obligation to transcend.We've made a lot of progress since 1916.A half-century ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to finally enshrine in law the principle that all of us  regardless of race, color, or national origin  are created equal.Shedrick Willis was a slave who, before the Civil War, had been bought and sold on the steps of the McLennan County Courthouse  the very place where Jesse Washington would later be dragged to his death.When I was governor of Texas, I had the proud distinction of appointing Willis' great-great-great-grandson, Wallace Jefferson, to be the first African-American on the Supreme Court of Texas. In 2004, I appointed Wallace to be the Supreme Court's first black Chief Justice.There are tens of thousands of stories like Wallace Jefferson's.When it comes to race, America is a better and more tolerant and more welcoming place than it has ever been. We are a country with Hispanic CEOs, and Asian billionaires, and a black President.So why is it that even today, so many black families feel left behind? Why is it that a quarter of African-Americans live below the poverty line, even after the impact of federal programs like food stamps and housing subsidies?The supplemental poverty rate for African-Americans is nearly double the rate for other Americans.Democrats have long had the opportunity to govern in African-American communities.It is time to help black families hold them accountable for the results.I am here to tell you that it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children.I am proud to live in a country with an African-American President. But President Obama cannot be proud of the fact that the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership.We cannot dismiss the historical legacy of slavery, nor its role in causing the problem of black poverty. And because slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a role for government policy in addressing their lasting effects.But the specific policies advanced by the President and his allies on the left amount to little more than throwing money at the problem and walking away.We spend 450 billion dollars a year on Medicaid, and yet health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than for those with no insurance at all. Instead of reforming Medicaid, the President expanded it under Obamacare.In the cities where the left-wing solutions have been tried over and over again  places like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore  African-Americans are moving out, and moving to cities like Dallas and Houston.As Americans we are all united by certain aspirations. We all want access to opportunity. We all want good schools for our kids. We want to live in safe neighborhoods. We want to live in cities and states where housing and college and everyday expenses are affordable. We all want to experience the American Dream.From 2005 to 2007, more African-Americans moved to Texas than any other state except Georgia. Many were coming from blue states like New York, Illinois, and California. Many came from Louisiana, where they had lost their homes due to Hurricane Katrina.But each new resident was welcomed to Texas, with open arms.They came to a state with a booming economy. We kept taxes and regulation low, and frivolous lawsuits to a minimum. And we worked hard to educate every child.Let me be clear. We haven't eliminated black poverty in Texas. But we have made meaningful progress.In New York, the supplemental poverty rate for blacks is 26 percent. In California, it's 30 percent. In Washington, D.C., it's 33 percent.In Texas, it's just 20 percent. Here's how it happened.Because we curtailed frivolous lawsuits and unreasonable regulations in Texas, it's far cheaper to do business in Dallas or Houston than in Baltimore or Detroit. And those lower costs get passed down to consumers  especially low-income consumers  in the form of lower prices.There's a lot of talk in Washington about income inequality. But there's a lot less talk about the inequality that arises from the high cost of everyday life.In blue-state coastal cities, strict zoning laws and environmental regulations have prevented builders from expanding the housing supply. That's great for the venture capitalist who wants a nice view of San Francisco Bay, but it's not so great for the single mother working two jobs in order to pay rent and still put food on the table for her kids.It's not just about how many dollars you earnthough there are plenty of opportunities to do that in Texas. It's also about how far each dollar can take you, after you've paid your taxes, and your rent, and your tuition, and your grocery bills.In too many parts of this country, black students are trapped in failing schools where union bosses look out for themselves at the expense of the kids. This matters, because kids who graduate from high school typically make 50 percent more than those who don't.In Texas, we made sure that the kids come first.Texas' high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013. Our most recent graduation rate for African-Americans was number one in the nation: 13 points higher than the national average.We also found a way to reduce crime while keeping kids out of jail. In 2014, Texas had its lowest crime rate since 1968. At the same time, we closed three prisons and reformed our sentencing laws.Too many Texans were going to prison for non-violent drug offenses. And once they got out of prison, many found they couldn't get a job because they had a criminal record.Nobody gets Texans confused as being soft on crime. I believe in consequences for criminal behavior. But I also believe in second chances and human redemptionbecause that, too, is part of the American story.Americans who suffer from an addiction need help, not moral condemnation. By treating alcohol and drug abuse as a disease, we have given Texans who have experienced a run-in with the law the help they need and the rehabilitation that many seek.And many now are living in recovery, engaged in saving the lives of others trapped in addiction.The human soul yearns to be free  free from the chains of addiction, free from the chains of poverty.I am running for President because I want to make life better for all people, even those who don't vote Republican.I know Republicans have much to do to earn the trust of African-Americans. Blacks know that Republican Barry Goldwater, in 1964, ran against Lyndon Johnson, a champion of civil rights. They know that Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, because he felt that parts of it were unconstitutional.States supporting segregation in the South cited ""states' rights"" as a justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table.As you know, I am an ardent believer in the Tenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. The Tenth Amendment says that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""I know that state governments are more accountable to you than the federal government is.But I am also an ardent believer in the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no state shall ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""There has been  and will continue to be  an important and legitimate role for the federal government in enforcing civil rights.Too often, we Republicans  myself included  have emphasized our message on the Tenth Amendment but not our message on the Fourteenth  an Amendment, it bears reminding, that was one of the first great contributions of the Republican Party to American life, second only to the abolition of slavery.For too long, we Republicans have been content to lose the black vote because we found that we could win elections without it. But when we gave up on trying to win the support of African-Americans, we lost our moral legitimacy as the party of Lincoln. As the party of equal opportunity for all.It is time for us to once again reclaim our heritage as the only party in our country founded on the principle of freedom for African-Americans.We know what Democrats will propose in 2016the same things Democrats have proposed for decades: more government spending on more government programs.And there is a proper and important role for government assistance in keeping people on their feet. But few presidents have done more to expand government assistance than President Obama.Today, we spend nearly $1 trillion a year on means-tested anti-poverty programs.And yet black poverty remains stagnant.Here is what I have seen in my time in public service: the best welfare program in America is a job.There's a fundamental reason why Democratic policies have failed to cure poverty: It's because the only true cure for poverty is a job, and Democratic policies have made it too hard for the poor to find work.Just this week, the President announced new regulations for overtime pay that will make it costlier for companies to hire full-time employees. Companies will respond to these rules by hiring fewer people, for the simple reason that money doesn't grow on trees.And so my first priority as President will be to reignite the engine of American economic growth by reforming the tax code and requiring federal agencies to adhere to a strict regulatory budget.A growing economy will give those at the bottom of the ladder more opportunities to climb, just as it has in Texas.Many poor Americans want to leave welfare and rejoin the workforce. But because of taxes and regulations, it often makes more economic sense to stay on welfare than to get a full-time job.Furthermore, federal programs impose a one-size-fits-all approach to fighting poverty. In California, someone might need more money to deal with the cost of housing. In Massachusetts, it might be the cost of vocational school.Instead, we force the poor to enroll in separate programs for housing assistance or Pell grants.If I am elected President, I will send to Congress a welfare reform bill that will take the money we already spend on non-health care-related, anti-poverty programs and split it into two parts.The first part will be an expanded and reformed version of the Earned Income Tax Credit so that anyone with a job can live above the poverty line.The second part will consist of a block grant so that states can care for their safety net populations in the manner that best serves their residents.As I mentioned earlier, one of the most important things we did in Texas while I was governor is reform our drug-related sentencing laws, so that non-violent offenders could stay out of prison. As Texans got smarter about policing and crime prevention, we came to appreciate the importance of keeping promising young people out of jail.Imagine how hard it is to get a job if you have a criminal conviction on your record.We are working to stop the inter-generational cycle of incarceration, where grandchildren meet their grandparents behind prison bars. We can reform federal sentencing laws  just as we have done at the state level  to ensure more young people have a shot at a better life. And we can do so while keeping our low-income communities safe from crime.We all know we have to improve our schools. This is an area where President Obama had potential, but he caved into the demands of labor unions.It's a fallacy to assume that the vastly different student populations across the country can be adequately educated with one-size-fits-all policies. We need to empower state lawmakers, school boards and parents to implement policies that address the specific needs of their students, and keep schools accountable and efficient.Enterprising charter school teachers, like Eva Moskowitz in New York, should be able to replicate their astounding success all over the country, without the interference of the federal government.And we have to tackle the exorbitant price of a college education. One of the biggest barriers today to entering the middle class  black or otherwise  is the high cost of a college degree.A four-year degree at the typical private college now costs more than 170,000 dollars.Compare that to the median home price in America, which is $205,000.We are literally asking poor students to mortgage their future in order to gain a college degree.This must end. In Texas, I challenged our state universities to offer a four-year college degree for less than $10,000. Many thought it would be impossible to drive tuition and fees that low. But today, 13 Texas universities have reached that target.We are on the cusp of an online revolution in higher education, but only if the federal government rolls back the rules that make it almost impossible for students to gain accredited bachelor's degrees achieved with online instruction.Furthermore, just as with college tuition, we have to reduce the cost of living for those who need every dollar to be stretched as far is it can go.Federal regulations, like Obamacare's employer mandate, drive up the cost of hiring new workers. That means that companies hire fewer people. But it also means that the price of basic consumer goods goes up.Earlier this year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimated that federal regulations cost American businesses as much as $1.88 trillion a year. That's nearly $15,000 per U.S. household. If you add in state regulations, the problem gets even worse.If we do these five things  if we create jobs, incentivize work, keep non-violent drug offenders out of prison, reform our schools, and reduce the cost of living  we will have done more for African-Americans than the last three Democratic Administrations combined.At the American Cemetery in Normandy, nine thousand three hundred and eighty-seven American soldiers are buried in orderly row upon orderly row.""If ever proof were needed that we fought for a cause and not for conquest,"" a general once said, ""it could be found in these cemeteries. Here was our only conquest: all we asked was enough soil in which to bury our gallant dead.""Some of our gallant dead were the sons of Presidents, like Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. Most were ordinary Americans, simply doing what their country asked of them. Some of the graves don't even have namesthey're simply marked: ""Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to God.""Some of the most compelling graves at Normandy are for African-Americans who served in segregated regiments, like Willie Collins of the 490th Port Battalion.Willie Collins made the ultimate sacrifice for America, despite the fact that America didn't always treat him in the way he deserved.Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Sergeant Willie Collins grew up in different circumstances. Ted's ancestors had a coat of arms. Willie's ancestors were brought here in chains.But Ted and Willie joined themselves together with a commitment that every generation of Americans has embraced: the promise of leaving America  and the world  a better place than they found it. Of ensuring a better future for the children and grandchildren of those to come.I am a beneficiary of the sacrifices of Sergeant Collins and General Roosevelt, and of so many others known but to God.I grew up in a place called Paint Creek. When I was young, we had an outhouse and mom bathed us on the front porch in a number two washtub.We attended the Paint Creek Rural School, where some of the teachers lived on campus. Their profession was literally their life, and they inspired me. I can assure you none of my teachers knew they were instructing a future Air Force captain, let alone a future governor.But they also have a motto at the Paint Creek School that summarizes the endless possibilities for its students: ""No dream too tall for a school so small.""Many people don't feel that their lives are filled with endless possibilities anymore.Americans entering adulthood today have good reason to fear that it will be harder for them to earn a living, to buy a home, to pay off their debts, than it was for their parents.But if there is one thing we can learn from Willie Collins and the millions like him  from the tragedy of Jesse Washington and the triumph of Wallace Jefferson  it's that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones we face today.Willie Collins died in the belief that America could become a better country than the one he left home to serve. And he was right.It's up to us to be worthy of the country that Willie Collins' generation gave us. It's up to us to leave our country better off than we found it.America has never been perfect. No country composed of imperfect beings ever could be.But there is no country that has achieved more than the United States of America.With new leadership and durable reforms, America can be stronger and more prosperous than it has ever been.America can be that exceptional place, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we all have an equal opportunity to build a better life for ourselves and our children and their children.Thank youand may God bless America."
Rick Perry,R,c,"July 22, 2015","Remarks at the Opportunity and Freedom PAC Forum in Washington, DC: ""Defending Conservatism Against the Cancer of Trump-ism""","Thank you. The next president will face serious issues that demand serious leadership.Because of the failed foreign policy of the Obama Administration, our 45th president will have to deal with an emboldened Iran that will have renewed access to hundreds of billions of dollars that even the Obama Administration acknowledges can be used to fund terrorism.This, combined with an agreement that amounts to nuclear appeasement, promises a major realignment in the Middle East at the expense of our Arab allies and Israel. And it will surely lead to the development of a Sunni bomb.The challenges in the Middle East extend beyond Iran.Despite White House declarations, ISIS continues to expand its territory. The atrocities continue. They have become so normal they no longer make the front page. It's a sad commentary on the state of the world.Syria remains a complicated war zone, led by a brutal dictator that our president said must go several years ago. He is still there, after crossing a red line attacking his own people with chemical weapons.And his nation is also a hotbed for jihadist recruitment.The mistakes of a few years ago leave few good options for the next president.Russian aggression has been met with strong words, but again feeble action. Putin has annexed Crimea, and invaded the mainland of Ukraine. And we have yet to even provide lethal weapons to those fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and democracy.Mr. Putin has become the greatest threat to peace and order in Europe and parts of Asia as the message has gotten out that the American Administration speaks loudly, but is loath to use a big stick.China is threatening its neighbors, stealing our secrets, and violating trade agreements.In the face of all these threats, we are now on course to have the smallest military since June of 1940. The hollowing out of our military forces is an invitation for our enemies to test us.Gathering threats abroad are matched by storm clouds at home.The recovery is anemic, leaving millions of workers uncounted in the unemployment rate. One in ten workers are unemployed, under-employed or too discouraged to search for a job. One in seven Americans live in poverty, including more than one quarter of our African-American population that has suffered for decades under Democratic policies that lead to failed schools, few opportunities, and lives lost to poverty or crime.Our debt is at historic levels. President Obama is on course to racking up as much debt as his 43 predecessors combined.Our border is under siege, our infrastructure is aging, our entitlement programs are in fiscal jeopardy.These are, indeed, troubling times.Yet America has faced worse. And America has been blessed for more than 200 years with magnanimous leadership in the presidency, individuals who were raised beyond their personal limitations to steer the nation through war, depression and disaster to a better future for all Americans.Each one of these leaders have been repairers of the breach, such as Lincoln who  at the height of the Civil War  insisted on the completion of the Capitol Dome. He meant the world to know our Union endured. And showed it in acts small and large.Here was a president who ordered hundreds of thousands of men to war, and ultimately, to their deaths.And yet, once he had won the war and freed the slaves, after so much blood had been spilled, he set out to bind the wounds of the nation, declaring ""malice toward none, with charity for all.""Lincoln was a healing force who rose above great differences to preserve our union. He was a repairer of the breach.When King George the 3rd inquired what George Washington would do upon winning the war, he was told he would return to his Virginia farm.To which the king responded, ""if he were to do so, he would be the greatest man of his age.""Thousands of years of history had informed the world that to the victor go the spoils, that conquering heroes seize power, and reign with impunity. But George Washington reluctantly accepted the presidency, only after the Constitution had been written, guaranteeing power to the people.And because of his humility  because he never wavered from his revolutionary principles  ours was the first nation to be founded on an idea: that all ""are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""Even great antagonists, like Adams and Jefferson, in later life were able to put differences aside, exchanging letters until the day they both died.It was Adams who wrote a prayer about the presidency to his wife Abigail, saying, ""May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.""Ulysses S. Grant  the head of the Union Army, our president from 1868 to 1876 who had led a great many into battle  would come to symbolize the healing of our nation campaigning under the banner, ""let us have peace.""At his funeral the pallbearers would include two Union generals, and two Confederate generals, Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph Johnston.In more recent years we were blessed to have in the Oval Office the quiet strength of Harry Truman, the leadership of the Supreme Commander Dwight David Eisenhower, the inspiration of John F Kennedy, the vision and resolve of Ronald Reagan.During the second World War, FDR sought the power of God to preserve the nation and protect our people.These were all fallible men. But they were great men. And they all possessed a goodness and decency that allowed them to rise above the petty, the personal and the partisan for the good of the nation.The White House has been occupied by giants. But from time to time it is sought by the small-minded  divisive figures propelled by anger, and appealing to the worst instincts in the human condition.In times of trouble, there are two types of leaders: repairers of the breach and sowers of discord.The sower of discord foments agitation, thrives on division, scapegoats certain elements of society, and offers empty platitudes and promises. He is without substance when one scratches below the surface.He offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as Trumpism: a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued.Let no one be mistaken  Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.It cannot be pacified or ignored, for it will destroy a set of principles that has lifted more people out of poverty than any force in the history of the civilized world  the cause of conservatism.I feel so strongly about this because I believe conservatism is the only way forward for this country.We have tried the policies of the progressive left for the last six and a half years. The Democratic candidates for president could offer them for the next eight.Their failures are self-evident. We have never spent more money on welfare in the history of our nation, with few results to show for it.One in five children now live in families on food stamps. This is not a success of the Obama recovery, but the evidence of its failure. Millions have stopped looking for work, and are uncounted in the unemployment rate. Over-regulation has frozen access to credit from community banks,harming small businesses. ObamaCare has decreased healthcare choices, and premiums have skyrocketed.And for all the liberals' talk about income inequality, the fact is their own policies of over-regulation make the cost of living exorbitant for single moms and small business owners in blue states like California and New York.They have mastered the politics of grievance, when in reality Americans are the victim of their policies that caused the housing crash, that have produced the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, that have caused a precipitous increase in the cost of college tuition.The Democrats see the problems of their own party's making and offer to double down on them.Now Senator Sanders says college tuition should be ""free."" But as we know, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Forcing taxpayers to hand more of their money over to colleges will only incentivize those colleges to raise their prices even further.Secretary Clinton is now talking about profit-sharing. I believe in profit-sharing.Many of America's best companies, like Whole Foods and Apple to name just two, use profit sharing and stock options to reward their workers.But history shows that when government gets involved, there are fewer profits to be shared.Indeed, Mrs. Clinton would pay for her unwieldy, bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all plan by raising taxes on businesses, directly reducing their profits, leaving them with less ability to raise workers' salaries and invest in the future.American workers aren't looking to get something for nothing. They want to make an honest wage. They want a shot at a good job. And big government won't give it to them.That fair shot can only come from free people, and free markets, and the free market incentive known as the profit motive.Conservatism can lead us out of the Valley of Economic Ruin.It places faith in individuals, not government.It restores personal freedom instead of restricting it.It lets business owners and families keep more of what they make, so they can invest it in the economy and create jobs.I believe in a conservatism that empowers people to make the most of their lives rather than government that makes a mess of their lives.We have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Lower it. This will bring jobs and investment back home from overseas.Democrats want to punish businesses for making the rational choice to locate their offices and factories in countries with lower taxes. Instead, we should reform our tax code to attract those companiesand many othersto our shores.We have had six and a half years of government growth. We need a policy of economic growth.We need to realize the best welfare program is a job. That welfare benefits are a means to an end, not an end. That the best welfare programs give people the tools of self-sufficiency.We need to stop pretending that we can throw money at our inner cities and hope it solves their problems.Rather than providing people incentives to stay on welfare, we need to expand on ideas like the Earned Income Tax Credit to build a bridge to the high-paying jobs of the future.We need to end regulations that lead to high-cost housing, that keep single moms living hand-to-mouth with no hope of getting ahead.We need to bring regulatory relief to small businesses that are being punished by Dodd-Frank. Financial regulations are killing Main Street rather than cleaning up Wall Street.We need to expand energy production to create jobs, and end the ban on foreign exports. Thanks to President Obama, Iran will soon have the ability to export its oil, while America is barred from doing the same.Carter era policies didn't work when he was president, they certainly won't work now!If we bring jobs and investment back home and invest in American energy, we will realize a manufacturing renaissance.Common sense, conservative economics can lead to removing barriers to trade, job creation and opportunity. They can be implemented without harming our environment.It is time we get about the business of unleashing growth in America again.Under all this lies a main premise: I trust American workers, American entrepreneurs, to do what's best for their lives and for the public interest more than I trust government.I am an optimist. I have faith in our people.Liberals don't.They profess faith in government because they look down upon the individual. But you can't raise people up by talking down to them.And if someone is not equipped to govern their own affairs, surely a colossal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., is no better positioned to do so.We need to replace over-regulation with smart regulation. We need to overhaul the welfare state to create greater independence. We need to create incentives in the tax code for productivity and job creation, rather than for corruption and favoritism and the outsourcing of millions of jobs overseas.I believe in America.I believe in our people.I believe we can out-compete, out-produce the workers of any nation.I believe each of you can make better decisions for yourselves and your families than government.I believe in personal freedom over bureaucratic fiat.The era of the liberal nanny state must end.But it cannot be replaced by reactionary politics founded on division.We will be no better off with a Republican divider in the White House than the current Democrat divider in the White House.Donald Trump the reality television star is a great generator of ratings. But Donald Trump the candidate is a sower of division, wrongly demonizing Mexican-Americans for political sport.It is wrong to paint with a broad brush Hispanic men and women in this country who have fought and died for freedom from the Alamo to Afghanistan. He scapegoats Hispanics to appeal to our worst instincts, when we need a president who appeals to our best.This is not new in America.In the 1840's the ""Know Nothings"" emerged as a political movement, scapegoating Irish and German immigrants for the problems of the nation.They were obsessively anti-Catholic, so much so that when the Pope sent marble for the building of the Washington Monument, they smashed it to pieces and helped delay its construction for 35 years.These people built nothing, created nothing. They existed to cast blame and tear down certain institutions. To give outlet to anger.Donald Trump is the modern-day incarnation of the know-nothing movement.He espouses nativism, not conservatism. He is negative when conservatism is inherently optimistic.He would divide us along bloodlines, when conservatives believe our policies will work for people of all backgrounds.He has piqued the interest of some Republican voters who have legitimate concerns about a porous border and broken immigration system. But instead of offering those voters leadership or solutions, he has offered fear and soundbites. This cannot stand.Conservatism doesn't foment agitation through identity politics. That's what Democrats do. But as a supporter of socialized medicine, the stimulus package and Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump is quite suited to follow the Democrats' example.I, for one, will not be silent when a candidate for the high office of president runs under the Republican banner by targeting millions of Hispanics, and our veterans, with mean-spirited vitriol.I will not go quiet when this cancer on conservatism threatens to metastasize into a movement of mean-spirited politics that will send the Republican Party to the same place it sent the Whig Party in 1854: the graveyard.As a veteran, I took offense to his attack on Senator McCain, and I found lacking his defense that he spent a lot of money on veterans' parades.Donald Trump was born into privilege. He received deferments to avoid service in Vietnam. He breathes the free air thousands of heroes died protecting. And he couldn't have endured for five minutes what John McCain endured for five and a half years.Think what you want about Senator McCain's politics, but let no one question his service to our country.Here was a man offered the chance to go home. He refused, knowing it could cost him his life. There was no way he would leave before any man captured before him. This is the embodiment of duty, honor, country. Mr. Trump does not know the meaning of those words.But most telling to me is not Mr. Trump's bombast, his refusal to show any remorse for his comments about Senator McCain, but his admission that there is not a single time in his life that he sought the forgiveness of God.A man too arrogant, too self-absorbed, to seek God's forgiveness is precisely the type of leader John Adams prayed would never occupy the White House.Adams, Lincoln, FDR  they all went before God on bended knee. They all held this office of great power with humility.When a candidate under the Republican banner would abandon the tradition of magnanimous leadership of the presidency, when he would seek to demonize millions of citizens, when he would stoop to attack POWs for being captured, I can only ask as Senator Welch did of Senator McCarthy, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir?""My fellow Republicans, beware of false prophets. Do not let itching ears be tickled by messengers who appeal to anger, division and resentment.Resentment is the poison we swallow that we hope harms another. My fellow Republicans, don't take the poison.Scripture tells us ""a house divided against itself cannot stand.""The candidate who wins the Republican nomination for president will articulate the best vision of ""a house united.""It will be based on a conservatism that works, that appeals to our better angels, that believes in the power of individuals, through hard work and thrift, to improve our lives.We need a president who rises above personal grievances, petty differences, raw partisan politics. Who puts the nation first, who inspires Americans to believe again and produce again and dream again.We must move past the empty calories of Trumpism, and return to conservatism.Ronald Reagan put it best when discussing the stakes of the election in 1964. He said, ""This is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.""We shall not abandon the Revolution.We shall not give up on the animating idea of our Republic  a nation founded on the principle of ""government of the people, by the people, for the people.""There is nothing wrong in America that cannot be fixed with the right leadership.We need leadership that repairs the breach in America, that brings the country together, that sets our sights on greatness after a long period of pettiness.Let's get on with the business of building that America. Thank you."
Rick Perry,R,c,"July 29, 2015",Remarks in New York City on Reforming Wall Street,"Two hundred and twenty-three years ago, twenty-four businessmen gathered under a buttonwood tree four miles south of here and signed an agreement to the following effect: ""We the Subscribers, Brokers for the Purchase and Sale of the Public Stock do hereby solemnly promise and pledge ourselves to each other, that we will not buy or sell from this day for any person whatsoever any kind of Public Stock at a less rate than one quarter percent Commission""It was signed on May 17th, 1792, one of the most consequential days in U.S. history: the founding of the New York Stock Exchange.So much of what has made America the most prosperous country in the world is a result of what those 24 men signed under that tree outside of 68 Wall Street. It was also on Wall Street that George Washington took the oath of office as our first President. And it was on Wall Street that the Bill of Rights was proposed by the first United States Congress.But for a century or more, Wall Street has been famous for one thing: its role as the financial engine of the world's economy. It has funded entrepreneurs, homeowners, and the world's great innovators.However, Wall Street's reputation isn't what it once was.After the bailouts of 2008, Americans came to believe that Wall Street is out for itself. That the game is rigged. That the wealthy and the well-connected have insurmountable advantages over average Americans who simply work hard and play by the rules.At a time when average Americans have experienced stagnant wages for a quarter century  while dealing with the rising costs of health care, child care, college tuition and consumer goods  distrust with Wall Street, as well as Washington, is probably greater than any time in the modern era.And for good reason: most Americans see a special political class that spends large sums of money to wield influence, to protect entrenched interests, to advocate for special favors at the expense of taxpayers and the general public.This kind of cronyism has transformed capitalism into corporatism, where profit is secured without risk. Where government officials reward cronies in pet industries, forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab for companies like Solyndra, or quasi-public entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Wall Street should not be let off the hook for its bad behavior. Banks made a lot of mistakes regarding risk management leading up to the crisis. Some financiers intentionally misled investors and customers. They pushed people into deceptive financial products.This is wrong. But instead of them being punished, it was average Americans who paid a tremendous price.To be quite frank, they were screwed.They were not bailed out. They lost jobs, homes and savings. And they have every right to still be angry about it.But I am tired of politicians bashing Wall Street while ignoring the sins of Washington, D.C.It was Washington regulators who fell asleep at the switch. It was Washington politicians who changed laws that created the housing crisis.The roots of the financial crisis can be traced to the 1990s. President Clinton's goal was to add another 8 million people to the ranks of homeowners. He sought to achieve this goal by forcing the two federally-backed mortgage giants  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to increase from 30 percent to 42 percent the share of mortgages they sponsored from low- and moderate-income borrowers.In 2000, Clinton increased the share requirement yet again, to 50 percent.In a speech on his housing policies, President Clinton said: ""Our home ownership strategy will not cost the taxpayers one extra cent. It will not require legislation. It will not add more federal programs or grow federal bureaucracy.""It reminds me of the promise, ""if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.""The truth of the matter is many Republicans were for these changes too. In fact, Under the Bush Administration in 2008, Washington told Fannie and Freddie they wanted 56 percent of loans to go to low- and moderate-income borrowers. So it is fair to say there was bipartisan support for Fannie, Freddie and private mortgage lenders eroding their lending standards in order to meet the Clinton-era requirements.This set in motion catastrophic events. Lower-income Americans started taking out mortgages that, in many cases, they couldn't really afford. And upper-income Americans started taking advantage of the relaxed standards to buy even larger homes than the ones they already had.Prior to 1992, nearly all mortgages held by Fannie and Freddie had been purchased by Americans with good credit, who had paid at least 10-20 percent down  what bankers call prime mortgages.But by 2008, half of the mortgages in the country  31 million of them  failed to meet the prime standard, thanks to the new Clinton regulations. And three-quarters of those non-prime mortgages were held by government agencies or government-backed entities like Fannie Mae.Not only were Americans buying homes with little or no money down, but they had no documentation of their income or assets. The banks looked away. The regulators looked away. Everyone pretended the good times would never end.When some people warned that danger was afoot, Democrats Chris Dodd and Barney Frank blocked reforms to the federal mortgage system.Said Congressman Frank, ""I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing.""Looks like Congressman Frank rolled snake-eyes.As Americans began to borrow more money to buy bigger houses, demand went up and prices went up. A whole ecosystem of lobbyists emerged to block reform, and ensure that the party could go on. People started saying that housing prices would never go down again. And then the music stopped.During the good times of the '90's, seeds were sown that would do great harm to the middle class in America.If Secretary Clinton wants to take credit for the ""Clinton economy,"" then she must defend the destructive homeownership policies advocated by her husband that pushed shoddy loans to people who couldn't afford them, and the economic chaos that followed.Once the smoke cleared, Congress misdiagnosed the problem, passed the wrong remedy, and actually made things worse. In 2010, Chris Dodd and Barney Frank wrote a new bill that bears their name.In the five years since President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law, Fannie and Freddie have been backing even more mortgages than they did before.During the housing bubble, taxpayers backed around 50 percent of all American mortgages. Today, they back around 60 percent of them. Thanks to Dodd-Frank's blizzard of new regulations, it has become extremely difficult for investors to set up new funds. And the law's so-called ""Volcker Rule"" which is supposed to prevent banks from making risky bets, has become so cumbersome that banks can't adequately manage their balance sheets.It's everyday Americans who are paying the highest price for it. Credit card and checking account fees have gone up. Nearly one million people were shut out of mainstream banking from 2009 to 2011. So instead, many turned to riskier forms of credit, such as payday loans, as lenders of last resort.Over 1,300 community banks have closed, making life for small businesses much more difficult. Yet the big banks are bigger than ever. Three decades ago, the six largest U.S. banks held assets amounting to 14 percent of our GDP. Today, it's 61 percent.If you thought the financial crisis of 2008 was bad, wait until the next serious economic downturn.The fact is the Obama Administration is pursuing some of the same reckless policies that caused the housing crash of 2007 and 2008. Fannie and Freddie are still pushing relaxed credit standards, and down payments on homes that are too low.The next crash is on the horizon, and the question is: have we learned anything from the last one?That's why, today, I am proposing a new agenda for Wall Street reform, one that will do far more than Dodd-Frank to end the era of bailouts and cronyism.If we want to truly end ""too big to fail,"" we need to restore market forces to banking, where failure is not rewarded or bailed out.I want to be very clear: if I am elected president of the United States, we will not bail out a single bank on Wall Street.Concentrating assets in the hands of a few giant banking institutions is a recipe for massive bailouts. Systemically important banks can borrow money at lower rates, giving them a substantial competitive advantage, because investors know those banks will be bailed out in the future. It has to stop.We have to level the playing field between small banks and big ones. Second, we have to put forward smart regulations that make it less likely that the banks of the future will fail.I don't always agree with the Federal Reserve, but last week they announced the final version of a new rule that points us in a promising new direction.The Fed examined America's eight largest banks  the Global Systemically Important Banks, or G-SIBs  and the Fed required them to harbor additional capital requirements: financial cushions in case of another downturn.What's smart about this new rule is that it uses a formula to ensure that bigger and more complex banks must maintain larger capital cushions. In that way, the Fed has reduced, but not eliminated, the risk that these banks will someday fail again.The Federal Reserve and Congress should consider strengthening this rule, to help assure American taxpayers that they won't be on the hook for trillion-dollar bailouts in the future.Let me say a few more words about the Federal Reserve.I mentioned the role of Washington politicians and Wall Street financiers in the financial crisis of 2008. But it bears noting the Fed shares part of the burden too. They kept interest rates too low for too long. They created the conditions for the housing bubble that crashed in 2007 and 2008. And they are creating those conditions again.We must have steady, reliable currency. We must have a predictable money supply. And we must have market-based rules that make the Fed transparent and understandable to everyone.We also need smarter regulations than the Volcker Rule. We could once again require banks to separate their traditional commercial lending and investment banking and related practices. Alternatively, these large, one-stop-shop banks could be required to hold a significant, additional capital cushion for their trading activities.Who knows? Those banks' shareholders just might convince them to break up into smaller units on their own, in order to unlock the value of their distinct parts.We should replace Dodd-Frank's so-called ""orderly liquidation authority"" with a true, orderly bankruptcy process, so that banks of any size can fail. Small banks can be closed by the FDIC in a weekend. A reformed bankruptcy code for big banks can help make bailouts obsolete. In 2012, scholars at the Hoover Institution proposed adding a new Chapter 14 to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with this express purpose in mind.We should create regulatory breathing room for banking with digital currencies, like Bitcoin. Digital currencies harbor the possibility of reducing the cost and improving the quality of financial transactions in much the same way that the conventional internet has done for consumer goods and services.We have to free up credit for small businesses on Main Street in order to truly revive our economy. I once served on a community bank board in the small town of Haskell, Texas. I can assure you that its capital was vital to the prospects of Main Street businesses.Dodd-Frank took aim at Wall Street and ended up harming Main Street. And today, community banks are spending more time and money on legal compliance than ever before. We should exempt community banks, banks run as partnerships, and asset management firms from Dodd-Frank's onerous and excessive regulations.And let me say a word about one of Dodd-Frank's least accountable new agencies: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's run by a sole director and can spend whatever the Federal Reserve wants it to spend, without Congressional review.The regulations imposed by the CFPB haven't protected consumers, they've made credit cards and checking accounts more expensive. They've also made it harder for community banks to compete and stay in business.At a minimum, we need to reform the CFPB so that its leadership and funding are accountable to Congress. We also need to put the CFPB under a strict regulatory budget, so that it doesn't do more damage to consumers than it already has.Lastly, Congress should wind down Fannie and Freddie. In the meantime, the two mortgage giants should maintain strict capital cushions, just like the big banks, and we should phase in a requirement that all loans that they sponsor are accompanied by higher, more responsible down payments.And let me be clear: if we want a vibrant home lending market in America, we need to stop the trend of pushing more and more home loans to Fannie and Freddie and start rejuvenating the private insurance market again.Before I move off of financial reform and talk about the economy more broadly, I want to discuss why Texas largely escaped the housing crash of 2007 and 2008.To put it simply, no one running for President has a stronger economic record than I do. The proof is in Texas' performance after the Great Recession.From December 2007 to December 2014, Texas added 1.5 million jobs. The rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs over that same time period. We did this by keeping our taxes low, and our regulations and frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, and by educating our kids.And significantly, Texas didn't have a housing crash like the ones they faced in Florida and Nevada. One analyst recently estimated that more than a third of Florida's job growth, under Jeb Bush's administration, was due to the housing bubble.During the Great Recession, the national house price index fell by 20 percent. In Texas, it fell by less than one percent. In 2011, 27 percent of all first mortgages in America were underwater. In Texas, only 7 percent were. Among non-prime borrowers, 54 percent of mortgages were underwater across the country, compared to only 10 percent in Texas.Part of the reason for our success is that Texas has flexible zoning laws and land use regulations. Our cities have been able to expand the supply of housing along with their expanding population.But there's another thing we have in Texas that the rest of the country could learn from: we regulate, in an intelligent way, the use of a type of mortgage called ""cash-out refinancing.""During the housing bubble, in most parts of the country, American homeowners could take advantage of an increase in the value of their home to refinance their mortgage and take cash out, as if their house was their own ATM.For many Americans, this was a great financial resource. But for some, it was a way to borrow and spend even more than they otherwise would have. Where cash-out refis were common, the housing bubble got worse.The problem was that when the bubble burst, homeowners who had done cash-out refis at the peak were suddenly underwater with their loans, and many went into default.In Texas, we've been regulating cash-out refis since our great state joined the Union. Today, we limit the amount of cash you can take out of your home to 80 percent of its value.This simple rule protected Texas from the worst of the housing crisis. We can stabilize the housing market across America, if Fannie and Freddie are required to hold their loans to the same standard.If we do these things  if we end too big to fail, and stabilize our housing markets  we will have come a long way in restoring Americans' faith in the ability of the free market economy to work for them.But what's most important, for both Main Street and Wall Street, is that we get our economy back on track.There is nothing wrong in America today that can't be fixed with new leadership. We're just a few good decisions away from unleashing tremendous growth.But there is a major battle concerning the right economic policy for America.Democrats have a 1915 view of the 2015 economy.The problem is they are building a toll bridge to the 21st Century, with higher health care costs for employers, a higher cost of living for single moms in blue states because of their land use policies.Now Hillary Clinton wants to raise capital gains taxes.She thought it was a bad idea in 2008. Her husband cut capital gains in the 90's. But now that she is a proponent of Warrenism, she is for taxing capital gains, which is already double-taxation on Americans.And here is where Democrats are blind to the effects of their policies: Secretary Clinton's plan won't do much harm to rich people who can offshore jobs, capital and investment, but it will harm average Americans, who can't hire an army of accountants to lower their tax burden.When you kill ""risk capital"" you kill economic growth. And economic growth is the only solution to stagnant wages.The answer to the failed Obama-Clinton policies is not to raise taxes more. It is not to amp up the regulatory state. It is not to protest the innovation economy and companies like Uber because of antiquated views on labor.The answer is growth.Growth is the key to funding education. Growth is the key to funding health care. Growth is the key to reducing poverty. And growth is the key to investing in our military, and stopping the march of tyrants and terrorists around the globe.If we set our sights on four percent growth or higher, instead of the two percent growth of the Obama years, we can solve a whole host of challenges in America.To get there, we need to stop taxing businesses at a higher rate than any country in the Western world. We need to significantly lower corporate rates to bring jobs and investment back on shore, and to lift wages for workers.We need to dramatically cut taxes for businesses of all sizes. And we need to cut taxes on individuals and families.It's wrong that Americans have to work two jobs just to afford the increased premiums posed by ObamaCare, the increased housing prices spiked by big city, liberal mayors, or the increased tuition charged by Ivory Tower elites.And as America emerges as the leading energy power of the 21st century, we must legalize the export of our oil and natural gas.Thanks to President Obama, Iran will soon be able to export its energy. Maybe it is time he allowed America to do the same.If you elect me president, I will reform Wall Street and I will reform Washington.We have a lot of Washington insiders running for President. But I will suggest true change can only come in the form of an outsider, with the leadership of a governor who was not one vote out of 100, but one out of one when a bill came to his desk.We need someone not beholden to Washington interests and megabanks to lead the country and change the culture.As someone who grew up on the prairies of West Texas, I know that the common sense of Main Street can help make Wall Street work again for all Americans, not just the well-connected few.It can be done. It will be done.If there is one thing we can learn from the 24 visionaries who met at the Buttonwood Tree, and from those who lived through the American Revolution and the Civil War and the Great Depression, it's that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones we face today.America can still be that exceptional country, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we all have an equal opportunity to build a better life for ourselves, our children and our children's children.Thank youand may God bless you."
Rick Perry,R,c,"September 11, 2015","Remarks to the Eagle Forum in St. Louis, Missouri Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities","Thank you. It is such an honor to speak to the patriots of Eagle Forum. In case you didn't know, we have a pretty vibrant chapter in Texas. They have long lived up to the standard set by your outstanding founder, whom I am proud to recognize today, Phyllis Schlafly.I also want to say a word about the gentleman who is taking over for Phyllis. Ed Martin is a good man  a great leader  a movement conservative who leads by conviction. I am glad to be in his home state of Missouri.46 years ago I spent a summer in Festus, Missouri. I went door to door, selling Bibles. It was then that I learned what it was like to remain optimistic in the face of rejection, especially when I knew the power of the message I was selling.It was good preparation for life in politics.For me, this life has been a dream.I came from a place called Paint Creek. Too small to be called a town, too remote to be found on a map, it was the center of my universe.We had an outhouse, and mom bathed us in a number two washtub on the porch. We farmed vast fields of cotton, and attended the Paint Creek Rural School. I was a six-man football player, a proud member of Boy Scout Troop 48, and an Eagle Scout.I experienced the bonds of family, the power of community, the meaning of faith. And I learned the high calling we have as Americans to protect freedom.It was for freedom that I wore the uniform of the United States Air Force. I flew C-130 aircraft all across the globe. I lived in places like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. I learned how special it is to be an American.Later I would become a state representative, ag commissioner, lieutenant governor, and eventually governor of the world's 12th largest economy.I would truly live the motto of the Paint Creek Rural School: ""no dream to tall for a school so small.""I continue to draw inspiration from a trip I took with my father fifteen years ago.Dad and I went back to his old air base in England for his first visit in 55 years. Then we crossed the channel and visited the American cemetery that overlooks the bluffs at Omaha beach. That flight across the channel he had taken 35 times previously, as a tailgunner on a B-17.On that peaceful, wind-swept setting, there lie 9,000 graves, including 45 pairs of brothers, 33 of whom are buried side by side, a father and a son, two sons of a president. They all traded their future for ours in a final act of loving sacrifice.In that American Cemetery, it is no accident each headstone faces west: west over the Atlantic, towards the nation they defended, the nation they loved, the nation they would never come home to.It struck me as I stood in the midst of those heroes that they look upon us in silent judgment. And that we must ask ourselves: are we worthy of their sacrifice?The truth is we are at the end of an era of failed leadership.We have been led by a divider who has sliced and diced the electorate, pitting American against American for political purposes. We are a country more divided by race, income, religion and party than when he entered office.His lofty words were no match for the reality of the world.How long ago it seems now the speeches before fawning millions in Europe, in front of Roman columns in Denver. We were told America needed to improve its reputation abroad. Now we are neither liked nor respected.That's what happens when a president governs based on popular acclamation, instead of based on enduring American values.We have isolated our allies, and emboldened our adversaries.ISIS has ripped a swath through the Middle East as large as Great Britain. It could have been prevented. But a nave campaign promise took priority over stability, and even the blood shed by American heroes. Today, the president remains in denial about the weakness that led to their emergence, and even the nature of the threat. With political correctness expected of a Harvard professor, he refuses to admit we are at war with radical Islam. Mr. President, we are at war with radical Islam.Nave policies gave us the Iranian nuclear deal  an agreement that fuels Iran's nuclear ambitions rather than prohibiting them. A president who boldly claimed it was his goal to rid the world of nuclear weapons will have a legacy of nuclear proliferation. All because he places his trust in a regime that is the leading sponsor of state terrorism, in the word of radicals, in inspections that can be easily manipulated.My friends, this is not the America I know.Neither is a domestic economy that settles for two percent growth, and neither is a president who ignores the Constitution and issues executive orders to make law.Washington needs to return to doing its constitutional duty: standing up a strong military, implementing foreign policy from a policy of strength, not weakness, and securing the border with Mexico. And they need to get out of the education business, get out of the healthcare business, and stop utilizing EPA zealots to shut down small business.Washington is not the fount of all wisdom. The best ideas come from the states.Liberal Justice Lewis Brandeis once said, ""that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.""Each state should chart its own course, whether it is Governor Haley fighting the unions to bring Boeing and Michelin to South Carolina, or Bobby Jindal standing up for school choice. I support the right of states to be wrong, like Colorado legalizing pot. I would rather one state get it wrong than the whole country.Today Washington has discarded the Tenth Amendment, centralizing power while failing to meet the test of leadership.Our present-day leaders would have us settle for low expectations, low growth, record numbers out of the workforce. To them, two percent growth is the new norm. They want us to embrace their vision of mediocrity. I, for one, will not.As Americans we have the power to make the world new again.But let me issue a couple warnings. First, the answer to a president nominated for soaring rhetoric and no record is not to nominate a candidate whose rhetoric speaks louder than his record. It is not to replicate the Democrat model of selecting a president, falling for the cult of personality over durable life qualities.Only in Washington do they define fighting as filibustering, leading as debating.Where I come from, talk is cheap. And leadership is not what you say, but what you do.Missouri is the ""show me state"", and this must be a ""show me, don't tell me"" election, where we get beyond the rhetoric to the record to see who has been tested, who has led and who can be expected to stand in the face of fire.And for the record, if a candidate can't take tough questions from a reporter, how will they deal with the president of Russia, the leaders of China or the fanatics in Iran?My second warning is this: we cannot indulge nativist appeals that divide the nation further. The answer to our current divider-in-chief is not to elect a Republican divider-in-chief.Conservatism is inherently optimistic. It celebrates the power of the individual, it believes in free markets over state-controlled solutions. It knows free individuals can govern their own lives better than centralized government.Progressives think we need to protect the people from themselves. Conservatives think we need to protect the people from government.We have had too much government  too many government answers, too much government meddling  all at the expense of individual freedom.We need to get back to the central constitutional principle that, in America it is the content of your character that matters, not the color of your skin  that it doesn't matter where you come from, but where you are going. In an America blind to color, that champions the individual, that recognizes merit, there is no room for debate that denigrates certain people based on their heritage or origin.We can secure the border and reform our immigration system without inflammatory rhetoric, without base appeals that divide us based on race, culture and creed.Let me be crystal clear: for those of us in Christ, our citizenship is first and foremost in God's kingdom, our brothers and sisters are those made in the image of God, and our obligation  after loving God with all our heart, mind and soul  is to love our neighbors as ourselves, regardless of where they come from.Demeaning people of Hispanic heritage is not just ignorant, it betrays the example of Christ. We can enforce our laws and our borders, and we can love all who live within our borders, without betraying our values.It is time to elevate our debate from divisive name-calling, from soundbites without solutions, and start discussing how we will make the country better for all if a conservative is elected president.And let me say, I know something about enacting conservative principles. We have done it in Texas.During my 14 years as governor, Texas created nearly one-third of all new American jobs. We passed balanced budgets, cut taxes, set aside billions of dollars for a rainy day, and elevated our graduation rates to second highest in the nation.We did this based on conservative principles: Don't tax too much, don't spend all the money, invest in an educated workforce, and stop frivolous lawsuits at the courthouse.It can be done, all across America, with the right leadership.2016 is the most important election of our lifetime. I know we say this every election, but this time it is actually true. It is true because we have had six and a half years of an expanding welfare state, and a contracting freedom state.There are two visions for America: the government-run welfare state of Washington, New York and California, and the limited government freedom state pioneered in places like Texas.The centralized state offers more regulations, and less freedom. A world where everything costs more, from college tuition, to the cost of housing, to the price of government.Their answer to our current economic mess is more government solutions, more tax dollars placed in the hands of bureaucrats, more redistribution schemes, and a shrinking pie for the middle class.As Margaret Thatcher once said, ""the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.""But it doesn't have to be that way. With the right nominee, we can cut taxes on corporations and individuals, unleash growth, create jobs, and lift wages. We can create opportunity by drilling for American energy and selling it around the world.We can restore our reputation abroad by reasserting our moral authority, by standing with allies like Israel, and standing up to adversaries like Iran.We can be the America we know in our hearts we are meant to be  a nation of ideas and innovations, a place where freedom flourishes, that special land that the heroes of Normandy died to defend.Conservative principles applied consistently will make life better for all, but especially minority Americans. More African-Americans are living in poverty since President Obama took office. That's because he offers them government programs, instead of creating new incentives for people to work.We can improve life for minority Americans. The formula is simple: stop politically correct regulation policies that make housing so expensive for single moms, let low and middle-income Americans keep more of what they make, challenge all kids to exceed in school.We did that in Texas, and now we have the highest graduation rate for minority students.For me, the message has always been greater than the man. The conservative movement has always been about principles, not personalities. Our nominee should embody those principles. He  or she  must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity.I still believe in the power of that message  a message that offers hope, redemption and solace in the midst of storms.When I gave my life to Christ, I said, ""your ways are greater than my ways. Your will superior to mine.""Today I submit that His will remains a mystery, but some things have become clear.That is why today I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States.We have a tremendous field  the best in a generation  so I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, the cause of conservatism will be too.I share this news with no regrets. It has been a privilege and an honor to travel this country, to speak with the American people about their hopes and dreams, to see a sense of optimism prevalent despite a season of cynical politics.And as I approach the next chapter in life, I do so with the love of my life by my side, Anita Perry. We have our house in the country, we have two beautiful children and two adorable grandchildren, four dogs, and the best sunset from our front porch that you could ever imagine.Life is good. And I am a blessed man.I remain as convinced as ever: there is nothing wrong with America today that cannot be fixed with new leadership. Leadership that champions conservative ideas.As great as our greatest Republican presidents were  from Lincoln to Reagan  it is their ideas that remain greatest.Those ideas live on through the spirit, idealism and optimism of this generation of Americans.We must return to great ideas, to our belief in the power of free individuals, free markets, and free Americans standing watch for liberty wherever it is threated.This is up to us. It is up to you. And to me. Let's roll up our sleeves. Let's get to work. Let's make America, America again.Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
