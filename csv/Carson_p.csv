Ben Carson,R,p,"July 17, 2015","Press Release - Carson: Planned Parenthood's Defense 'Spurious,' 'Nothing That Can't Be Done Without Fetal Tissue'","Retired neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson stated that the argument that Planned Parenthood is obtaining fetal tissue for important medical research is ""spurious"" because ""there's nothing that can't be done without fetal tissue"" on Thursday's ""Kelly File"" on the Fox News Channel.Carson said, in response, to the argument that Planned Parenthood uses fetal organs for medical research, ""it's been over-promised what the benefits of fetal research would be. And very much under-delivered. And if you go back over the years, and look at the research that has been done and all the things that it was supposed to deliver, very little of that has been done, and there's nothing that can't be done without fetal tissue. So, it's a spurious argument, but, you know, what's really disturbing is the fact that we have become so callous that a lot of people don't even realize that this is shocking. To see the callousness, [with] which we are treating human life. It's interesting that there are so many people who are concerned about snail darters and little spiders and things, and yet, the human being inside of that mother's womb, just beyond, you know, 10 weeks, is much more sophisticated than many of these creatures that they're trying to preserve. And we've created a dichotomy in what should be a[n] almost sacred relationship between a mother and that baby, and a mother is a protector of that baby, and we've distorted things to the point where people believe that if the mother can't kill the baby, than anybody who's advocating that is an enemy of women. How can we be so foolish as to believe such a thing?""Read More"
Ben Carson,R,p,"July 28, 2015",Press Release - Op-Ed by Ben Carson: We Must Value Human Life,"The recent revelations regarding a video showing a Planned Parenthood staff discussion of the alleged sale of tissue from aborted fetuses should be deemed abhorrent by anyone with a conscience.A second undercover video has emerged showing Planned Parenthood''s medical directors council president Dr. Mary Gatter, haggling over payments and offering to use a ""less crunchy technique"" for intact fetal tissue specimens. Planned Parenthood''s president, Cecile Richards, defended the organization, saying that it broke no laws. But that is not enough.It would be instructive for people to know more about the origins of this organization and its founder, Margaret Sanger. This woman was a proponent of eugenics, which promotes the notion that there are superior individuals and inferior individuals, and that society is helped when the superior ones proliferate while inferior ones are reduced.She was quoted advocating ""a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.""Perhaps the horrendous videos will let us reflect as a society about what we have been doing over the last several decades with precious human life.We have allowed the proponents of a woman's choice movement to convince us that killing valuable human babies is not a big deal and certainly is better than infringing upon the convenience of a woman. We have established the setting where many women think the baby inside of them would negatively impact their lifestyle. These women believe their babies need to be eliminated rather than guarded and cherished.We've distorted things to the point where people believe that anyone who opposes mothers killing their babies is waging a war on women. How can we be so foolish to believe such a thing? One must be able to recognize the depravity to which we have sunken as a society when valuing a baby's life is frowned upon.The brain of a little baby develops at a rate of hundreds of millions of neurons every single day by the time it is 6 to 8 weeks old. The baby is rapidly becoming a very complex organism. It is much more sophisticated than many of the creatures that we go to great lengths to preserve in our environment.Through the wonders of ultrasonography and endoscopy, we have been able to recognize the human features at an early stage that characterize these priceless beings and belie the myth that they are nothing more than meaningless clumps of cells. In my view, this is propaganda that has been perpetuated by organizations like Planned Parenthood and others who desire to promote the abominable practice of abortion on demand.My entire professional career as a pediatric neurosurgeon was dedicated to saving the lives of children and promoting their long-term welfare, as I took the Hippocratic Oath to ""First, do no harm."" Protecting innocent life is a duty consistent with that solemn oath. Destroying or butchering them is particularly offensive to someone like myself who has operated on babies while they were still in utero. All human life is precious and should be preserved and protected with the utmost respect and care.When we reach a point where we are so callous that we kill innocent little babies, what else won't we do? Is there a limit to our barbarism? Human history is replete with examples of what happens when we devalue human life. Here in the United States of America, we have a history of compassion and kindness that characterizes a model citizen. It is time to reclaim our heritage and reject the purveyors of selfishness and callousness.Congress should defund Planned Parenthood and consider having the IRS revoke its status as a 501(c)(3) organization. I believe deeply, as it is written in the Declaration of Independence, that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. First and foremost among these unalienable rights is life, and we created a government in order to protect it -- not fund its destruction.We must do everything in our power to advance a culture of life. Let's once again be proud of ourselves rather than making excuses for our behavior."

Ben Carson,R,p,"December 8, 2015",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan for Government Reform,"Alexandria, Va. - December 8, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, released his plan to reform Washington's bloated and inefficient bureaucracy. The plan is available for download at https://www.bencarson.com/issues/government-reform.Dr. Carson's policy plan is built around five key concepts: accountability, analysis, reform, taxpayer feedback and public reporting. Chief among these proposals would be the establishment of the first-ever Chief Organizational Architect. This position, designed to bring an objective eye and knowledge of organizational science to the government, would be responsible for reviewing agency structures and systems to find opportunities to reduce waste and increase efficiency.The federal government is projected to spend $3.7 trillion this year, but the Government Accountability Office estimates that almost $125 billion of the spending in 2014 went to improper payments.""Generations of politicians have talked about reforming the institutions of government,"" said Dr. Carson, ""but like so many other promises made by career politicians and beltway insiders, it's all been for naught. My government reform plan will bring substantive change to the way Washington works, redirecting the focus of the government back to the people it's supposed to represent.""""For too long, government agencies have grown rampantly, without any forethought or planning,"" added Dr. Carson. ""The Chief Organizational Architect will bring rigor and analytics to government organization, identifying opportunities for streamlining operations and reducing waste. As president, I will bring unprecedented scrutiny and transparency to our government operations, ensuring that federal agencies are better equipped to serve the American people.""The federal government currently consists of roughly 8,000 senior executives, 2.6 million civilian employees and a cadre of federal contractors so large that the Congressional Budget Office is ""unaware of any comprehensive information"" about its size. By treating the American people as ""citizen-owners"" of their government, Dr. Carson's plan would bring accountability and accessibility to the Washington bureaucracy and give taxpayers a greater say in their government."
Ben Carson,R,p,"December 9, 2015",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Health Care Reform Plan,"Alexandria, Va. - December 9, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, released his policy plan for health care reform in America. The plan centers on repealing Obamacare, expanding individual choice and restoring the doctor-patient relationship to the forefront of the health care system. The plan is available for download at https://www.bencarson.com/issues/health-care.Since the implementation of Obamacare, patients have faced rising costs in premiums, deductibles and co-pays; received less access to the doctors of their choice; and have fewer options for their desired health care plans. Five million Americans have already been kicked off of their private health care plans and 21 percent fewer health plan options are now available to the American people. Dr. Carson's plan will repeal Obamacare all together.In place of Obamacare, Dr. Carson proposes giving each individual the power to choose the health care plan that suits his or her unique health care needs. His plan focuses on the expansion of tax-protected Health Empowerment Accounts (HEAs), currently known as Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). An HEA will be automatically opened for every citizen at birth and would be available to everyone in the current system who has a Social Security number. An individual HEA owner can grow his or her account over a lifetime; spend every dollar on medical care without first having to meet deductibles or pay additional copays; and have the option of transferring the account across state lines and to family members.Dr. Carson's plan also aims to save Medicaid and modernize Medicare (by gradually increasing the eligibility age to 70). These programs will be reformed, not eliminated. For Medicaid, the federal government would provide fixed-dollar support to the states, which must use the funds for insurance premium payments for beneficiaries. For Medicare, beneficiaries would receive a fixed contribution to buy the health insurance they actually want and need. The enrollees of both programs will receive HEA accounts and would be able to choose medical insurance plans like every other American. This will foster healthy competition among private insurance companies, which in turn would promote the expansion of health care options in the marketplace.""I have spent my entire adult life within the American health care system, spending countless nights working to heal the lives of children in America and beyond,"" said Dr. Carson. ""Health care decisions are some of the most important decisions a person will ever face and the government should not be the one to make these decisions. The power to choose your health care plan and your doctor was always intended to be placed within the hands of ""We The People."" I am pleased to release my vision for the American health care system and offer a blueprint for empowering the American people instead of the federal government."""

Ben Carson,R,p,"December 15, 2015",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Outlines Plan to Protect America; Calls for Declaration of War Against ISIS,"Alexandria, Va. - December 15, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, issued the following statement and announced ""Seven Steps to a Safer America,"" his plan to defeat the Islamic State and protect the U.S. homeland.""Our country faces grave national security threats. We must act boldly and decisively to protect American citizens from terrorists at home and abroad,"" said Dr. Carson. ""We can no longer dawdle while ISIS continues to persecute Christians, enslave young girls, oppress civil societies and perpetrate terrorist attacks against the free world. We must destroy their caliphate and prevent their terrorists from infiltrating our homeland. We must also secure our borders, identify radical Islamic extremism by name and root out its agents and collaborators in our own country. My 'Seven Steps for a Safer America' offers a path forward for confronting these threats and protecting this great country.""The plan calls for the following actions to be taken.1. Congress should immediately issue a formal declaration of war on the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIL or ISIS.2. The United States should lead the immediate formation of  and provide substantial advisory, financial and military support to  a military coalition in the Middle East to wage war against ISIS. Such a regional coalition would consist of countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.3. The United States should urge its allies and partners in the Middle East to engage in massive recruitment and training of Sunni Syrian men based in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf and of Sunni Syrian male refugees in Jordan  to establish a military force to destroy ISIS and to establish a protection zone for the victims of the terrorist state.4. The United States should deploy its military resources and work with moderate Arab nations  as well as extend strategic support to Kurdish, Christian and Sunni tribes in the free al-Hasakah Province in northeast Syria  to establish a refugee safe zone in the Province. All refugees should be directed to that free area and to other liberated areas later, and be put under international protection.5. Congress should immediately establish a war-time emergency visa and immigration policy; establish an emergency inter-agency task force to review all visa and immigration policies; and limit visitor visas to three months with mandatory check-ins for extensions no longer than three months.6. President Barack Obama and Congress should immediately deploy the National Guard and military troops to patrol the U.S. southern border as well as designated spots along the northern border.7. The Department of State should designate the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations that propagate or support Islamic terrorism as terrorist organizations, and fully investigate the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and a supporter of terrorism."

Ben Carson,R,p,"December 30, 2015",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Denounces Obama and Clinton for Spying on Israel,"Alexandria, Va. - December 30, 2015 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, condemned the Obama administration for spying on Israel.The Wall Street Journal has reported that although President Barack Obama announced two years ago that he would curb U.S. surveillance on friendly heads of state, he has consistently spied on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders. The administration has used the information gathered to counter Israeli opposition to the U.S. nuclear arms agreement with Iran.As part of its eavesdropping efforts, the Obama administration has also collected private conversations between Israeli leaders and U.S. policymakers in Congress.""It is truly disgraceful that the Obama administration has spied on Prime Minister Netanyahu, his colleagues and pro-Israel lawmakers in Congress,"" said Dr. Carson. ""Instead of focusing on deterring the Iran nuclear threat and fighting against the Mullahs who chant 'Death to America,' President Obama has treated Israel, our staunch, democratic ally in the Middle East, as his real enemy. Not only did he not curtail surveillance on our close friend, he has once again proven himself to be a president that our enemies need not fear and our friends cannot trust.""""No doubt President Obama's former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew of the administration's spying efforts on Israel,"" added Dr. Carson. ""It is shameful that she participated in undermining the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Once again, she has shown that her experience in government is merely an indication that she is unfit to lead. When I am president, I will stand firmly with Israel, and one of my first acts in office will be to revoke Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran."""

Ben Carson,R,p,"January 4, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Pro-Growth Economic Plan; Calls for 14.9% Flat Tax,"Alexandria, Va. - January 04, 2016 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, released his policy plan for reforming America's convoluted and systematically unfair tax code. The plan will throw out the current tax code in favor of a simple, transparent and fair flat tax on income. The plan is available for download here.Every year the U.S. tax code gets more complex, costing taxpayers more than $230 billion and 6 billion hours just to be in compliance. This labyrinthine maze of regulations and loopholes only favors those with an army of accountants and tax lawyers at their disposal, leaving small businesses and middle class families at the mercy of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). At the same time, 45 percent of the households of this country pay no federal income tax at all. Dr. Carson's plan will create a tax system anyone can understand, replacing every loophole and tax shelter with one simple rate of 14.9 percent.Under the Carson Flat Tax, all income, personal and corporate, will be taxed at this same rate  ensuring that no one can game the system. To help lower income families, taxpayers will only pay the flat tax for income earned above 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. For example, a family of four will pay a 14.9 percent tax on income above $36,375. Families that do not earn more than the allowance amount will be asked to make a de minimis payment, ensuring that every taxpayer becomes a citizen-owner of his government.Dr. Carson's tax plan will also eliminate unfair double taxation such as the death and capital gains taxes. Americans' success and investment should be rewarded, not punished by a second round of taxation.Removing these barriers to investment will also jump-start the economy. Over the first ten years of this plan, the real gross domestic product is likely to grow by more than 16 percent, with wages increasing 11 percent over the same time. By reducing corporate tax rates from 35 percent  currently the highest in the developed world  to just 14.9 percent, billions of dollars of profits that U.S. corporations currently keep overseas would be repatriated back to America for investment and development. This increased investment will help push our economic growth to nearly 4 percent, a 73 percent increase from the anemic 2.2 percent growth we have today.""Liberty and fairness are bedrock principles of this great nation,"" said Dr. Carson. ""It's time that our tax system reflected those ideals. My plan for a simple, fair and transparent flat tax will not only eliminate the onerous burdens the IRS places on taxpayers, but it will grow the economy. Everyone will be on the same footing, from the largest corporation to the local family business. No one will be able to hide from their tax burden, but neither will anyone be ruined by an incomprehensible tax code. A Carson administration will push Congress from Day One to implement this plan to revitalize our economy through fundamental, common-sense tax reform. We will take the power away from the IRS and put it back in the hands of 'We The People.'"""
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 8, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Announces Education Plan,"Alexandria, Va. - January 08, 2016 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, released his policy plan for restoring exceptionalism to America's schools. The plan offers five commonsense principles that empower parents and support teachers. The plan is available for download here.Dr. Carson's plan restores American exceptionalism in our schools by focusing on five key principles: provide school choice to families, empower local communities, encourage the innovative spirit of educators, reward good teachers and create a streamlined student loan process.Growing up in dire poverty in the inner cities of Detroit and Boston, Dr. Carson knows education is the great liberator. His mother understood the value of education and was empowered to make decisions for her sons that changed the course of their lives. The Carson Education Plan provides families and school administrators with the tools necessary to improve the educational opportunities of their students.""Dr. Carson's education plan returns America's education system to top tier global status by returning the power back to the people who know best: parents and local school systems,"" said Carson's Nevada State Director Jimmy Stracner. ""By contrast, ill-conceived liberal reforms like Common Core have worked to create a centralized education system that gives the federal government control over decisions and policies that should be made at the local level.""""The hallmark of Dr. Carson's education plan is empowering parents and local communities to make the best decisions for their children,"" said Carson's Iowa State Director Ryan Rhodes. ""Like Dr. Carson, I believe that parents in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines are better capable of improving educational opportunities for their students than bureaucrats in Washington.""""My mother had little education, but she understood the great power that education has in changing life for the better,"" said Dr. Ben Carson. ""My prescription for achievement takes politics and politicians out of education reform and puts it back in the hands of We the People.""""The plan not only empowers parents, but it also rewards effective teachers. A great teacher can make all the difference in a student's life. I've seldom met a successful person who can't point to a teacher who played a significant role in their success. The stakes are too high and we owe it to our children to restore our educational system to global preeminence."""

Ben Carson,R,p,"January 14, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Continues to Call for Thorough Investigation of U.S. Muslim Group CAIR,"Alexandria, Va. - January 14, 2016 - Dr. Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, continues to call for the U.S. government to conduct a full investigation into the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a U.S. Muslim group. CAIR has extensive ties to foreign terrorist groups, such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and was once named by federal prosecutors as an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" in a plot to facilitate terrorist financing. CAIR has repeatedly and openly expressed support for terrorism, disdain for the U.S. Constitution and a desire for America to be ruled under Sharia law. Three Muslim countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have designated the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates, which include CAIR, as terrorist organizations.""CAIR has long hidden behind a thin veil of advocacy, using political correctness to attack anyone who would expose their extremist roots,"" said Dr. Carson. ""We can't let a fear of offending obscure domestic terrorists prevent us from subjecting CAIR to the full scrutiny of law enforcement. CAIR's ideals and activities do not represent the views of America's peace-loving and patriotic Muslim communities. We must investigate this organization immediately in order to safeguard the security of the American people.""Facts and Questions About CAIR:CAIR and Domestic Terrorism: In the aftermath of the San Bernardino terrorist attack that left 14 dead and 31 wounded, many questions arose about the link between the attackers and local members of CAIR. Hussam Ayloush, head of CAIR's operations for Greater Los Angeles, has documented associations with Mustafa Kuko, the Director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, where the San Bernardino attackers worshipped. Yet instead of answering questions about how the terrorists became radicalized, CAIR has stood in the way of law enforcement's investigation, even at one point deflecting blame for the attacks onto U.S. foreign policy.CAIR and Terrorist Financing: CAIR was established by individuals with known ties to terrorism. The Holy Land Foundation (HLF), shuttered in 2001 for its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and efforts to facilitate terrorist financing, provided the seed money for CAIR. Court documents show that CAIR was named by federal prosecutors as ""unindicted co-conspirators"" of the HLF plot, but the Obama Justice Department has refused to bring charges against CAIR.CAIR and Sharia Law: CAIR's terrorist links are merely the manifestation of its open desire to replace the U.S. Constitution with Sharia law. One of the most disturbing revelations of the HLF trial was the exposure of a Muslim Brotherhood document calling for ""Civilizational Jihad"" to eliminate and destroy Western civilization from within.CAIR has echoed such calls throughout its history. Most notably, co-founder Omar Ahmad has decreed, ""Islam isn't in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant.The Koran, the Muslim book of scripture, should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on earth.""CAIR Designated as a Terrorist Group: Already, other countries have decided that CAIR is an organization they do not want on their soil. Three of America's partners in the Middle East, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have designated the Muslim Brotherhood and its associates, which include CAIR, as terrorist organizations.CAIR and Its Nonprofit Status: In addition to openly espousing terrorism and working with terrorist groups, CAIR has brazenly violated IRS regulations governing nonprofit organizations. It has previously lost its tax-exempt status by failing to file federal taxes three years in a row. Last year, it demanded that Dr. Carson withdraw as candidate for the 2016 presidential race, even though the IRS prohibits tax-exempt organizations to intervene in a political campaign on behalf of  or in opposition to  a candidate. America's taxpayers should not be subsidizing the political activities of any organization, let alone one with such close ties to terrorism and anti-american ideologies. The IRS should review CAIR's tax exempt status and remove it.""The American people are rightly concerned about domestic support for terrorism,"" explained Dr. Carson. ""After attacks like those in San Bernardino and Philadelphia, we need to examine every source of terrorism and extremism in America. CAIR has a history of extending support to Hamas and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, a history that they can't shield with claims of bigotry or political correctness. Instead of inviting CAIR members to attend the State of the Union, as some of our political leaders did earlier this week, we should be investigating their activities. We should also press the leaders of CAIR to explain their devotion to Sharia law and their eagerness to impose Islam on Americans. We cannot afford to remain wilfully blind to the threats posed by terrorist-affiliated groups in our own backyard. As president, I will fight terror aggressively, no matter how politically incorrect or difficult it may be."""

""Our Founding Fathers understood that our rights were endowed 'by our Creator,' the only power strong enough to provide true liberty. While the freedom to believe in God - or not - is forever enshrined in our Constitution, the First Amendment does not require the abolition of all public religious sentiment, as some seem to want.

Ben Carson,R,p,"January 25, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 25,"Hello everyone, it's another night that we get to spend together for our nightly chat. Remember, keep sending me your texts using the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let's jump right in.The first question is from Jeremy and he asks about my new cyber security plan, ""how does this tie into 'national security'?""I'm glad you asked Jeremy. This has everything to do with national security  the job of the President of the United States, first and foremost, is to secure our country and defend its borders from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I mean all borders, physical and digital. We live in a new age of tactics and an evolving battlefield  it is unconventional and asymmetrical. Not only do we need to have the most robust military fighting force in history, with the intention of peace through strength, but also the capabilities to thwart both domestic and international terrorism through our digital infrastructure. With so much of our data and information being stored and transmitted electronically, we must be able to secure our national interests by putting in place safeguards to prevent theft. Our financial stability and future rests on the assuredness and proactive thinking our country deserves  and, I know the spirit of American ingenuity will shine in this new frontier.The next question is from Emily who asks about the ""importance of our 2nd Amendment, the right to bear arms."" She stressed to me how important this issue is to her and wanted to know if I am committed to protecting her right to defend both herself and her family.No question Emily, I fully support the Second Amendment. 100%. This question ties back into the previous one about ""security"". It is paramount that a free society be able to defend itself, that is the distinguishing characteristic of a free people. It is also important that you elect a leader that understands the paramount nature and genesis of our right to bear arms: not only do we need a ""ready and able"" citizenry for the militia if need be, but even more importantly, it is for the people to be able to defend itself against a tyrannical centralized government which might oppress its people. History is a great reminder and we need look no further than the formation of our own nation to see an example of this. Lest we forget.Let me be clear: I will not infringe upon the guaranteed right of our law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. Period. We have vilified those who look to protect themselves and their families long enough, it's time we started focusing our attention to those who openly call for our destruction. I believe in We the People and I'm confident you do too.Finally, Melissa asks ""who's more competitive, you or Ms. Candy?"" Well, Melissa, I have to admit, I am more competitive. But don't let her know it, I like to tell her I let her win, but the truth is, she actually beats me at games more often than not, even at pool! That's what I love about her; she's dignified even when she beats me, that's the kind of woman she is. Humble and loving, she can make me laugh like no one else. The smile on her face when she can tell exactly what I'm thinking. She is my best friend, and if I'm going to get beat by someone, who better than the one who makes me a better person. But, I still like to think I'm better at pool, but she has me beat when it comes to musical talent!Again, thank you for letting me into your homes to spend this time with you. It always brings a smile to my face when I read your messages. It's only a couple more days until We the People make our voices heard in Iowa and I'm excited to see you on the road, and beyond.Goodnight,Ben"
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 25, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan for Cyber Security and Innovation,"Alexandria, Va. - January 25, 2016 - Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, today released his plan to create a national drive for cyber security and innovation. The plan is available for download here.Dr. Carson's policy plan is built around the consolidation of federal efforts and private partnerships into a new National Cyber Security Administration (NCSA). Much like the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) coordinated and unified America's space exploration efforts, the NCSA will unify and drive a national effort to secure personal, private and government computers against the many threats facing the country. Rather than a new bureaucracy, this administration would streamline existing programs, consolidate efforts and eliminate stovepipes that hinder cooperation.With estimates that internet traffic will soon eclipse a zettabyte, earning more than $1 trillion annually for the American economy, the need to secure U.S. interests online is more urgent now than ever. Recent hacks of personal data, sensitive weapons plans and the Ukrainian electrical grid demonstrate just how vulnerable we are. Dr. Carson's plan will put this issue in the forefront, educating and empowering the American people and their government to respond to cyber threats forcefully and effectively. ""We need a new space race for the 21st century; a cyber space race,"" said Dr. Carson. ""When President Kennedy said he'd land an American on the moon, it brought together every part of America, from ordinary citizens to the highest levels of government. That is the kind of effort we need to drive American cyber leadership. My plan to unify cybersecurity efforts behind a National Cyber Security Administration will bring more accountability and efficiency to our government's cyber initiatives. There is no challenge too great when 'We the People' set our minds to a solution. We must turn our attention to securing America's cyber leadership for generations to come."""

Larry Ross, Communications Director for the Ben Carson for President 2016 campaign. ""He is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed Planned Parenthood's heinous and illegal activities. As President, he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization, but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn."""
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 26, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 26,"Hello everyone, it's another night that we get to spend together during our nightly fireside chat. It's been another great day in Iowa  from getting to meet so many of you at Revive 714 and talking to Sean Hannity about how We the People will restore faith in our great nation to seeing so many of our team hitting the ground hard, the February 1st Iowa Caucus can't come soon enough! Remember, keep sending me your thoughts and comments by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).The first question tonight comes from Ryan who asks ""what are your thoughts concerning the Justice Department going after the people who exposed Planned Parenthood's negligent practices?""Ryan, thank you for this important question. As I have said repeatedly  the moment we start devaluing human life is the moment we lose our humanity. Without life, we have no hope for a future, tomorrow will never come  we must not allow ourselves to become callous and indifferent to the slaughter of our most precious little ones. They are our hope. They are our future. No longer can we let these children's unrealized potential go unchecked into perpetuity. We have witnessed those who tried being a voice for the voiceless now being targeted by this administration's Justice Department, an attempt to silence their plea for increased scrutiny regarding these heinous acts performed by Planned Parenthood  I will not stand idly by and allow this to go unnoticed or brushed aside. I ask that you visit crsn.co/1KD9FBH and stand with me against these barbaric practices.The next question comes from Ruth. She asks ""do you feel the same way about the government and its overreach as I do?"" Ruth commented that she feels our government has become far too large and overreaching, especially for small businesses.Yes, Ruth, I agree. The truth of the matter is government has come to resemble a 'Leviathan' presence in America. It is lethargic and inefficient, reaching into our lives in ways our Founding Fathers never intended. Though, this is not ""something new under the sun""  we have been having this very discussion for far too long, only to have politicians promise ""reform"", as if they are listening The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome. We the People have been ignored and pandered to enough, now it is time for the government to listen to us!Our nation cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road, allowing the pervasive hand of government to dictate our prosperity or outcomes: not from our homes, not from our places of business, and certainly not our places of worship.Americans are innovators and entrepreneurs, when given the proper free-market environment for individuals, families and businesses the opportunity to thrive, We the People outperform the competition time and time again. It is in our national DNA  we are an accomplished people with so much to share, if only the government bureaucrats would cut the red tape, that would be the real stimulus needed to jumpstart the American engine of ingenuity. I am ready to fuel this restoration with you and return this country back into the hands of We the People. Enough is enough.Finally, Eddie asks ""what is the hardest thing about running for President?""Eddie, I won't lie  running for President is not easy and I often have to spend a lot of time away from my family. They keep me centered and grounded. At the end of the day, there is nothing like spending quality time with them, and without their support, this would not be possible. I am blessed to have them by my side. The next hardest thing is seeing the trajectory of our country and being so passionate about ""sounding the alarm""  often, we can feel as if ""I'm only one voice, does it make a difference?"". I can tell you with absolute certainty: one voice can echo throughout history. You are that voice that is multiplied many times over. I can see it in the eyes of everyone I meet  it is passion, zeal and a resolute mindset that will fight for this country at each and every impasse. Americans have a distinct quality of fighters, and they wear many different uniforms, many without nametags. I am so proud to fight by your side and We the People are stronger now more than ever.As always, thank you for spending the evening with me for our nightly chat. I look forward to tomorrow and beyond.Goodnight,Ben"

Ben Carson,R,p,"January 27, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 27,"Hello everyone, it's been another great day in Iowa as I prepare for tomorrow night's debate on Fox News  I'm looking forward to putting We the People front and center stage! Please remember to keep sending me texts throughout the day using the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let's jump into tonight's questions.The first question tonight is from Hal, he asks about ""common core"" and it's ""detrimental effect on effective learning in the classroom."" Thank you for asking Hal, you know education is one of my passions.I have been, and always will be, a proponent for facilitating learning environments that enrich our students, reward excellence and motivate our young ones to dream beyond their current circumstances. A student's mind is more than eager to absorb even more than we often give credit, ready to be challenged and stretched. That is my issue with ""Common Core"" is it lacks Common Sense  why would we place bureaucratic impediments and barriers to learning in front of students, more focused on rote and regurgitation, there is nothing intellectually stimulating about this debacle. There's a lot of rhyme without much reason.What I will advocate for is empowering local communities, states, parents and students to explore the many opportunities a free-market approach to education will produce: performance-driven curriculum that engages students and allows our amazing teachers to get back to their passion, which is enriching students. The math is simple on this one.Next, James asks about ISIS and their ""seemingly emboldened"" international posture, specifically towards America and Israel.Timely question James, and yes, I agree. The more we allow these Radical Islamic Terrorists to carry out their mission, unchecked, the more their ranks will feel untouchable. A cancer that is allowed to grow will spread its tentacles until the body is decimated  I, for one, will not allow our hands to sit idly by. As Commander-in-Chief, it will be my priority to protect American interests and innocent lives, of all creeds and religions, from the pointed threats of those championing death rather than life. Period.The time for wishful thinking and capitulation is over  we must not allow the spine of America to be planted firmly in the sand. It will require decisive action with clear and measurable objectives and goals  this war will not be fought from the rear. We are a nation of leaders and operators, a country rooted in bold distinction, ever present to thwart evil when it rears its head. I am confident that given the proper leadership, coalescing our international allies in common purpose, the United States will once again reestablish itself as the force for peace through strength, stability through anchored positional readiness.It starts with calling out the enemy by name. Let's make it official.Finally, Karaina asks ""are you prepared for the debate? What do you think about Mr. Trump not showing up?""Prepared, yes. The thing is, Karaina, we should always be prepared to give an account and answer. Whether it is walking on the debate stage, speaking to large crowds at our town halls, or engaging with people every day on the numerous stops throughout the country, I am at ease knowing that I am prepared to talk about important matters because I'm not a politician, I'm person, just like you. It's not about ""sound bites"", it's about sound guidance, wisdom and principles. Those are the core of whatever topic it is I'm addressing. As long as you have your foundation firmly rooted in the truth, facts are sure to follow. It's common sense.As far as Mr. Trump possibly not participating in the debate, I don't really think that any one candidate should be the focus  remember, this is about We the People and representing a multitude of people on that stage tomorrow night, and every day thereafter.Again, thank you for the great questions, I always enjoy spending our evenings together for these chats.Goodnight,Ben"
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 27, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan for Defeating the Islamic State and Eliminating the Threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism,"Alexandria, Va. - January 27, 2016 - Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, today released his plan to defeat the Islamic State and the larger threat of radical Islamic terror. This is Dr. Carson's third plan addressing national security issues announced this month. Combined with plans to overhaul government bureaucracy, the tax code, education and health care, these strategies represent Dr. Carson's extraordinary vision to empower 'We the People' to re-invigorate the nation. The plan is available for download here.The past seven years have seen increasing incidences of terrorism around the world, from the emergence of the Islamic State to the revitalization of the Taliban. Attacks in San Bernardino and Paris highlight the Obama administration's failure to implement a coherent response to radical Islamic terrorism around the globe. Dr. Carson's plan will engage terrorist ideology and strategy head on, recognizing the nature of the enemy this country faces, targeting the threat at its source and protecting the American way of life.First and foremost, the Carson plan identifies the nature of the threat: a radical ideology that seeks to violently impose Islam on others and supplant existing cultures and duly constituted governments around the world. Dr. Carson's strategy recognizes the reality of global jihadist movements, and counters terrorism not only militarily, but also diplomatically, economically and politically. His plan will defeat the Islamic State, both in Iraq and Syria, as well as in northern Africa where it seeks to gain a new stronghold. Dr. Carson's plan also calls for waging war against the radical Islamic terror movement as a whole, and outlines a unified national response to this grotesque and violent ideology.""A President's most sacred obligation is to protect this great nation from every threat, both foreign and domestic,"" said Dr. Carson. ""Today, radical Islamic terrorism threatens our very existence. Whether through direct violent attacks or 'civilizational jihad,' radical Muslim terrorists wish to destroy America, her allies and her principals. Seven years of failed leadership against this threat has left us more vulnerable than ever. As President, I will unify the national will to confront radical Islamic terrorism in all of its forms."""
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 29, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 29,"Hello everyone, it's another night we get to spend together for our nightly chat. Please remember to keep sending me your thoughts and questions by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let's jump right in!First, I wanted to thank the thousands of you who sent me your prayers and well-wishes yesterday before the debate  it always centers me and puts me in the right frame of mind to know who I am fighting for, We the People. So much attention has been given to ""sound-byte sensationalism"" and pitting this person against that one  we must always remember that this is not about 'them', it is about us. The future we sow for will be what our children reap, and I am confident, together, we will be planting the seeds for our children to bear the fruit of a prosperous tomorrow.Division and demonization are not the answer  it is healthy to recognize 'differences' that are inherent in our 'melting pot' society steeped in tradition and common purpose, unique perspectives and voices are at the very essence of our nation's formation. However, when we lose sight of our commonality  to the point of demeaning rhetoric and dehumanizing insult  our neighbor becomes nothing more than an accumulation of 'material', without dignity and meaning. I refuse to belittle, We the People are bigger  it's time ""politicians"" learn how to lift ideas up rather than pushing other people down. This election means more than the person who will hold the office of President because the American people ultimately govern from that desk, and I'm not quite sure there's enough room for one man's ego and We the People to fit at the same time.Before I head off to bed, I'd like to answer Don's question about last night; he asked ""were you frustrated about the lack of time and questions you got during the debate?"" This was a common response from many of you, so I wanted to make sure I shared my thoughts with you on this.Yes and no, Don. No, I wasn't personally frustrated over the lack of time I was given  I don't think it takes a verbose and drawn-out answer to get to the point. According to the reporting, I had the ""lowest time"" answering on stage, but I always prefer quality over quantity. On the same note, however, I do wish that more time was spent getting to the focus of this debate: the American people. There was plenty of ""back and forth"", from side to side on that stage, not enough discussion about giving this country back to We the People, forthright solutions that speak directly to a divided America. Let's leave the bickering on the playground, this is not a game. I stand with you  not over you. We the People are united in actually solving problems, telling it like it is  who cares about scoring political points when the score always ends up zero. We all lose when fall divided, but, united we stand. Let's get back to winning again. I am confident we will secure the victory Americans are known for, time and time again, leading the way for others to follow.As always, thank you for allowing me into your homes for another night together, just We the People connecting without all the noise. It's always a highlight of my day.Goodnight,Ben"
Ben Carson,R,p,"January 29, 2016","Press Release - Statement from General Bob Dees, Carson for President Chairman","Despite having the least opportunity to speak at tonight's debate, Dr. Ben Carson said the most. He proved himself the best qualified candidate in the 2016 presidential race, addressing common sense solutions to the problems and concerns of the American People, demonstrating he is committed to keeping them safe and has the economic plans to make them prosper.Dr. Carson proved he is a uniter, not a divider, setting aside pettiness of ""politics as usual"" and focusing on the solutions that will heal our nation. He is the only candidate with the moral character and authority to lead America as Commander-in-Chief. Ignoring political correctness, tackling bullies like Putin, defeating ISIS and restoring our global leadership requires moral courage, not political expediency.The debate stage is one of many avenues that Dr. Carson has used to share his vision to heal, inspire and revive America. His website,www.BenCarson.com has more detailed policy positions than any other candidate, offering further proof that Dr. Carson is the most prepared to step into the Oval Office and lead from Day One."

The two met at the opening of the Kosovar consulate in Des Moines, the first foreign consulate in Iowa. The new consulate highlights the special relationship between the Republic of Kosovo and Iowa.The relationship began as a 2011 partnership between Kosovo Security Forces and the Iowa National Guard. The relationship strengthened in 2013, when Governor Branstad and President Jahjaga signed a sister state agreement, bringing the states closer together, both economically and culturally. Choosing Des Moines for Kosovo's consulate is a sign of just how strong this relationship has become, and further underscores the Republic of Kosovo's impressive recovery and growth after enduring civil war and genocide.""Having served in Kosovo during my U. S. Army career, I was honored to represent Dr. Carson and the campaign, and delighted to meet with meet with Deputy Prime Minister Thaci,"" said General Dees. ""I look forward to seeing even greater cooperation between Kosovo and the United States, and Iowa is the perfect state to be the bedrock of that relationship.""""Kosovo's history is a testament to the resiliency of its people,"" said Dr. Carson. ""This new consulate also demonstrates that when the United States and its NATO allies commit to the fight for peace and liberty, it can have profound effects for victims of violence and oppression. All Americans should be proud to see this vibrant relationship that has developed between Iowa and Kosovo, and I look forward to seeing this friendship and cooperation grow in the years to come."""

Ben Carson,R,p,"January 31, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan to Fix the Broken U.S. Immigration System and Restore the Rule of Law,"Alexandria, Va. - January 31, 2016 - Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, today released his plan to fix the broken U.S. immigration system and restore the rule of law.This is Dr. Carson's fourth policy plan addressing national security concerns announced this month. Combined with plans to overhaul government bureaucracy, the tax code, education and health care, these strategies represent Dr. Carson's extraordinary vision to empower 'We the People' to re-invigorate the nation. The plan is available for download here. For decades, career politicians have watched as our borders have been overrun by illegal immigration and drug and weapons trafficking. Politicians in Washington have turned a blind eye to our borders, the American people have paid the price. At the same time, politicians have held immigration policies hostage to political gamesmanship.As a political outsider, Dr. Carson will finally fix America's broken immigration system. His plan is built around five central tenets: 1) securing the border, 2) implementing sensible admission and removal procedures, 3) offering a solution for the large illegal immigrant population already here in the United States, 4) addressing legal immigration and 5) restoring the concept of the American melting pot. By adhering to these principles, Dr. Carson will ensure that entrants to our country are properly vetted and documented, while preserving America's legacy as a nation welcoming of anyone who respects our nation, our laws and our ideals.""We simply cannot afford to ignore our broken immigration system any longer,"" said Dr. Carson. ""Career politicians in Washington have opted to play games rather than solve the problems unregulated immigration has caused for the American people. As President, I will restore faith in America's laws through fair and equal enforcement, while investing the resources and personnel necessary to protect and seal our border. Our founders sought a nation of immigrants and laws. I share their vision, and will return this country back to the hands of 'We the People.'""This immigration plan is Dr. Carson's fourth policy prescription.

Ben Carson,R,p,"February 2, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - February 2,"Hello everyone, it's another night we get to spend together for our nightly chat. Please remember to keep sending me your questions by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).My first question is from Sumter who asks ""how important is it, really, to protect our borders?"" I believe the border is our first line of defense against illegal immigration. Border security is about upholding America's laws as well as defending U.S. national security. Currently, terrorists and criminals are eagerly entering our country. We must stop them or we will risk more tragedies like the death of Kate Steinle, a young woman who was shot in San Francisco last summer. The man accused of perpetrating the crime was an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times but still managed to sneak back into this country. Preventable crimes like that should never happen, and they will not happen when I am president. A Carson administration will enforce a multi-faceted approach to securing our borders, based upon the successful model that had been implemented in Yuma, Arizona, prior to intervention from the Obama administration. Next, Kate asks ""why do you support school choice?"" Kate, the fact is the United States cannot remain competitive in the world if we do not have an education system that meets the needs of students in every corner of our country. It is our moral imperative as Americans to lay the foundation for a world class education for every student, not simply to those in the best neighborhoods or with the money to buy the educational support they need. We must adopt policies that will give parents and students the freedom to design an educational experience that is tailored to their unique abilities, interests and learning needs.Finally, Anthony asks ""how do we address the constant approach of 'government-based' solutions we always here about?"" Anthony indicated that he thinks too many politicians seem to think ""government"" is the answer.Anthony, I agree with you. Why do we keep looking to government for the answer? It is We the People that have, and always will be the answer. It's time to return to common sense solutions that enrich the American people, not line the pockets of bureaucrats with special favors. Back room deals will have no place in my administration, that I promise  it will actually be transparent for once.Thank you again for letting me into your homes for our nightly chat.Goodnight,Ben"
Ben Carson,R,p,"February 2, 2016",Press Release - Statement on Senator Cruz's Apology for Campaign Caucus Tactics,"Alexandria, Va. - February 2, 2016 - Dr. Carson has accepted Senator Cruz's apology issued earlier this afternoon, said A. Larry Ross, Communications Director for Ben Carson for President 2016. These 'dirty tricks' political tactics are part of the reason Dr. Carson got into this race and reflect the 'Washington values' of win at all cost -- regardless of the damage to the country -- which he is trying to change. This incident further demonstrates that we need an individual who is not a politician to lead and to heal our nation, not someone driven by ambition.Dr. Carson will continue to work tirelessly toward reforming the system, restoring faith in the integrity of the electoral process and giving government back to 'We the People.' He invites Senator Cruz and all of the candidates who profess to reject politics as usual to join him in conducting a race worthy of American ideals and respectful of the American people. He is looking forward to continuing his campaign in New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond."

Already this year, as in every year, there are countless reports of dirty tricks, shady practices, and outright lies intended to get voters by any means possible. Unfortunately, these deceptive practices have become ""business as usual"" for the political class. It's disheartening to see, but it's also a reminder of why I got into this race in the first place. I'm not here to play the same sleazy games that have become routine in American politics. I'm running to return integrity to our politics.I can't speak for other campaigns. I can only tell you this: I promise to always run a campaign that is reflective of my character and Christian values. I think how we conduct our campaigns says a lot about how we lead, and I want the American people to know that I will always lead with integrity and honesty. Washington politicians will do anything to keep power, resorting to any dirty trick. I got in this race to break that cycle of political gamesmanship and return the White House to ""We the People.""So while I'm saddened to see the tactics employed by some of my fellow Republicans, I won't let it change who I am or how I run. I want to thank all of my supporters for their continued faith. And to any supporter in Iowa who feels they were deceived, I'm honored by your support. I will carry this fight on.

Ben Carson,R,p,"February 5, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - Feb. 5,"Good evening friends, It's great to be able to sit down with you again for our nightly Ask Ben chat. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions at 275-236 (ASKBEN).I get a lot of questions about my views on the debate process, so I thought I'd discuss it some this evening. Public debates are an important opportunity for the American people to hear directly from their candidates. We spend so much time trying to spread our messages, but between the media distortions, the negative ads and political rumor mills, everything get's pretty jumbled. There is no room for that kind of distortion when we get on the debate stage, just as I will tomorrow night in New Hampshire. That's why I think it's important for every candidate to participate.I have called for a change to the debate process in order to make sure all candidates are given more equitable opportunities to answer questions and that the stage itself is representative of the entirety of the Republican Party. We need to begin by getting rid of the 'Coliseum' mentality that is driving moderators to instigate fights between candidates. We should be answering substantive questions about how we will fix the problems facing America today. That is why I always try to stay above the fray, even if it means sacrificing time in the spotlight. I am also interested in seeing a more collegial format -- where the candidates can discuss issues less formally, and with longer speaking times allotted. This will provide an opportunity for candidates to fully convey their positions on the issues rather than creating sound bites for the news.No matter the format, I will eagerly take the stage at any debate. It is a privilege to be running for President, and I am immensely grateful to We the People for the support that they have shown me throughout this process."
Ben Carson,R,p,"February 6, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Delivers Commanding Performance at GOP Debate,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire  At tonight's ABC GOP Presidential Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, Dr. Ben Carson delivered a commanding performance characterized by quiet strength and strong moral convictions.He appealed to the best qualities of the American people and acknowledged that ""America would not be free without our veterans."" Dr. Carson also emphasized that the prevailing ethics of Washington are not his ethics. While career politicians are happy to do whatever is necessary to win, Dr. Carson stressed that he will do what is right. He is confident that he will beat Secretary Hillary Clinton in the general election because the American people will choose honesty and integrity instead of deceit and the Washington way.On stage, where other candidates chose self-promotion and bickering, Dr. Carson opted for civility and respect, breaking through the name-calling and personal attacks to address the serious issues facing the American people. Last week in Iowa, when Washington insiders stooped to efforts to unfairly manipulate voters, Dr. Carson stood strong for integrity and accountability. Throughout this race, while politicians have engaged in empty rhetoric, Dr. Carson has offered real common sense solutions backed by a lifetime of accomplishment. Tonight, voters in New Hampshire and across the country are the real winners, as they saw for themselves a leader who will make tough decisions based on his moral compass, not according to political correctness or expediency."

Ben Carson,R,p,"February 8, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - Feb. 8,"Hello, Friends. It's that time of night again when I like to sit down and answer some of your questions. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).Our first question tonight comes from Emily. Emily wants to know how I feel about the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and what message I would have for voters in the state.Great question, Emily! First and foremost, I am very much looking forward to the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and I am confident that the people of the Granite State will cast their votes with conviction and careful consideration. As to what I would say to voters in the state; I would want to make sure that people know that as President, I will fiercely defend the Constitution of the United States, secure our borders and safeguard our nation from any threat. Most importantly, I will do what is in the best interest of We the People and not capitulate to special interests and the political elite. If the people of New Hampshire honor me with their votes, I promise to be a candidate of integrity who will follow through on the promises that I have made during this election process.Our second question tonight comes from Lauren. Lauren wants to know what my thoughts were on this past weekend's debate and how I feel about the debate process in general.Thank you so much for the question, Lauren. I believe that the debate process is an important part of the public being able to better get to know the candidates and for the candidates to be able to share their ideas with the American people as well as debate them in a public setting. Furthermore, we need to make sure that every candidate has an equal opportunity to present their ideas and need to get away from arbitrary debate requirements. I thought this past debate went very well and that people are starting to realize that I am a candidate with real ideas and real solutions to the many problems facing our nation. If you want to learn more about where I stand on the issues, you can read more at bencarson.com/issues.Our final question tonight comes from Alex. Alex is a student who wants to know what I would do to improve the education system in our country.That's a great question, Alex! The problems facing our education system are complex. First of all, I think that if we take a serious look at Common Core, it will prove that the piece of legislation has very little common sense. I believe that we need to fundamentally reshape the way that we think about education in this country. We can begin by offering alternatives such as voucher and charter school programs so that every student can reach their full potential. I also believe that we need to not think about our education system as a ""one-size-fits-all"" program. What works for Massachusetts does not necessarily work for Louisiana. We need to place more educational power in the hands of the states, not in the hands of the Washington bureaucracy.Thank you so much for checking in with me tonight and please continue to send in your questions. Looking forward to a great day in New Hampshire tomorrow! - Ben"
Ben Carson,R,p,"February 10, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - Feb. 10,"Good evening, Friends. It's time for yet another evening chat. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions at 275-236 (ASKBEN).I get a lot of questions about the the environment, and specifically the Obama Administration's many executive orders and overreaching rules. Yesterday we finally saw the Supreme Court stand up to the President on one such rule. While they stopped short of ruling on the Clean Power Plan's emissions restrictions on power plants, the Supreme Court did issue a stay preventing the rule's enforcement for now. This latest attempt by the EPA to control and reinvent our energy sector by executive action is shameful. Despite the complete lack of regulatory authority, the EPA director and climate alarmists remain committed to imposing their agenda regardless of the law or even the will of the people.This is the most alarming part of this court case. It has shown just how little regard the administration has for We the People. Democrats are willing to use any means at their disposal to radically change our country, and the Constitution, along with Constitutional principles such as the separation of powers and federalism, have repeatedly been the victims of their assault. Our next president must be a vigilant defender of the Constitution, and if elected I promise to always abide by our founding principals; and to appoint justices who will do likewise. We cannot afford another President who will erode our liberty or our laws.As for encouraging cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy sources, federal mandates are the wrong course of action. We should encourage free market investment to innovate new technologies and methods. Artificial restrictions on energy sources only hurt consumers by raising prices. If we want a vibrant, affordable and cleaner energy sector, we need to let companies compete. That's the only way to ensure that the American people will continue to have access to the affordable and reliable energy they need."
Ben Carson,R,p,"February 11, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - Feb. 11,"Hello, Friends. Thanks for joining me this evening as I take some time to answer some of your question. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN)Our first question tonight comes from Kaitlin. Kaitlin wants to know when I become President what my plan is to defeat ISIS and bring peace to the Middle East.Great question, Kaitlin. I believe in a hands-on approach to defeating ISIS that will involve collaboration with our allies in the region and by giving our military leaders the resources that they need to accomplish the mission. We must wage war against our enemy both abroad and at home, by fundamentally rooting out radical Islamic factions and destroying them both militarily and ideologically. As President I will fight ISIS, its affiliates, and other terrorist groups wherever we find them; from Iraq and Syria to Libya and the Maghreb. That includes fighting the spread of their radical ideology here in the US as well. Radical Islamic terrorists seek to oppress free people around the world, and a Carson Administration will settle for nothing less than the destruction of this murderous and tyrannical ideology.Our second question tonight comes from Tyrone. He wants to know what I will do to improve the lives of our nation's veterans.Great question. I think that it's important to recognize that the Obama administration has not treated our veterans with the respect that they deserve. It is disgraceful that more than 20 military members are committing suicide every single day. Our service men and women deserve the best treatment and care available for serving in our armed forces. We need a comprehensive system in place for re-introducing former personnel into society that is seamless. Additionally, we need to provide exceptional psychological and physical treatment services for those that need our help. That's why I've introduced a health care plan that will provide America's veterans with medical coverage from day one of their transition to civilian life, ensuring no American service member is ever left behind. Implementing this kind of comprehensive reform to our veterans services will not be an easy undertaking, but our service men and women are more than deserving of such care.Our third and final question tonight comes from Jessica who wants to know what is my favorite part of running for President of United States.Thanks for the question! The simple answer is that my favorite part of running for President is being able to connect with the American people and learn first-hand about the issues that they find important. This election has always been about restoring power to We the People and taking it out of the hands of an out-of-control, bureaucratic government. Therefore, my greatest joy on the campaign trail is getting to meet the people that I am fighting for and having the opportunity to discuss my ideas for how we can revive our nation.Thank you so much for checking in with me tonight. I am very much looking forward to a great day of campaigning tomorrow in South Carolina!"

An Army combat veteran with more than 20 years of service, Congressman Bentivolio is an outspoken advocate for America's military personnel and veterans, and staunch fighter for conservative values.

""When I look at what we need in our next president, I look for someone who will fight against the political class that has mired our country in higher debts and less accountability.

Ben Carson,R,p,"February 19, 2016",Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - Feb. 19,"Hello, Friends. It's been a great couple of days on the campaign trail in South Carolina and it's been an honor to have the opportunity to present my solutions to the important issues facing our nation. Keep texting your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).Tonight, I wanted to take some time to talk about veterans issues in our country and what we as a nation can do to better care for our brave service men and women.Our veterans are heroes that deserve the greatest degree of care available and we must ensure that we are fostering seamless transitions from their time of service into their time as civilians. The recent and ongoing failures of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are a national disgrace. The VA's fundamental problems are twofold: first, the Secretary of the VA does not have the authority he needs to manage the organization and second, the culture at the VA needs to change. My comprehensive plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs will begin with ensuring that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the necessary authority that they need to execute the job that they have been given. We need to standardize our acquisition procedures across the board in order to decrease the overhead costs of running the department while also modernizing the process to meet the needs of the 21st century. Finally, above all else, we must encourage a system of accountability that ensures that our government fulfills their obligation to take care of our heroes.As a nation, we made a promise to those who bear the burden and scars of service in our armed forces that we would attend to their medical care. That is a promise we must keep, and in a Carson administration, it is one we will keep and keep well.Tomorrow is the South Carolina Primary, and if you place your trust in me, I will be a candidate of integrity and honor that will follow through on the promises that I have made. I hope that I can count on your vote."
Ben Carson,R,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Offers Vision for a Better America at GOP Presidential Debate,"Houston, Texas  At tonight's CNN Republican presidential debate in Houston, Texas, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, again shared his vision  and displayed his determination  for building a better America.In a debate characterized by personal attacks and hostile rhetoric, Dr. Carson called for candidates to tackle the nation's problems of divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility and failure of leadership  not by destroying each other  but by focusing on serving the American people. Demonstrating strength and clarity, Dr. Carson expressed his frustrations with the Internal Revenue Service, stood strongly for America's alliance with Israel and outlined his strategy for thwarting the North Korean nuclear threat.In this race, Dr. Carson has offered common-sense solutions to America's challenges and has issued more detailed policy proposals than any of his opponents. He continues to appeal to the best of the American people and believes that eventually they will be more interested in a presidential candidate's policies and solutions than in his personality. Even more important, not once in this campaign has Dr. Carson compromised his values and principles for political expediency. That is exactly how he will serve in the Oval Office.In the past week, many in the political and media establishment have said that Dr. Carson has no path forward in the 2016 presidential race. At tonight's debate, Dr. Carson once again proved that talking heads and Beltway insiders do not understand him, and never have.Dr. Carson has fought  and continues to fight  for those who have been ignored for far too long by Washington. He has built a movement of Americans from every part of the country and every walk of life, including many who had never before participated in the political process, as well as many others who had given up on the country's political leadership.Unlike the mainstream media and the political establishment, the American people continue to express faith in Dr. Carson's candidacy. Just in the past 24 hours, the Carson for President 2016 Campaign has raised record funds from an email to existing grassroots supporters.With less than 5 percent of the delegates selected, this presidential race has just begun. The field has narrowed to five candidates, and tonight's debate only sharpened the contrast between the other candidates' promises and Dr. Carson's vision and values. As President, he will Heal, Inspire and Revive America."
