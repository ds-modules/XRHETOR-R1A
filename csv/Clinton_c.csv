Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 20, 2007",b'Video Transcript: Presidential Exploratory Committee Announcement',"b""HILLARY CLINTON: I announced today that I am forming a presidential exploratory committee. I'm not just starting a campaign, though, I'm beginning a conversation -- with you, with America. Because we all need to be part of the discussion if we're all going to be part of the solution. And all of us have to be part of the solution. Let's talk about how to bring the right end to the war in Iraq and to restore respect for America around the world. How to make us energy independent and free of foreign oil. How to end the deficits that threaten Social Security and Medicare. And let's definitely talk about how every American can have quality affordable health care. You know, after six years of George Bush, it is time to renew the promise of America. Our basic bargain that no matter who you are or where you live, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can build a good life for yourself and your family. I grew up in a middle-class family in the middle of America, and we believed in that promise. I still do. I've spent my entire life trying to make good on it. Whether it was fighting for women's basic rights or childrens' basic health care. Protecting our Social Security, or protecting our soldiers. It's a kind of basic bargain, and we've got to keep up our end. So let's talk. Let's chat. Let's start a dialogue about your ideas and mine. Because the conversation in Washington has been just just a little one-sided lately, don't you think? And we can all see how well that works. And while I can't visit everyone's living room, I can try. And with a little help from modern technology, I'll be holding live online video chats this week, starting Monday. So let the conversation begin. I have a feeling it's going to be very interesting. TEXT: HillaryClinton.com Paid for by Friends of Hillary Exploratory Committee."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 22, 2007","b'Remarks in a ""Let the Conversation Begin Webcast""'","b'SENATOR CLINTON: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our first online web chat. We\'ve got a lot to talk about tonight. But first I want to thank you for the great response we\'ve been getting since we started the campaign on Saturday. You know, it\'s amazing how new technology can bring so many of us together. We\'ve already got a lot of questions to answer. So let\'s get started. I probably should dispose of the most important question. This is really for my brothers. They are fanatic Chicago Bears fans, so go Bears. What can I say? They said, if you\'re going to talk to anybody, you gotta well root them on. I want you to meet Crystal Patterson. Crystal is going to be our campaign blogger. Tonight she is going to be letting me know your questions. So, let the conversation begin. Crystal, what is the first question? CRYSTAL PATTERSON: The first question is from Barbara in Massachusetts. What can I say to people who say this country isn\'t ready for a woman president? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, Barbara, I hope you\'ll tell them, number one, we won\'t know until we try. Every time we\'ve broken any barriers, that\'s always required people to take a bit of a leap of faith because it hasn\'t baseball done before. But I am fully confident that there are many women in our country who are equipped and ready to lead just as has happened in other countries around the world. But I\'m doing this because I believe I would be the best candidate and the best president. I\'m not looking for people who say, well, I\'m going to vote for her just because she\'s a woman. But I do think it\'s important that we try to demonstrate that women are fully capable of serving at the highest level in our government, and obviously, I\'m going to be asking people to give me the honor of that. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Carolyn in New York. Carolyn asks, where do you stand on the Iraq war? Knowing what you know today, do you regret your vote of endorsement to go into Iraq in the first place? I would love to support you, but these issues are very important to me and many others. SENATOR CLINTON: Well, they\'re very important to me as well. There\'s nothing more important, and you know, ever since I became a Senator from New York, your state and mine, I have worried about 9/11 and terrorism and Afghanistan and Iraq. I have said many times that, if we had known then, when the president came to the Congress to ask for authority to pursue what he said would be an effort to contain Saddam Hussein and put inspectors in to make sure that he didn\'t have weapons of mass destruction, if we had known everything that we now know, the president would never have asked for such authority, and the Congress would never have voted to give it to him. And I certainly would not have voted to do so. But all these years later, we are faced with a very dangerous situation, and what I\'ve tried to focus on, starting, you know, shortly after the invasion, when I began pointing out the problem saw and raising questions about the policy that was being pursued from my position on the armed Armed Services Committee, we have to make better decisions now than this President was made in the past. That\'s why I went again, my third trip to Afghanistan and Iraq last weekend, and I tried to make my own assessment. And when I returned, I reaffirmed my opposition to the President\'s strategy of escalation, putting March American troops into Baghdad, into Iraq. Instead, I think we should cap the number of troops, and we should begin to put real conditions on the Iraqi government. I\'ve said, look, I don\'t want to cut money for American troops. I\'ve been to too many events and places like our military hospital in Germany, where I stopped on the way back, where I met with our wounded servicemen and women. I don\'t want to do anything that in any way undercuts their ability to protect themselves and to do what they need to do in the combat arenas where they are being placed. But I do think we should threaten to cut the funding for the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi police force and the security for the Iraqi leaders, which we pay for, unless they make some of the decisions that we\'ve been expecting them to make for a number of years. I don\'t understand why this president has given them such a blank check, and I think we need to make clear there is no open-ended commitment. We need a phased redeployment of our troops. We need to try to bring them home as safely and as soon as it is possible. But let me add that America does have some remaining very vital security interests. The Al Qaeda in Iraq, they weren\'t there before, they are there now. They pose a threat not only to our troops in Iraq but to our friends in the region and even to us here at home. We have to make sure we do everything we can to try to prevent them from using their horrendous terrorist tactics against Americans and against other innocent people. We also need to try to prevent Iran from expanding its influence in Iraq and in the region. And prevent its continuing effort to obtain a nuclear weapon which would be so dangerous not only to the region but also to Israel and our country and really to the stability of the world. So, yes, I would certainly, you know, wish that we didn\'t have the situation we face now, but I\'m going to continue to do what I can to try to be as responsible as possible to get our troops home but also to deal with the dangers that have been unleashed there. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Kim in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Senator Clinton, how does New Orleans rank on your list of priorities, and what are your plans for bringing New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back? SENATOR CLINTON: It ranks very high. I spent many years having a wonderful life in Arkansas, and my husband and I used to go to New Orleans. And so I\'ve walked those streets. I have had many friends who have lived and worked in New Orleans. When I went down to visit after the horrors of Katrina and Rita, I was just heartbroken to see the devastation. I don\'t believe that this president and our government have responded as I would want them to. They have not put in the effort, the money, the attention, and focus that the people in New Orleans and in the surrounding parishes and along the Gulf Coast deserve. So this is a high priority for me. You know, it\'s really unimaginable that our country would turn its back on the people who suffered so much. These are our fellow Americans. Many of them don\'t feel they can even go back home, and I meet people all the time who they themselves and their families are still dislocated. It\'s tragic that we had such a poorly organized half-hearted response continue to this day to fail the people in the Gulf Coast area. So I\'m going to do everything I can, first from my position as Senator, and then, I hope, as your President, to try to make good to the people who have unfortunately been so disappointed and let down. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Matty in New York. Matty says, I am a 14-year-old class president from Armonk, New York. I have an interest in politics and one day aspire to be President. My question is what made you so inspirational, and why do you believe you should be President? SENATOR CLINTON: Matty, you live very near where Bill and I live in Chappaqua. You\'re just right up the road. There\'s no guide book for someone who wants to go into political life. I didn\'t think I\'d ever personally run for office, but I\'d always worked in campaigns and believe strongly in doing my part to help our democracy work. I guess my advice would be do what you love. Do what really makes you happy. For me, when I was growing up, I wanted to help people. I particularly wanted to help children when I was in college and then in law school, I spent a lot of time studying about the best ways to help kids. And then I did, you know, work when I was in law school with children who were abused and neglected and tried to think of ways that I could be of help. And I worked for the Children\'s Defense Fund. You know, through that, I really was exposed to a lot of the problems that I frankly didn\'t see when I was growing up. I had a very nice middle class upbringing in a suburb of Chicago. And I think, if you can get out and learn more about the world and volunteer to help people. I did that through my church when I was growing up. And any way that you can expand your horizons because every one of us is somewhat limited by the family we\'re born into and the experiences we have and where we go to school. And I think today, more than ever, we need young people like yourself who\'s really going to learn about the world and understand what you can do to make a contribution. And I would also just really recommend just study what you\'re interested in, learn as much as you can, and volunteer in campaigns. You know, you\'re in Armonk, I hope you\'ll volunteer in my campaign because you get to see firsthand how our system works. I wish you a lot of luck with your life as you go forward. And just keep dreaming big dreams because we need young people who care a lot about what\'s going to happen in the future. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Debra in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. I am a 55-year-old single female. I\'ve been a hair dresser for 30 years. I cannot afford to think about paying any kind of health coverage. What would you do as president about this serious problem? SENATOR CLINTON: Debra, I hear about that from so many people, particularly people like yourself who are self-employed, working for small employers who don\'t offer health insurance. I remain committed to providing quality affordable health care for every American. Now, some people might say, well, Senator, didn\'t you try that before, you know, back in 1993 and 1994? And I did. I worked at my husband\'s request to try to see if we could do what was necessary to create a system that everybody could be part of. And we were not successful, and we made a bunch of mistakes, and I\'ve learned from all of that. And I have the scars to show what we went through. And back then, I\'m not sure that enough people really accepted the fact that what we\'d always had was just no longer going to be successful in a new global economy where our businesses are competing with companies and countries that don\'t have to provide health insurance or where everybody has to offer it so that, you know, everybody\'s in it together. So I\'m determined to work toward this. But what I\'ve been encouraged about, Debra, is that for the first time in the last several months, people are really focused on this. We\'ve got businesses talking with labor unions, talking, you know, with community people, talking with doctors and nurses and hospitals. And everybody\'s coming together. All levels of business, all levels of government. And so I\'m very encouraged that we\'re going to do what Americans do best when we finally roll up our sleeves and say, look, we\'ve got a problem. It\'s a problem of cost because, as you say, it\'s too expensive. It\'s a problem of competition because we are losing jobs in America, because we haven\'t figured out how to make quality health care affordable and available to everyone. And it\'s also a question of will. You know, political will. Are we going to roll up our sleeves and do this? And I think we will. So I\'m sure going to be campaigning about it around the country. I\'m going to be asking people in these conversations to give me their ideas, what they think would work, and I sure hope that, you know, you\'re going to be able to have affordable health care. One of my ideas that specifically would affect someone in your age category, which is my age category, is to let people who don\'t have insurance between 55 and 65 buy into Medicare. That\'s one idea that we\'ve had floated around that we could look at. Or buy into the federal employee health benefits plan, which is what takes care of Senators like me. So a lot of good ideas, but I\'m determined that we\'re going to come up with a better system so that I don\'t have to hear the stories that I hear about people who are really left out, bankrupted, denied medical care when they need it most. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Timothy from Honolulu says, ""We\'ve always admired the great job Bill and you did in shielding Chelsea from life in a fish bowl, and in the process raising her to be such an intelligent and well poised lady. We were wondering, now that she\'s an adult accomplished in her own right, do you expect she\'ll be taking a more active and visible role in your upcoming campaigns than she has in previous campaigns?"" SENATOR CLINTON: One of the things about raising an independent son or daughter, in my case, is you want them to do what\'s right for them, and that will be up to her. What I appreciate is the fact that being in public life has a lot of great benefits and privileges, but the families of people in public life have, you know, unfortunately been put in that fish bowl, as you say. And what I\'ve tried to do and what I admire about other people, including our president currently in the White House and others, is, you know, we shouldn\'t be exposing our children and other relatives. That\'s not, in my view, part of the political process that we really need to do. So I appreciate what you said, and, obviously, I turn to her for advice and support in every way, and I will continue to do so. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Michael from New Rochelle, New York, asks, ""What are you going to do to specifically battle terrorism and keep the United States safe?"" SENATOR CLINTON: New Rochelle is another neighbor of mine. We\'re both outside of New York City. As you know living in New Rochelle, we went through such a horrible time after 9/11. Every one of us in the greater New York area knew somebody who was affected. That gives us perhaps a keener awareness of the dangers we face. Sometimes it can seem like 9/11 was a long time ago or a very long way away. When I travel around the country and talk to people who weren\'t there, weren\'t affected. But just this morning, I was at Ground Zero with victims who had been afflicted by the toxic dust that was released because of the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings. We have people dying. We have people unable to breathe. We have a retired NYPD officer fighting for his life in one of our hospitals right now. His son is going to be my guest at the State of the Union tomorrow night. So 9/11 and the threat of terrorism is never very far away from my mind. And I intend to do everything I can for us to remain vigilant and prepared. We\'ve made some progress in the last year since 9/11, but not nearly enough. Our system is not as focused on the threats we face as I would like it to be. And I want to continue to advocate for more resources and better funding and more personnel to protect our borders, our ports, our mass transit systems. We\'ve done a good job on passenger aircraft but not as good a job on all of the materials, the freight that is shipped by air. We need to be vigilant about who\'s coming in and out of our country. We try to stop terrorism wherever we can beyond our borders by having better cooperation with people around the world. So this is a primary goal of mine, to make sure that we are as well prepared as possible. I can\'t sit here tonight and tell you that there will never be another attack although I pray there will not be. But we want to know that we\'ve done everything we can to prevent that from ever happening to anyone again. The scars of 9/11 and the lives of the people that I serve and represent in New York are still present every single day, and it remains, you know, my primary obligation to make sure that we take care of those who were affected and their families and do everything I can to prevent that from happening anywhere in our country again. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Linda from Pensacola, Florida, asks, ""Do you plan to end our dependence on foreign oil?"" SENATOR CLINTON: Linda, I do. It\'s probably longer and more wonkish than I can tell you in a brief web chat, but just briefly, let me say that I\'ve put on my web site a lot of the legislation that I\'ve championed and my plans for how we decrease our dependence on foreign oil. You know, obviously, this is a security issue as well as a jobs issue. Securitywise, we know that, if we don\'t move away from our dependence on foreign oil, we are literally over the barrel. From people who do not wish us well and not just in the Middle East and not just places like Iran, but Venezuela. And we\'re also at the mercy of very unstable regimes than other parts of the world. So I don\'t think there\'s a higher security priority, and the previous question about terrorism goes hand in hand because we can better deal with the terrorist threats we face if we are not funding them through all kinds of means where they get money that literally comes out of our pocket because we are so dependent upon the natural resource that they have in abundance. So we also, though, need to look at this as a jobs issue. We need to create new and good-paying jobs in America. And alternative energy. What I like to call smart energy, home-grown energy, would be a tremendous way of giving a lot of our people a better future, helping them to have a more secure foothold in this very competitive global economy. So I think we\'ve got to do more to look for alternatives. I support all kinds of ethanol. I support looking at the solar and geo thermal and certainly trying to do more on hydrogen, which are longer term goals. I think we have to do more on conservation and energy efficiency. I\'m really impressed with what California has done over 30 years. Because they have imposed conservation and energy efficiency standards, they have kept flat their energy use, and the rest of the country has just, unfortunately, continued to use more and more energy. We\'ve got to do something to make our transportation system more fuel efficient. And although there are some who think it\'s, you know, a difficult problem, I would like to see us approach the question of how we can use the great coal reserves we have without polluting the environment and adding to global change. I\'ve asked to take away the subsidies from big oil and put it into a strategic energy fund that would be used comparable to what he did with the Manhattan Project, responding to Sputnik, the Apollo project. Using the energy fund with a windfall tax on the oil companies taking away their subsidies, to expedite the creative genius of Americans. And I was up at a plant of GE\'s, their research facility, which is in upstate New York, and I saw what we can do if we use our imagination and our know-how. And I would also very much like to see us form an agency within our government that put all of this on a fast track, that went out to our universities, our colleges, our garages where creative people are thinking about how to make solar and wind and everything else much more commercially applicable. Let\'s put this on a fast track. There\'s no reason we can\'t do it. But the federal government has to make some investments in order for it to happen. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Jean from New Jersey has a question, on a lighter note. What\'s your favorite movie? SENATOR CLINTON: My favorite movie. I\'ve had favorite movies at different stages in my life. When I was very much younger, The Wizard of Oz was my favorite movie. I just loved imagining myself being there with Dorothy and being part of that great adventure that she had. Probably when I was in college and law school, Casablanca. I watched it I don\'t know how many times. It always was so much fun. By the time we watched it over and over again, we were actually reciting the dialogue. And I suppose in the last years, Out of Africa. I love Meryl Streep and Robert red Ford. Those are three of my favorite movies. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Rachel in Austin, Texas, asks, our relations with the international community have deteriorated over the last several years. What will you do to mend our relationships with the other countries? SENATOR CLINTON: I think this is the most important task the next president will face, and I intend to tackle it head on. I have been fortunate over the last 15, 16 years to travel widely representing our country, to know many of the leaders that are currently running their countries and those who are coming in to power. We have to send a clear message that the United States wants to lead the world, but we want to do it through cooperation, building alliances, making more friends than enemies. We cannot kill, occupy, jail all of the bad guys who wish us ill, but we sure can surround them. We can deter them. We can defeat them. If we have people rooting for us, and what\'s happened in the last six years tragically, because the world was with us after 9/11. They were there with us. They wished us well. They wanted to be part of the fight against the terrorists. And we have so squandered that good will. And we\'ve got to rebuild it. And that means starting at the top with a president who will send a message to the rest of the world that we want to work together. We believe in negotiations, and we want to have diplomatic efforts. I don\'t understand why our current President won\'t talk to people that he considers bad. I mean, look, there are a lot of bad actors in the world, but I think it\'s a sign of strength, not weakness, to engage in a process with these people because, frankly, you can learn something. You know, one of the first rules of warfare is know your enemy, and we\'re flying blind because we won\'t sit down and try to figure out what these people really want, who\'s calling the shots, how we can better deter them. All during the Cold War, Republican and democratic presidents talked to the leaders in the Soviet union. After Richard Nixon\'s break through, we talked to the leaders in China. Now it\'s as though we are over in one point of the world and looking out and pointing fingers and making judgments. So we don\'t have the good will, and we are not being smart about how we can better solve our problems. So I agree that we\'ve got to have a different approach, and I intend to do that not only through this campaign by talking about it and putting up ideas that I think would make a difference. But as President, going out there and making it clear that we want to solve problems together. One last point about this because literally I could talk for the rest of this web chat. You know, when President Bush pulled out of Kyoto, I thought that was a mistake. But an even bigger mistake was he refused to go into any other process. If you don\'t like what was negotiated at Kyoto, well, don\'t turn your back and pretend that global climate change isn\'t real because it is, and it is affecting our climate, and it is going to have an increasingly big impact on how people live. So come up with a different process. But don\'t walk away from the problem. Just because you don\'t deal with the problem doesn\'t make the problem go away. So on that and on so many issues, we need to get back into a dialogue with the rest of the world. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Alexis from Anondale, Virginia, asks, ""What will you do to insure that middle class Americans can afford a college education?"" SENATOR CLINTON: You know, I hear about this problem all the time. College is increasingly expensive. Everybody knows that. And it\'s very hard, with the cost of everything else going up, for most middle class families to afford to save and pay for college. You know, that means that, number one, a lot of kids don\'t go who would be college material because they can\'t afford to start. A lot of other kids don\'t finish because they get there and they can\'t afford to complete their education. And thirdly, a lot of kids go and tough it out, often working, you know, jobs, sometimes more than one job, and they get out, and they have a lot of debt, which really hangs over them, making it very difficult for them to get started with their own lives and families. So we\'ve got to get the cost of college down. We need much more in the way of college aid. We also need to get back to need based aid because a lot of kids who are really good prospects for college, they may not be the A student, but they\'re the solid B student, or they\'re the really hard working C student. And now we\'ve cut so much of the aid that used to be based on need and shift it over to merit that a lot of these kids aren\'t having a chance, and I don\'t think it\'s smart or fair. We also need to get the cost of college loans down, cut the interest rates. We\'re trying to do that in the Congress now. But I believe this is a big problem because, if you actually look at the numbers, we haven\'t done that much to increase the percentage of our kids who actually graduate from college. And in a competitive global economy like the one we face today, we need to get our best educated kids out there competing. College, you know, you don\'t have to go to college to be a good person or to get a good job, but increasingly a lot of the jobs are really dependent upon additional education. So I\'m hoping that we\'ll get the costs down and we\'ll enable many more people to start and to finish without that huge debt load, which I would like to see much more forgiveness to if we could get kids to graduate and then go into public service jobs, take some of the jobs that we really need to have filled. We should be forgiving their debt as well. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our final question tonight is from Nancy in Wisconsin. Nancy says, ""I\'m one of the baby boomers who now looks at retirement as an impossible dream. I\'ve worked hard all my life, and I\'m discouraged. What can you tell me and others like me that will give us some hope?"" SENATOR CLINTON: Well, Nancy, I understand the discouragement because the cost of living has gone up. A lot of the pensions that used to be guaranteed for people are no longer available. A lot of workers have lost their pensions because of decisions made in the corporate boardrooms, or companies have gone bankrupt and just shed all of their responsibilities to hard working employees like yourself. Social security is there. It\'s an absolutely critical part of anyone\'s planning for retirement, and I will do everything I can to make sure it\'s protected and that it will be available to you and to others. But we\'ve got to come up with some new ways of helping you save for retirement and making sure that you\'re not going to be left hanging, either by your employer or by your government through Social Security. So I\'m looking at some ideas about how to help you and other people who are hard working like you make investments in accounts that will be safe and will be on top of social security, that will be there when you need it, when you\'re ready for retirement. This is a huge issue because pension security, retirement security is something that is really part of the basic bargain that I believe we should have between our government and our people. And it\'s something I\'m going to be focused on during this campaign. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Great. Well, that\'s it for tonight. Thank you, Senator. We\'ll see you tomorrow night. SENATOR CLINTON: See you tomorrow night. 7:00. Same place, same time. And I want to thank everyone who logged on tonight to watch and everyone who submitted a question. I hope you\'ve learned a little bit more about what I\'m believing and trying to do and really helped this conversation about our country get started. Iraq, energy, health care, we\'ve covered a lot of ground, and these are all concerns that are very important to me. So please log back on tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. eastern so we can keep this conversation going. Send me more questions, ask me anything you\'d like. I want everyone to be part of the discussion because we need everyone to be part of the solution. So thank you so much. And I hope see you tomorrow.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 23, 2007","b'Remarks in a ""Let the Conversation Begin Webcast""'","b""SENATOR CLINTON: Hello, and welcome back, those of you who logged on last night. And welcome to those of you who are joining us for the first time tonight. I thought last night's questions were really interesting, and I'm looking forward to the ones that you have asked me for this evening. And tonight we're having this conversation just hours before the President's State of the Union address, so I think there's a lot to talk about. So let's get started. Crystal Patterson, our campaign blogger, is here with me again. So, Crystal, what's tonight's first question? CRYSTAL PATTERSON: First question comes from Kathy in New Briton, Connecticut. She says, I watched you last night and thought you did great. My question is how would you help our reserves who get hurt? I understand, because they're reserves, they don't get the same pay or medical help. SENATOR CLINTON: Kathy, thank you so much for raising this. This is an issue I've been working on for the last 3 years. And you're right. There used to be a big disparity between the active duty military and the national guard and reserve members. They were not given the same access toward health care and credit toward retirement, and we've begun to change that. I teamed up with one of my Republican colleagues, Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and we started with legislation to make sure our guard and reserve members and their families had access to health insurance. Not just when they were deployed or activated, but all the time, because what we found is that a lot of them were self employed or worked for small employers who didn't provide health care. And just like in the civilian world, they didn't have health insurance for themselves and their families. So we are beginning to rectify that. We still have some work to do, but at least we've made some progress. It's been one of the most heartbreaking experiences for me to travel around New York and talk to our reservists and our Guard members and hear about how difficult it was for them to make sure their children have health insurance, and here they were serving our country. I think we're making progress, but keep our feet to the fire because we have a lot more work to do. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Susan in Greensboro, North Carolina. Susan says, I keep hearing that the U.S. economy is good. Please, how can that be when we owe trillions of dollars to foreign countries? Don't you think we need a reality check? SENATOR CLINTON: That's a great comment, Susan. Yes, I do think we need a reality check. You know, the reality is that, when this President came into office, we had a balanced budget and a surplus, and we were positioned with those funds to be able to deal with some of the problems that we face as a nation. You know, we do have to make sure that social security is there in the future. We've got to provide funding for Medicare so that we take care of our seniors. A lot of other investments and opportunities that we were poised to take care of. Well, that's all gone, as you know, and we now are in a series of very large deficits. Our debt is growing. And the problem that you point out is we owe a lot of money to foreign lenders. Now, what does that mean? Well, it means that, in order to pay the interest on our debt, we have to entice foreign banks and foreign investors to buy our debt instruments, and that's how we keep our government going. And who are some of the people we owe the most money to? Well, like the government of China. And lots of times people ask me as I travel around New York, you know, why can't we get tougher on China to make sure they live up to trade agreements? And I say, you know, I wish we were getting tough because there's a lot to be concerned about, but I think this administration can't figure out how to get tough on its banker. And, in fact, that is what we have created is a situation where we're now this very large debtor nation, and that is going to undermine our competitiveness. It undermines our strategic leadership in the world. So there is a lot to be concerned about. I'm hoping that, in this new Democratic congress, we start moving back toward fiscal responsibility. We are certainly going to be trying to tighten the budget rules that worked so well in the 1990s. You know, you can't do spending or even tax cuts unless you can figure out how to pay for them. That's what worked for us in the '90s. We need to get back to it, but we also have to be sensitive to the fact that there's a lot of problems that we've left untended in the last years that we're also going to have to address like health care, like energy investments and climate change. So we have to strike the right balance. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Our next question is from Peg in Corning, New York. Tonight the President will give his State of the Union speech. What are your thoughts leading up to this, and is there anything specifically that you're listening for? SENATOR CLINTON: You know, the State of the Union is a time for the president to come and report to Congress and the people. I think that we need to make our union stronger than it is right now. I'm sure the president will put the best face on it from his perspective, but if we're honest, we know that we are facing very dangerous and difficult situations in Iraq and with Iran and North Korea and, you know, the terrible problems in Darfur and disease and so many difficulties that we have to confront. And here at home I know very well that, in places like Corning, New York, where there are a lot of wonderful, hard working people, it is a more difficult task to have a middle class lifestyle and afford health care and education and all the other costs. So I think the president has his work cut out for him. Now, I will be listening for any overture that he makes to the Democratic congress because I believe in getting things done. You know, I worked very hard in Corning, for example, you know, with a wonderful New York company called Corning to solve some problems and create new opportunities for that great company. So I don't really care where the good ideas come from. I just want to roll up our sleeves and get to work. I hear the President's going to talk about health care, which I'm very happy to hear although, from what I hear about his proposals, I can't say I support those. But the very fact that he's talking about how we can get the universal health care coverage perhaps gives us an opportunity to work together. Similarly, he's going to be talking about energy. Again, I don't think he'll go far enough. I don't think he'll have the kind of proposal that I believe will move us toward energy independence, but, again, opening the door, maybe inviting the democrats to work with him, moving away from the very divisive partisanship that he and the former Republican congress displayed is a good sign because we have a lot of work to do here in America. And I hope tonight we have an invitation for all of us to work together. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Our next question is from Laura in Chicago, Illinois. She says, we are a middle-class family with two great kids with parents that work very hard, sacrifice as much as they can and volunteer to help the school community as much as possible. Despite our best efforts, we can't afford health care. The only place we can afford a home is in a drug and gang infested neighborhood, and we can't save a penny for the future. What would you do to help young middle class families like ours to have a better prospect for the future? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, you have really summed up the problem that is not just confronting young middle class families, but so many of our families. And I applaud you for working as hard as you can and having your family stay tight together with your parents and your kids. But I really sympathize because it is harder to maintain the quality of life and the standard of living that we should take for granted in America. So you need help from your government, and I don't think that should be, you know, something that people turn their noses up at. Because I know that, you know, when my father got back from World War II, our country did a lot to get us up and going. And we had great schools and road programs that connected up our country. And we had a wonderful commitment about how we were going to plan for the future and have a better life. Well, that's what we need to get back to. I think we need to renew the promise of America for families like yours. So what does that mean? It means we tackle health care costs. We've got to get them down, and we have to provide quality affordable health care. On Sunday I put forward a proposal that would insure every child. I want to go to the point, where if you're a family of four making several thousand dollars a year, you'll be eligible for the family health care program. I want to make health insurance affordable for everyone. We have to give you planning for the education of your children. We have to make it easier for you and your husband to save. I have some proposals about how we can do that. With your parents, I assume they're still working, as you said in your question. Well, let's make sure that they can save for retirement, that they are able to be as independent as possible. We've had the retirement system really ripped out from under Americans. You know, the kind of defined benefit pensions that previous generations counted on are really a vanishing breed. The defined contribution, we have to make it easier for people to invest, and we have to put, you know, more information into the marketplace so people can make good decisions and plan for the future. We also need to be sure that we start to tackle energy costs. You know, it's something that is not going to go away, and we have to help families by giving them better tools to conserve and be more efficient and make better choices in the marketplace. There is really a lot that can be done at the governmental level, but I want to add another factor here. For a lot of our hard working families, I think they feel kind of let down, even betrayed by their employers. You know, there's not that sense that we're all in this together. And too many of our corporate leaders are not really sharing the wealth with their employers. Productivity is up. That means Americans are working harder. We actually work harder than people anywhere in the world on average. And profits are up for our companies. But where are the wage increases? Where are the you know, the benefits that should accrue to hard working Americans. So I would really like to call on corporate leadership to do more, and I want to support in every way I can the union movement in our country because a strong union movement has really been part of the American dream and one of the pillars of the American middle class. We're going to try in this democratic congress to make it easier for people who want to join unions to do so. We're going to try to make it easier to bargain. We've got to get back to a balance of power. All of the power is on one side of the economic equation, namely with the employers, and employees can't really, you know, get their fair share of the wonderful wealth and benefits that are being created for people at the higher end of the income spectrum. You know, that doesn't work for America because, with all due respect, America was not built and become a great country because we have rich people. You can find rich people anywhere in the world. We're a great country because of families like yours, and I hope that we're going to get back to more of a balance and provide some of those building blocks again that will give you and your family a leg up on a better future. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Our next question is from Tom in Roanoke. If elected president, would you make the FDA into a true champion of good for the people instead of just a lackey for the enormous drug companies? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, I'm really glad you asked that because I have been fighting to, you know, reassert the independence and the scientific standing of the FDA. You know, the FDA, still, despite all of its problems, remains the gold standard for all the drug and food safety in the world. But you obviously have followed this, and you know that what has happened in the last six years is the politicization of the FDA. I had a real struggle with them over something called Plan B, which is the morning after pill for contraception, and because of ideology, this administration didn't want the FDA to make its judgment about this particular drug based on its safety and its effectiveness. So I and my colleague, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, we waged a battle saying, we're not going to tell you how to decide. We want you to decide based on the best evidence and follow the weight of science. So what I'm hoping is that we will be able to reassert the independence and the integrity of the FDA. We also have to buttress the FDA's ability to not just approve drugs, but to follow what happens with those drugs, to do the kind of after approval testing. We need more comparative effectiveness, something that I have been advocating and passed an amendment to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Let's compare drugs, and so we know that consumer, the clinician, whether these drugs are good. Whether they really make a difference. And, finally, you know, the FDA is responsible for a lot of our food supply, but they don't have the personnel and resources necessary, and we've had some really tragic situations in the last couple of years where E. Coli has killed people and been traced to our vegetables, our produce. The FDA is responsible for that part of our food supply. I think we should have one agency responsible for food safety, but until we can get to that kind of gold standard, let's increase the resources going to the FDA, and let's put it back into the business of science and not ideology dictated from political leaders. That's my goal. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Pierre from Georgia asks, what will you do to restore confidence and the integrity in our voting system? SENATOR CLINTON: Oh, Pierre, this is a passion of mine. I've introduced a very comprehensive bill called the count every vote act because, unfortunately, we have discovered ever since our 2000 election, we have lots of problems with the integrity of our voting system. Many of you know the problems we've got with the electronic voting machines, and we've got to have better standards and make sure that we're not engaged in buying machines that have owners and companies with conflicts of interest. We've got to have better protection and safety against hacking or any kind of interference with these machines. There are other problems as well. We, unfortunately, have seen a history of intimidation, people being called and told that they shouldn't vote, or they are being told to vote on a different day than the actual election, or having a flier when they come out of church which says, if you've ever had a parking ticket, you're not eligible to vote. I mean, horrible kinds of interference and destruction of the most important constitutional right that a citizen has, the franchise to exercise his or her voice. There's a lot that I want to do to improve the voting system, and maybe now that we have a democratic congress, we will tackle this. I know that that is on the minds of a lot of my colleagues, and it is something I hear about everywhere. People are constantly asking me, what can we do to get the voting system to once again have integrity, to earn the confidence of the people? You know, we're supposed to be the model of democracy to countries around the world. We cannot afford to have a voting system that is a laughingstock and where people, you know, basically don't believe in it anymore. That would be the beginning of the end for the trust that is needed in a democracy like ours. So I'm going to keep that on the very top of my priority list and work with my fellow democrats to try to make some of the changes we need. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Dave in Detroit. The last few Presidents publicly showed their leisure time activities, such as fishing, jogging, swimming, tennis, et cetera. Are you an active exerciser or family sport participant? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, Dave, I love to take long walks. I'm a, you know, great walker and hiker. I'm a pretty poor jogger, to be just really honest with you. I run like a tortoise. But I love to get outdoors, and I love taking brisk walks. My husband and I do that all around where we live in New York. I also do work out. Not as often or as faithfully as I should, but I try to. And I love swimming. Whenever I get a chance. Any kind of water, whether it's the ocean, a lake, a pool, I really love being in the out of doors. And, you know, for me, I don't get enough time in the job that I have now to be, you know, outside in nature, but there's nothing I like better than going to one of the beautiful parks and preserves that we have near where we live. We take our dog Seamus, our Labrador, who, for those of you who followed our first dog in the White House, Buddy, who tragically died in a road accident, Seamus is Buddy's great nephew, and we go for long walks and have a wonderful time just being outside in all sorts of weather. That's where I feel very much at peace. Occasionally, I'll ride a bike. I used to do that much more when I was in the White House. I used to take a bike and go down to the pathway along the canal here in Washington and ride, you know, a long way, turn around and come back. I found it very restful. I don't get to do that quite as much as I'd like to. But those are the things that I love to do outdoors. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Lucinda from Ft. Myers, Florida, asks, what are your thoughts on bringing our troops home from Iraq, and what should be our exit strategy? Are you going to vote for additional funds to support this war? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, Lucinda, I'm against the president's escalation. I do not believe this is the right strategy. For more than a year and a half, I have advocated something quite different. I've said, look, we need to start redeploying our troops out of harm's way. We need to put pressure on the Iraqi government to stand up for itself, to provide its own security. And one of the ways it has to do that is by tackling the political and economic problems in the country. They have not been willing to step up and do that. And I would like to see our government put more pressure on the Iraqi government so that they would begin to do so. I don't see that as a part of this plan. The president makes some vague references to having benchmarks for the Iraqi government, but he doesn't share them with the Congress. We don't know what he's going to try to expect the Iraqi government to do. And, thirdly, I would very much like to see the international community involved in this. That's what the Iraq study group recommended. I think it's inevitable, and I don't understand why this White House won't engage with the neighbors in the region, including people that, you know, are obviously not friends of ours, like Iran and Syria. But I know that we've had examples where this has worked in the past. We had an Armed Services Committee hearing earlier today to have General Petraeus, who the President has chosen to lead this new strategy. He's a wonderful man, a great soldier. And I think a number of us on the committee told us we have great confidence in him. We just don't have confidence in this strategy. We want to protect our troops. We want to keep giving them the resources they need because they still don't have the armored vehicles that they are in need of, to protect themselves from these horrible bombs and improvised explosive devices that they are constantly in danger of. So we are absolutely united across the party divide to support our troops. And if the president is going forward with this strategy, as he appears to be doing, then we want to make sure we protect our young men and women. But it's the wrong strategy, and we wish he would reverse course and do what many of us would believe would have a better chance of requiring the Iraqi government to do its part. You know, making sure that the people in the region had an obligation that they had to fulfill to try to make Iraq more secure and stable. And begin, you know, moving our troops out of harm's way. That's what I would like to see him do instead of this escalation strategy he's following. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Eric from Kalamazoo, Michigan, says, although a diehard Democrat, I'm often disappointed by the lack of vocal support from party leaders on issues of gay and lesbian civil equality. I realize this is a divisive topic, but I would like to know, if you were made president, would you be comfortable in addressing issues and comfortable support plans, policies or initiatives that advance and protect the civil liberties of gays and lesbians? SENATOR CLINTON: Yes. And I feel very strongly about that. We have legislation pending in the congress to do two things, which I support wholeheartedly. One is to end discrimination against gays and lesbians. You know, the ENDA bill, it's called, has been pending for some time. I'm hoping we can bring it up and perhaps pass it in this Democratic congress because, as you may know, or as you personally have experienced, there is still discrimination in the workplace and in other settings in our society. And no matter how anyone might feel about some of these issues, which you have described, I think, as Americans, we certainly can be against discrimination against anyone. Secondly, I'd like to see the hate crimes legislation to be amended to include any kind of hate crimes on the basis of sexual orientation, which is what the language in the bill currently says. Well, I hope we can bring that up as well. Again, it's overdue. And, finally, I support civil unions. I think that this is a matter that historically has been left to the states because that's where decisions like these are made. But I have been on record supporting civil unions and equality in relationships. You know, there's so many discriminatory effects that people may not realize. You know, you know so well, not being able to inherit, not being able to own property together in some places, not being able to visit your partner in the hospital, and so much else. Well, I think that, again, regardless of how some have tried to politicize these issues in what I think of as a quite mean spirited way, pitting people against their brothers and sisters and neighbors and colleagues, I think that Americans are fair minded, and we'll move forward on an agenda of equality. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Aaron from San Diego, California, says, hi, Hillary. As a 20-something blogger, I am so thrilled to see that you will be publishing your own campaign blog on HillaryClinton.com. Can you tell us how you plan to further your conversation with the American people through your blog. SENATOR CLINTON: Well, I'm delighted that you asked about this because we are determined to have as broad a reach as possible to as many people as we can touch through our blog, through web chats like this, through our web site. But I'm going to turn to the expert here because Crystal's been working very hard, haven't you? I think she's getting a little sheepish looking here. But, Crystal, I think it would be appropriate for you to perhaps explain what we're trying to do with our blog. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Well, I think you put it well. We're just trying to continue the conversation with you and hopefully give people insight, as you're traveling around the country and talking to different people and seeing how they're reacting to you and, you know, what you have to say. Our blog is hopefully going to be a larger community of supporters who all want to see you go on to bigger and better things and generate some excitement. I think it's going to be a really fun place for people to kind of express themselves. Right now our biggest push is we're inviting people to put a blog post in to be our first guest blogger on the site. So we encourage everybody to go ahead and submit a blog post and let us know what you think. The conversation has started. SENATOR CLINTON: Well, you've heard it from someone with a lot more experience than I have. And I'm just thrilled to have Crystal on board, and I hope those of you who are blogging out there, that you'll post a submission for our guest blogger, that you'll follow what Crystal and others are doing and let us hear from you. Because, as I said in the very beginning, I want to have a conversation, and I want to choose as many different ways of having that conversation, and you can't have a conversation in America today if you don't utilize the web and involve as many people as possible. So I'm excited about what we're going to be doing. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Yeah, it's going to be great. Our next question is from Richie in White Plains. How did you start your political career? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, Richie, let me think. Are we going all the way back to grade school? I don't know, you know. You know, I really didn't have an electoral political career until I ran for the Senate. Richie is from a town, a city, a wonderful city near where I live, and I didn't run for office myself except in school until I ran for the Senate. But I've always been involved in politics, in supporting other people who ran for office, in working on behalf of causes that I cared about. And I would urge others to do that because there's, you know, maybe a problem right where you live in White Plains that you care about. I know young people who are working to clean up environmental problems where they live, who are working to help the homeless, who are organizing on behalf of the genocide in Darfur, who are actively involved in trying to work on HIV/AIDS and other diseases, global climate change. There's so many ways to be involved in issues as a means of becoming involved in politics because, ultimately, we have to change our governmental decisions to affect a lot of these issues. Global climate change is a great example. You can care about it. You can talk about it. You can read about it. But if you make it a political issue, then perhaps we can start doing something about it in our country. And so I hope that you will take a look at all the different ways to be involved, and certainly working on a campaign. I'd love to have you work on mine, but there are a lot of other people in the area where you live who have campaigns. They are involved in actively organizing around issues, and if you look for an opportunity to do that, I think you'll find that it can be quite rewarding and fun. So I hope you do get involved. CRYSTAL PATTERSON:  Melissa from Martinez, Georgia, has our last question for this evening. With the rising cost of health insurance, where do you stand in helping making sure all Americans have health insurance? Like large employers get large discounts to help provide coverage to their employees. Wouldn't the U.S. get a big discount for purchasing insurance by the millions to cover all U.S. citizens? SENATOR CLINTON: Well, that's a very smart point because it's true. There is one huge purchasing pool that is known as the federal employees health benefit plan, and if you're a federal employee, you have choices among all different kinds of insurance policies, and the rates are good because the federal government bargains for better rates. If you are a veteran who gets health care at the VA, the VA gets to bargain to get prescription drug costs down. We're trying to get that same opportunity to negotiate in the Medicare prescription drug program. Because the point you make is absolutely right. You know, large employers, you know, bargain with pharmaceutical companies, with insurance companies in order to get the costs down because they buy in bulk. It's like when you go to a discount store, you buy in bulk, you're going to get a lower price. Well, we have a huge health insurance market in America. We've got to figure out how to use that market power. And it's especially important because we pay the highest cost for health care in the entire world, and yet we do a lot of the innovation and funding for advances in medical research from the federal government. So it's kind of ironic that we're paying for better health care but Americans don't get the benefit of the really lower prices that should flow to those of us who have actually paid for it. So it doesn't really add up or make sense. So I'm going to be coming forward with proposals in the weeks and months ahead. Yes, I'm taking on health care again because I think that it's one of the most important issues facing us, and I hear too many stories about too many people who cannot afford health care, and we're going to do everything we can to at least advocate for a system that I would like to see implemented when I become president about trying to provide quality, affordable health care and save money for families, for businesses, and for our country in doing that. Well, I can't believe how fast it's gone by again, Crystal. I mean, really. And thanks to all of you for logging on again tonight. And I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow, same time, same place, 7:00 p.m. so that we all can keep the conversation going. Thanks again for joining me."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 24, 2007","b'Remarks in a ""Let the Conversation Begin Webcast""'","b'HILLARY CLINTON: Hello and welcome back. We have a lot to talk about tonight because last night was the President\'s State of the Union address, and I know we have been getting a lot of questions about that. In fact, we\'ve gotten tens of thousands of questions in the last few nights. And I have really been impressed by how serious people are about the future of our country. So let\'s have that conversation again tonight and let\'s get started. Once again, Crystal Patterson, our campaign blogger, is here with me. So, Crystal, what\'s tonight\'s first question? CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our first question tonight is from Patricia in York, Pennsylvania. She asks, there was no mention of the Katrina disaster in the State of the Union. Did that strike you as odd? Isn\'t that a large part of the Union? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Patricia, that did strike me as odd. I know from talking from my friends and colleagues from the Gulf Coast, particularly New Orleans, that the promises the president made are just not being kept. They are more empty promises. It is so heart-breaking because this is a part of our union. These are our fellow citizens and we need a much more serious effort. So I\'m hoping that with the Democratic Congress, we will be able to push things along, that we\'ll be able to try to sort out some of the continuous bureaucratic snafus that have presented people from getting what they needed and making decisions about their futures. There are thousands of people who are still displaced from their homes in southern Louisiana and even along the Mississippi coast. Well, let\'s figure out what we\'re going to do to try to help those people. This was one of the worst blots on President Bush\'s record. It was disgraceful the way they were so inattentive and different. It has been equally disgraceful how incompetent and really inadequate their response has been. So I\'m going to continue to talk about Katrina. I\'m going to continue to work with my colleagues from the region as well as others of us that are concerned about this to see if we can\'t make some progress now that we have a Democratic majority. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question comes from Alexander in Palm Springs, California. After hearing the State of the Union address last night, do you agree or disagree with President Bush\'s plan for medical insurance for the people of this country? If you disagree, what would you do differently? HILLARY CLINTON: Alexander, we didn\'t get a lot of details last night. It was a couple of lines in a nearly hour-long speech. So I\'m trying to make sure that I understand exactly what the president is proposing. And what I worry about is that the President\'s plan wants to cap the deduction that you get for the cost of health care and essentially use that to try to help uninsured people get some tax benefits to go out into the marketplace and buy health insurance. There is no real market yet. This would require that we would have to tell insurance companies they would have to insure people, even with preexisting conditions, which they don\'t want to do, that they would have to keep their cost down in order for a lot of the people who are insured and people who are just above that line to be able to afford it. So I\'m going to be focusing on a more comprehensive approach because the other problem that I have with the President\'s plan is the way he would help to pay for this is by cutting federal funding for public hospitals and community health centers. That is really a false choice in my book. We shouldn\'t be cutting the money that goes to actually give people health care to get them into the insurance market. I will be proposing in the next weeks or so my own plan about how we get to universal coverage. I\'m pleased, however, let me add that the President was willing to talk about health care and come forward with a proposal. I have told members of his administration that\'s a good sign and we need to figure out how we can work together to try to make progress. But at the end of the day, we\'re going to have a much more comprehensive approach if we are going to tackle the problems of coverage so that everybody is insured, quality so what you are insured for is good quality care, cost because, it\'s way too expensive in America compared to the rest of the world and we don\'t even have the highest quality health care compared to the rest of the world. And competitiveness, we are losing jobs because of the health care costs that are imposed on our businesses. So I have got a lot of ideas. Stay tuned. We\'ll talk about that later. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: We are going to take a break from the live questions to respond to Steve Clemons who posted the following on the Huffington Post blog. Would you be the kind of president who gave your staff license to challenge you, to force consideration of every last policy action, to put bad news before good news? Or do you like your team to validate your views and not challenge you? HILLARY CLINTON: Steve, I think you can ask anybody who works for me that I like people who challenge me. I like people with expertise and experience and strong opinions. Now, I may push back because I also have my opinions, but I want that kind of give and take and debate. I don\'t think any one person -- and certainly no president in these difficult and complex times -- have all the answers. And I don\'t think you find answers from an ideological starting point. I believe in looking at the facts and the evidence, trying to understand what you\'re trying to achieve in terms of the values that you have and the objectives that you\'re setting forth in order to get results. What we\'ve seen in the last six years is exactly the opposite. It is as though there is a little echo chamber where everybody is saying the same thing where the president, from what we\'ve been told, is rarely challenged or confronted. That is not the kind of office that I run today. That is certainly not the kind of White House that I would want. Another thing, I would like to get a broad cross-section of people. I don\'t want people who already agree with me. I want honest, experienced, hard-working patriotic people who want to be part of a team, the American team, in order to understand what we have to do to meet the challenges of today. So I hope that if you ever run across anybody who works for me, you will probably hear that I have got high standards because there is a lot at stake. I want people to work to the best of their ability and I want them to be part of a team, even if the other members of the team disagree. I think through that process you can come to better conclusions. And I\'m always open to new evidence, new ways of looking at things, asking those hard questions about the direction we\'re headed. I think it leads to better decision-making. And sometimes it is a little messy because you\'re trying to get to a point after hearing all sides and you want to keep searching for the very best outcome, the consensus that\'s going to stand the test. But that, to me, is a better way of making decisions than this kind of top-down, intimidatory style where you have to tell them what they want to hear. That\'s been a disaster and I certainly hope we can get beyond that. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Alice in Cornelius, North Carolina. What are your plans and proposals for domestic homeland security? Would you approve a budget that would aid in security services such as the FBI and CIA to carry out specific duties in fighting terrorism? HILLARY CLINTON: Alice, this has been a principal concern ever since 9/11. As a senator representing New York on that horrible, horrible day, I saw firsthand and I still deal with the consequences today of our lack of preparedness, our failure to communicate adequately of the stress we were facing. I have very strong feelings about this. I introduced some of the very first legislation after 9/11 that would try to get money to our law enforcement agencies, to our intelligence agencies. But equally important, getting it to our local communities. They are the first line of defense with our local fire departments and our police departments and our paramedics and our health departments and so many others that are working diligently to try to be prepared in the case of a natural disaster like Katrina which we were just discussing or a terrorist attack. So from my perspective, we need to do many things simultaneously. We need to beef up our Homeland Security funds so we protect our border. We protect our ports, our mass transit systems. We have done better with airline passengers since 9/11. Airline cargo, we still have work to do. Our vital infrastructure like bridges and tunnels, some of our landmark buildings. We have got to have the very best security. It\'s not just for the public sector. The private sector has to be involved. They own a lot of our buildings. They are landlords for buildings. They run our big malls and our sports stadium. This has to be a partnership. Recently we got the administration to set standards for the chemical industry. We have so many chemical plants in our country that could be disasters if they were ever attacked and there were explosions. That could affect literally millions of people in certain highly congested areas. We have to do a better job of sharing information among levels of government. The federal, state and local governments. We have to get all of our federal agencies working together, the Homeland Security, FBI, the CIA, counterterrorism centers. All of that has to be much more streamlined and focused so that the police on the beat in the car who stops somebody that may be suspicious, may be somebody that the FBI is looking for, they will have that information, they will be able to immediately respond. So we have a lot of work to do. We have made progress since 9/11, but, you know, the 9/11 Commission which did such a great job in analyzing what happened on 9/11 came out with a report card last year and basically gave our federal government a D. That\'s not a very good grade. It may not be a failing grade, but I sure wouldn\'t want to bring it home to my mother. We have to do a better job in trying to work together, get the money to follow the threat which is what the 9/11 Commission recommended, and then make sure that all levels of government and the public and the private sector are working together. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Judy in Seymour, Connecticut. I am a 69-year-old widow of 13 years struggling to get by on Social Security. I know there are many widows in my situation. If you were elected president, do you have any interest in this large population of Americans? And if so, what will you do to help? HILLARY CLINTON: Judy, I have a lot of interest. My 87-year-old mother lives with Bill and me. And I have many friends who are retired who are widowed or divorced, but are alone. They are living on either Social Security and a small pension, their own, or maybe a late husband\'s or their ex-husband\'s. So I am very concerned about this because as you know so well there are so many older women who are living alone and it is great that they\'re healthy enough, independent enough. But as you get older, you have, you know, some challenges. And certainly my highest priority is to protect Social Security. I consider it a solemn generational promise. And I was adamantly opposed to the President\'s plan to privatize Social Security because the very people it would have hurt the most are older women. I worried any move to undermine the guarantee of Social Security would throw a lot of women who are only above the poverty level today because of Social Security, I\'m going to continue to do everything I can to strengthen Social Security. There are some fixes we will probably have to make in order for the whole system to keep operating and I\'m going to, you know, be open to doing that. But I will never support privatizing this basic guarantee of financial security in our older years. I will also work to find different ways of adding to the savings that widows and single women have in their later years because Social Security is not enough and even Social Security with a small pension is sometimes difficult to get by on. So I will certainly be attentive and sensitive to these concerns. You know, as a woman myself who has a lot of friends, either already in your position or very close to it, I consider it a very important part of my responsibility to do everything I can to make sure that you get the help and support you deserve to have. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Virginia from Jensen beach, Florida asks, what will you do to ensure increased health care for our military personnel returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East as well as health care for the lifetime career veterans facing overcrowded facilities and long wait times for their appointments? HILLARY CLINTON: Boy, I am glad you asked that question because you may have noticed in the State of the Union last night that we didn\'t hear a single word about veterans. We heard a lot about our currently serving young men and women who we are so proud of and so grateful to. But, eventually, they will become veterans, and when they return home, they should be guaranteed access to the highest quality health care through the VA. And unfortunately, we\'ve had to fight with the Bush administration every year to fund the VA. I believe that we should have guaranteed funding for the VA. We shouldn\'t have to fight it out every single year in the appropriations process that goes on in Congress to decide how we are going to spend the money in the budget. And the VA has made a lot of improvements over the last ten or so years. I\'m very proud of the changes that were made in the Clinton Administration, moving toward information technology so we don\'t duplicate and lose the medical records and the test results. I am very proud of the power that was given to the VA when Bill was president to allow the VA to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. As your question implies, there are still long, long lines, waiting periods. We just haven\'t put together the services that are needed to take care of our returning vets. And, unfortunately, as you probably know, we\'re going to have so many young men and women with serious conditions going forward. You know, the battlefield is a 360-degree, 24/7 situation now. And many people are able to survive wounds that would have killed them in the first Gulf War and certainly Vietnam or World War II. What that means is that we have a lot of seriously injured young people with amputated limbs, with traumatic brain injury, with spinal cord injuries. And we owe them everything. I will be a very strong advocate for our veterans and not just in showing up at veterans\' gatherings and making a patriotic speech but in fighting for veterans, in fighting for their health care, in fighting for the VA, in fighting for fair treatment for vets. We have an all-volunteer military now. So to a great extent our military is composed of young men and women to really want to make a commitment to our country. We\'re so proud of them and grateful to them. But let\'s show it by taking care of them. Let\'s not just give lip service to their needs. Let\'s make sure that the VA is fully funded to meet the ongoing physical and mental health needs of our veterans. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Jamie in Illinois. HIV/AIDS in the USA, what will you do and make sure Americans are cared for? HILLARY CLINTON: This is an issue for me for a long time. Especially as a senator from New York, we have a very high population of people living with HIV and AIDS. I believe we need to provide the full range of medical care and support services for people who are afflicted with HIV and AIDS. I have been a strong supporter of the federal programs that fund treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS. And I will continue to do so. Here in our country, the fastest-growing group of people that are being infected with the disease are women of color, are women who are poor. They are often being left out of the service system and the programs that are available to treat people with HIV and AIDS. I want to be sure that everybody has access to the medical care that they need. We are going to have to do some work -- excuse me -- to get that done. I think it is very important that we recognize that the population is growing in our southern states. And up until now, there hasn\'t been enough treatment available for people in those states. I had a big fight -- You may know if you follow this issue this past year because the Ryan White Care Act is one of the principal vehicles for providing health care to people living with HIV/AIDS. What I really argued against was instead of keeping the money at the same level, the federal government should increase the amount of money available. And they wanted to take money away from my state of New York which still has the highest number of people in order to take care of the people who are suffering in other states. I want to take care of everybody. But why take it away from people who need it to give it to other people who need it? It is one of the reasons why we need a new president and why I am looking forward to being that president, to make sure that we take care of everybody who is afflicted with this disease. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Brian from New York says, how will you handle the current nuclear crisis in Iran and North Korea? HILLARY CLINTON: Let me get a glass of water here because I am losing my voice. I have think I have done too much talking in the several days. We are in a terrible situation because of the way this administration has mishandled both North Korea and Iran. With respect to North Korea, we had a crisis with North Korea in 1994 and we were able to prevent them from processing plutonium. That\'s the fastest, easiest way to get what you need for a nuclear weapon. The North Koreans being the North Koreans were cheating and they were trying to enrich uranium. They didn\'t breach the agreement about plutonium but they were cheating on the side trying to enrich uranium which is frankly harder to do. When the Bush Administration found out they were cheating, they said we are not going to talk to you anymore. We are taking the inspectors out. We are shunning you because you were cheating. That was, like, an open invitation to the North Koreans to process plutonium. As we have seen, they have produced some nuclear weapons. I think that was a backwards approach. We should have come down even harder on the North Koreans. We should have put even more inspectors in and we should have been very tough in negotiating with them directly. We made the same mistake with Iran. Instead of negotiating and dealing with Iran and figuring out what they were up to and trying to understand who was really calling the shots, this administration\'s attitude is ""we don\'t talk to bad people"" Well, I don\'t know why that\'s a very sensible policy in their view, but that\'s their policy. They stopped talking to Iran. Instead they told the British, Germans and the French, you go talk to Iran. So that went on for years with no real results and Iran is just continuing to push forward. I have advocated direct contact, engagement with both of these regimes. Do I agree with what they\'re doing? Of course, not. Do I trust them? Absolutely not. We dealt with the Soviet union all during the Cold War when they had thousands missiles pointed at us. We didn\'t stop talking to them even during the Cuban Missile Crisis. We gained valuable information that enabled us to take steps that led to the demise of the Soviet Union. I would urge that we do the same thing with Iran and North Korea. I would like to see the administration begin doing that sooner instead of later. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Great. Okay. Our next question comes from New Jersey. Andrea asks, what do you like to do when you are not working? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, sleeping is a good option, catching up on my sleep. Seriously, last night I talked about what I like to do outdoors. I love to walk. I love to hike. I love to bike. I love to swim in appropriate weather. And I love to go to movies. Bill and I go to movies as often as we can. We love to go out to dinner with our friends, sometimes just the two of us. There are a lot of favorite little places we enjoy going to. I love to read for pleasure. I just -- you know, I just like to chill out and do as little as possible. Putter around in my garden which is, you know -- I\'m not that great a gardener. I try to avoid killing anything I have. But I love being out there and think about what I can ask somebody else to do who has a much greener thumb than me. I love to spend time with my friends, just normal things that give me some real pleasure. Sometimes I like to clean my house, clean out my closets because there is a beginning, a middle and an end. And a lot of the work I do, there doesn\'t ever seen to be an end. You worry about North Korea and Iran and there is no way to get your arms around it all. Kind of normal stuff I like to do, I think, when I am not working. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Our next question is from Jacqueline in Wellesley, Massachusetts. As a college student concerned for the future of our environment, I was wondering if you had any plans to implement controls on CO2 emissions and further, how do you plan to address the ever growing crisis of global warming. HILLARY CLINTON: I see that your message is from Wellesley. I don\'t know if you are a Wellesley student or perhaps going to one of the other fine institutions around there or Wellesley High School. I spent four wonderful years at Wellesley College and really enjoyed myself there. I am glad you are worried about the environment. I think the changes we have to make are going to be driven by young people. We have dropped the ball. This administration has wasted six years. It looks like it will waste mostly the next two years instead of coping with and dealing with the challenge of global climate change. There is a lot we have to do. I want to draw your attention to something I will be involved in. I sit on the environment committee. It is now being chaired by my friend and colleague Senator Barbara Boxer from California. She is absolutely committed as all the Democrats are on the committee to trying to get a piece of legislation that we can, perhaps, get majority support for that moves us toward dealing with CO2 emissions. Now, we have a closely divided Senate so it won\'t be easy to do everything that we all think we should do. But we have got to make a start. It is disgraceful that our country is not on record as dealing with global climate change. Starting next week in the Environment Committee, we will start having forums on climate change and global warming. We will be having an open forum with every member of the Senate invited to come and state their position so we can try to figure out what\'s the consensus position. We\'re also going to be having later that week or next week, I can\'t remember which, we are going to be having a meeting with people from other countries who have dealt with global climate change. Look at what Great Britain has done. They set very strict standards about trying to get back to the 1990 levels and they\'re doing very well because they adopted both some carrots and some sticks. They have incentives for energy conservation and efficiency. They are working with polluting power plants. They have a comprehensive program. And the extra-added benefit is that it has helped to create thousands of new jobs in Great Britain because they are dealing with a problem by putting people to work, to actually make a difference. So stay tuned. I think you are going to see some positive action out of the Democrats in the Senate. CRYSTAL PATTERSON: Okay. Our final question for the evening comes from Patrick in South Dakota. He says, Senator Clinton, my name is Patrick. I live in a small town in South Dakota so my wife and I can stay close to our roots. We are recent college graduates and worked hard in college and continue to do so as graduates. We are finding the contrast our society lives in now, that is, getting an education equals success. What it should say is getting an education equals debt with high interest rates and the inability to buy a home, start a family and live a good life. With the rising cost of health care, interest rates on student loans, rising housing market and not being compensated for our education, what would you say to the youth of America to stay focused and go to school? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I think that is the message, that I understand completely the problems that you have just outlined. But we have to continue to educate our people in order to be competitive globally. And I would hope that we can give you some relief from some of these rising costs. It is incredibly damaging to someone\'s prospects for the future or the choices they can make in their life, if they are totally focused on having to pay back their debt. So I want to get the cost of education down. I want to get the interest rates on loans down. I want to give more forgiveness for debt for people who go into areas of shortage or need in our society, like math and science teachers or engineers. We have a lot of work that needs to be done in America and we aren\'t going to be successful if we make it so difficult for our young people to afford to go to college, stay in college and complete college. So I hope that in the next few years -- and this is one of the issues I am going to be running on for president -- I hope that we can get back to paging college affordable again, that we don\'t load people down with debt, that we can deal with the rising health care costs in a sensible way and that we can also, you know, try to close that gap between the very well off and everybody else because that\'s not good for America either. But I guess I would underscore the importance of an education. Despite the difficulties and the challenges, I really wish you and your wife well. You are exactly the kind of young people that build communities and being close to your roots, you know how important it is to really keep your family going and make something of yourself. And I wish you well, just as I do everybody who is watching tonight. I have to thank all of you for logging on tonight and for the last two nights. It has really gone by way too fast. I have enjoyed the conversation. I will be going out around the country. I will be in Iowa this weekend, the following weekend I will be in New Hampshire. I am going to be having face-to-face conversations. But I will continue to use this medium as well because I want you to hear directly from me and I want to have your questions. I am so sorry we couldn\'t answer the tens of thousands of questions that came in. It was really overwhelming. But I want to thank Crystal for all of her help. I hope when we launch our blog and Crystal starts reporting on the campaign that all of you will log on and share your thoughts with us. Meanwhile, I look forward to keeping the conversation going. And I wish all of you the very best. We\'ve got a lot of tough challenges in America but there is nothing we can\'t handle if we work together, we come up with sensible, practical solutions and we keep our eye on what\'s important, to renew the promise of America and to restore the greatness and respect for our country at home and abroad. That\'s what I intend to try to do during this campaign with ideas and with my vision for this country. And then in 2009, to have the chance as your president to do that as well. Thank you all and good night.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 7, 2007",b'Senate Floor Speech on the War in Iraq',"b'Mr. President, we are all well aware in this chamber that our country finds itself in a deepening crisis in Iraq, and we find ourselves at a moment of decision in the United States Senate. Nearly four years ago, our President rushed us into war in Iraq, a war now longer than American involvement in World War II, which next month will actually exceed the length of our own Civil War. For four years, members on both sides of the aisle have watched with shock and dismay as our President has made mistake, after misjudgment, after miscalculation. Even before the invasion ended, the Administration rejected the voluminous plans drawn up by the State Department to deal with the chaotic aftermath. The successful examples of the U.S. experience in Bosnia and Kosovo during the 1990s were summarily rejected. State Department and other officials with experience in nation-building were blackballed in favor of inexperienced ideologues who were selected on the basis of political litmus tests, including answering questions about whether they were for or against Roe v. Wade and whether they had voted for George W. Bush. Despite the urgent warnings of Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki and other senior military commanders, the necessary number of troops to ensure security and stability were not sent at the start of the conflict. Our men and women in uniform were ordered into harm\'s way without the necessary body armor or armored vehicles, a mortal error I have tried to correct time and again since I first learned of it. The strategic blunders now fill an entire library shelf of books, and they are certainly too numerous for me to list in the time allotted here. Through these four years, there has also been another abdication of responsibility. That was the failure of this Congress to engage in its constitutional obligation of the majority\'s refusal to hold the Administration accountable. In the election last year, the American people decided that the status quo was no longer acceptable. So we have a new Congress, and it is past time that we in this chamber do our duty to balance the President and provide a check against his failed policy in Iraq. There is a majority against this situation in Iraq; there is a bipartisan consensus in this chamber as well. The resolution reflects that consensus as it reflects the overwhelming majority of Americans. But a partisan minority seeking to shield the Administration\'s continuing failure in Iraq seeks to thwart the bipartisan majority and the will of the American people. This is not a debate about abstractions. I have seen the consequences of our involvement in Iraq, as have many of my fellow Senators. Three weeks ago, I visited Iraq to express gratitude to our soldiers, to meet with Iraqi leaders and U.S. commanders, and our troops on the ground. What I saw and what I did not see underscored my concerns. I saw American servicemen and women performing their duty admirably, but I did not see a strategy that under the current circumstances has much chance of success. The collective analysis of our intelligence community in the latest National Intelligence Estimate is that the term ""civil war"" does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict In Iraq. The bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission said, the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. Yet the President\'s response to the bipartisan commission and the latest National Intelligence Estimate does not match the urgency that is described. The so-called surge is not a new strategy, but a tactic that has been tried and failed. The absence of leadership on the part of the President leaves Congress no choice but to demonstrate the leadership that the American people and the reality on the ground demand. The previous two Congresses abdicated their duty. We must not. Every single day, our feet sink deeper into the sands. Every day the crisis worsens. To hide from this debate with our troops in such danger is wrong, plain and simple. The crisis in Iraq has fostered a crisis of democracy here at home. The American people expect a debate. Our troops are owed a debate. And our constitution commands that we debate. But a partisan minority, acting at the behest of the Administration, is standing in the way. This amounts to a gag rule on our democracy, contrary to the national security interests of the United States. Even though America voted for a new direction in Iraq, even though the majority of Senators oppose escalation in Iraq, we cannot get the Republicans to allow us to take a symbolic vote to condemn the escalation, much less a real vote to stop it. This resolution deserves a debate, it deserves a vote, and it deserves passage. Now, there are those in the chamber who invokes our brave troops, suggesting that a debate on the most important issue facing our country and facing our troops would somehow undermine the mission and weaken our nation. It is a pernicious, shameful argument, and it is dead wrong. Our democracy is stronger than that, and the American people and our troops deserve better than that. You know, our troops understand we are debating this war. We\'re debating it not just in this chamber; we\'re debating it in kitchen table conversations and around water coolers and standing in line at supermarkets. We\'re debating this war everywhere Americans gather. Indeed, our troops are debating this war, and the American people understand that it is the policy that undermines our national security and interests, not a vote disapproving the policy. This debate and this resolution have merit and purpose and it will, if permitted to go forward, begin the process of changing the policy. Otherwise, why would the Administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fought so hard to prevent us from having a debate and a vote? Because they understand that this will be the first step to restore our strength and renew our leadership around the world, to begin redeploying our troops out of Iraq and start on the long road to undoing the damage brought by the President, to America\'s leadership around the world. If you believe the escalation is the right strategy, then cast your vote for it. But if you believe, as the majority in this chamber believe, that escalation is not the right strategy, then cast your vote against it. But standing on the sidelines is no way to stand up for the troops. Now, there are many, both in the chamber and outside, who would wish to go further than this resolution and look for ways to bind the actions of the President and to require him to change course. I understand and agree with the frustration that has afflicted many of us in dealing with the President\'s policy, but if we can get a bipartisan vote against escalation, it will be the first time the Senate has exercised its constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance on the President. The first step for the Senate will be a giant leap toward accountability and toward the right end to this war. There is a big difference between calling for the end of this war and doing the difficult, painstaking work of building the political will within the Congress to take action. We, in the Senate, entrusted by our constituents to cast tough votes, should not have the luxury of standing outside the arena and lobbing criticism from within. Once we pass this resolution, we should go further. Rather than an escalation of US troops, which will not contribute to fundamentally changing the conditions on the ground, we should put pressure on the Iraqi government in a way that they will understand there are consequences to their empty promises and their continued inaction. Last week, the National Intelligence Council released the unclassified key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. That presents the consensus views of the United States intelligence community, and it underscores the need for a political solution. The NIE States that in the coming 12 to 18 months, the overall security situation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006. And ot goes on further to say that even if violence is diminished, given the current winner-takes-all attitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene, Iraqi leaders will be hard-pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the time frame of the estimate, namely, a year to a year-and-a-half. Even if, the intelligence experts argue, the escalation results in greater security, their best judgment is that the bloodshed and violence will continue to spiral out of control. So what should we do? Well, many of us believe -- and we\'ve been arguing for this and voting for this for more than a year-and-a-half -- that we have to chart a new course that emphasizes greater Iraqi responsibility. I still believe that is the path we should be taking. Instead, the President has chosen a very narrow course that relies heavily on American military force. I will be introducing legislation that I think offers a better alternative. First, my legislation will cap the number of troops in Iraq as of January 1, and will require the Administration to seek Congressional authorization for any additional troops. The President has finally said this is not an open-ended commitment in Iraq, but he is providing the Iraqis with an open-ended presence of American troops. Second, as a means to increase our leverage with the Iraqi government and to clearly send a message that there are consequences to their inaction, I would impose conditions for continued funding of the Iraqi security forces and the private contractors working for the Iraqis. My legislation would require certification that the security forces were free of sectarian and militia influence and were actually assuming greater responsibility for Iraqi security along with other conditions. We must not let US funds, taxpayer funds, be used to train members of sectarian militias who are responsible for so much of the violence in Iraq. Unfortunately, it appears that our funds to Iraqi security forces may be going to the people we are trying to restrain. A news report last week in an article entitled, ""Mahdi Army Gains Strength Through Unwitting Aid Of US,"" reported that the U.S. military drive to train and equip Iraq security forces has unwittingly strengthened anti-American, Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr\'s Mahdi Army militia, which has been battling to take over much of the capital city as American forces are trying to secure it. According to this news report, U.S. Army commanders, and enlisted men who are patrolling east of Baghdad said al-Sadr\'s militia\'s had heavily infiltrated the Iraqi police and Army units that they\'ve trained and armed. Said one soldier, ""they\'ll wave at us during the day and shoot at us during the night."" We need to inform the Iraqi government in no uncertain terms that there are consequences -- terms that there are consequences, that we will take funds away from their troops, not from our troops, many of whom still lack armored vehicles and counterinsurgency measure devices and communications equipment. And we will not fund the Iraqis if our troops are going to enter into sectarian battles where some of the participants have received American training and support. Third, I would hold the Administration accountable for their empty promises as well. My bill requires the Bush Administration to certify that Iraq has disarmed the militias; has ensured that a law has finally been passed for the equitable sharing of oil revenues; that the Iraqi government, under American influence and even pressure, has made the constitutional changes necessary to ensure rights for minority communities; that the de-Baathification process has been reversed to allow teachers, professionals, and others who join the Baath party as a means to get a job to serve in the Iraqi government. I would also require the Administration to engage in a regional diplomatic initiative including all of Iraq\'s neighbors to address Iraq\'s future and to understand and convey clearly that the United States expects Iraq\'s neighbors in the stability and security of the new Iraqi state. If these conditions are not met or are not on their way to being met within six months, a new Congressional authorization requirement would be triggered. Finally, I would prohibit any spending to increase troop levels unless, and until, the Secretary of Defense certifies that our American troops will have the proper training and equipment for whatever mission they are ordered to fulfill. Yesterday I read the classified report outlining the findings by the Department of Defense\'s Inspector General about the problems that have been faced by our troops getting the equipment they desperately need in combat areas like Iraq. The Inspector General did not have the full cooperation of the Department of Defense and it is heartbreaking that the Inspector General could conclude that the U.S. military still has failed to equip our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially for the kind of warfare that they are confronting with IEDs and insurgents who are attacking them in asymmetric, unconventional warfare. This report comes on the heals of an article in The Washington Post last week entitled, ""Equipment for Troops is Lacking: Troops Must Make Do, Officials say."" The Washington Post story raised serious questions about the adequacy of the supply of up-armored humvees and trucks. One of our Generals is quoted as saying that he doesn\'t have the equipment that our forces need and they will have to go into battle with what they have. On my way back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I stopped at Landstuhl Hospital in Germany to visit with some of our wounded soldiers. I met with one young man who was lying in his bed with his injuries that he had suffered from one of the shape charges, these new, more advanced, more sophisticated command-controlled IEDs, the Improvised Explosive Devices. He told me that the armored fully equipped humvee that saved his life and that of the life -- the lives of his buddies who were with him. But he also told me that not everybody that he served with had that kind of protection because there weren\'t enough of those armored vehicles to go around. Madam President, I do not believe that the Congress can shirk its responsibility. It is past time that we live up to our constitutional responsibility. If I had been President in October of 2002, I would have never asked for authority to divert our attention from Afghanistan to Iraq, and I certainly would never have started this war. But we are where we are, and this Congress must deliver a strategy to help us end this war in the right way and begin returning our troops home. So on this most important issue of our time, I call on my colleagues, not to hide from this debate, but to welcome it. To welcome the opportunity to set forth whatever one\'s opinions might be, because this debate is about more than our policy in Iraq. It is about the role and responsibility of this august institution. Great debates in our past have not only moved public opinion but furthered the progress of our country. This debate is not merely about whether or not the President should escalate troops into Iraq, whether he has failed to grasp the complexity of the situation we confront in Iraq and to take every diplomatic, political, economic, and military strategy available to him, but it\'s really about our democracy itself. We should consider this resolution. And I hope that we will. Our duty is rooted in the faith entrusted to us by our constituents and enshrined in our constitution. When we think about the patriotism and bravery, the humor and resolve, the optimism and strength of our soldiers, Marines, airmen, and sailors, our active duty, our Guard and Reserves, I think it humbles us all. But it comes out of this great democratic tradition that we are all blessed to be a part of. I hope that we have the opportunity in the next days to do our duty, just as the men and women who are serving us have done and are doing theirs. A week ago I was privileged to go to San Antonio for the opening of a remarkable center called the Center of the Intrepid. It is a new state-of-the-art facility devoted to the rehabilitation and recovery of our wounded heroes. It was funded by contributions from more than 600,000 Americans. It was not built by our government. It was built by our citizens. It is not only going to be a place of great hope and healing for the brave men and women who have given their full measure, but it will also stand as a symbol of our democracy, of our values, of people coming together across our country; a unique partnership that you find nowhere else in the world except here. As I sat on the stage during the ceremonies for the opening of this new rehabilitation center, I watched the hundreds of young men and women who had been injured march in-- in some cases wheeled in--and take their place in the audience. I believe they are owed this debate, and certainly all those who are currently serving and the thousands who are on their way to carry out this escalation strategy deserve it even more. So, Madam President, I hope we will have a chance to express the will of our constituents, our deeply held opinions, and participate in a debate that is historic and necessary. That is the least we can do.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 14, 2007",b'Senate Floor Remarks: No Military Action On Iran Without Congressional Authority',"b'Mr. President, at this moment of challenge for our nation, the vantage point of this august chamber, we look onto a world filled with danger, deeply complex threats against our troops and our national interests abroad, and genuine risks to our security here at home. Keeping our nation strong and our people safe requires that we employ the best and smartest strategies available. In confronting enemies and threats, we are fortunate to possess a great many assets, all of which we must wisely deploy, including our military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural assets. Our strongest asset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as members of the Senate and as representatives of our constituents. Our democratic institutions, under our Constitution, balance one another and check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us wrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way. This constitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national security, but the example that we should project to the world. Our democracy, with its tradition of accountable power and open debate, is America at its best. And that\'s what we need, America at our best, as we deliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the Iranian regime. Now, make no mistake, Iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests in the region and beyond, including the United States. The Iranian president has held a conference denying the Holocaust and has issued bellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for Israel and the United States to be wiped off the map. His statements are even more disturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime\'s request to acquire nuclear weapons. The regime also uses its influence and resources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack Israel. Hezbollah\'s attack on Israel this summer, using Iranian weapons, clearly demonstrates Iran\'s malevolent influence even beyond its borders. We also have evidence, although it is by no means conclusive, of attacks using Iranian-supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own American soldiers. As I have long said and will continue to say, U.S. policy must be clear and unequivocal: We cannot, we should not, we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons. And in dealing with this threat, as I\'ve also said for a long time, no option can be taken off the table. But America must proceed deliberately and wisely, and we must proceed as a unified nation. The smartest and strongest policy will be one forged through the institutions of our democracy. That is the genius of our American system and our constitutional duty. We have witnessed these past six years-- until the most recent election of a new Congress by the American people-- the cost of congressional dereliction of its oversight duty, a vital role entrusted to Congress by our constituents, enshrined in, and even required by our Constitution. So we are here today because the price that has been paid in blood and treasure; through the rush to war in Iraq and the incompetence of its execution and managing the aftermath; in the excesses of military contracting abuses and the inadequate supply of body armor and armored vehicles on the ground have led to a loss of confidence among our allies and the American people in this Administration. Therefore, Mr. President, we cannot and we must not allow recent history to repeat itself. We continue to experience the consequences of unchecked Presidential action. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, but this President was allowed, for too long, to commit blunder after blunder under cover of darkness provided by an allied Republican Congress. In dealing with the threats posed by the Iranian regime, which has gained its expanding influence in Iraq and the region as a result of the Administration\'s policies, President Bush must not be allowed to act without the authority and oversight of Congress. It would be a mistake of historical proportion if the Administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further Congressional authorization. Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, in any way, authorizes force against Iran. If the Administration believes that any, any use of force against Iran is necessary, the President must come to Congress to seek that authority. I am deeply concerned by the recent statements coming out of the Bush Administration. The Administration has asserted evidence that the Iranian regime\'s complicity, at the highest levels, for attacks within Iraq. Yet at the same time, General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, questions these as assertions, in particular, the capability and intentions of the Iranian government. In this delicate situation, while making disturbing comments, [there are reports that the Administration] is sending a third aircraft carrier to the Gulf. The President owes an on-going consultation to this Congress and owes straight talk to the country. We have to get this right. The Congress should debate our current course, including the current silent-treatment policy toward our adversaries. I believe we can better understand how to deal with an adversary such as Iran if we have some direct contact with them. I think that can give us valuable information and better leverage to hold over the Iranian regime. And if we ever must, with Congressional agreement, take drastic action, we should make clear to the world that we have exhausted every other possibility. I welcome the agreement announced yesterday between the United States and North Korea. It demonstrates the central value of using every tool in our arsenal to achieve our objectives. I only wish the Administration had pursued this course six years ago when an agreement with North Korea was within reach. The wasted time has allowed North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the interim. Failure to use diplomacy has damaged our national security interests. The important step forward our country has made with North Korea raises the obvious question: Why will the President refuse to have any kind of process involving Iran as I and others have urged? The United States engaged in talks with North Korea within a multilateral process, but also had ongoing bilateral discussions. We should have such a process of direct engagement with Iran, as recommended by many, including the Iraq Study Group. We need friends and allies to stand with us in this long war against terrorism and extremism, and to contain and alter the regimes that harbor and support those who would harm us. During the cold war, we spoke to the Soviet Union while thousands of missiles were pointed at our cities, while its leaders threatened to bury us, while the regime sewed discord and military uprisings and actions against us and our allies. That was a smart strategy used by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, even though it was often a difficult one. As we discuss potential evidence of Iranian complicity in supplying arms to insurgents, along with the refusal to suspend their nuclear ambitions, we need to deliver a strong message to Iran that we will not stand by and tolerate this behavior. However, we need to deliver that message forcefully through direct talks. The lives of American soldiers are at risk and we should not outsource our discussions with the Iranians on this and other issues. When I say no option should be taken off the table, I include diplomacy. Currently, our intelligence on Iran is of uncertain quality. We need to examine the facts closely and carefully. No action can or should be taken without explicit Congressional authorization. And knowing what we know now, this body needs a steady stream of real, verifiable intelligence. We, in the Congress, cannot do our part in deciding what needs to be done if we do not know what is happening. And it does not appear that the administration has any real grasp on the facts on the ground, even after all these years. The public unclassified sections of the NIE report recently issued, made it very clear in their conclusions that sectarian violence would still exist in Iraq absent Iran. So we have a lot to sort out here. We have all learned lessons from the conflict in Iraq, and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations that are being raised about Iran. Because, Mr. President, what we are hearing has too familiar a ring and we must be on guard that we never again make decisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty. If we find evidence of potential Iranian complicity, we will take appropriate action, but that requires a partnership to defend and protect America\'s national security interests between the Congress and the President. Oversight will also lead to a consensus approach that brings together the best judgments and strategies of our nation and will examine the consequences of action, the reality of any perceived or alleged threat, and the consequences of taking action. I sometimes fear that the word ""consequence"" has been taken out of the vocabulary of this Administration. We have to look over the horizon. We have to make hard choices among difficult options. So, Mr. President, there are no easy answers to the complex situations we confront in the world today, but if we do face threats, then Congressional consultation and authorization will bring the American people into the debate. Whatever steps, if any, may be required should be taken by our nation, not just by our President. We must act as Americans, not as members of one party or another. Our nation has been divided by a failed policy and the relentless pursuit of it. We are facing that again with the escalation policy that the President is pursuing today. Mr. President, if we face up to our constitutional responsibilities as the Congress, if we conduct the oversight that is required, if we exercise our checks and balances, then we are likely to reach a better conclusion than we have thus far. We must be tough and smart, deliberative and wise, and we must look at all of our assets, not just the brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country to implement the best policy. We should start by employing our best values, the democratic values that give strength to our nation and our cause, and that serve as an example and beacon to people who wish to live in peace and freedom and prosperity around the world. Mr. President, I yield the floor.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 4, 2007","b'Remarks on the 42nd Anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama'","b'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. And I want to begin by giving praise to the Almighty for the blessings he has bestowed upon us as a congregation, as a people, and as a nation. and I thank you so much, Reverend Armstrong, for welcoming me to this historic church. And I thank the First Baptist Church family for opening your hearts and your home to me and to so many visitors today. I have to confess that I did seek dispensation from Reverend Armstrong to come because you know, I\'m a Methodist. And I\'m in one of those mixed marriages. And my husband, who sends greetings to all of you today, felt it necessary to call the Reverend to make sure that was all right. And thank you, reverend, for being so broad-minded and understanding. It is also a great honor to be here with so many distinguished members of the clergy, elected officials, leaders of the civil rights movement, today, tomorrow, and yesterday. President Steele, I could have listened all afternoon. That pulse that you found so faint you have brought back to life. And all of us owe you and SCLC a great deal of gratitude. I think everybody in the sanctuary has been introduced. But I want to just say a word of recognition to some of my colleagues in government who have traveled a long way to be here with us today. Congressman Rahm Emanuel from Illinois and his son Zach. Congressman Anthony Weiner from New York. Congresswoman Gwendolyn Moore from Wisconsin. Congressman Linda Sanchez from California. And the chair of all the mayors in the country, Mayor Palmer from Trenton, New Jersey. I thank them for coming to join with us. And I have to say, Chairman Chestnut, thank you for the history lesson and for the welcome. I thank all of the board of deacons, the board of trustees and the deaconesses and I appreciate that we are gathered here for another commemoration that is important for us once again to re-enact so we never forget. I also want to ask for our prayers on behalf of all those who lost their lives in the terrible tornadoes that swept through this state and others and particularly for those young people, those eight students of Enterprise High School who lost their lives, for their families, and on behalf of all those who may still be missing. I come here this morning as a sister in worship, a grateful friend and beneficiary of what happened in Selma 42 years ago. I come to share the memories of a troubled past and a hope for a better tomorrow. One that is worthy of the sacrifices that were made here. Today marks that 42nd anniversary. but it also marks, as we have heard, the 50th anniversary of SCLC and the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High by the Little Rock Nine. And I have friends with me today from Arkansas who have been with my husband and me for all those years. We know, as President Steele reminded us, that America\'s march to freedom, equality and opportunity has been marked by milestones -- milestones like the creation of SCLC and the integration of Central High and that fateful Sunday with that march across the Pettis Bridge. But those are just milestones. They do not mark the end of the journey. In fact, it is not over yet. and I believe that for many people today who are mistaken that Bloody Sunday is a subject for the history books, it is our responsibility to make it clear to them it is just as relevant today as it was 42 years ago. Yes, that long march to freedom that began here has carried us a mighty long way. But we all know we have to finish the march. That is the call to our generation, to our young people. As a young girl, I had the great privilege of hearing Dr. King speak in Chicago. The year was 1963. My youth minister from our church took a few of us down on a cold January night to hear someone that we had read about, we had watched on television, we had seen with our own eyes from a distance, this phenomenon known as Dr. King. He titled the sermon he gave that night ""Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution."" some of you may have heard it because he delivered it more than once. He described how the literary character Rip Van Winkle had slept through the American Revolution. And he called on us, he challenged us that evening to stay awake during the great Revolution that the Civil Rights Pioneers were waging on behalf of a more perfect union. It was sweeping our country, and we would sleep through it at our risk and detriment. Now, I know we\'ve been at this a long time. And after all the hard work, getting rid of the literacy tests and the poll taxes, fighting for the right to vote, bringing more people into the economic mainstream, a body does get tired. But we\'ve got to stay awake. we\'ve got to stay awake, because we have a march to finish. a march toward one America, that should be all America was meant to be. That too many people before us have given of themselves time and again, to make real. How can we rest while poverty and inequality continue to rise? How can we sleep, while 46 million of our fellow Americans do not have health insurance? How can we be satisfied, when the current economy brings too few jobs and too few wage increases and too much debt? How can we shrug our shoulders and say this is not about me, when too many of our children are ill-prepared in school for college and unable to afford it, if they wish to attend? How can we say everything is fine when we have an energy policy whose prices are too high, who make us dependent on foreign governments that do not wish us well, and when we face the real threat of climate change, which is tinkering with God\'s creation? How do we refuse to march when we have our young men and women in uniform in harm\'s way, and whether they come back, their government does not take care of them the way they deserve? And how do we say that everything is fine, Bloody Sunday is for the history books, when over 96,000 of our citizens, the victims of Hurricane Katrina, are still living in trailers and mobile homes, which is a national disgrace to everything we stand for in America? You know, Dr. King told us -- Dr. King told us our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. Well, I\'m here to tell you poverty and growing inequality matters. Health care matters. the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans matter. Our soldiers matter. Our standing in the world matters. Our future matters, and it is up to us to take it back, put it in to our hands, start marching toward a better tomorrow! Now, 42 years ago, from this church and from brown, brave men and women first tried to march. Two days later, Dr. King tried again. Getting as far as the bridge. Then on the third day, armed with judge Frank Johnson\'s order, more than 3,000 people crossed the Pettis Bridge. And by the time they got to Montgomery, they were 25,000 strong. Now, my friends, we must never forget the blows they took. Let\'s never forget the dogs and the horses and the hoses that were turned on them, driving them back, treating them not as human beings. But also don\'t forget about the dignity with which they bore it all. They understood the right to vote matters. Now, five months later the voting rights act was enacted by Congress and signed by President Johnson, but we all know it was written on the march from Selma to Montgomery. It was written by men and women with tired feet and swollen ankles. And it was first signed with their blood, sweat, and tears. We cherish the few, including my good friend, Congressman John Lewis, who still remain with us today, to cross the bridge again. But let us not forget those who have passed on -- Dr. King and Coretta, Viola, Ralph Abernathy, Josea Williams and all the others. We remember, too, Jimmy Lee Jackson, whose killing near here was one of the events that ignited the march. and we were the support of this great church and of Reverend Fred, who helped to lead people into justice for all. So many prayed and stood up for the right to vote. Dr. King said quality for African-Americans would also free white Americans of the staining legacy of slavery. And so it has. In 2000, my husband said here that those who walked across the bridge made it possible for the south to grow and prosper and for two sons of the south, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be elected president of the United States. The Voting Rights Act gave more Americans from every corner of our nation the chance to live out their dreams. And it is the gift that keeps on giving. Today it is giving Senator Obama the chance to run for president of the United States. And by its logic and spirit, it is giving the same chance to Governor Bill Richardson, an Hispanic, and yes, it is giving me that chance, too. You know, this may be interesting for the legislators who are here, but before Selma and the Voting Rights Act put quality front and center, it was illegal under Alabama law for women to serve on juries. I know where my chance came from, and I am grateful to all of you, who gave it to me. But in the last two presidential elections we have seen the right to vote tampered with, and outright denied to too many of our citizens, especially the poor and people of color. Not just in Florida, Ohio, and Maryland, but in state after state. The very idea that in the 21st century, African-Americans would wait in line for 10 hours while whites in an affluent precinct next to theirs waited in line for 10 minutes, or that African-Americans would receive fliers telling them the wrong time and day to exercise their constitutional right to vote. That\'s wrong. It is simply unconscionable that today young Americans are putting their lives at risk to protect democracy half a world away when here at home their precious right to vote is under siege. My friends, we have a march to finish. I will be reintroducing the Count Every Vote Act, to ensure that every voter is given the opportunity to vote, that every vote is counted, and each voter is given the chance to verify his or her vote before it is cast and made permanent. We have to stay awake. We have a march to finish. On this floor today, let us say with one voice the words of James Cleveland\'s great freedom hymn, ""I don\'t feel no ways tired/I come too far from where I started from/Nobody told me that the road would be easy/I don\'t believe he brought me this far to leave me."" And we know -- we know -- we know, if we finish this march, what awaits us? St. Paul told us, in the letter to the Galatians, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due seasons we shall reap, if we do not lose heart."" The brave men and women of Bloody Sunday did not lose heart. We can do no less. We have a march to finish. Let us join together and complete that march for freedom, justice, opportunity, and everything America should be. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 6, 2007","b'Remarks in the ""Equal Pay HillCast""'","b""You know, it's hard to build the future if you don't start by honoring the past. And March is Women's History Month, a great time to remember that women's work helped build this country. It's also an important time to make sure that women's work is valued. Not just with fine words, but with fair pay. It's been 44 years since the equal pay law was first passed, and there's been a lot of progress since then. So many barriers have been shattered. The possibilities for my daughter's generation exceed anything my mother could have imagined even when I was growing up. But here we are at the beginning of the 21st century and women still earn significantly less money than men for doing the same jobs. Women who work full time year round earn just 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes. And for women of color it's even less. Sixty-seven cents for African American women for every dollar a man makes. And just 56 cents for Latinas. You know, that's a huge difference every single week, when it comes to paying the rent or the mortgage, or buying groceries or school supplies, or covering the doctor's bills. Over a lifetime the numbers really add up. Working women stand to lose a quarter of a million dollars over the course of their careers because of unequal pay practices. And this is a problem for women no matter where we work. I read a story recently that Wimbledon finally agreed to pay their women tennis champions the same amount of prize money as their male champions. It only took 123 years for them to do the right thing. So what do we do? Well I'm introducing a new bill called the Paycheck Fairness Act to help closed the pay gap for women. First, it offers women meaningful remedies for pay discrimination by toughening the penalties for violating the Equal Pay Act. Now that should help stop employers from discriminating against women. Second, it makes sure our government enforces equal pay laws in our own federal contracts. Millions of women are employed through federal contracts. We should at least be a model to the private sector about giving women an equal paycheck for equal work. Third, this bill prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information. Right now when women try to find out if they are being treated fairly by asking around about what others get paid, they can get in trouble or even be fired. This bill would make that illegal. And finally, this bill requires the Department of Labor to continue collecting and disseminating information about women workers. You wouldn't think you would need a law to do that. But the Bush administration has stopped collecting some valuable information about women in the workplace. As with so many things, they seem to think that the problems will go away if they make the facts go away. Well, I want to get back into the reality business, with real solutions to the real problems people face. That's why I'm also working to expand family and medical leave to cover sick leave; to increase funding for research into the connection between diseases like breast cancer and environmental hazards; to insure that Title IX continues, so that young women can compete. And we also have to make sure that we stay vigilant about protecting a woman's right to choose and smart about making family planning available. I hope you'll join this conversation about these and other important issues. This is Women's History Month, so let's keep the conversation going about women, about our past, and most definitely, about our future. If history has taught us nothing else, it's that if we work together, we can do anything. Thanks for listening."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 10, 2007","b'Excerpt from Hillary Clinton\'s Remarks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party\'s ""100 Club"" Dinner'","b""America's middle class, and working families, have become the invisible Americans. If you are a hard working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college, you are invisible to this Administration. You are invisible to the oil companies earning record profits while you pay more at the pump. You are invisible to the companies who outsource your job, or lay you off or end the promise of your pension. For six long years, President Bush and the Washington Republicans have looked right through you. If you are a first responder, worker or volunteer from 9/11 in need of medical treatment, you are invisible to them. If you are a soldier returning from combat and waiting for treatment or disability pay, you are invisible. If you are a child sitting in a failing school waiting for the promised federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act, you are invisible. If you are single mom who needs safe quality child care while you go to work, you are invisible. And if you're a career government scientist raising the global warming alarm; a conservationist trying to protect the environment; a government accountant looking into no bid contracts that have cost the tax payers billions of dollars; even a Republican U.S. Attorney trying to enforce the law impartially - they've tried to make you invisible to the rest of us. More than 46 million people living without health insurance. More than 90,000 people living in trailers after Hurricane Katrina. 13 million children living in poverty. For six long years, they have all been invisible. Well, they're not invisible to us. They're not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, they will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 14, 2007","b'Remarks at the International Association of Fire Fighters Bipartisan 2008 Presidential Forum in Washington, DC'","b'Hello, how are you doing? Thank you. Thank you all. Thanks so much and thanks for last night too. It\'s an honor and pleasure to be here this morning. It was a lot of fun to be here last night. You know as I look around this room which is packed with people whom I admire so much, I see a lot of old friends, and it\'s been an honor to stand with you. We\'ve stood together in good times and bad times. We\'ve stood together when it seemed as though the darkness would never end and when we finally saw the light. So it is just a personal honor of the highest degree to be here today. And I want to thank also my friend and your great leader for that wonderful introduction. You know Harold and Vinny have been the heart and soul of leading this great, great union. And we\'ve been through a lot, but the thing about going through tough times with Harold and Vinny on your side is that you know that you\'re not going to be alone. And that has meant the world to those of us from New York. And we have a lot of firefighters from across New York here today and I want to thank you all for everything you do, every single day. When I think about the work that you do and the service and commitment that you have given to your nation, I know that for all of you, courage is a job requirement. You don\'t make this decision to be a firefighter easily or quickly. You have to think about the sacrifice and you have to think about your families. For you when you go to work, when you go to that fire house or that station these are not just your colleagues, these are members of your extended family. And I recognize how much this family, both the one that you leave at home as you kiss your wife goodbye or you tuck your son into bed are part of the commitment that you\'ve made. And I want to also thank your family members because its not easy to see you walk out the door, to see you leave for that shift and just wait to make sure you\'ve come home safely again. So I want to express my gratitude to your families and to everyone who love you and support you in the work that you do every single day. You know, Harold referred to our meeting that we had on the morning of September 12. On the day before, September 11, not only our country but the entire world saw for themselves what firefighters are made of. You were the ones who ran into the fire. You were the ones who ran into the dust. Into those collapsing buildings. And for you some of your brothers and sisters it was the last time you saw them. But people who were not even on duty dropped everything they were doing to be there that day. People who didn\'t even work for the FDNY but who worked out on Long Island, who worked in Westchester, who worked in Connecticut, who worked in New Jersey, dropped everything they were doing. And pretty soon teams started coming from around the country. Everybody sang we want to be there, we want to watch your back, we want to help search that wreckage to see if we can find anybody still alive. When Harold and I spoke it was a time of shock and confusion. Harold was kind enough to describe what I said to him but I want to tell you what he said to me. He said, ""We will stand with New York. Firefighters across this country and even across our border to the north will be there for you."" Well, Harold, you were true to your word. Not only you, but firefighters and paramedics and others poured into our city. You shared equipment with us; you raised money for us; you worked side by side with us. And you prayed with us. You were there when we needed you, and I want you to know that I will be there with you when you need me. Now, we have to put this into a little bit of a context today. Because I know many of you including Harold and Vinny were perhaps a little unsure about me when I started running. Now that happens to me sometimes. In fact, you might recall, that back in 2000, you actually endorsed my opponent. But I never saw that as any kind of obstacle to working on behalf of your needs and your interests. Just as when I ran for the Senate in New York, I said I wanted to be a Senator who represented everybody, people who were for me, people who were against, people who didn\'t have an opinion. And I wanted to find ways we could move a common agenda forward. And of course, a crisis brought us all together. And we rolled up our sleeves. Over the years I\'ve made wonderful friends with many of you. I was very proud in my last election to have the support of the New York firefighters. That meant the world to me because without fail, we have to stand together. We have a lot of big problems that we\'re facing, and I think we can once again reassert America\'s leadership at home, restore our values, fulfill the promise of America, and get back to leading the world in the right way. Now that starts with restoring what I call the basic bargain. So many of us grew up with that. You know, we were raised to believe that if you worked hard and if you played by rules you\'d be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. Well, I don\'t think in the last six years our country has actually been living up to that basic bargain. The leadership here in Washington seems to ignore middle class and hardworking families across our country. Under this president\'s leadership household debt has soared, healthcare costs have skyrocketed, assuming that you have it. Wages have remained stagnant. Now corporate profits are up. And productivity is up, which means Americans are working harder than anybody in the world, but we\'re not getting rewarded. I\'ll tell you who is getting rewarded. Companies like Halliburton are getting rewarded with no-bid contracts, then they move their CEOs across the ocean to another country and leave us hanging right here at home. I\'ll tell you something else that we are going to have to deal with, the alternative minimum tax, which falls heavily on a lot of you and your families. You know, for six I\'ve have been saying, with all due respect, do the billionaires in America need more tax cuts? Don\'t you think we ought to cut the taxes of middle income people, in particular those who are going to be hit by the alternative minimum tax? You know, for six long years, our President has not seen the vast majority of Americans. Not our middle class, not our working families. He\'s looked right through them. To him, they\'re invisible. You know, if you\'re a child sitting in a crumbling school, you\'re invisible. If you\'re a small business owner who worries about energy costs or someone who can\'t afford to fill up your tank -- you\'re invisible. If you\'re a hardworking parent who needs affordable childcare while you go to work -- you\'re invisible. Even if you\'re a soldier returning from combat who needs healthcare and disability compensation, you are invisible. Well, those days are over. When we look at the way our first responders have been treated, if you\'re paramedic who got sick after 9/11, if you\'re a federal firefighter who can\'t qualify for worker\'s compensation or disability retirement, if you\'re a retired firefighter who can\'t afford health insurance, well, you\'re invisible too. It\'s great for the photo ops, but how about taking care of the people who taken of us across our country! Well I want to make clear today you\'re not invisible to the people of our country. And you\'re sure not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, you will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States of America. And I want to say in this public setting that when I\'m in the White House I\'m going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for. Because there isn\'t anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders. It is part of our national security; it is part of our moral obligation. And being there for you means continuing the fight to ensure that you have everything you need to do your job --the equipment, the people, whatever it takes. So let me tell you when George W. Bush tried to cut the funding for the Safer Act, which I co-sponsored, and the Fire Act, I took that personally. And with my colleagues, we fought him. And when he did it again, we fought him again. And I\'m going to keep on fighting until FIRE and SAFER are fully funded, whatever it takes. Now being there for you also means caring for every firefighter, every police officer, every paramedic, every volunteer or worker who has fallen ill in the aftermath of September 11. It wasn\'t just people from New York who responded that day and the days to follow and the months to follow. It was people from all over our country, and when I first visited the site, the afternoon of September the 12, I could barely see anything, the dark cloud was so thick. But I could smell it, I could taste it, I could feel it. As I watched the first firefighters walking out of that curtain of darkness, covered in black soot, barely able to stand, dragging their axes behind them, I knew that the effects of 9/11 would last long after September 11. Within days the so called World Trade Center Cough began to appear. Young men and women in the prime of their lives developed asthma and bronchitis and laryngitis, and their livers were polluted and their lungs were failing. And people who, before September 11 could lift three times their body weight, could barely stand they were so bent over in pain. They couldn\'t sleep lying flat in their beds anymore; they had to sit up all night long. People who used to be able to run miles without stopping could no longer breathe going up a flight of stairs. Working hand in hand with many of you and with the IAFF we created a program to screen and monitor those who were sick. And we got $90 million to expand it. And when President Bush tried to take $125 million back, we knew we had to draw the line. And you once again came in and helped us win that fight. Let\'s just say the president picked a fight with the wrong people. We won it but we didn\'t stop there. With your help I was able to introduce legislation asking for more than $1.9 billion for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment. We\'re going to keep working on this, not just this year or next year but as long as our first responders, our workers, our volunteers, our residents need help. Being there for you also means getting smart about homeland security. As you know all too well, we confront a new enemy and a new kind of warfare. It\'s really the warfare of cowards. It\'s people who sneak around and blow themselves up or place bombs in cars, who have a philosophy of nihilism. You know, they may dress it up in a kind of perverse version of religion, but it\'s really about destruction and death. And it is imperative that we stand against them. Their warfare is not conducted by armies or navies but by criminals, by insurgents, by militias driven by this twisted hate. And it\'s been frustrating for many of us because we can\'t get the resources to match the rhetoric. We\'ve got a lot of tough rhetoric out of Washington, but when it comes to paying overtime, getting you the equipment you need not the equipment they want to give you, providing the money directly to local communities and not passing it through the states. Well, we haven\'t gotten what we know you need to protect our country. And in this latest budget, the president is proposing to cut funds for first responders at the Department of Homeland Security to the tune of $1.7 billion. The way I see it, saying you believe in homeland security without funding first responders is like saying you believe in building a hospital without doctors and nurses. If we don\'t fund you, we\'re not funding our first line of defense, and we\'re going to need to work together to make that happen. And as Harold knows, and all my folks from New York know, we have been fighting for interoperable communications since September 12. We have put in legislation. We\'ve asked for more money, but when firefighters can\'t talk to police officers, when emergency responders can\'t talk to those form another, we not only saw it on September 11, we saw it again during Hurricane Katrina. A crisis that really, once again, put firefighters in the forefront. Just think about what\'s happening where your brothers and sisters are trying to operate out of trailers, and they\'re still using ruined equipment that we still haven\'t replaced. What was a natural disaster was turned into a national disgrace, and we need to get the funds directly where they are needed. And being there for you means trying to end the war in Iraq in the right way, because firefighters have fought and died in Iraq. And we were heartbroken to learn that those who had fought and had been injured were languishing in Walter Reed. I went out there a week ago Friday early in the morning to meet with a bunch of soldiers from New York. Some of them had been tied up in the bureaucratic red tape until they were just beyond words. They couldn\'t figure out ""what had I done to deserve this? I served my country, active duty, National Guard, or reserve. Why am I being treated like that?"" Well, the 2006 elections sent a strong message that we do not want our young men and women in uniform to be in the middle of a sectarian civil war, where they don\'t know who is shooting at them, and they can figure out whose side they\'re supposed to be on. We\'re trying to introduce some rationality in this, in the Congress, trying to stop the escalation because I profoundly believe that putting more of our young men and women into harm\'s way -- unless the Iraqis decide to defend themselves -- we cannot end this war for them. If they\'re not going to stand up and take responsibility, we should not lose another American life. We should end this escalation now. I hope that the president will extricate us from Iraq before he leaves office. But let me assure you, if you doesn\'t, when I\'m president, I will. Being there for you means standing side by side with you in the fight for your most fundamental rights. As Harold said in his introduction, I believe that it is absolutely essential to the way America works that people be given the right to organize and bargain collectively. Nearly 90 years ago, when 36 delegates gathered for the first IAFF convention, 84 hours work-weeks were the norm, and terrible conditions were a fact of life. You know why that\'s no longer the case? Because of you. You organized, you unionized, you stood up for your rights. You said, ""We\'re not going to be invisible. We\'re doing our part. You have to give us safe working conditions, fair treatment, and the right to bargain."" But some people still don\'t get it. You know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security. They think you haven\'t earned the right to organize. You know what I say to them? I say, ""Would you change places? Would you go into that fire? Would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings? Well the way I see it, when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living, you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job."" Make no mistake about it, the days of George Bush thinking the union bug is something he needs to squash are over. We are here to stand up for the rights of people who pull children out of raging waters and rescue people from flaming rooftops. We are here to stand up for the people who stand up for us. We have a lot of work head of us, and we could get some small victories along the way until we finally get the majorities we need to completely have an agenda that we support in the Senate. They can still stop a lot of what we believe in, unfortunately, but we just have to keep electing more people who see the world the way we do. And we certainly will make a lot more progress when we take back the White House. Back after the days of September 11, so many of you came to me and said that the families of firefighters who had been killed were confronting piles of paperwork just to get the benefits they were owed. They were told it would take weeks or months, and the families didn\'t have that kind of time. So again, working with Harold and his team, we put together a bill, and my friend Jerry Nadler sponsored it in the House, and within a week that bill passed into law. And when the bill passed, we didn\'t declare victory or do some kind of big celebration, because the truth is, in the end, there was nothing we could do to give back to those families the people they had loved and lost. All we could do is to come together as a team and help as best we could. And in the end, we just followed the basic rule you live by: you never leave a brother or sister behind. Well that\'s how I\'ve tried to serve in the Senate. That\'s how I\'ve tried to set my priorities, and I want you to know that, if I do have the honor and the opportunity to be your president, that\'s what I will continue to do. Now, people who know me will tell you I don\'t back down from a fight. And others use more colorful language sometimes about me. But that\'s just fine with me. I don\'t care what they say; I just care about what we do. That is what is important to me. And because I\'m proud to fight for you because you fight for us, I\'m going to stay on your side. I\'m not in any way concerned by the fight we have ahead because I know we can win this fight. I know that if we stand together, we get our message out to America. If we steel ourselves to all of the criticism and the counter-attacks and the stereotypes and everything that they\'ll put out, then we\'ll be victorious. I have a little experience at staying the course and in sticking with people who stick with me. St. Augustine said a long time ago that hope is really the combination of two things. It\'s a combination of anger at the way things are and courage to change the way things are. Well, living by hope and understanding, we can\'t be satisfied by what we see before us on homeland security or collective bargaining. But having the courage to step out and try to make a different future is one of reasons why I admire what you have done over the course of your work on behalf of firefighters. And I am thrilled and honored to stand with you, and together, we will make it clear that those of us who believe that courage and anger about what is, leads to hope, means that we will change America for the better. Thank you all so much, and God bless you for everything you do. Thank you, take care.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 15, 2007",b'Speech on Subprime Lending',"b'Thank you so much. And I could not have had a better economic development partner in Upstate New York than Lee Beaulac and Rural Opportunities, Inc. We\'ve had a lot of fun. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to bring people together to talk about what we were going to do to reinvest in communities and provide economic opportunities and housing and healthcare, microcredit and just a whole a range of issues that we have worked on together for the last six years. But Lee does know how the public sector and the private sector both work and he combines that knowledge with a real passion to improve the lives of people. So I want to thank you in front of all of your peers and your colleagues, someone who I am very grateful to work with and I am so pleased that he could introduce me.I also want to thank John Taylor because the fact that NCRC is now celebrating 30 years of CRA is a big accomplishment. There were lots of times when we were checking for a pulse. Was CRA still beating? Was it going to be there as a tool that we could use for reinvestment? And thanks to all of you, it is. And we\'re going to strengthen it. We\'re going to begin to strengthen it in the Democratic Congress. And it\'s certainly one of my priorities because I believe in community development investment funds. I believe in empowerment zones. I believe in the tools that we know work in communities. And I was proud during the Clinton Administration to work with some of you and to visit some of the projects like the one that Lee was talking about in Newburgh. So there\'s a lot of work that needs to go on and we have a lot of good examples of what will make it possible for us to bring people into the mainstream economically and provide economic opportunity across all sectors of our economy and every region of our country. And I want to thank Irvin Henderson, the chairman of the board of NCRC and all of the board members because obviously they are committed to doing what does work. And to all the New Yorkers who are here today, thank you for being partners in what we have done together over the last six years. NCRC stands firmly behind a really simple idea that when Americans are given the tools for success, Americans succeed. You know, when the American government is on our side, we all do better together. And it is important that we renew that mission every so often because we face new challenges. You know, when my husband started running for president back in 1992, which wasn\'t exactly the dark ages--some might think it was--but I know it wasn\'t. It was not that long ago. There wasn\'t really an Internet. There was an Internet that existed for scientists to communicate, but there weren\'t hundreds of millions of websites. We have changed so much. And we have to keep asking ourselves, what do we do to bring opportunity to everyone? And Lee mentioned one of my projects up in the North Country of New York. And that was to put small, rural businesses on EBay. Because I said to myself, you know, there\'s not much of a market up here. These folks are working really, really hard and they\'re producing high quality products but they don\'t have many people to sell them to. So what we did was work with EBay to put these businesses on the Internet, help them with their websites, help them get some technical assistance so when the orders started coming in, they would know how to meet them. Lee mentioned one of the businesses we put on, which was a soap maker. Really high quality soap, she made, in a very painstaking process that was pure and really traditional. Somebody working for Oprah came across one of her soaps and one day after she got on EBay, she gets an order for $40,000 worth of soap. She had to go out and get every person she knew in her community to come in and help her make soap. So that was a good problem to have. And that\'s the kind of challenges that we want to overcome by being innovative and creative together. Well, obviously I believe in the basic bargain that I was raised with. You know, if you work hard, you play by the rules, you ought to be able to get ahead. And that\'s what I was raised with and I think that is at the heart of the American Dream. Well unfortunately, we still have too much of America that is held back by a lack of capital, investment and opportunity. Middle class families and families struggling to reach and stay in the middle class are really being squeezed from all sides. You know Americans are struggling to pay for college costs and energy costs and healthcare costs, because after all, premiums have gone up 90 percent since 2000. And I\'m concerned that we\'re not facing the problems that we have. We\'re not meeting our challenges the way previous generations of Americans did. We have 47 million people without health insurance. When you have 300 million people dependent on foreign oil; when you have more than 90,000 of our fellow citizens still living in trailers along the Gulf coast, it is time for a change and it is time for [inaudible]. I want to focus on one aspect of the American Dream, of that basic bargain, because I am worried about homeownership. And as we have seen in recent days, the basic bargain that may be breaking down is homeownership. There has been a lot of attention recently on the volatility in the subprime housing market. But the subprime fallout takes a toll on families as well. These are not just statistics, these are flesh and blood people who are so proud of that first home, who felt like they finally had a real foothold in the American middle class that they were going to have their children in a safer environment. Now we know that there were more bankruptcies in America last year than college graduates. And half of those bankruptcies were due to an illness and people unable to pay their medical costs. So a lot of these new homeowners are one illness away from foreclosure. They\'re one job loss away. They\'re one, let\'s cut your hours away. They are hanging on. Because despite what you hear from the happy-talkers on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and for some of those folks they put on TV, wages have been stagnant, haven\'t they? So you\'ve got CEO pay up. You\'ve got corporate profits up. You\'ve got productivity up, which means that we\'re all working harder than ever before. But the folks who are doing the work are not getting rewarded. And a lot of those folks during the 90s, when we created 22 million new jobs and lifted more people out of poverty than at any time in our history, they felt that we and our country were on the right track, didn\'t they? And they thought the sky was the limit. They were going to send that child to college. They were going to get that home. Well, now we are concerned, and NCRC has been sounding the alarm to try to wake us up for the last several years. Well, I sure hope we\'re awake now. You can\'t be surprised, can you? Because the alarm bell about the subprime home market has largely gone unnoticed by this Administration because they keep arguing we have to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy. They keep arguing that a $9 trillion national debt and an increasing trade deficit -- the highest in history -- are signs of increasing strength. Well, I have to say that I don\'t buy that. I think there are trouble signs below the horizon. Maybe they\'re not as obvious to some, but you keep sounding that alarm. Because I believe that we\'ve got to take action. According to most recent statistics, delinquent payments now affect more than 13 percent of subprime loans in our country. That\'s the highest level in four years. Now, many would attribute this rise to unsophisticated homebuyers, even irresponsible buyers, or the subprime market itself. But the foreclosure rate for all mortgages increased by more than 17 percent in the last quarter of 2006. That\'s the highest foreclosure rate in four decades. So when somebody tells you this subprime market thing is no big deal, or maybe, you know what, let the buyer beware, these folks signed on the dotted line, it\'s their responsibility. Ask them why the rate for all homeowners is so high. Because the economy is not supporting homeownership the way we need it to. And after all, in the absence of an alternative, the subprime market has opened the doors to millions of families and responsible lenders and the market are rightfully casting out some of the worst actors in the subprime industry. But the market will not address the millions of families trapped in unworkable mortgages, hounded by delinquency and facing the grim possibility of foreclosure. Now there will always be risk, and we cannot absolve it and should not absolve homebuyers of his or her responsibility. But we should make the rules clear and level the playing field. The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street. It\'s a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families. So what are some of the things we need to do? We need to expand the role of the FHA to issue more mortgages at better rates to these homeowners. We need to give consumers more counseling and information, prevent families from being trapped in high interest loans with pre-payment penalties and in some cases, allow more breathing room from foreclosure. This market is clearly broken and if we don\'t fix it, it could threaten our entire housing market, which in turn would threaten our entire economy. So this is a serious issue and I\'m so pleased to be in front of a serious group to just spend a few minutes talking with you about it. You know, often the plight of these families are lost. We just don\'t focus on who they are, but we all know them. I bet if we had the people who served lunch today come in and asked them to raise their hands, you\'d see folks who bought their first home, wouldn\'t you? Probably some in this crowd know people personally who have. And we know that very often people are paying in rent what they should be paying in mortgage to actually own something, but they don\'t have anyone to help them cross that bridge. What we have to do is try to figure out how to help people who because of their credit history or a lack of savings because they\'re living paycheck to paycheck or for other reasons are diverted into the higher rates of the subprime market. Well that\'s why I think the Federal Housing Administration must be made to work better. Because after all the FHA remains an industry leader in serving minority, first time, and low income home buyers. And it continues to help people who don\'t qualify for prime mortgages to avoid risky and in some cases predatory mortgage products. And, very importantly the rate of minority lending through FHA has grown to more than one in three after many years when it didn\'t look like that was very welcome, right? So unfortunately the FHA\'s impact on the marketplace has declined, because of inefficiencies and personnel shortages, they cannot keep up with demands at FHA. In the 1990\'s, FHA-backed loans represented about 12 percent of the market. Today, it\'s closer to three percent. This is another one of these government programs that this administration wants to starve and by doing so cut off the dream of homeownership. Now, I will soon be reintroducing my 21st Century Housing Act, which will take steps to modernize the agency by allowing the FHA to reinvest a portion of its revenues in new employees and information technology; to develop new mortgages to meet market demand and to position the FHA to work more efficiently with lenders and to serve more borrowers. I also want to raise the FHA mortgage limits for high cost of living areas so it can reach home buyers in more expensive markets. Many people in New York cannot afford a home within two hours of where they work. If the FHA limit were higher, they could afford a home and we should make that happen. But what if that family that we\'re trying to get into their home decides they will seek out a subprime loan? Well, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of a parent signing a mortgage product unaware of a complicated, escalating payment formula that has been worked out on some computer that has balloon payments and pre-payment penalties, which includes the cost of taxes and insurance, and other added on costs that the owner doesn\'t really understand and nobody takes the time to explain them. Clear and easy to understand disclosure, plain talk meant to inform, not to confuse must be the starting point. Buyer beware is just not enough. So, I also propose a stop to pre-payment penalties designed to trap borrowers when payments skyrocket. These penalties apply to 70 percent of sub-prime mortgages but less than five percent of prime mortgages. Now, we can imagine a family stuck in this subprime catch 22. A family tries to be responsible and pay down on their principal and even make payments ahead of time. But, in the fine print they learn that unlike everything else in their world, if they pay things off and get ahead, there\'s going to be penalties imposed on them. This is totally perverse. So they\'re stuck waiting for the rate to go up instead of being given the opportunity to protect themselves. And then they may very well find themselves on the brink of foreclosure. I\'m also calling for independent counseling to be made available, so when buyers like this family sign the dotted line they understand what they are signing. And as you know from your own experience at NCRC more than one third of subprime borrowers could qualify for lower rate prime mortgages, but many low income and minority borrowers are simply unaware of there options. Finally, we also know that sometimes because of a sudden catastrophic illness or an accident that disables or injures the prime bread winner, or other circumstances, very responsible families have trouble making their payments. Now unfortunately, homeowners in distress often simply miss payment after payment and eventually lose their homes. A better alternative would be to create incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and to work out solutions before foreclosure happens. Lenders might for example, give borrowers a period of a foreclosure time-out, during which borrowers will have the opportunity to put their financial houses in order and to work out a payment plan. This proposal can build on the great efforts that NCRC is already leading with your Consumer Rescue Fund Initiative. And I want to applaud you for this because this is wonderful agenda to restore the homeownership market and your network of community groups and responsible lenders and state and local governments should strengthen our ability to respond to this crisis. But, you know, really when it comes to homeownership we should get back to that basic bargain. If you play by the rules, you can count on the rules being fair, open, and honest. And responsible lenders and community organizations need to be encouraged to really live up to their end of the bargain. I want to see more opportunities for lenders to go into communities that have not always been well served. And I know it can be done. Several years ago, I challenged New York\'s credit unions to reach a goal of $100 million in responsible home loans to first time buyers in under served areas. These were areas where usually the only alternative would have been a sub-prime or risky mortgage. The result: well, a year later the credit unions all came back to my office to report that they have exceeded their goal. They announced $150 million in loans and they are still [inaudible]. I think it\'s also important that we look for ways for the government to incentivize these changes and to provide some kind of safety net if the worst happens and escalating foreclosures begin to mount. You know, it\'s true that I travel around the country a lot now and speak in big cities and very small towns just as I did throughout my years in the Senate in New York. And there are a lot of people who are feeling less and less connected to one another. You know, it\'s ironic that in this age of virtual reality where people are on the Internet and bending over working their text messages and blackberries that there is a sense that perhaps we are not as secure as we once were. You know, people are working more, but their jobs are less secure. The whole family has cell phones, but finds it nearly impossible to sit down around the dinner table together. Our nation is growing more interdependent in the global economy, but increasingly feels divided here at home. Well, I believe we can pursue policies together that lift us all up and homeownership is one piece of that puzzle. And that is why it\'s so important that what you\'re doing continues. And the Community Reinvestment Act was a wise decision thirty years ago by Congress and President Carter. And it has made a tremendous difference. Bank lending to minorities and lower and moderate income borrowers has gone up 20 percent since then. But we still have a lot to do. I\'ve done a lot of work in microcredit over the years going back to Arkansas when I worked with my husband and Dr. Muhammad Yunus who just won the Noble Peace Prize for the Grameen Bank to bring Grameen Bank techniques to Arkansas. And I\'ve been in many different settings with borrowers and lenders who are doing microcredit. I\'ll never forget a woman in Denver who said to me, ""more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else."" We need to figure out how we\'re going to open up the commercial lending sector and continue to provide more alternatives as well. And when I go out and speak with my constituents, they\'re not asking for a handout. They\'re just asking once again to be part of this great American Dream; this adventure that we are all on together. They just want the tools to help them realize their own ambitions. Now, when I created an organization called New Jobs for New York, to try and bring more capital from New York City upstate, I went around and met with a lot of the entrepreneurs who were trying to break through and look for a chance to get the capital they needed. And time and time again there was just no place for them to go. Well, it would be in America\'s interest to have a big national capital fund that would make bets again on smart people who are willing to work hard. I want to do that in the strategic energy area. You know, I meet people all over the country who have good ideas about alternative energy, but they\'re not getting the funding they need to translate that into reality. And when it comes to the Renewal Communities which the Clinton administration started back in 2000; well, I see the results of those investments in tourism along the Erie Canal, which had basically been just left to wither. I see those investments in the local wine industry in New York. And I think if we pursue a comprehensive agenda, urban and rural, leaving nobody out, then I think we\'re going to have the consensus we need in the country to start solving problems again. Because that\'s what I believe in. I believe that if we put our heads together and we start looking at the facts and the evidence, and put the ideology on the back shelf somewhere, because I\'ve never seen any ideology that helps you solve a problem, you\'ve got to get together and see what the real facts are. And we know a lot about what works, we\'ve just been stymied a little bit in the last six years. But we\'re going to get rid of those roadblocks, and we\'re going to roll up our sleeves and we\'re going to starting acting liking Americans again. We\'re going to start solving our problems together. We brought electricity to rural communities, we brought interstate highway systems, we\'re going to bring broadband deployment so that every community can be connected up to the global economy. We\'re going to have a new housing project program that is going to invest in local communities. We\'re going to have universal healthcare coverage and we\'re going to use energy to create new jobs. We can do this. Thank you all.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 13, 2007","b'Remarks on Government Reform at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire'","b'It is such a pleasure to be with all of you today at the Institute of Politics here at St. Anselm. Thank you, Melissa, for that wonderful introduction. And I hope you will give me a copy of your thesis. I need to read that. Probably some very useful tips in it. And thank you for welcoming us here. It is wonderful to for me to have this occasion to be here at the institute of politics. It is a tradition that is certainly well-known far beyond the boundaries of this state. And I commend the college for having such an active interest and involvement in the political process of our country and having excellent students like Melissa who take advantage of those opportunities. This university for over one hundred years, has been inspiring young people like Melissa and I am convinced of the quality of this school\'s graduates that I\'m looking to hire some of them. And I have already made one hire; Colin Pio, class of 2007 even before he has graduated to join my campaign. Contingent of course upon receiving his diploma. That is the requirement for the kind of employment we are going to be offering. I\'m here this afternoon to talk about the importance of government and how we make our government work for us. Now, I know for some that might be an unusual choice of topic in the ""Live free or die"" state, where the general feeling is, the less government, the better. But after what I have seen the last six years in Washington, I certainly understand that sentiment. But what I want to talk about today has nothing to do with whether our government is big or small  and everything to do with whether it is competent or incompetent, whether it is corrupt or honest, whether it is devoted to the public interest or beholden to the special interests. Despite their rhetoric, for the past six years, we\'ve had an Administration that doesn\'t believe in less government or smaller government or better government. They simply have contempt for government. Though they lead it, they look down on it, they disparage it, they belittle it at every turn. And because they view our government with contempt  they treat it with contempt. Since they don\'t believe government can be a force for the public interest  they treat it as a source of favors for private interests. They\'ve created a government of the few, by the few, and for the few. Our President has handed out jobs to his friends even when they were not qualified. Given out no-bid contracts to Halliburton  even after they overcharged us by hundreds of millions of dollars. Fired U.S. Attorneys who tried to uphold the law. Silenced government scientists who told the truth. Retaliated against a diplomat who refused to validate fabricated evidence of WMDs in Iraq. Really, it is a stunning record of cronyism and corruption, incompetence and deception and it has shaken the faith of many Americans in our government. When government consistently lets us down like this, we become cynical. We distrust our government  and grow to distrust democracy itself. We decide that politics is distasteful, and politicians just out for themselves, so why should we trust our government with our hopes, dreams and ideals? It really is a self-perpetuating cycle. Because this Administration doesn\'t respect our government, they run it poorly, and it fails our people. They then point to government\'s failure to prove it\'s not worthy of respect. And this just makes it harder for us to work on the critical issues that affect people\'s lives  health care, energy independence, making college affordable and so much else that people throughout New Hampshire and America talk to me about. And today, our families are paying a steep price. Energy costs are up. Health care costs are up. Education costs are up. But wages and incomes are lagging. So while Americans are working harder than ever  they\'re falling further and further behind, and we\'re seeing more and more inequality. It\'s like middle class and hard working families don\'t even exist to this Administration. It\'s like they\'re invisible. For six long years, our President has looked right through them. If you were a victim of Hurricane Katrina  if you\'re one of the nearly 90,000 people still living in trailers  you\'re invisible. If you\'re a soldier who returned from Iraq only to be warehoused in crumbling facilities at Walter Reed, fighting to get the treatment you need  you\'re invisible. If you\'re a parent who can\'t afford childcare or a student who can\'t afford college, a family that can\'t afford to get by on the minimum wage  while the wealthiest of us get tax cuts -- you\'re invisible too. Well, you\'re not invisible to the rest of America. And you\'re certainly not invisible to me. And when we take back the White House, you will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States. Now, we know that government certainly isn\'t the answer to all our problems  that\'s not even close. But we also know that good government  smart government -- can be a partner for progress. It can help us solve problems and accomplish things together that we could never accomplish alone. We\'ve seen this in everything from the Peace Corps to AmeriCorps. From curing diseases to building the Internet. From the end of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo to the end of religious strife in Northern Ireland. This isn\'t about big government or small government  it should be about smart government. And we all know that in order to meet the big challenges of our day  to lift up the middle class and hard working families  to establish universal health care, energy independence and fiscal responsibility  to end the war in Iraq and restore our leadership around the world -- we need a government that is ready to rise to the occasion and lead us to our goals. We need to return to accountability and a system of checks and balances  to a Congress that once again exercises oversight and accountability. We need a 21st century government to meet our 21st century challenges. But in order to reclaim our government, in a democracy after all, our government is us. You know as Pogo once said, memorably, we\'ve met the enemy and it is us. Well our government is us. So by denigrating our government we undermine our capacity to work together to solve these problems. So we have to change the way business is being done. And I think we start by looking at what we expect from our families, our businesses, and our communities  and then asking ourselves, why can\'t our federal government do that? You can check your bank account online. Why can\'t you go online and see how your government is spending  or misspending  your tax dollars? You go to the ATM, stick in your card, and get money  why can\'t our government transfer medical records from the Department of Defense to the VA? You make a budget for your family, and you don\'t spend what you don\'t have or what you don\'t need  why shouldn\'t our government do the same with our federal budget? You trust your doctor to give you honest advice about the medicines you take -- why can\'t government scientists do the same when they regulate our food and drugs and study our environment? Well, I believe our government can do all these things. And that we can be an example to ourselves and to the rest of the world. We can do it in so many ways. We can do it by leading through the government. We can be the institutional support for creating a market for energy efficiency. We can create the architecture for electronic medical records. We can provide information in a way that will enable us to do so much more in a cost effective way. Now, I do know that people are cynical about our government and that\'s sort of the American birthright. But I believe that with the right leadership we can restore trust and faith in government. I believe America is ready for change. Ready for a new start. And ready once again to make this government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We can re-establish the competence of government, the confidence of citizens in government, and the capacity of our government to set goals and achieve them. Today I want lay out a ten point agenda to do just that  an agenda for government reform. A plan to enhance accountability and transparency. To make government more efficient and effective for taxpayers. To restore competence and end the culture of cronyism. To replace secrecy and mystery with openness. A plan to make our government work for all Americans again. First, we need to close the revolving door between government and lobbyists. This is exactly what Governor Lynch did during his first term in office when he created an independent ethics commission and required every member of his administration to file public financial disclosure forms. I think we should follow his lead in Washington, and I\'ll start by permanently banning any of my cabinet officials from lobbying my Administration once they\'ve left office. We\'ve seen the consequences of what happens when we let the revolving door keep turning. The recent Medicare prescription drug bill offers a perfect example. By the time this bill became law, many of those who\'d helped to write it and pass it had left government to become lobbyists for companies that sought to benefit from it. Well, the way I see it, people shouldn\'t use what they\'ve learned on the taxpayers\' dime to enrich themselves at our expense -- and we\'re going to put an end to it. Second, we\'re going to strengthen whistleblower protections so we can root out corruption and cronyism, wherever it may lie. Over the past six years, we\'ve seen one scandal after another at our agencies, from an official in the White House doing favors for Jack Abramoff to an administrator at the Department of Education buying stock in the student loan companies he was supposed to oversee. And while whistleblowers play a critical role in alerting us to behavior like this, our whistleblower protection laws don\'t give people adequate protection  and too many are afraid to step forward. We\'ve seen brave employees who speak up, stripped of their security clearances, pressured into resigning, or outright fired. Take the example of Jack Spadaro, a mining engineer who was head of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy. He blew the whistle on what he felt was a whitewash by the Bush Administration of an investigation into a major coal slurry spill. And he was subsequently forced out of his job. There are hundreds of examples like that. We need to expand whistleblower protections to ensure that people who do the right thing are rewarded  not punished. That means protecting their anonymity  and protecting those who aid them as well. It means guaranteeing whistleblowers a true day in court. It means making sure those who are vindicated get real relief, including compensation, coverage of attorney\'s fees, and the option to transfer jobs. Because no one should be afraid to hold our government accountable. Third, when I\'m President, I will once again appoint the most qualified, dedicated, public-minded people to serve in government. Now, that doesn\'t mean that I won\'t appoint people who support me. But what it does mean is that this administration could have appointed well-qualified Republicans of independent judgment to positions of trust in our government. Instead, they often simply appointed their friends and supporters  qualified or not. A Republican partisan whose job at the International Arabian Horse Association did not prepare him for a job heading FEMA. People hired for the Iraq reconstruction team based on whether they were pro-life rather than whether they spoke Arabic. They hired scores of environmental, health and safety regulators who came from the very industries they were supposed to oversee. And they purged the professional staff at the Civil Rights division in the Department of Justice. Well, the results speak for themselves. Tragic incompetence in the Gulf Coast. Environmental standards weakened. Corporate loopholes widened. An industry-written prescription drug benefit that bars Medicare from bargaining for lower prices. And a Department of Justice that, between 2001 and 2006, did not file a single voter discrimination suit brought by African Americans or Native Americans. Now, we tried to change this. When we were working to improve disaster response after Hurricane Katrina, I proposed that we require proper qualifications for the director of FEMA  something you would think you wouldn\'t have to write into the law. And my proposal eventually did become law. It was part of an overall reform package of FEMA. But when the President signed it, he specifically said that he wasn\'t going to necessarily follow the directions of having a qualified person head FEMA. He used what is called a signing statement, to pick and choose from the provisions in the law of what he would and would not enforce. We have to reign in these signing statements. The President has used them to go way beyond what any President before has ever done. And in effect to veto portions of bills that he just doesn\'t agree with. Well when I\'m President, the entrance to the White House will no longer be a revolving door for just the well-connected -- but a door of opportunity for the well-qualified. And in order to attract the best people to government, I have joined on a bi-partisan basis with some of my colleagues in both the Senate and the House to propose a U.S. Public Service Academy  an undergraduate school modeled after our military service academies that will cultivate a new generation of leaders dedicated to public service. The Academy would provide a four-year, subsidized college education in exchange for a five-year commitment to public service after graduation. It will help us produce a new generation of law enforcement officers, of civil servants of experts who will dedicate themselves to public service. We\'re seeing the retirement of so many people who have been doing the nuts-and-bolts work of the government for many years. And we don\'t see the pipeline filling with people who are willing to take these jobs. And yet I know that many young people are ready, willing and able to answer the call to serve. But they often graduate from college with so much debt that they can\'t imagine going into a public service career. So I hope that the Academy will open the doors much more widely for young people who want to serve their country. Fourth, we\'re going to stop outsourcing our government and put an end to the abuse of no-bid contracts. Over the past six years, this Administration has steadily outsourced critical government functions to private companies, adding more than 2.4 million private contractors to the federal payroll. And today, government contractors have essentially become yet another special interest, with the top 20 contracting firms spending nearly $300 million since 2000 to lobby the government for more business to leave the government and come to them. But these contractors, it turns out, are often more expensive than doing the work in the government  in fact, some contract employees cost twice as much as comparable federal workers. They\'re often less accountable and less competent. And just think of what happened at Walter Reed, when the Army was forced to outsource maintenance to a private contract contractor. The number of people doing maintenance dropped dramatically. The contractor cut corners, fell down on the job -- and our soldiers paid the price. All too often, this Administration has handed out government contracts without even shopping around for the best price. Today, there has been an explosion in no-bid contracting, with almost half of the $329 billion spent on federal contracts being done now on a no-bid basis. The result is fraud, waste, and abuse everywhere from Afghanistan and Iraq to the Gulf Coast. I propose that we eliminate 500,000 government contracting positions, saving our government between $10 and $18 billion a year. And that we insist on competitive bidding for the remaining contracts, so we get the most value for every taxpayer dollar. In the rare case where non-competitive contracts might be appropriate, we\'ll make sure they have close oversight. It seems as thought he motto for the Administration has been ""What\'s a few billion tax dollars between friends?"" Well, when I\'m President, the days of billions in no-bid contracts and handouts to companies like Halliburtonthat in return for the work given to them picks up corporate headquarters and moves to Dubaithose days will be over. Fifth, we\'re going to stop substituting ideology for science and evidence, and we\'re going to start giving the American people again the facts on the issues that matter to them and their families. Over the past six years, this Administration has tried to turn Washington into an evidence-free zone. Whether it\'s stem cell research or Plan B Contraception or pollution or global warming or the safety of our food or the quality of our air -- all too often, ideology has replaced facts, and truth has been the first casualty. The American people deserve better than that. Way back in the 1990s, the White House had an Office of Technology Assessment that was charged with just one task: telling us the truth about science. Sorting out the competing claims and to the best of the scientists\' abilities, telling us what to believe. For decades, they cut through the myths and the spin on everything from Star Wars to AIDS prevention to solar technology. It\'s time we put this office back in business, because our citizens should have the information they need about the issues that affect them. Sixth, we\'re going to open up our government\'s balance sheets so you can see exactly where your tax dollars are going  and the results they\'re getting. As tax day approaches, you probably find yourself wondering just where all your hard-earned money is going. Well, I propose that we require government agencies to publish their budgets and their government contracts online for all to see. So if someone tries to sneak in special favors for their special interest, we can find out about it with the click of a mouse. And we won\'t just track government spending  we\'ll also track results with a new America Results Initiative. With the technology we have today, we can get real-time data on just about anything  from the purity of our water to the health of our ecosystems to the condition of our roads and bridges. We\'ll gather and analyze that data to see whether our government programs are effective. We\'ll then post it online so that our citizens can have the most up-to-date knowledge about everything from the quality of their air to the traffic on their streets. Information technology is revolutionizing every segment of society  from business, to education, to entertainment  and it\'s time that it revolutionized our government as well. We also need to go back to doing what was done during the Clinton Administration with the Reinventing Government initiative, known as REGO, which Bill started and asked Vice President Gore to head-up. And the results were astonishing. REGO was credited with saving taxpayers more than $136 billion over eight years by cutting the federal workforce, trimming layers of management, cutting subsidies for items like mohair and wool. And so, why don\'t we get back to doing that again if we\'re serious about having a government that works, we should be constantly asking ourselves the hard questions about why we\'re paying for something, and whether we should continue to do so. I also want to establish a new Corporate Subsidy Information Service. This watchdog agency will track every tax subsidy that Congress gives to big corporations. So we\'ll know exactly how much each company gets  and we can track whether those subsidies actually promote results for the country and not just the company. Those subsidies are supposed to have a public good element to them. That\'s why we provide tax dollars, and yet too often, we have no analysis and evaluation as to whether they are really worth what the taxpayers are paying. Seventh, we\'re going to make sure our government pays its bills and lives within its means again  just like our families. That\'s what we did during my husband\'s Administration, when we balanced the budget and turned record deficits into surpluses. It took discipline and determination, a lot of hard work, but again, the results speak for themselves. Twenty-two million new jobs. The longest peacetime economic expansion in history. And the savings rate was reflected in our attaining leverage once again in the world. We\'ve moved from the largest debtor nation to a creditor nation. Well, we\'re back in to the larger debtor nation again. That undermines our capacity to exercise leadership on important issues like trade and other strategic concerns. So, we need to return to the fundamental principle of pay-as-you-go. Eighth, I want to make government more user friendly across the board  and that starts with bringing more government services online. Last year, 73 million Americans filed their income taxes online. I want to make it possible for virtually every transaction to be paperless. Every day, Americans read the news online, shop online, chat online, and it\'s time that our government went fully online as well. In order to do that, however, we\'re going to have to move to the ninth point of my reform agenda. We have to have government take the lead in modernizing its record keeping systems and take the lead in areas that really can change the market and behaviors to the benefit of us all. What do I mean by that? Well, I know this doesn\'t sound particularly exciting, but it\'s really important. Because, just look at what\'s happening to our veterans. Just earlier this week, I spent a day in Upstate New York visiting with a lot of our wounded and injured veterans. I was at the V.A. in Syracuse, New York, and then I went up to Fort Drum, which is up in the North Country of New York. And I met with soldiers who had just returned from Afghanistan and Iraq. I met with over 40 of them who had been injured and/or wounded. And here\'s what they told me: their medical records have been lost. One young soldier told me that he\'d been hit by an IED on his convoy in Baghdad, which is absolutely superbwhat our soldiers get at the point where they are beginning treatment to save their lives is extraordinary. We\'re saving so many lives that we couldn\'t have saved in the first Gulf War. And then as he was on a gurney as he was being wheeled to the plane to take him to the Army medical center in Landstuhl, Germany, someone came over, said, ""Soldier, I\'m putting this packet on your chest. It\'s your medical records, don\'t lose it."" He gets on the plane. He\'s doped up for the long flight. They wheel him off in Landstuhl. The medical records haven\'t been seen since. I hear that over and over again. And when a soldier moves from being treated in Department of Defense facilities, which do provide very good acute care, to either outpatient or into the V.A. system, the records don\'t get transferred. The records get lost. There are so many examples of how our government is inefficient because we can\'t figure out how we computerize it. Maybe some of you have read about the years of struggle to get the FBI to have a computer system that keeps track of their cases. Still hasn\'t happened, at the cost of billions of dollars. Well, we can fix this. We need to bring in private sector partners. We need to cut through red tape, and we need to begin to do what it takes to get our government to have information as readily available as we have in the rest of our lives. And our government can also lead by example, by pressing national issues like energy efficiency and health care reform. I\'ve introduced legislation to require that government buildings become energy efficient, and that new buildings which the government constructs try to attain the highest LEED standard, which is the gold standard for energy efficiency for a building. We can help to create markets with everything from new building materials to more energy efficient appliances to more fluorescent light bulbs by having the government lead by example. And with respect to health care reform, I\'ve also worked on a bipartisan basis to help create the framework for electronic medical records so that we could begin to realize the cost savings that would come if we have medical records that were private and confidential, with encrypted codes for access, that could be available if you were visiting New York, and you have to go to an emergency room or just visiting another doctor here in New Hampshire, and not have to go through a history again, tests you\'ve taken before. The RAND Corporation has estimated we would save $100 billion a year in our health care system if we had electronic medical records. And the government has to lead with creating the architecture and standards for us to be able to do this, and not just create thousands of towers of Babel that can\'t talk to each other. Tenth and finally, we have to reform our election system. That\'s where our democracy starts. We have to make sure that every vote is counted and every vote counts  and we know that the best place to hold a government accountable is at the ballot box. Unfortunately, there\'s been a lot of interference with our electoral system in the last years, and there have been new requirements that have been put up as obstacles, that have really discouraged people from exercising their right to vote. I\'ve introduced legislation called the Count Every Vote Act, which is a comprehensive voting reform bill. It will make our voting systems more accountable and accessible. It will expand the right to vote of most of our citizens. It will create more opportunities for people to register to vote, and it will give greater assurances through paper-verified ballots that those votes will be counted. We need more oversight in our electoral system to discourage manipulation and deception. It is almost heart-breaking that I have to mention this on my reform agenda. American should lead the world in the best electoral system, using the best equipment. A few years ago, there was an election in India. We are the oldest democracy. India is the largest democracy. They had an election, and no one predicted the outcome. Everyone thought that the then-BJP Party in power would be sent back in to power. There was an earthquake. Congress Party won the election. There were no complaints. There were no disagreements. People accepted the results, even though Indian politics can get extremely exciting. And I asked some of my Indian friends, ""We\'ve had two elections, and we\'ve had complaints; we\'ve had people turned away at the voting booth. We\'ve had people misled about where and when they were supposed to vote. We\'ve had ballots lost. How could you have done this?"" ""Very simple,"" they said. ""We have turned it in to into a nonpartisan, civil service effort, where we have an independent board,"" like our Federal Reserve board, ""that runs our national elections, and we computerized everything."" So whether you were a peasant woman in Rajasthan, or a billion dot-com entrepreneur in Delhi, you voted on computers, and in order to deal with the problem of illiteracy, you had both words and pictures so that people could know who they were voting for. And your vote would be automatically recorded in the computer where you were polled and in a regional server and in a national server as a failsafe. You know, someone after hearing that story said, well maybe we should outsource our elections to India. I mean, it\'s sort of is a sad commentary to think about. But here we are the leaders in all this technology. We invented it, and we can\'t figure out how to use it for our own purposes. So, I\'m convinced we can do everything I\'ve outlined with the right leadership. People are ready for this change. In fact, it\'s the only way we can restore confidence in our government again. Now, I know I\'ve covered a lot of ground today, and it\'s not exactly the kind of subject matter that gets people marching in the streets, but if we don\'t restore competence in our government and confidence in our government, we will see the steady erosion of our government\'s capacity. There are some who argue that ideologues may have that in minddiscourage people from believing in government, render it incompetent, make people give up on this great enterprise known as our government. Oh, we\'ll still appropriate money for defense and homeland security but, beyond that, not much else. Well, we can reject such a cynical perspective by beginning to implement this reform agenda. When I was working on this speech, I remembered a story that former Secretary of State, my friend, Madeleine Albright once told me about a tour she took through the Czech Republic in 1995 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. In every town she visited, the Czech people were out waving American flags. But the flags had only 48 stars. It turns out that American troops had given out these flags at the end of World War II, 50 years before  and that families had treasured them, had kept them through communists and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and all of the problems they confronted. Through all those years of communist repression, the Czech people held on to them and to the hope they represented. They wouldn\'t give up on America\'s ideals  and neither should we. It is past time that we once again have a government that works and that works for all of us. For leaders who never forget that it is your votes that put them in power  your tax dollars that pay the bills  your nation they are leading. It\'s time for a President who earns your trust and respect one day at a time. A President who never forgets that, as the great Granite stater, Senator Daniel Webster once said, ""We are all agents of the same supreme power, the people."" If you give me that chance, I will be that President. Thank you all, very, very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 19, 2007",b'Speech at Dillard University in New Orleans',"b'Good Morning, what a great day this is in so many ways. And I am deeply honored to be here today and to have been asked to be your commencement speaker. I want to thank President Hughes, and the faculty of this great university, the alumni, the class of 1957 and all the family and friends who are gathered here. I want especially to congratulate my fellow honorees, Dr. Frank Mason, a long time friend and real hero of mine, Dr. Roberta Flack. I am hopeful that the feeling you all have today as you walk through those majestic oaks will stay with you as you leave this university and enter into the world you have been prepared to lead and serve.President Hughes, I\'m not sure if words exist to express the gratitude this assembly feels for you today. Certainly you and your trustees led by Trustee Roche face a challenge that rarely ever has had to be confronted by any university. And to think that you just arrived at Dillard, you were just unpacking you bags, you had only been here for two months, when you found yourself at the helm of a university that was under water. But true leaders are those who rise to whatever challenge confronts them. And no one has risen higher than your President. To the entire Dillard community, I thank you for you leadership and your example. And to the members of the class of 2007, I am very proud to be here to congratulate you on this milestone moment. The day you know that all your hard work was worthwhile, the nights you spent studying, the days you spent in class, the hours you worked to earn your tuition money. And that\'s all in addition to the months you spent coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As I walked between you, you were holding the flags of the colleges and universities you attended during the time that Dillard was so grievously struck. And I was glancing at the names that were literally all over the country. I know it wasn\'t easy, and I know that none of you did it alone. As your valedictorian pointed out, you were in this together, you found strength from each other, you may never have known before. You had friends and family, teachers and preachers, administrators and staff who believed in you and sacrificed for you. They held you up when you were struggling. They would not let you give in to your fears and doubts. You are here because of them, and because as it is written in the scriptures, of their work of faith and labor of love, and steadfastness of hope. As I look out on these graduates, I see that you are the work, the glorious result of faith, love, and hope. Today, let us give thanks to all the family and friends and others that helped you along the way. Some are only here in spirit, but they are with you, they have guided you and I know that you are grateful to them. Just think of that dark day nearly two years ago, you boarded those buses for destinations unknown, you may have wondered whether you would ever see this moment. Whether you would join all of the Dillard alumni who had marched down that Avenue of the Oaks. Whether you would ever be reunited with your faculty members that you have depended upon and learned so much from. But while you may have been scared and uncertain, you did take a deep breath -- probably many deep breaths -- and you showed this country exactly what that Dillard University motto means: you were the living, breathing embodiment of the confidence that comes from faith. Lifted by the kindness of strangers, sustained by the communities you found you learned what I hope was one of many lessons throughout your life about the amazing grace that brought you safe and finally leads you home. Back here in New Orleans, President Hughes was doing everything she could to provide that home. Dillard\'s campus may have been uninhabitable, but that didn\'t stop your President. She worked around the clock, making calls, making plans, making sure all of you were OK. And when the Spring Semester came, because of her perseverance, Dillard University had a new home -- in a Hilton Hotel. Now, President Hughes and the faculty and the trustees and the stuff did not know whether you would come back. Whether you would be willing to pursue your studies in a temporary campus in a struggling city. She thought maybe 400 or 500 of you would return. But by the time those doors opened in January of 2006, 1,200 of you were ready to walk through. You came back. You came because you refused to abandon this great American university and this great American city. You came back because you refused to leave behind the friends, the professors, and so many who had become your extended family. You came back because you knew that Dillard is more than the beautiful buildings and the lush green lawns and the majestic oaks -- you knew that what makes Dillard special is something no storm, no flood, or fire can ever destroy. And because you came back, Dillard University came back as well. You did your jobs -- you learned you taught you devoted long hours to serving your community. People and institutions in New Orleans -- and across America -- they did their jobs too. The non-profits provided desperately-needed services in terrible conditions. The churches reached out to those most in need. Ordinary citizens volunteered donated money opened up their homes and hearts. But unfortunately, the federal government did not do its job. It didn\'t hold up its end of the bargain. Now federal officials did find time to track down students and demand recoupment of money they gave you to survive the storm, but in everything else from emergency response to rebuilding public works to restoring essential services, the federal government failed. And today, nearly two years later, we still don\'t have a reliable hurricane protection system. We still haven\'t rebuilt schools, hospitals, firehouses or parks. There are more than 80,000 households living in trailers. And New Orleans is caught in a vicious cycle. Because so many people have left, neighborhoods haven\'t recovered. And because neighborhoods haven\'t recovered, many people simply cannot come back. In short, a natural disaster became a national disgrace -- and an international embarrassment. Let me say that again -- this is a national disgrace. Anyone who thinks this is a local or regional crisis -- anyone who thinks this is about ""them,"" and not ""us"" -- is sorely mistaken. Think about how all Americans benefit from the commerce that goes through this city\'s port. How all of us benefit from the oil and gas produced off your shores. All of us have been enriched by the culture and legacy of this city. And when our fellow citizens hurt -- all of us hurt. Whether in Oklahoma City or New York City or New Orleans -- when Americans our fellow citizens suffer -- all of us suffer. Today, I want to be very clear: rebuilding this city is not a New Orleans obligation or a Louisiana obligation -- it is an American obligation. And I want to spend a few minutes with you today talking about that obligation. And how we finally begin to fulfill it. Now, as a Senator from New York after September 11, I know what it\'s like to stand in the aftermath of destruction so great, you can barely comprehend it, and to wonder where to even begin and whether you\'ll ever fully recover. But I also know about the kind of love for a city that makes you determined to not just restore what you\'ve lost -- but to create something stronger, more beautiful, and more lasting. I also know a thing or two about what you don\'t need as you try to move forward. You don\'t need more empty promises. You don\'t need more talk. You don\'t need more bureaucracy. If talk and bureaucracy and promises were enough, we\'d have rebuilt New Orleans three times over by now. What we do need is action. Action supported by our federal government, but driven right here in New Orleans and in the surrounding parishes. by the people who understand the reality on the ground. Action that leads to real, measurable improvements. Not six months from now, or a year from now -- but right now. The question is, where do we begin? How do we stop talking the talk and start walking the walk? Well, I think we need a comprehensive approach -- one where the federal government responds to what our state and local leaders and residents are telling them from the point of living and working in the area. I want to commend groups like women of the storm, and by the way, I fully support their proposal to hold a debate right here in New Orleans in the fall of 2007. My good friend and colleague, Mary Landrieu, has been a passionate voice and an effective leader for Louisiana, and I have learned a great deal from her during this time. I support her coastal restoration plan. My proposals in this area build on her work, and the work of other leaders from this state and region. My approach starts with putting one person, one accountable person in charge of recovery efforts and giving that person the authority he or she needs to do that job. Right now, the federal government\'s Gulf Coast rebuilding office is buried in bureaucracy at the Department of Homeland Security. Instead, there should be a Federal Recovery Director who sits in the West Wing and reports directly to the President every single week about what is happening to the people who are still suffering. And the Director\'s first order of business should be to reach out to every community affected and figure out exactly what they need and how the federal government can help. I don\'t think that communities should have to go to the federal government to beg for help -- the federal government should come to them. Second, let\'s get federal money where it\'s needed right now. Enough with the red tape. Enough with the paperwork. Right now, communities are required to match a percentage of the funds they receive from FEMA. But we know that many simply can\'t afford it. When you hear people in Washington talking about all the money that\'s been appropriated for Louisiana, stop and ask yourself how much of that money has actually been delivered to the people of Louisiana. So let\'s do for New Orleans and the surrounding parishes what was done for New York after 9/11. Waive the rule requiring matching funds to get federal money for infrastructure improvements. And, let\'s create a user-friendly, flexible, streamlined process to get funding for public works projects. Here\'s one of the things that drives people crazy, they\'re trying to get flood money through a program called a program called Community Development Block Grant to service the mass to get the money from FEMA, you have to get the environmental assessment. Trying to get the money from FEMA, you need to have an environmental assessment. Don\'t you think they could talk together and one single environmental assessment, instead of requiring people to spend 40 and 50 thousand dollars to get two assessments? This is the kind bureaucratic nonsense that has stood in the way of rebuilding. And once a community has applied for funds, let\'s provide a small amount of money upfront, so you can get started on their project while they\'re waiting for approval. And let\'s come together and finally find a way to make the ""Road Home"" program actually work for the people of Louisiana. I was in the Broadmoor neighborhood yesterday, I met with Mrs. Johnson, a widow, raised six children in her home. Unfortunately she paid fifty thousand dollars to a contractor who turned out to be unscrupulous. And the work done on her home does not meet the standards of the city. So, she is still living in one of the trailers. How many of you have been in one of the FEMA trailers? So, you know how difficult it is. And across the street, Mr. Washington is paralyzed on one side, a retired gentleman trying to save his home. Wondering when he is going to get the help to do the work that he needs to do. It is heartbreaking to see people who are decent hardworking Americans neglected by their government. One of the things we need is more people to help. Third, let\'s create a Gulf Coast Corps of dedicated men and women who would work fulltime to help our communities rebuild. Congressmen Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and other Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are working on a similar idea. I would envision the Corps having two separate parts, one that would provide financial incentives to skilled professionals -- teachers, doctors, nurses and others to serve high-need areas. The other working hand-in-hand with the building trades union would consist of workers and apprentices who would complete priority projects. Many would be local -- and many would be able to return to get jobs that paid well,. And you could work with local communities to help restore our fire stations, the hospitals, sewers and so much else. Fourth, let\'s make sure we finally build a reliable hurricane protection system for the city of New Orleans. That starts with a stem-to-stern review of the Army Corps of Engineers\' plans and progress so far in building the levee and pump system. Once we\'re certain we\'re on the right track, let\'s fully fund the construction of this system -- and let\'s set a deadline so we actually get it done. We also need the Corps initiate a wetlands restoration plan, because we if we don\'t build up the wetlands we know we won\'t be able to protect the city. Fifth, let\'s expand affordable housing. We know we need to provide more housing. The president showed me the housing she\'s already built here on campus, it looks a lot better than trailers. We also need to address the skyrocketing cost of insurance and provide more rental housing. Next, let\'s deal with the rising crime rate, put more police back on the street, fund them with federal dollars. We need to make sure we have 21st century schools for New Orleans. We know there were serious problems before Katrina, and let\'s set the goal of making New Orleans schools the best in the country. Eighth, let\'s revitalize the health care system in this city. Reopen hospitals, and let\'s rebuild charity hospitals, and make it simple for healthcare patients. We need to address the growing mental health crisis in the city and the area. Let\'s promote smart development, clean efficient energy use, ""green"": buildings and so much else, so New Orleans is sustainable. Finally, we have to overhaul our nation\'s disaster response system. Lets start by making FEMA independent again, giving it cabinet-level position, where it reports directly to the President.Let\'s create a Katrina and Rita Commission modeled on the 9/11 Commission to figure out what went wrong so it will never happen again. When all is said and done, I know how hard it is to move forward after a tragedy of this magnitude. In a tribute read at a remembrance service for British citizens lost on September 11, Queen Elizabeth wrote that ""Grief is the price we pay for love."" I know that today, many still grieve for those we loved and lost. For the homes and business destroyed. For the memories and heritage and history swept away in that storm. Class of 2007, at a very young age, you have learned the hard truth that there are moments in our lifetime on this earth when, after extraordinary loss, we have no choice but to begin history anew. I have confidence that we will choose to move forward, choose to rebuild, choose to create a new life and a new life for this great city. And I hope that one day, years from now, you\'ll bring your children and grandchildren here, to this city and this campus, you\'ll tell them about what you did in facing the great flood, and you will tell them that you love this school too much to leave it behind. I believe that is what we have to tell the people of this country about the people of New Orleans. That we need to love this city too much to not leave it behind. And that while our government has stumbled, we ultimately found our way. And that out of the sludge and ashes and destruction of this storm, we rebuilt this city -- stronger, prouder, more lovely and lasting than ever before. Graduates, on this day, that is my wish for you. That you will live lives that reflect the courage and heroism, the bravery and determination that you have exhibited thus far in your lives. And that is also my hope for Dillard and for New Orleans. With your talent, your dedication and your hard work, I have every confidence those hopes will be realized.Congratulations again on all you have achieved. You have made your families and all of us so very proud. Thank you and God speed.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 21, 2007",b'Remarks in Miami on Expanding Pre-K',"b'Thank you all very much. It is such a pleasure to be here at North Beach and I want to thank superintendent Rudy Crew. I\'ve known the superintendent for many years, worked with him when he was in New York and am delighted to have this chance to reconnect with him here in Miami. I want to thank the principal, Mr. Luther Grey for welcoming me. I have a little personal rule when I walk into a school and I\'ve walked into probably by now thousands of schools over the years, just to get a feeling for what the school is like and if there are teachers around, to ask the teachers what its like, ask the students, if the parents are there ask them. And the real support and enthusiasm for this school is just palpable. And I\'m so grateful for all of you being here and I wanted to commend not only the principal and all of the teachers but the entire school community; students and the parents and the family members who make this school work so well. This is a gift, my beautiful, beautiful necklace from two of the pre-k students, Sofia and Savannah and it matches my jacket so I had to wear it and it has my initials, so I\'m feeling very dressed up today. I\'m here to talk about an issue that I\'ve been working on for a very long time, going back to when I was in law school and became concerned about how we cared for and educated our youngest children. Because I believe that we have to do our best with our children from the very beginning.For thirty-five years as a lawyer and an advocate, as a friend lady and a Senator and most importantly as a Mom, I have been strongly in support of providing the tools to parents that would give parents an opportunity to recognize that they are their child\'s first teachers and that the family is their child\'s first school; because we have to have a strong partnership between our families and our schools and our society on behalf of our children. I\'ve seen what happens when caring adults come together and make a commitment to insure that each child has a chance to fulfill his or her god-given potential. Years ago when my husband was governor of Arkansas, I brought a program to Arkansas from Israel that helped to train parents -- mostly mothers and some grandmothers -- about how to prepare their own children for school. We talked to them and helped them understand the importance of reading to their children, of talking to their children, of even using household objects to teach basic lessons; the difference between a spoon and a fork, for example. Because what we knew is that when children entered kindergarten or first grade, a lot of children who had a very good basic beginning by how they were raised and what they were exposed to, were so far ahead of other children who didn\'t have that set of opportunities. I believe its important that we work as families to help to encourage them. To understand that things that seem very simple like talking to a child and reading to a child, lay the groundwork for brain development and for a child being able to do well later on. I see this when I visited the Head Start programs, where children were learning to read and count and solve problems and work with each other, have a chance to develop the habits that we need in society so that people get along. We all know about the \'terrible twos\' and we know about the sometimes rebellious fours and trying to figure out how to structure settings so kids can learn what it will take to be successful in this society is so important, not only for the children but for all of us. And early this morning, I was here in North Beach and met some of the pre-k children and teachers and then I just toured the three classrooms and I\'m very impressed with the quality of interaction and instruction and with the lessons that children are learning. Not only the academic lessons, where I saw children circling all the letter H or all the letter G or doing the alphabet puzzles or using rhyming cards to begin to do what they need to understand words and get ready for reading, but also getting along with each other, respecting each other, something that we really need in the world today. And I think every child should have the same opportunity to learn and grow and develop at the four year olds here at North Beach are doing. Because the fact is, we cannot succeed in the global economy today unless our children universally are given the best start in life and then can take advantage of education and enter the world ready to be productive. Obviously if you look at the entire education system there\'s a lot of work we have to do. We have to make college more affordable and I\'ve talked a lot about that. We have to make it possible for our teachers to have working conditions that give them the chance to be the best teachers we can be. There\'s a lot of things we need to do to reform and change No Child Left Behind, which is an unfunded mandate on our school. But we all know that preparing children to attend college or to start a career, to get the skills they need, starts way earlier than that. I\'m going to be proposing throughout my campaign, additional investments in even younger children; those 0-3 because parents need high quality child care and much more in the way of parental support in education about how to do best job they can. Today, fewer than 20% of our four year olds in America are in pre-K programs that are funded by our various states. That\'s what I want to discuss because I think our educational system needs to be strengthened from start to finish, but we have to start where it all begins. Today I\'m announcing a proposal to establish universal pre kindergarten education; access to high quality pre-kindergarten for every single four year old in America. Our children are growing up in a world that is vastly more competitive and certainly a lot more technologically advanced than when most of us were those ages. I go into classrooms and it\'s pretty much familiar to me because it looks exactly like looked when I was in elementary school and that was a long time ago. And we have a lot of working care, a lot of single moms supporting kids, we have a lot of differences now than what we used to have. So how do we help prepare all of our children to be as successful as they possibly can? I\'ve talked to lots of teachers about what happens the first day of kindergarten, the first day of first grade. Some children arrive already knowing how to write their name, they know how to interact with their peers, they thrive in a structured environment. Others don\'t; they are not even sure of how to fit in, or what they are supposed to do. They certainly don\'t know how to spell their names, in fact some of them don\'t even know their full name because they\'ve been called by a nick name for so much of their lives. We can\'t let that continue if we expect our children to be successful. We can talk all we want about how public schools are great equalizers and engines of our meritocracy in America. But if children start school behind, it is likely they will stay behind and by the third or fourth grade they are already feeling like they don\'t fit in. They are not comfortable, they are being labeled failures and I don\'t think that\'s what we want for our children. Many families cannot afford the kind of pre-k program on their own that I see here in this school. Many parents struggle to try to find somebody to take care of their children in a safe environment while they go to work. During the time that I was First Lady, I hosted a White House conference on child care and one on how the brain develops because it was becoming very clear that in the first give years of life, so much of the brain develops. You don\'t think about that but that\'s exactly what\'s going on when children are making connections; their brains are making those connections, as well. And unfortunately we cut back in the last six years on investments in early childhood. This administration has not provided adequate funding for quality childcare; they\'ve cut Head Start 11% in the last five years and unfortunately proposed to cut another 30,000 slots this year alone; nearly 1200 of them in Florida. I don\'t understand that because I really do believe that children deserve our attention and they deserve our resources and our investment. Too many children, though, and their needs are just not being seen in Washington today. If your child is sitting in a crumbling school and I\'ve been in those; you\'re invisible. If you\'re a single mom who can\'t afford safe, quality child care, you\'re invisible, too. If you\'re a family that works and can\'t afford health care your child needs to have his eye checked or her teeth checked, you\'re invisible, as well. If you\'re a teacher who is not getting the respect and pay you deserve from the hard work you put in, you\'re invisible. I think we shouldn\'t allow anyone in America to be invisible and in order to do that we have to change our priorities as a nation. We should start with our youngest children. A lot of people say, well that\'s a nice thing to do but what does that have to do with all the big problems we face in the world. In fact, some people, when I talk about the need to really help prepare children, they sort of say, well that\'s a nice thing to be for, but kind of soft, I mean it\'s not really that important, is it? But we know that it is. Not only do we know that the brain develops in those early years and it is hard to imagine that some children come into Kindergarten or first grade knowing lots of words and knowing their meanings. That gives them a tremendous head start. Some children for whom English is not the first language, they struggle with that. So we have to work to do across the board. But it is not just the right thing to do or the nice thing to do. We now have lots of evidence from hard-headed economists that investing in early childhood makes sense. According to one study conducted by Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman of the University of Chicago, you can close half the gaps in testing between African-American and white students that shows up at the end of high school if you have pre-school. You can also begin to deal with a lot of behavior problems that kids come into school with; these early years do not pre-ordain a child\'s life. Many children from difficult and disadvantaged childhoods can become extraordinary adults, but this is a critical moment in time, and we are squandering it right now. I go to schools and I see so many children who just don\'t fit in. They feel left out, they feel overwhelmed. Lots of times, the teachers are overwhelmed; there is not enough help in the school to give them the attention they need. So I\'d like to make sure that we offer pre-kindergarten to every four-year old in America. And we should make it an offer, if not required, we should certainly encourage parents to do this and tell then what the facts are. Children who attend pre-kindergarten are less likely to enroll in special education; they are less likely to drop out of high school. They are more likely to go on and graduate from college. They are less likely to be unemployed, and they are less likely to go on welfare. As Professor Heckman said: early learning begets later learning, and early success begets later success. And if you add up all the benefits, it\'s is really astonishing. Another study done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis show that investing in early childhood shows an annual rate of return of between 7 and 18%. In other words, you put in a dollar in early childhood, you are going to get at least seven dollars back. And imagine if you could buy a stock with that kind of return. That is why a lot of business groups including the Committee on Economic Development support universal pre-kindergarten. And it is not only for our family budget, it is good for everybody\'s budget. The cost of childcare, even if the childcare is frankly not that good, is pretty high these days, isn\'t it? And think about the savings that families could have if pre-kindergarten was accessible as public kindergarten is. It is also important to recognize that other countries are doing this. You know, a lot of our competitors really are starting earlier because they understand that they will get better results. It is also startling to realize that many people who plan what kinds of prisons have to be built and how big they need to be say they look at third grade readings course to project how many children will grow up into trouble, teenagers and adults and end up in the prison system. And we spend a lot of money on prisons in this country. If we could avoid spending money on prisons, we could certainly make our society better, and we can pay for this by cutting back on some of the expenditures that the current administration is doing. We could consistently fail to invest in what saves us money. I remember during the 1980s, the federal government was trying to immunize children during the 1970s, and in the 1980s that was all cut back. It was an attempt to save money. But what happened is because so many children weren\'t immunized, there was measles epidemic between 1989 and 1991 that struck 55 000 people, killed 130 of them, many of their children and it cost the country 150 million dollars to cope with the measles epidemic. So, it makes sense to try and prevent problems instead of paying for them. And we can do this by creating some cuts in programs that really don\'t add up. In all of the assessments of how much this would cost, we believe that investing in pre-kindergarten now will end up saving the government about 191 billion dollars over time, in not having as many prisons, in having more productive adults who will make more money, in avoiding the cost of illiteracy and dropouts. So it is a pretty good investment and a lot of states understand that. We have about 29 states now that invest in pre-k. And recently here in Florida, six former governors of Florida and the wife of late Governor Lawton Chiles, all sides of different viewpoints signed a letter urging Florida to make good on the constitutional amendment that the people of Florida have voted for back in 2002. See, Florida was way ahead of everybody, and the people of Florida were really in the vanguard of this, saying let\'s provide a universal pre-K. And I want to start by investing 5 billion dollars in matching grant for the gold state. Now in a state like Florida which is already beginning to do this, the money would help you go to the next level, to make sure that there was a program everywhere of high quality. In order to receive the money, states would have to hire teachers with bachelor\'s degrees who had specialized in early childhood development. They have to develop learning standards and curricula if they don\'t already have them, and ensure low teacher-child ratios so that every child gets an individual attention that the child needs. And of course you would have to have to health and safety oversight that is required. I would also require states to coordinate with community based providers, work with Head Start. I am a big believer in Head Start and I had fought to protect Head Start and also, to early provide Head Starts so we can begin to help children who are particularly at risk. And if there are problems in having enough money, I would want the state to target the children who need it the most. My daughter didn\'t need it. We sent her to pre-school. We had her in pre-school program because we knew it would be good for her, to have the interaction with other children, to be with other adults besides her father and me. And we had some great experiences from that. We also ran into some challenges. There is a period of time when my daughter would only eat green grapes and Jelly sandwiches. And she took a bunch of green grapes and Jelly sandwiches to pre-school every day to eat during her break. And the state was monitoring the pre-school program and they had a supervisor from the state seeing how the children were treated and at the end of the week, the supervisor said to the head teacher \'I think the program is very good but there is this one child who is really going to be poorly served. She may end up being mal-nourished because everyday she brings the same thing for lunch.\' So the head teacher said, well yeah I know, that is the Governor\'s daughter [laughter] and that is what she is eating this week.\' Obviously, I thought it was worth doing it for my own child, and I think it is worth doing it for every child. I believe that we can increase our investments once we see that it works and when people say \'where we will get the 5 billion dollars to start this program?\' There are so many to cut the money that is being spent in this government. Let\'s start by cutting 500 000 off the contractors that the Bush administration had added, who don\'t do a job that is held [Applause].I think we can find a lot of other waste. Obviously we are spending more than half a trillion dollars on the Iraq war and when we finally end that, we are going to have to start getting ourselves out of deficit, but we need at the same time to make some investment that will help keep our country strong. So I am excited about doing this. [Applause]. Years ago, my first job out of law school was to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund and it is one of the great jobs you could have because if you care about children\'s futures, if you believe it is important to do everything possible to help them, there is no better place. And the Head of the Children Defense Fund Marian Wright Edelman once said ""if we don\'t stand for children, we don\'t stand for much."" And I could not agree more. I saw these beautiful children here in this school today and every one of them has a divine spark inside, every one has the potential to be the kind of person that we all hope our children would grow up to be. Parents and family members have the first and primary responsibility, but then the rest of us have a role to play. That is why I wrote a book ten years ago called \'It Takes a Village\', because you can be the best parent in the world and think you are doing the very best job, but your child is going to be affected by people you will know like teachers, and people you will never meet like police officers who try to keep the streets safe or people who check that the water you drink is safe. If we think about our responsibility for all our children, we will start making investments that will not only help our children but I believe really help us. So, today to stand up for our children, let\'s do what is done here in this school. I am looking at these young people here wearing their North Beach shirts and I am still proud that they are going to a school that really values them and appreciates how important it is that we make good investments. I am a big believer in public education and I am not giving up on public education. I think public education is absolutely essential [Applause]. And one thing people rarely talk about is when you look at test scores and analyze assessments, private schools don\'t do better than public schools, but a lot of people believe that because everything that happens in the public school is public information. If something bad happens in a public school, it is going to be in the newspaper, if something happens in a private school, you are not going to read about it. I think it is time that we really invest in our public schools, so let\'s begin by investing more in our in our youngest children [Applause]. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 24, 2007",b'Remarks at the George Washington University on Reducing the Cost of Health Care',"b'Well, thank you very, very, much. I am delighted to be back at GW and I want to thank President Trachtenberg for his kind introduction, but he and his wife Francine have been leading advocates on behalf of higher education and so many other issues for as long as I\'ve known them, and that goes back many years. And as Joel said, we shared the experience of our children in high school, and that was indeed an experience we both survived, so we\'re grateful to tell the tale. I want to thank Dr. Williams, and, of course, Dr. Becker. I want also to recognize Russ Ramsey, the chair of the board, Dr. Scott, Dean of the Medical School and the CEO of GW Medical Faculty Associates, Stephen Badger. It is an honor to be back at GW in order to talk about one of the most important issues facing the health care community, and of course, our country. As I travel around America, I have talked with people from all walks of life about the challenges that our country is facing: from ending the war in Iraq to ending our dependence on foreign oil -- from improving our education system to reducing our deficit. And no matter where I go or with whom I talk -- whether it\'s small business owners or CEOs, doctors or nurses or patients -- I hear growing concern about the crisis in our health care system: exploding costs, declining coverage and shortcoming in care and prevention. Now, I\'ve tangled with this issue before -- and I\'ve got the scars to show for it. But I learned some valuable lessons from that experience. One is that we can\'t achieve reform without the participation and commitment of health care providers, employers, employees and other citizens who pay for, depend upon, and actually deliver health care services. I think we finally have a recognition that everyone sees there is an economic imperative to rein in costs. There is a moral imperative to extend coverage to all Americans. And, there is a practical necessity to promote wellness and prevent illness wherever possible. I plan to put those lessons to work to ensure every single American has quality, affordable health coverage. There are three parts to my approach. First, lowering costs for everyone. Second, improving quality for everyone. Third, insuring everyone. Today, I will focus on the challenge of lowering costs. Health care costs are spiraling out of control. Premiums have almost doubled since 2000 -- increasing four times faster than average wages. Every day, parents choose between paying the premium for themselves or their children. Small businesses wonder how they will stay afloat when their health care costs eat up their profits year after year. CEOs of major American companies worry about how they will succeed in the global economy when they\'re competing with foreign companies that spend significantly less on health care. We spend 16 percent of our gross domestic product - $2 trillion -- on health care. And by 2016, health costs are scheduled to exceed $4 trillion, or almost 20% of GDP. That means that within less than 10 years, 20 cents out of every dollar produced in America will be spent on healthcare. No other country spends more than 12%, a difference of more than $500 billion. All other wealthy countries spend even less. We spend $5,711 per patient. The next highest spending country, Switzerland, spends $3,847 on patients. Yet, they cover every single one of their citizens and have an average life expectancy that is three years longer than ours. Now, how have our costs spiraled out of control like this? Well, about 30% of the rise in health care spending is linked to the doubling of obesity among adults over the past 20 years. In other words, if our obesity levels had remained at 1990 levels, we would be spending 10% less on health care today -- a savings of $220 billion. About two-thirds of the rise in health care spending is associated with a rise in the prevalence of treatable disease - like diabetes, asthma and heart disease. 75% of all health care spending -- roughly $1.5 trillion -- is associated with the 4 to 5 percent of patients who have multiple chronic illnesses and require ongoing medical management over a period of years, or even decades. And 10-12% of the total health care budget is spent on end of life care. Our administrative costs are by far the highest in the world. Today more than one in four health care dollars goes to administration. 64% of private insurance plans\' administrative costs are dedicated to underwriting health risks, sales, and marketing. Every man, woman and child in America spends $412 on health care administration, nearly six times as much as other countries. According to a recent report by McKinsey, the United States spends 98 billion more than other countries on excessive administrative costs that have nothing to do with delivering good health care. Too much of the money we spend is wasted on care that doesn\'t improve health. A study in Santa Barbara, California found that one out of every five lab tests and X-rays were conducted solely because previous test results were unavailable. A recent study reported in the Atlantic Monthly found that for two-thirds of the patients who received a $15,000 surgery to prevent strokes, there was no compelling evidence that the surgery actually worked. At the same time, in situations where the benefits of intervention are clear, many patients still don\'t receive the care they need. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that, overall, Americans get needed care only 55 percent of the time. If we spend so much, why does the World Health Organization rank the United States 31st in life expectancy and 40th in child mortality -- worse than Cuba and Croatia? Our health care system is plagued with under-use, overuse and misuse. It is, simply put, broken. As President, I will make it my mission to fix it, starting by helping the 250 million people with public or private insurance who face skyrocketing costs, inadequate care, and bureaucratic obstacles to coverage. Today, I\'m announcing a seven point plan to lower health care costs for all American and again to make our healthcare system, without doubt from any corner, the best in the world. Building a national consensus around these cost savings is the first crucial step to cover all Americans with quality, affordable healthcare. First, we\'re going to focus on prevention -- on wellness, not just sickness. Under my reforms, all Americans will have access to comprehensive preventive care, which will save money in the long run. Today, we pay doctors and hospitals to treat diseases and injuries, but not to help prevent them from occurring in the first place. Only 38 percent of adults receive recommended colorectal screening, and roughly 20 percent of children do not receive recommended immunizations. In fact, our country spends only an estimated 1 to 3 percent of national health expenditures on preventive health care services and health promotion per year. That is about the same percentage we spent in the 1920s. For example we have many more adults and young people being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. While, the costs of caring for them are increasing exponentially, many insurance companies won\'t pay for someone who\'s pre-diabetic or who\'s been diagnosed with diabetes to go to a nutritionist to learn how to eat properly, to get preventive medicine or to go to a podiatrist to have their feet checked. But the companies will pay if you have to have your foot amputated. The insurance companies will actually tell you they don\'t want to pay for preventive health care because the patient might change insurance companies, and the original company won\'t get the benefits of the money they invested. But if a patient\'s doctor tells them that a foot needs to be amputated, well the company is kind of stuck with that. Talk about a system that is upside down and backwards. We clearly need a new approach. We know we can save money if we give insurance companies incentives to cover preventive care and wellness services -- and my plan will do exactly that. Keeping people healthy today will not only keep our costs down in the future, but improve quality of life as well. We know that preventive care works. I could cite thousands of examples, but just consider the following: The incidence of diabetes was 58 percent lower among adults with elevated blood sugar were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program than the control group that was only given drugs. Among those aged 60 and older the reduction was 71 percent. And some of the research that was done leading to these outcomes was right here at GW. Or look at what the private sector has tried to do. Safeway has made a conscious decision to focus on prevention. It pays 100% of all appropriate preventive care services, and it offers a 24-hour hotline staffed by registered nurses, and provides services to help people manage chronic conditions and incentives designed to promote healthier lifestyles. Again, the results speak for themselves. While average costs went up 7.7% across the country. Safeway its health care costs will be flat. And they aren\'t the exception: Motorola\'s wellness initiative showed savings of almost $4 per every dollar invested. Under my plan, all insurers who are already participating in a federal health program like Medicare or Medicaid or the federal employee\'s health benefit plan will have to cover prevention as a condition of doing business with the Federal government. Insurers would encourage both individuals and providers to use prevention services by paying for benefits like cancer screenings and immunizations. My plan also pools and coordinates federal spending on prevention to help redeploy high-priority preventive services. Working in collaboration with the private sector, this initiative would pay for preventive care initiatives in schools, workplaces, supermarkets, churches, communities. It would fund and train new health prevention outreach workers, who understood the language, understood the culture of various constituencies around our country. Now, we still have so many people, and I\'m sure you see it in the hospital, who come in unable to speak English, often times bringing a child to interpret. And we\'re just not doing a good enough job in getting information broadly available to people who need it. Now, of course, you can have the best insurance plan in the world, but if you don\'t take the medicine your doctor prescribes, or follow lifestyle advice your doctor recommends, you aren\'t going to improve your health. If we\'re going to reduce costs through prevention, all of us all must take responsibility for taking better care of ourselves and I will have more to say about that later. The second way to bring costs under control is to bring our health care system\'s record keeping into the 21st century, finally leaving behind paper records and outdated, obsolete, 20th century information technology. Right now, if you\'re rushed to a hospital with a medical emergency, they may not be able to access your medical history or to find out what medications you\'re taking, what surgeries you\'ve had -- or even what your blood type is. Electronic medical records would change that. This is also important in the event of catastrophes. After Katrina, medical records were under water, never to be recovered. A lot of people who were taking prescription drugs who fled their homes or were rescued didn\'t even know the names of the drugs they were taking. Only, those who had been buying drugs from drug stores that had electronic medical records could immediately access to find out what the drug was and what the prescription should be. Modernizing our system will improve quality of care and reduce costs. Today, processing paper claims costs an average of $1.60 to $2.20 per claim. It costs 85 cents for an electronic claim. A RAND study found that, as a nation, we could save more than $77 billion annually through the widespread use of electronic medical records, and these savings could double with the addition of prevention and chronic disease management. If the use of information technology impacts our health care system as much as it has impacted other sectors of the economy, like for example, the wholesale and retail industry, we could see savings as high as $346 billion annually or over 15% of health care spending. There is no reason why people\'s health files -- their test results, lab records, X-rays -- can\'t be stored securely and confidentially on a computer file accessible from a doctor\'s office or hospital. In fact, if all hospitals used a computerized physician order entry system, an estimated 200,000 fewer adverse drug events would occur, saving roughly $1 billion per year. We can also use information technology to disseminate research. A government study recently showed it takes 17 years from the time of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually incorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside. Why not 17 seconds, the moment we know the discovery improves care? The Veterans medical system provides a perfect example of a fully automated health information system that supports the needs of patients, clinicians, and administrators. Its computerized patient record system (CPRS), contains every detail of a patient\'s health record, including laboratory test results, medical images, bar code medication administration, progress notes, and appointments, all accessible from anywhere within the VA system. The VA started modernizing its programs in 1993, using health IT as well as other care management techniques. And it delivers some of the best quality health care in the United States with amazing efficiency. Between 1999 and 2003, the number of patients enrolled in the VA system increased by 70 percent, yet funding (not adjusted for inflation) increased by only 41 percent. So the VA has not only has become one of the health care industry\'s best quality performers, it has done so while spending less and less on each patient. Health care spending per capita averages, as I said, over $6,300 in the U.S.; at the VA, however, the per-patient cost is $5,000, and 20% lower than the national average, even though the average age of a VA patient is 60. Last year I was at the hospital here at GW announcing legislation that has since passed the Senate that promotes the use of information technology so we can end the paper chase, limit medical errors and reduce the number of malpractice suits. It would allow us to use IT to develop a nationwide, interoperable system, to streamline our healthcare costs, and, I believe, reduce errors as well. Now, I\'m proud of my legislation, we didn\'t get it passed in the House last year, we\'re going to try again this year. But if we don\'t get it passed, I will have it as one of my highest priorities as President. I\'m going to build on that legislation by requiring health providers that participate in federal programs, which is nearly all of them, to adopt private, secure, and interoperable technology. And to help hospitals and doctors modernize their systems and promote the widespread adoption of health IT, I would invest $3 billion a year in grants to help ramp up the system. No more yellowing paper records -- no more trying to decipher messy handwriting. Third, we\'re finally going to coordinate and streamline the care our chronically ill patients receive. Americans with chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes account for an astonishing percentage. When I first saw this, I couldn\'t believe it----that it was 75 percent of our national health care expenditures. And improving the quality of their care will help limit costs, and improve health. To that end, I propose establishing medical ""homes"" similar to those operating right now in Oregon. Dr. David Dorra, a primary care physician, spoke at the Senate Aging Committee, on which I serve, two weeks ago about the success of these medical homes. He told the story of a patient, Ms. Viera, a 75 year-old woman in Oregon who suffered from five chronic illnesses, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and mild congestive heart failure. She also had difficulties remembering what bills to pay and what pills to take. Now, in most clinics across this country, Ms. Viera would receive care from qualified, capable doctors and nurses. But her care would likely not be coordinated -- her providers wouldn\'t be talking to each other, making sure that the treatments they were prescribing were working together. This ends up raising costs and increasing the chances that she will suffer complications or end up back in the hospital. Anyone who has ever tried to coordinate their own care, or the care of a loved one, knows that this is all too common situation. Fortunately, her care was addressed comprehensively through Care Management Plus in Oregon, an IT system with trained care managers in primary care clinics to treat older adults with complicated conditions. She\'s is in good hands. Her care managers and her primary care physician addressed her symptoms early, preventing problems rather than treating them after they occurred. And she is helped to navigate the system. Under this program, seniors with complex diabetes have had a 20 percent reduction in mortality, a 24 percent reduction in expensive hospitalization, and up to 42 percent improvement in control of their disease. Every patient should have access to a system with outcomes like that. That\'s why my proposal would require that Americans with costly, hard to manage illnesses have access to state-of-the-art chronic care coordination models under federally-funded plans, like Medicare and the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) plan. This proposal would permit multi-specialty clinics (GW, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Partners Healthcare), provider-sponsored organizations and private plans to bid on and provide services such as care coordination amongst and between providers, drug management, diet and exercise control and the promotion of individual patient responsibility. We know that this coordinated care model would result in significant cost savings. A recent RAND study concluded that chronic disease management, preceded by prevention and backed by information technology, could save $147 billion annually. Another study found this model could reduce the cost of diabetes care alone by 3 percent, saving us $4 billion dollars. Fourth, my plan will offer will offer individuals and small businesses market access to larger insurance pools that will lower costs and end insurance company discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. As part of a plan for universal coverage, which I will discuss in detail in the coming months, we would create large insurance pools that lower administrative costs for small businesses and individuals by spreading the risk. In a system of universal coverage insurance companies cannot as easily shift costs through cherry picking and other means. In fact, according to a recent McKinsey report, insurance companies in America spend tens of billions a year figuring out how not to cover people -- doing complicated calculations to figure out how to cherry pick the healthiest persons, and leave everyone else out in the cold. That is how they profit: by avoiding insuring patients who will be ""expensive"" -- and then trying to avoid paying up once the insured patient actually needs treatment. I see this all the time. My office spends countless hours arguing with insurance companies to get my constituents the health care they have paid for. For example, a father called me from northern New York -- his son had a rare illness. Now he and his son were well insured. He\'d worked for many years for the same employer who provided a good policy. But when his son needed a special operation -- that could only be performed at one place in the country -- the insurance company said, sorry, that\'s out of network, we\'re not going to send you to have that done. So my office intervened. And in the end they got permission for the operation. But I don\'t think people should have to go to their United States Senator to get their insurance company to give them what they\'ve paid for. As President, I will end the practice of insurance company cherry-picking once and for all by allowing anyone who wants to join a plan to do so and prohibiting insurance companies from carving out benefits or charging higher rates to people with health problems. I also will call for rating reforms to ensure that older and other vulnerable populations are not discriminated against. The whole point of insurance, lest we forget, is to spread risk across a group of enrollees. It\'s one of the reasons that the administrative costs of Medicare are so much lower; because they are actually insuring everyone. Everyone is in the pool, and we have to figure out how to better control the costs within Medicare but they start with an advantage because they have such a considerably lower administrative cost. Finally, insurers would be required to prove they were spending much less on marketing and schemes to avoid providing insurance to high-risk Americans, and more on direct care-giving. Now most businesses and some states have become tough purchasers of health insurance, insisting on fair marketing and cracking down on high overhead. We should follow their lead. One of the things I\'ve advocated now for 14 years is a common vocabulary and a common form that every insurance company must use. This sounds like a pretty common-sense idea---so you can actually compare and contrast what you\'re paying for---but when I proposed in back in 93 and 94 it was, shall we say, vigorously objected to. Because we need more transparency and we need that common vocabulary in order to get costs down, and that\'s opposite of what the insurers want to happen. By insuring all Americans through accountable public and private plans, we can get rid of administrative costs that do nothing but add to insurance companies\' bottom line. In such a reformed system, risk would be widely spread and we could reduce administrative costs by as much as $20 to 30 billion a year. Fifth, I will work to improve the quality of care which will also help us drive down costs. I\'ll start by establishing an independent public-private Best Practices Institute. This Institute would be a partnership among the public and the private sector, to finance comparative effectiveness research, so that doctors, nurses and other health professionals -- as well as consumers and businesses -- would know what drugs, devices, surgeries and treatments work best. This would reduce the use of inefficient and ineffective treatments, and I believe that it would have tremendous benefits because we could get evidence-based medicine into the bloodstream of the country much more effectively. I spearheaded a similar proposal to authorize the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to start doing research on comparative effectiveness at the Department of Health and Human Services. Eight reports have been released and dozens more are underway. One of the things they\'re finding is a lot of these so-called ""blockbuster drugs"" are no more effective, and sometimes less effective, in treating conditions than old standbys that have been around for a long time, and don\'t have all the advertising of, you know, people running through fields of wildflowers that convince patients that they need the new drug, as opposed to the one that has worked well. Too often, doctors and patients don\'t know which medical interventions are most effective -- and which have little benefit. A recent study by Dartmouth researchers shows that close to one third of the $2 trillion we spend goes to care that is duplicative and fails to improve patient health -- in fact, the researchers posited that it may even make health worse. More care is not necessarily better care, and inefficient care may do more harm than good. My plan will provide incentives to encourage doctors to keep up with the research and prescribe the most effective treatments. The University of Michigan and Pitney Bowes are doing just that -- linking out of pocket drug costs to clinical benefit for patients. The more effective the medication, the less that patient has to pay for the drug. As of 2005, Pitney Bowes had saved more than $3.5 million dollars using this method. Another innovative idea is the Geisinger Health System\'s suggestion of a medical warranty: it charges a flat fee for surgery that includes 90 days of follow-up treatment. Currently, there is little incentive to seek out the most effective treatments, because if a treatment regimen or surgery doesn\'t work, the patient simply returns for more costly treatments. The warranty is an incentive to do it right the first time, because there is no extra billing if more care is needed. Geisinger doctors have identified 40 essential steps to bypass surgery, and they\'ve established procedures to ensure they\'re always followed. The Best Practices Institute will empower with information and evidence those who have to make the decisions. It will not only be beneficial with respect to pharmaceuticals but also medical devices and even practice protocols and I think that it will give a lot of doctor\'s ammunition against insurance companies, drug companies and even sometimes patients about what works better than other options. The Oregon drug effectiveness review founded by Governor John Kitzhaber in 1999, is a collaborative partnership between states and non-profits that conducts reviews of widely used drugs to promote the most effective ones. North Carolina has used such reviews to educate providers, saving the state an estimated $80 million in 2003 alone. Now I can\'t extrapolate how much we would save as a nation, but I believe it would obviously be in the billions. Sixth, if we want to get health care costs under control, we need to get prescription drug costs under control. We know that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs that we have already in most instances funded the research on funded the clinical trials on, done the FDA evaluation of, then we put it into the market place and we end up still paying the highest prices . Studies have shown that brand drug prices are 35 to 55 percent higher in the U.S., and top-selling medications a full 2.3 times more expensive compared to other industrialized countries. Over the past decade, prescription drugs accounted for 15 percent of the total increase in health spending, even though they account for only about 10 percent of what other countries spend. Let\'s start getting drug costs under control by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and to lower those costs for everyone. We also have to crack down on the overpayments in Medicare to private plans. These Private plan payment rates are around 12 percent higher than Medicare traditionally pays to treat the same beneficiaries. Reducing these overpayments could save Medicare $10 to $20 billion dollars a year. Seniors don\'t want to lose the benefits they have under these plans, but under my reforms they would not. We should also allow the importation of drugs from certain countries to lower costs and let\'s remove barriers to generic competition. While 53 percent of all prescriptions are generic medicines, they account for only 12 percent of total pharmaceutical costs. A one percent increase in the use of generics could yield $4 billion dollars in government savings. We need to break the monopoly that biotech pharmaceutical companies have over their products, which can cost us so much money. Most Americans have no idea that right now, under current law and FDA practice, generic biopharmaceuticals are precluded from going to the market. And businesses and consumers are paying for that. You know the cost differential between generic and non-generic drugs is astounding: in 2003, the average cost for a one-day supply of non-generic drugs was $45.00, but only $1.66 for generic drugs. There is bipartisan support for providing the long overdue authority for the FDA to approve generic products that are the biologics. Already, an unprecedented coalition of patients\' groups, labor, business, pharmacists, governors and a number of forward looking biotech companies have united to support legislation that I introduced with Senator Charles Schumer and Congressman Henry Waxman. Providing such competition is projected to save $5 to $7 billion dollars a year in savings to businesses and consumers. The final point that I would make today about lowering costs is to reduce costs through medical malpractice reform. While some have overstated the role that malpractice insurance plays in the health care crisis, I think we can all agree that we need reform that works for doctors and patients alike. I have offered one solution that has been used successfully at the University of Michigan Hospital system. It\'s called the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation (MEDiC) Act as I have borrowed it from the University of Michigan to put it into law. It\'s a novel approach to improving patient safety and the quality of health care while protecting patients\' rights, reducing medical errors and lowering malpractice costs. This Act would encourage physicians, hospitals and health systems to provide liability protections for physicians who disclose medical errors to patients and offer to enter into negotiations for fair compensation. At the University of Michigan, these policies have already resulted in greater patient trust and satisfaction, more patients being compensated for injuries, fewer malpractice suits, significantly reduced administrative costs and between one and three million dollars in litigation cost savings. The rise in malpractice rates has spurred states like Texas and Nevada to allow doctors to create their own risk retention companies as an alternative to traditional liability insurance. Because a large percentage of actual malpractice is committed by a very small percentage of doctors who won\'t be included in insurance groups that other doctors control, thereby lowering malpractice rates for all. Now as I have made clear in these seven points, we know that if we continue on our present path, health care costs in the U.S. will double within a decade, we know that we will spend increasing amounts and we aren\'t sure, and I think it is fair to say we know, that we won\'t improve quality and outcome. Now how will this actually work? Well it has to be implemented over time according again to Rand who has been studying healthcare costs intensely now for several years. We could save $147 billion dollars from the information technology changes I have recommended, $20 to $30 billion dollars in administrative savings every year, $25 billion in savings from overpayments for pharmaceuticals and health plans, and there are billions more in countless other inefficiencies that could be rung out of our often wasteful health care system. We also will have to move toward a system where it is doctor-patient centered and consumer driven if we expect to really get the results that we need. Now there is no question that at least $120 billion dollars in projected savings that I have included in my plan are not only reasonable, but extremely conservative. Now I know that a lot of this is kind of overly wonky, which is why I am glad there is an audience of people here today who really understand a lot of these issues, but I imagine, you know, many people wonder what all this adds up to. Well the Business Roundtable has recently estimated that just with a system that used information technology, the typical family would save $2,200 dollars, and I think that is a pretty impressive outcome for us doing what we need to be doing anyway. The money we save from the waste we eliminate and the way we change how we care for people should be used to help finance coverage for the 45 million Americans who have no insurance. Also, when you insure everyone, it will maximize the impact of the prevention programs I have recommended -- with earlier care as opposed to emergency care -- as well as cutting administrative costs. Our present system is outdated, ineffective, and unsustainable. We know how to do this. Many of you in this audience could give me ten more suggestions that we need to do immediately. Well the key is to develop the political will to make it happen through a coalition of those who are most directly affected. The people who deliver care, our doctors, our nurses our pharmacists and others, the people who pay for care, our business and our government and the people who receive care which is all the rest of us, because I know very well that every one of these recommendations will run into considerable opposition from forces that do not want change in our system. So I believe that equally importantly to having a plan, we have to have a political consensus and that is what I am trying to develop as I talk about healthcare and engage in a conversation with the American people because I think Americans are ready for change. They are ready for a healthcare system that produces better results at lower cost and ends the shame of us not covering 45 million plus of our fellow Americans. I look forward to your ideas about how we can pursue these goals and I hope you will join with me in being part of this broad based, national coalition that will not only talk about and demand change, but work to make sure, starting in 2009, that our political system actually delivers the changes we all know our healthcare system desperately needs. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 29, 2007",b'Remarks - Modern Progressive Vision: Shared Prosperity',"b'Well, Colleen, I can assure you that as President, I will strongly support schools like the Manchester School for Technology. I have for many years because I know how important schools like this are. At this very moment, students in this school may be learning how to wire an office building, or work the machinery that runs our automobiles, or fix the bugs that crash our computers. Every day, students at this school are discovering talents and strengths they never knew they had.And that is because this school has great leadership. I want to especially thank the Principal. Karen White has led this school in an exemplary fashion, and I know she\'s worked closely with Governor Lynch to design the plans that will enable the school to be renovated and grow even stronger in the future. I really applaud your leadership, Karen. Because you can\'t look at the Manchester School of Technology without realizing that it didn\'t happen by accident. It was built by the people of this state who, even 25 years ago, understood that to compete in today\'s economy, young people need the skills for today\'s jobs. That\'s what we\'ve always done here in America: When our economy changes, we don\'t panic or give up or wring our hands -- we simply change with it. That\'s what has happened here at MST. I really applaud you for doing that, because we have to look for examples like this to figure out what we need to do more broadly across our nation. Now we\'ve done this before. We did the same thing back at the turn of the 20th century. Back then, the American economy was dominated by large corporate monopolies. Corruption was far too common and good government far too rare. Women couldn\'t vote, and the minimum wage, well, that wasn\'t heard of and worker rights were completely unimagined. Back then, America was a country filled with haves and have nots -- and not enough people in between. In response to these excesses, the progressive movement was born. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the progressives busted trusts and fought for safe working conditions and fair wages. They created the national park system, and replaced a government rife with cronyism with a merit-based civil service. They understood, as the great progressive President Teddy Roosevelt once said, that The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us. Well, today, at the beginning of the 21st century, I think it\'s time we remembered those lessons. For the first time in history, we have a truly global economy. Workers today think nothing of holding teleconferences with colleagues on three continents at once or e-mailing business partners across the globe. Companies also think nothing of shipping our jobs -- even entire factories -- overseas. Today, competition no longer stops at the water\'s edge. In fact, for many of our companies, that\'s where it starts. For example, New Hampshire provides $2 billion worth of exports to 140 countries a year. At the same time, technology is playing an increasingly important role. It\'s really revolutionizing how we live and work. We\'re seeing U.S. telemarketing jobs done in remote locations far, far from our shores. Manufacturing requires fewer jobs as machines replace people both here in America and around the world. In part because India and China have begun to harness the power of technology, they are on their way to becoming economic super powers. Like it or not, that is the reality of globalization. And it isn\'t going away. However, if managed properly, globalization may offer the promise of new markets, new growth, and new opportunities for broadly shared prosperity to young people like Colleen. Unfortunately, we\'re not managing globalization properly. Instead of working for all of us, globalization is working only for a few of us. Now, it is working for corporations. Corporate profits have grown an average of 13% a year since 2001, adjusted for inflation. It\'s working for CEOs who\'ve seen their pay go from 24 times the typical worker\'s in 1965, to 262 times the typical worker in 2005. And it\'s working for Americans with incomes at the very top. In 2005, all income gains went to the top 10% of households, while the bottom 90% saw their incomes decline, in spite of the fact that worker productivity has increased for six years. Now, in past economic expansions, that\'s not the way it was. In the past, about 75% of net corporate revenues have gone to employee compensation, and only 25% to profits. However, for the past five years, the comparable figures are 41% going to employee compensation and 59% going to profits. Think about this: last year, the share of America\'s national income going to corporate profits was the highest since 1929 -- while the share going to the salaries of American workers was the lowest. The inescapable reality is that globalization, modern technology, economic policy, are creating new conditions that threaten our middle class families and make it harder to maintain a middle class lifestyle. Now, during the second half of the 1990s, productivity growth led to rising incomes across the board. But over the past six years, while productivity has gone up 18 percent -- that means Americans are working harder than ever and, by most indicators, working harder than anybody else in the rest of the world -- family incomes have gone down $1,300. The global labor market may even be depressing wages for skilled and professional jobs. Since 2001, new jobs created in America pay, on average, 21 percent less than the jobs we have lost. And back in 2000, child poverty was the lowest it had been in 20 years. Since then it has risen by 1.3 million. And today we have 12 million children living in poverty. Now, given these realities, it\'s unsurprising we\'re seeing rising inequality and rising pessimism in our workforce. Today more than 80 percent of Americans believe that our manufacturing jobs are at risk of being outsourced. And let\'s be clear. It\'s not as if America hasn\'t been successful economically the past 6 years. But the measure of success doesn\'t relate what\'s happening in households across our country, because, while productivity and corporate profits are up, the fruits of that success just hasn\'t reached many of our families. It\'s like trickle-down economics, but without the trickle. As a result, the gap between those who are enjoying the fruits of the modern economy and those who aren\'t is growing wider. In 1970, the top 1 percent of households held roughly 9 percent of our nation\'s income. In 2005, they held 22 percent, the highest level since 1929, a year that isn\'t exactly one of our best years in American history. Now, our founders knew that inequality wasn\'t good for our country. They believed that vast concentrations of wealth were a threat to democracy. They believed America should give everyone, not just the children of the landed gentry, the chance to fulfill their God-given potential. But today, that ideal is at risk. We are in danger of losing that uniquely American engine of opportunity that has created so much wealth and spread it so widely. Believe it or not, today in some parts of Europe there is more social mobility than right here in America. Well, now we haven\'t heard much from Washington in the past six years about how to solve this growing problem of inequality. In fact, the tax, investment, trade and budget policies of the administration and its allies in Congress have made the problem worse. I believe people are fed up with the policies of the past six years. So many people I talk to just want to hit the restart button on the 21st century and redo it the right way. And I agree with them. Now, after all, we started the decade with rising incomes, declining inequality, robust job growth and a surplus in our federal budget. Instead of building on policies that worked, the Washington Republicans reversed them with predictable but intolerable consequences. I believe that one of the most crucial jobs of the next president is to define a new vision of economic fairness and prosperity for the 21st century, a vision for how we ensure greater opportunity for our next generation, and then to outline a strategy and then to implement it. Today, I believe we need a new progressive vision for this new century. Now, I consider myself a thoroughly optimistic and modern progressive. I believe we can grow our economy in the face of global competition, and in a way that benefits all Americans. I believe we can curb the excesses of the marketplace and provide more opportunities for more Americans to succeed. I believe we can support and promote smart trade policies that truly enforce strong labor and environmental standards. I believe we can help more workers join unions to improve wages and conditions in our workplaces for jobs that cannot be shipped overseas. I believe that, just as 20th-century progressives fought corruption with a new civil service, we can restore competence to the front lines of our government and ensure that we never, ever experience another Hurricane Katrina. In short, I believe that our government can once again work for all Americans. It can promote the great American tradition of opportunity for all and special privileges for none. Today I want to focus on how we ensure both strong economic growth and economic fairness. Now, we have seen for more than a century that fairness doesn\'t just happen. It requires the right government policies. And no one should be surprised, human nature being what it is, people will go as far as they possibly can get away with. The genius of the American economic in the 20th century was that it helped to counter that tendency for people to push as far as their own interests would take them so that we created a leveler playing field that benefited everyone. Unfortunately, for the past six years it\'s as though we\'ve gone back to the era of the robber barons. Year after year the president has handed out massive tax breaks to oil companies, no-bid contracts to Halliburton, tax incentives to corporations shipping jobs overseas, tax cut after tax cut to multimillionaires, while ignoring the needs and aspirations of tens of millions of working families. And how has he paid for all of this largess? By running up record deficits. He has simply charged it to our national credit card and left our children and grandchildren to pay the bill. In fact, every baby born today starts like with $29,000 of national debt on his or her tiny shoulders, the largest birth tax in our nation\'s history. It\'s also important to understand these policies are consistent with the administration\'s theory about how we should manage our economy: leave it all up to the individual. That\'s why they want to privatize Social Security and let individuals bear the risks. It\'s why their answer to the health care crisis is limited to creating health savings account, which allows the healthiest people to get the best deal, with little concern if the sickest get worse. They call it the ownership society. But it\'s really the ""on your own"" society. On the other hand, they protect the drug companies from competition, including from their own products coming back across the border from Canada. And they give health care companies a subsidy of more than $1,000 per person to compete with Medicare. That is hardly the free market at work. As a result, too many of our families are left running in place or falling behind. Health care premiums have gone up 87 percent since 2000; college costs up 40 percent since the 2000 school year. Gas prices have more than doubled. And I don\'t need to tell anyone that they\'re heading even higher today. Wages and incomes are lagging so much that, after five years of overall growth, there\'s been a 4 percent increase in the percentage of workers falling below the poverty line, and a 4 percent increase in working families losing their health insurance. It\'s like our middle-class and hardworking families are invisible to this president. If you\'re a worker who can\'t organize for fair wages and safe working conditions, you\'re invisible. If you\'re one of the over 45 million Americans who don\'t have health insurance, you\'re invisible, too. If your company has shipped your job overseas and you don\'t know how to pay your bills, well, you\'re invisible. If you drive up to the gas station and have to pay well over $3.20 or $3.30 a gallon to fill up your tank, you\'re invisible as well. Well, you\'re not invisible to me. And we can\'t restore the American dream unless you\'re a very visible part of it. It\'s time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few, time to reject the idea of an ""on your own"" society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. I prefer a ""we\'re all in it together"" society. Now, there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets, but markets work best with rules that promote our values, protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed. When we get our priorities in order and make the smart investments we need, the markets work well. Some of you might remember that, while we began the 1990s with record deficits, we ended the decade with a balanced budget, a record surplus, higher wages for the middle class, and 22 million new jobs. Now, of course, we can\'t simply recycle the policies that worked in the 1990s. These are different times. But we can return to many of the principles that guided us then, the principles that have worked time and time again to build our economy, expand opportunity, and offer all Americans the chance to have that American dream which we promised. Now, I\'m the product of this chance. I grew up in a middle-class family in the middle of America in the middle of the last century. My father came back from World War II after having served in the Navy, and he worked hard to build his small business. He believed that one should avoid being in debt at all costs, and instilled in me the importance of being responsible with a budget at an early age, a value I still hold dear today. Like millions of other families, we worked hard, we saved and we invested. And together, our determination and work ethic helped to create the American middle class. Now that middle class is under assault from global economic forces and wrongheaded economic policies. So I\'m proposing a new progressive plan to restore that American dream and to give all Americans the chance to compete and prosper in the global economy. Here\'s what I believe we should do. First, I\'m going to work to level the playing field and reduce the special breaks for big corporations. We say this in every campaign. We make a little bit of progress. And then unfortunately, when the Republicans get back in office, they reverse everything we\'ve done and add to the corporate welfare. Well, I think we\'re going to have a better shot this time because we\'re going to make it an issue in this campaign. We\'re going to ask people who are running for Congress to sign up one way or the other: Are they for corporate welfare, or are they for the average American having a decent shot at the American dream? And there\'s a lot we could do right now. You know, I believe that if we did give Medicare the chance to negotiate with drug companies, we would save $10 billion to $15 billion a year. Why should the drug companies be immune from the process that goes on every day in America, where you bargain for the best deal you can get? And we need to give our government that opportunity to do so. When Bill was president, he gave it to the V.A., which is one of the reasons why the V.A. has the lowest drug prices in America today. Bargaining really does make a difference. We also need to require the big oil companies that are making the largest profits in the history of the world to invest in alternative energy themselves or pay into a fund to spur clean energy research and development. And there are many other examples that we could all give about how to zero in on corporate welfare. Second, let\'s once and for all get rid of the incentives for American companies to ship jobs and profits overseas. It is one thing for the marketplace to encourage overseas investment. It\'s another for our own tax code to do so. But that\'s exactly what is happening. Today, American companies that ship jobs overseas don\'t have to pay a penny in American taxes on the profits they make abroad unless they bring those profits back to the United States. And, of course, they don\'t bring them back because they don\'t want to pay taxes on them. It\'s estimated this policy costs us billions of dollars each year in lost tax revenues. Even worse, we actually put companies that want to create jobs here on our shores at a disadvantage to those who ship jobs to tax havens. Now, when I\'m president we\'re going to reward decisions to create jobs here at home. We will consider eliminating the deduction for the actual costs of moving jobs. These are decisions that, if there\'s going to be a level playing field, there should be no advantage given to anyone who takes a job and sends it overseas at the disadvantage of our workforce. Third, let\'s reform the governance of our corporations and our financial sector. If you have any doubt about whether corporate governance impacts ordinary Americans, just think back to what happened at Enron, where thousands of workers lost much of their retirement savings. The way I see it, allowing CEOs to escape with golden parachutes while their companies abandon workers\' pensions does not honor our values. We need to open up CEO compensation to public scrutiny and public challenge and ensure that boards of directors are independent when determining CEO pay. And we need to update our regulations to confront the emerging problems in our sub-prime and private equity markets. Fourth, let\'s restore fiscal responsibility to our government. Let\'s get back to balanced budgets and save Social Security instead of running up our deficits. You know, people ask me all the time, ""Why can\'t we get tough on China?"" Well, the answer is, because China is one of our bankers. We\'re their debtor. How can we truly enforce trade laws against a country that manipulates it currency and puts us at an unfair advantage when our economic stability depends on China\'s massive loans to us every single day? And when the president\'s irresponsible tax breaks for high-income Americans expire, we will return to the income tax rates for upper- income Americans that we had in the 1990s, rates that were consistent with a balanced budget and economic growth. For middle-class Americans, who haven\'t seen their paychecks increase, let\'s keep the middle-class tax cuts and reform the alternative minimum tax in order to give middle-class Americans the tax relief they deserve to have. And let\'s take a hard look at corporate tax reform. It\'s simply not fair that as corporate profits have skyrocketed, the percentage of taxes paid by corporations have fallen. It\'s time we restored the balance and required corporations to pay their fair share. Under the law, after all, they are citizens of the United States, with many of the responsibilities, I would argue, that goes with citizenship. Fifth, let\'s recommit ourselves to the idea that every young person in America who wants to should have the opportunity to attend college, and that a 21st-century education starts early in life and continues well into adulthood. We know that having the most skilled, educated workforce in the world is key to our future success. That starts at the very beginning, with access to universal pre-kindergarten: high-quality learning opportunities for every 4-year-old in America. And I\'ve laid out a proposal that would do exactly that. We know that pre-kindergarten keeps kids in school longer, keeps them out of trouble, gives them more incentive to be academically interested and that it is a good payoff for our country: For every dollar invested, we get a $7 return. The alternative is to pay costs in other ways. A startling fact is that some states in our country, when they\'re planning how many prison beds they need, look at third-grade test scores. And they extrapolate from the number of children who are failing in third-grade reading as to how many prison beds they\'ll need. That\'s a lot more expensive than providing pre- kindergarten to those same children to hopefully keep them out of our prisons. We also have to do more to raise up the opportunity for young people from middle-class and working families and poor families to be able to go to college. Seventy-five percent of students at America\'s elite colleges come from the top 25 percent of the income bracket, just 3 percent from the bottom 25 percent. We\'ve got to make college affordable again, and that means everything from increasing Pell grants to changing the way college loans are provided and cleaning up the college loan industry from all of the scandals that is besetting it. Because if we don\'t make college affordable, we are seeing the results: Young people can\'t go. The last time I was in Manchester I was talking with some of the teachers from one of the high schools here who told me that many young people were just really confused because they didn\'t have the money to go to college, and they didn\'t know what they were going to do. So we\'ve got to do a better job than that. Sixth, for those who don\'t attend four-year colleges and those in the workforce who need to update their skills, let\'s provide more support for schools like this and for community colleges that prepare people for good, high-paying jobs. And let\'s provide wage insurance for our workers so that if you lose your job because of our trade policies, you can get the training and support you need for a new and better job. There are a lot of jobs in our country that are going begging because we don\'t have the people with the skills to be able to fill those jobs. Two examples. We will need 35,000 automotive mechanics every year from now until 2010. Automotive Retailing Today reports that we have 37,000 vacancies for mechanics right now. These jobs pay salaries up to $70,000 a year. And employers are aggressively recruiting talented high school graduates to fill these positions. I met recently with the Machinist union. They were telling me the same thing about Airline Mechanics. They have hundreds of good jobs they can\'t fill. It\'s not just that we can\'t fill these jobs; it\'s that we\'ve come to a point in our society where, frankly, we don\'t have the respect that that these jobs should demand. This is something I feel very strongly about. We have sent a message to our young people that if you don\'t go to college and you don\'t have a high paying job---something like a basketball player or an entertainer, or maybe someone in a corporation---that you\'re thought less of in America. We have to stop this. Our country cannot run without the people who do the skills that are taught in this school. And it is time we begin to reverse the attitude that I think for too long has prevailed, which is why I\'m so pleased that Governor Lynch will be adding to the money available through the state for technology and other kinds of advanced degree learning that can give young people a belief that doing these jobs is important. As Senator, I championed Regional Skills Alliances that support employers in the same geographic region and industry. They support employers who pool their resources and broaden opportunities so that employees can get the training they need in today\'s economy. I think we need more programs like this. And when I\'m President, we\'re going to create more programs like this so that our workers will have the skills they need for the jobs they deserve. Those 1,200 people who come at night: That\'s what they\'re doing. They\'re trying to get additional skills that will enable them to fill jobs that already exist in this region. And we\'re going to create more jobs and more regional skills alliances when I\'m president. Seventh, let\'s ensure that people who work hard every day can support their families and save for the future. I do not believe anyone who works full-time in America should draw a wage that puts that person below the poverty line. If you are a full time worker you should make more than poverty. Now that we\'ve finally reach the minimum wage, let\'s expand and simplify the Earned Income Tax Credit so no one working full time lives in poverty. Let\'s also finally overhaul our unemployment insurance program. Today\'s unemployment benefits aren\'t even enough to keep an average family above the poverty line. And many workers in today\'s economy -- including part time and self-employed workers -- are still ineligible for unemployment insurance. Our unemployment system has hardly changed at all over the last 70 years, and yet we know a lot of employers don\'t want to give people full time jobs. They only give them part time jobs so they don\'t have to pay for benefits. So when someone is laid off or loses that part time job, under our existing system even though it was all they could get, they\'re not eligible for unemployment insurance help. So I\'m hoping that we can do a better job by looking at our unemployment system and bringing it into the modern age. I think we also have to have a modern attitude toward unions. We know that unionized workers make 30% more than workers who aren\'t in unions. But today, just 7% of our workplace in the private sector is unionized. We need to give workers more of the benefits that come with union membership. Let\'s pass the Employee Free Choice Act to make sure our unions can organize for fair wages and safe working conditions. Let\'s appoint people to the Department of Labor who are truly pro-labor. That would be an unusual idea, don\'t you think? Unions played a critical role in building the middle class, and I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence that as union membership has dropped, middle class incomes have stagnated. So this is not an either-or choice; we can have both. Some people say, well, if you have more unionization that would make America uncompetitive, but there are other countries in the global economy that pay wages equal to or higher than ours, and many jobs that are important to the economy in those countries demand a really good living wage for a middle class family. Their lower-paid workers are paid more than our lower-paid workers, but their higher paid workers are paid less. So there\'s less of a gap between our lower paid workers and our highest paid workers which means that there\'s more money for those wage increases in the middle. That\'s what worked for America until relatively recently, and that\'s what we have to persuade people is good for America again. Eighth, let\'s ensure everyone the most fundamental benefit there is -- quality, affordable health care. Now, we know that this is going to be challenging but if we could spend more than $500 billion to fund the war in Iraq, we can surely make the basic investments to ensure that every American can see a doctor when he or she needs to. Ninth and finally, let\'s make the investments we need to create the millions of good jobs necessary to lift up all of our families. To preserve and expand the middle class in an open, global economy, we have to have a source of good new jobs every five to eight years. Telecom did that during the 90s. In this decade, that means an all out commitment to a clean, independent energy future. I\'ll be talking a lot more about investing in alternative energy and energy efficiency. Because we know that alternative energy isn\'t just good for our national security, and we know that it\'s imperative for our environment and to tackle global warming -- but it is also good for our economy. By working to break our addiction to foreign oil and investing in clean energy technology, we can create good new jobs right here in America. When I was up in Berlin, they were hoping that we could take those old paper and pulp mills and turn them into energy creators by using wood. So instead of using wood for the purposes that it\'s been harvested in New Hampshire for hundreds of years, you would use it for creating energy. Well, these are the kinds of new jobs that we need to be looking for across our country. I also believe we have to invest in 21st century infrastructure we need to compete. I also believe we have to invest in 21st-century infrastructure to compete. Let\'s set a goal of putting high-speed Internet access through broadband or wireless within the reach of every single American so that people throughout this state and every other one will be able to participate in the global economy. In New York, as a senator, I\'ve done a lot of work trying to work with chambers of commerce and others to create zones for access to high-speed Internet, because it was difficult to attract jobs to the Adirondacks or to other areas of rural New York without having that. We haven\'t had much help from the federal government, but I\'ve been introducing legislation every since I arrived in the Senate to do just that. Just as we had a railroad system that connected our country, an electrification system, an interstate highway system, an airport system, we have to have a broadband system I also am not giving up on manufacturing. I believe we can still have a vibrant manufacturing base, with the right policies. It provides an immediate laboratory for innovation and a challenging feedback loop for engineers, designers and dreamers. It\'s an invaluable training ground for a new generation of entrepreneurs and leaders. That\'s why I helped to start the Senate Manufacturing Caucus, where I\'ve worked to develop a manufacturing strategy that will be suitable with the challenges of the 21st century. I also founded a group called New Jobs for New York, a unique non-profit that harnesses the ingenuity, entrepreneurship and hard work of New Yorkers. And I want to do that across our country. You know, we\'ve been able to show companies in New York they didn\'t need to leave our country in order to get qualified people to do the work. We also commissioned a study which proved the cost of moving jobs to other countries is a lot greater than people actually understand or realize. So there\'s a lot we can do to give us a source of new jobs and to have an innovation agenda that will make us competitive going forward. We can\'t do it if we just accept the Republican policies or if we just believe America\'s best days are over. You know, a lot of people around the world are writing America off. They do believe our best days are behind us. I could not disagree more. I believe America can rebound from these last six years. I believe we can restore fairness and ensure that all share in our prosperity. I believe we can reduce the deficit and restore fiscal responsibility and give people the education and opportunities they need to fulfill their God-given potentials. I\'m running for president because I believe if we set big goals and we work together to achieve them, we can restore the American dream today and for the next generation. The core ideals of a 21st-century progressivism are simple. The foundation of a strong economy is the investments we make in each other: in education, health care, clean energy and new technologies. Greatness comes from policies that promote prosperity and ensure we all share in it. Now, living up to these ideals and changing the political makeup will not be easy. But I\'m absolutely confident we can do it. And I would just close by thinking of that great Granite Stater Daniel Webster. He said it years ago when he urged us to ""develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered."" I\'m confident we have the discipline, the determination and the drive that we will not be the first generation in American history to leave our country worse off than when we found it. But we will continue, as every generation has before, to create much that is worthy to be remembered. We will restore fairness and responsibility to our economy, rebuild our middle class and rise to the challenges of this new global century. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 31, 2007",b'Hillary Clinton Speech and Q&A; on Innovation',"b'It is a real pleasure for me to be here, speaking to the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which I understand has been around for nearly 30 years. It is hard to believe that 30 years have passed but it is clear that those 30 years revolutionized our country and our world. And I am grateful for the contribution that all of you have made to that revolution.You know it as well as anyone, the benefits that spring from globalization. It has lifted more people out of poverty around the world than probably any other advance in recent history. It has certainly helped expand our prosperity here at home in many important ways. Again, it is inevitable. So, there is no escaping this and what we have to do in America today is figure out how to best harness the force of globalization to ensure a continuing quality of life and standard of living. But I have to tell you, here in the Silicon Valley, based on the work that I have done for many years, and in particular as a Senator from New York for the past six and a half years, and now as a candidate for President, there is a deep sense of anxiety in America. It is an anxiety that is rooted in the reality that for many Americans, they have seen their wages stagnate. They have seen the price of everything else that they need in life, health care to college tuition to the price of gas at the pump, continue to go up. And they believe that somehow they are not getting ahead, despite the fact that many of us here, and millions of others of us around our country are. I think that the fear that our prosperity will not be shared has very serious consequences for not only our economy but for our society and for our politics. And certainly the policies of the last six years have done little to assuage the fear that people feel. Over the past six years, while productivity has gone up 18 percent, average family income has gone down 1,300 dollars. The result is a pessimistic view that America can\'t win in the global economy unless the middle class loses. Well, I believe we ought to hit the restart button on the 21st century because America not only can but must succeed in the 21st century. And it\'s time for a thoroughly modern and optimistic, progressive vision for how we do that. Now, I\'ve given a series of speeches outlining what I believe that vision should be. I\'ve talked about reforming our government so it works for the vast majority of Americans. I\'ve outlined a series of steps to ensure that prosperity is shared and that equal opportunity is real. And today, I want to discuss policy that I believe would help us promote innovation and steps to spread the benefits of that innovation throughout America. That means dedicating more resources to areas like alternative energy and basic research and involving more people in the innovation economy. There is no doubt in my mind that American ingenuity is the key to greater prosperity in the face of global competition. That\'s what set us apart in the 20th century, and combined with the right policies to create opportunities for all, it will set us apart in this century. Unfortunately, while other nations have marched ahead, we\'ve been marching sideways. Over the past twelve years, while American investment in research and development has remained relatively static, China has doubled the share of its national wealth invested in R&D.; The European Union has set a goal of increasing R&D; investments by member states to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2010, nearly matching us. The education pipeline, the source of future innovators, reveals the same trend. Between 1970 and 2000, as many as of you know too well, America\'s global share of PhDs in science and engineering declined from 40 percent to 20 percent. That rate is expected to drop to 15 percent in the next 3 years. Too few of our college students are studying the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering, and math. Our innovation infrastructure is falling behind, too. We\'ve dropped considerably in our broadband deployment. Depending on which survey you look at, it\'s going to be 12th to 25th. The bottom line is it is not good news for what we\'re trying to achieve. Now in this debate about how to move forward, too often policy makers will wall themselves off into two competing camps. There are those who say there is nothing to worry about and others who say there is nothing we can do. I have familiarity with both camps, and I believe both are wrong. For those who say there is nothing to worry about, I think that their rosy scenarios are doomed to failure and they will be unfortunately proven wrong. But at what cost? And for those who say that\'s just the way the rest of the world works and we can\'t really do anything about this, I think that\'s a streak of fatalism that I find profoundly un-American. America remains the preeminent destination for discovery, but our global leadership and vision did not happen by accident. It took smart, forward thinking policies that used what was right about America to make America stronger. Yes, global competition is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity to lead the world in new fields like nanotechnology, while lifting up our standard of living and opening up new markets to American products. Energy dependence is the greatest innovation challenge that America has faced in generations. It is also an unparalleled opportunity to start new green industries and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Climate change is a major threat, but if we act to address it rather than ignore it, we could move toward new renewable energy and create millions of new jobs here in America. I mean just think about it, America was built on innovation. One of my favorite examples is President Lincoln, in the middle of the Civil War, a war that no one could predict that he would win and keep the Union together, decided to give the go ahead for two major national endeavors, one to complete the international, in the sense of cross-national, railroad, you know, to be able to go to from one coast to the other. The second was starting a system of land-grant colleges. Imagine the optimism it took to be sitting in the White House getting so many reports of dire outcomes in battles across the East Coast and to think when this is over we are going to need places to educate the next generation. Obviously, we had the same spirit of can-do progressivism at the turn of the last century; during the Great Depression; there is a highway system under President Eisenhower, putting highways where people didn\'t even live yet with the confidence that they soon would. The space program is a perfect example. And we certainly can point in the private sector to two guys in a garage named Hewlett and Packard or a team of researchers working for the Defense Department on a technology called ""Stealth,"" and see how the partnership that was forged, starting in the 1950s and into the 1960s, had such far reaching consequences for both the public and the private sector. A culture that values and invests in ideas is part and parcel of the promise of America. And we have always supported that culture with public investments that accompanied our entrepreneurial spirit, the availability of capital, and the best university system in the world. Now, what is happening today is we are not realizing either the benefits of those earlier investments or keeping our eye on the horizon as to how we, in this generation, in this century, will make our own contribution as a part of America\'s innovative agenda. Think about how the first lanes of the information superhighways were laid by our researchers. They built a new way of sharing information because of an insatiable appetite for data in the pursuit of discovery. Hugely consequential advances in logistics were pioneered by American companies. And we know that America may well be the land of opportunity, but it\'s also the land where people keep their eyes on opportunity costs. The fire that was sparked here in this valley has made such a difference but it can\'t just be allowed to sputter out. There has to be a partnership again between our government and our great companies and the entrepreneurs who yet have not discovered what it is that will revolutionize the way we live today. So, what are we to do and how do we do it? Well, today I\'m proposing a nine-point agenda to renew the promise of America, create good jobs, and bolster our capacity to innovate. Investing in alternative energy and basic research. Strengthening our science, engineering, and mathematics workforce. Reinforcing our innovation infrastructure through broadband with better incentives for research and development. Restoring scientific integrity in Washington. First, I propose a national commitment to solving the energy and global warming challenges. A $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund, paid for in part by closing the tax subsidies and loopholes that the oil companies still enjoy. It\'s almost impossible to imagine we are still subsidizing companies that have made the largest profits in the history of the world. Now, I do think there is a role for subsidies, and I\'ll get to that in a minute, but for mature companies in mature markets, that has to be carefully considered. This fund would invest in technologies available right now, to promote conservation and combat global warming, end our dependence on foreign oil. The fund creates an energy initiative modeled on DARPA -- the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. We bring together, as we once did in DARPA, the best minds in the public and private sectors to think outside the proverbial box. To do high risk, high reward research we can\'t even predict what the benefits will be. I know that the Silicon Valley Leadership Group has just put forth a 12 point campaign with an agenda called ""Clean and Green,"" and I just received a copy of that and I look forward to looking at it. But winning the 21st century energy race is as important and as potentially productive and profitable as winning the 20th century space race. We can safeguard our environment, grow the economy, protect our security, and create millions of good new jobs. I think that if you look at the experiences of other countries, you can certainly see the economic impact of this. United Kingdom signed Kyoto when we didn\'t. And not only did they meet their earliest Kyoto target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but they created thousands of jobs, they kept unemployment low, and wages increased. Instead of leading the world in oil imports, America can lead in green technology exports. I know that this organization is holding a series of events on this, and that Applied Materials is doing innovative work with solar technology. I believe, however, that in the absence of a national effort, modeled on the Apollo project for example, it will be very difficult to bring to scale and commercialization the changes that we need and that we can produce with the proper incentives. The country that split the atom can end our dependence on foreign oil and launch an energy revolution. We can call it Energy 2.0. Second, as President, I will increase support for basic and applied research by increasing the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy\'s Office of Science, and the Department of Defense. We\'ll boost funding by 50 percent over 10 years, with a greater emphasis on high-risk, high-return investment. Unfortunately, under the Bush administration, spending on basic and applied research has declined in real terms four years in a row. DARPA -- where basic research led to the precursors of the internet, the computer mouse, and so much more -- is putting less of its resources into truly revolutionary research. In fact, DARPA is becoming much more problem-solving oriented, and there is a reason for that. When you look at how difficult it is to combat the improvised explosive devices in Iraq, it\'s understandable that people would be put on overtime to try to figure out how to jam the signal -- how to do anything to prevent them from exploding or being placed in the first place. Why is it an either-or? And why don\'t we continue to fund what we need to for our military and their protection for both defensive and offensive purposes, and put the money in that we need to continue the kind of cutting edge research that has produced such great results? Often investments in basic research take decades to pay off, as so many of you know, or they don\'t pay off at all. That\'s why the private sector devotes only 5 percent of all its resources to basic research. But when this type of work leads to big breakthroughs, applied research, and eventually to new tools and products, the entire economy benefits. And I think government can work in partnership with the private sector by taking the lead in funding these kinds of ""blue sky"" endeavors. Third, I propose we increase the National Institute of Health budget by 50 percent over five years with the goal of doubling it over the next decade. What is happening with NIH is particularly troubling. We know that NIH funded researchers have produced breakthroughs and treatments for heart disease, cancer, AIDS and so much else. The NIH budget was doubled between 1998 and 2003 and universities and researchers had high hopes for continued funding and we truly are on the brink of so many important breakthroughs. In the years since, the rug has been pulled out from underneath a lot of our best minds. The President\'s budget for 2008 actually cut funding. The consequences of unpredictable and declining resources are halted construction on new laboratories, fewer grants for researchers, uncertainty in current projects, and less support for creative, outside-the-box ideas being investigated by younger researchers. Nobel Prize winning biochemist Roger Kornberg recently said, ""In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn\'t virtually certain of success, then it won\'t be funded. And of course, the kind of work that we would most like to see take place, which is groundbreaking and innovative, lies at the other extreme."" America has led the world in biotech research but we cannot rest on our laurels. Singapore is investing massively in biotech. European communities aren\'t standing still. Investments in NIH will not only help lead to cures, but will grow the economy. Fourth, I am proposing renewed commitment to multidisciplinary research, such as a combination of biotechnology, information technology, nanotechnology, a greater emphasis on public-private partnerships, and new efforts to promote collaboration and off-the-grid ideas. Here is an area where America has a unique, built-in competitive advantage. No other nation lays claim to the depth and breadth of excellence across different scientific and technological fields than we do. By bridging areas of expertise, we can bridge gaps in our understanding. And as well you know, sometimes the best answers involve approaching an old question in a new way. For instance, we should increase investments in non-health applications of bio-technology. NIH funded effort dominate life science\'s research but few programs explore non-health applications, such as bacteria that could dramatically reduce the costs of cleaning up Superfund sites. Another important step we must take is in health information technology. Bringing the efficiency of the information age to medical care -- through electronic medical records, for example -- can save money, save lives, and prevent mistakes. I have been working on this for more than four years, I started with former Senator Frist in a bipartisan effort to create a framework for health information technology. We finally got it through the Senate, but it died in the House. We\'re going to try to bring it back and get this done once and for all. And I know some of the companies represented here have been very helpful in thinking through the architecture of a health IT system for our country. We should invest in e-science to accelerate the pace of discovery. You know as well as anyone, information is only as useful as the means of putting it in useful hands. Billions and billions of data points are waiting in laptops and flash drives and paper files -- waiting to become the next great medical discovery or understanding of how to stem global warming. By investing in new tools to help scientists collaborate, process information, and share data, we can unleash a wave of discovery and benefits to our society. Promoting these new collaborations between universities and industry is also essential. We have to fill the gap left by the decline in great private sector research institutions like Bell Labs, which produced technologies like the laser and many world-renowned scientists. One other idea: let\'s use competitive prizes to encourage innovation. We\'ve got all these reality shows about singing and modeling and hair styling, and you name it. Well, let\'s do some reality shows about innovation, and let\'s have some cash prizes out there to get young people to start thinking that way. I\'ve long said that if we could have some really good programming about math students and engineers that would get people excited. We have so many kids who now want to go into forensics because they\'ve seen it on TV. If we propose prizes to be part of our budget at our research agencies, we could seek out new ideas from unexpected places. We ought to try to construct buildings that use onsite renewable energy technologies. I\'m holding a contest to pick campaign theme song, and my campaign got ideas we never would\'ve thought of from very unusual sources -- look at YouTube and you can see that for sure. While investing in ideas and research, we should also invest in skills and education. This has become almost a clich, hasn\'t it? And I have had countless meetings with people from the Silicon Valley and in Silicon Valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed. But I hear that across the country. There are auto mechanic jobs we cannot fill today. Thousands of them, making 50, 60, 70 thousand dollars. There are airline mechanic jobs that we can\'t fill -- there are so many jobs that we can\'t get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job. We need a much better approach to doing this. Now, with respect specifically to innovations, I propose tripling the number of NSF fellowships, and increasing the size of each award. We need to treat our young scientists and engineers with respect and provide real rewards. They should know that our country needs them, because in fact we do. I\'ve talked to many people who went into math, or physics, or chemistry after Sputnik and the space program which peaked their interest. They\'re all reaching retirement age. You think there\'s a skill shortage now, project it out a decade and we\'re going to be in real trouble if we don\'t figure out how to get the pipelines built. Now, light bulb moments require electricity. And education is the ultimate innovation prerequisite. Unfortunately, here again we are ceding ground to other nations. 50% of the undergraduates in China are earning degrees in science and engineering; in America the rate is 15%. The U.S. instituted National Science Foundation fellowships in response to the Soviet Union and the space race. In the decade since the number of grants is largely unchanged, despite a three-fold increase in the number of college students graduating with science and engineering degrees. So we face different challenges, but we need a similar commitment. I co-sponsored the America Compete Act, which recently passed the Senate, to increase the advanced classes for high school students in math and science, and to put more people in the scientific and engineering pipeline. We have to act now to improve education and research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to retain our leadership. And we\'ve got to start using new ideas. My husband recently spoke at a school that he and I started in Arkansas -- the Arkansas Math and Science High School. And it was started because there are a lot of young people around the state who cared about math and science, but their high schools couldn\'t offer a very challenging curriculum. It\'s a boarding school and kids come from all over, and they come mostly from small towns. There were only, I recall, maybe 88 graduates, and they brought in $9 million worth of scholarships because in that environment, which was self-selected and which drove a really high standard, they responded. So I think we should do even more to think about how we are going to find these skills. It may be that we need more of these public boarding schools. Let\'s think about how we really make math, science, engineering and technology attractive. Two of my proposals were included in the bill that passed. First, I would create new fellowships at the NSF to allow math and science professionals to become teachers in high-need schools, and to train current math teachers with expertise to become mentors and professionals. These are modeled on two successful programs in New York. I also included a study to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences to investigate promising practices in math and science education. We obviously need to do a better job of reproducing educational excellence and we need to have national standards in math and science education. There\'s not a difference in algebra across state lines and we act as though there is, and it\'s time to say enough. We need national standards, at least, in math and science. Sixth, we have to open the doors of science and engineering to more people, especially women and minorities. We\'ve done a great job bringing the best and brightest from around the world but we have to do more to get women and minorities to be involved, and as president I will try to promote that, to tap new sources of talent and to set examples by having a greater public awareness of what awaits. You know, one of my favorite people is the president of RPI in New York who previously was the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. She\'s the first or the second African American woman to receive a PhD in nuclear physics. Well, I don\'t know if enough people know about her and know about what she has done with her life and how she can, perhaps, serve as an example for others. So we need to do more and we have to also recognize the shortage that exists now. So I am reaffirming my commitment to the H1B visa and increasing the current cap. Let\'s just face the fact that foreign skilled workers contribute greatly to what we have to do in being innovators. And certainly that\'s understood well here in Silicon Valley where more than a quarter of highly skilled professionals are immigrants. But I would hope that we could do more of what I\'ve suggested simultaneously. Yes, increase the cap; yes, try to get green cards for those who graduate from our colleges and universities after we\'ve trained them so they don\'t go home, let\'s try and keep them here. There\'s a lot we can do to deal with the overreaction, in many ways, post-9/11, but let\'s also think about what else we\'re going to do here. One thing that I would offer for your consideration is whether it is possible to create some kind of continuing education or curriculum that could be available because what I find as I travel around the country are engineers who come up to me and say, ""I\'ve been an engineer at this country for 12 years or 18 years, and now I\'m being asked to train my successor because my job is being outsourced. What am I supposed to do?"" Well, if that engineer\'s talent and skills truly are not marketable in the current from, then what can we do to try to make them marketable? How can we create that opportunity? Seventh, as president I\'ll ensure we have a national commitment to broadband. Now we need to invest in our infrastructure and, what the railroads were to the 19th century and electricity was to the 20th, we know that innovation tools like broadband are essential to the economy of the 21st century. We should not be satisfied with our standings slipping year by year. We are the birthplace of the Internet, but our broadband infrastructure is stuck in adolescence. And I proposed an agenda to bring the information age economy to every corner of our country. It is possible to do this. We need national leadership. I\'ve introduced broadband proposals, we\'re going to keep working on this, but it\'s critical if we\'re going to connect up the country. Eighth, I\'ve proposed overhauling the research and experimentation tax credit. Let\'s make it permanent, more effective, and larger if necessary. We will not get exciting new applications unless we encourage companies to invest in research -- and do it in America. The R&E; tax credit is used by more than 15,000 companies who might not otherwise put many dollars into innovative ideas. We have failed to make the credit permanent; we always renew it year-by-year. It needs to be made permanent not only for the practicality but also as a symbol of what we believe about our future. And finally, a culture that values innovation requires a government that values facts. I am just often struck by how hard this Administration has tried to turn Washington into an evidence-free zone where the facts are subordinated to partisanship and where evidence was disregarded in favor of ideology. The integrity of science has been under assault for six years, and whether it was mercury in our water or carbon dioxide in our atmosphere or decisions over women\'s health, ideologues called the shots. Everyday, here in the Valley, you make decisions based on facts and evidence, not preconceived notions. I don\'t think it\'s too much to ask that our government does the same. In April, I outlined a comprehensive government reform agenda, and this was an important piece. Now way back in the 1990s, Congress had an Office of Technology Assessment that was charged with just one task: telling us the truth about science, sorting out the competing claims, and to the best of the scientists\' abilities, telling us what to believe. For decades they cut through the myths and the spin on everything from Star Wars to AIDS prevention to solar technology. It\'s time to put this office back in business, because how can we as a democracy make good decisions if we either don\'t have the facts or if they are actively withheld from us? And if we\'re going to reap the benefits of innovation, we have to take every step to ensure that our trading partners adhere to a standard of intellectual property protection similar to what we have in the United States. I know that intellectual property piracy costs companies millions of dollars every year and that piracy and counterfeiting hit our high-tech companies more than any other sector in the economy. So let\'s get back to free and open scientific enquiry and the promise and provenance of a free and open society, and let\'s also take the steps necessary to protect the results of that free and open enquiry. So do we face big challenges? Yes. Is our economy changing? Of course. But we\'ve done this before and I\'m confident we can do it again. Call me an honest optimist or a practical visionary, whatever, but I believe this is all doable because we are a nation of innovators, and you are both the beneficiaries and the benefactors of that innovative culture. And it is a culture of ingenuity, and in its absence we cannot expect to continue the standard of living and the quality of life that have marked our country, that have served as such an inspirational route to the American dream. We need leadership to get this done; I believe America is ready for change. Obviously I\'m offering myself to lead that change because I believe it is one of the most important issues confronting us, and I want to hear your ideas and to work with you. Call this version 1.0 of my innovation agenda, so after collaborating with some of you we\'ll perhaps tweak it and fine tune it, but the ultimate consequence of this has to be leadership that once again sets our sights on the stars and gives us the tools to get there. Thank you very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 27, 2007","b'Remarks at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, DC'","b'""Toward a New American Security"" is exactly the right title for this forum. We are in a moment of profound change and challenge that requires new thinking and a new direction. As Americans we bear much responsibility for the global economic, technological, and democratic revolution we are experiencing.Every day the world grows smaller and history moves faster. Decisions by a factory owner in China impact the health and safety of children in Chicago. American researchers use the web to share best practices  but so do Islamist extremists. And pandemics do not know where evil nations end and good nations begin, a fact that I\'m sure greatly disturbs the Vice President. Amidst the global transformation to an interdependent world our nation confronts possibilities of promise and peril. We know the current security policy with its excessive reliance on unilateral force, its rejection of international agreements of all kinds, and its preference for policy making based on ideology, not evidence, has to change. But let\'s begin with some basic assumptions rooted in reality. In this interdependent world, the United Stated cannot unilaterally kill, jail, occupy or isolate all of our actual or potential adversaries. Therefore, while a strong military remains essential to our security, it is not sufficient. Moreover, there are few security challenges we can meet entirely on our own. So in the words of Secretary Albright, ""We should cooperate with others whenever we can and act alone only when we have to. Not the other way around."" When I was First Lady, I was honored to visit 82 countries representing our nation. I witnessed the promise of America in the eyes of men, women and children. America represented hope, opportunity, freedom. As a United States Senator I continue to meet with leaders from around the globe and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, travel to places where our military has been engaged and performing heroically. And what we have seen here and around the world is that the administration has systematically broken down and thrown aside our hard-won partnerships and alliances and undermined our greatest asset, America\'s moral authority - not just destroying the work of the previous decade but the difficult work of more than a half century of internationalism practiced by Democratic and Republican administrations alike. All too often the administration has favored ideology over reality, promoted tough talk over tough decisions, and sown alienation instead of cooperation. The next president will take office at a time when the United States faces the greatest confluence of challenges in our country\'s recent history. We must regain our place in the world with a new security policy that serves our national interest, recaptures our moral authority, works with our allies, modernizes our military, and confidently projects our values. In short, we must rebuild our strength and widen and deepen its scope. We have to be both internationalists and realists. We have to renew those alliances around the world, around a common set of goals including combating genocide, expanding human rights, promoting reconciliation through diplomacy, stopping nuclear proliferation, and addressing global warming. We have to realize that we are in the middle of a sectarian civil war in Iraq and that it is well past time to start withdrawing our troops in the middle of that war. And we must also realize that the global threat of terror demands that we secure our home front, take on the terrorist networks abroad, and combat a false doctrine of hate, death and destruction. America must be the world\'s leader and yet we cannot lead unless we restore the greatness and goodness of America in the eyes of the world. That\'s why we must stand for freedom and fairness, justice and progress, peace and security. Let me say a few words about Iraq. I know that CNAS has released a new report on Iraq with a set of proposals for the way forward. I have some differences with the specifics of the proposal, but I believe it is time to end the war and bring our troops home as soon as possible. The failed ideology and flawed decision making that led us into Iraq has had a devastating impact on us here at home and around the world. Iraq continues to steal young American lives and to consume $8.6 billion a month, sapping our military readiness and standing. I traveled to Iraq three times to meet with soldiers and commanders as well as the Iraqi political leaders. There is no doubt that our military has performed heroically and has done what they were asked to do according to the authorization that was passed nearly five years ago. Not a day goes by that I don\'t think of our men and women who are over there right now, patrolling the streets of Baghdad, Mosul, and other places, trapped by a failed strategy and sectarian civil war and I never stop thinking about the lives that have been lost and the lives that have been so drastically affected by profound injuries. The president claims he listens to our military commanders - but he apparently doesn\'t hear what I have heard for several years now. General Petraeus, General Casey, General Pace, General Abizaid, Admiral Fallon and others have told him and us: there is no military solution to the Iraq conflict, only a political one. Without concerted U.S.-led international political and diplomatic efforts, as the Iraq Study Group supported but the Bush Administration disregards, any Iraqi government is condemned to failure. In the absence of credible and strong incentives backed by U.S. pressure, the Iraqi government has degenerated into protecting ethnic and sectarian interests. In the absence of sustained diplomatic efforts involving the parties affected and the nations in the region, we risk the expansion of the conflict beyond the borders of Iraq. The coalition building efforts during the first Gulf War and affecting the former Yugoslavia demonstrate that sustained political and diplomatic efforts are critical to establishing and maintaining U.S. national security interests. What worked for the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration has been abandoned or executed poorly. It is not a matter of partisanship; it is a matter of learning from lessons of successful American statesmanship of both Democratic and Republican presidents. The catalog of misjudgments offends common sense and shocks the conscience: the unilateral decision to rush to war without allowing inspectors to finish their work or diplomacy to run its course; the failure to send enough troops and the disgraceful lack of equipment for those we sent; the draining of manpower, resources and intelligence capabilities from Afghanistan; the inability to stop rioting or to secure weapons caches; dismantling Iraq\'s security and governmental capacity; the ignorance of a rising insurgency; and the adherence, which continues to the present day, to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began. Since 2005, I\'ve called for the strategic redeployment of U.S. Forces out of Iraq. I\'ve introduced the Iraq Troops Protection and Reduction Act to begin withdrawing our troops. And I continue to press for a basic three step approach that would end the war while preserving our security interests. First, start bringing the troops home now. Second, demand, and back up those demands, that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them. And third, begin intensive regional and international diplomacy on a sustained basis. We need to force the administration to change its failed policies in Iraq. That\'s why I\'ve gone further and with Senator Robert Byrd proposed de-authorizing the war by October 11, 2007, the five year anniversary of the original use of force resolution. Senator Byrd and I plan to offer an amendment de-authorizing the war when the Senate considers the Defense Authorization bill after the July 4th recess. It\'s a civil war in Iraq and we must extricate ourselves from it. I\'ve also called on both the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, and General Pace, to brief Congress on the existing plans for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq or to explain why no such detailed plans exist. The seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in a failure to adequately plan for the conflict that the administration was so anxious to begin. We cannot allow our failures in deploying into Iraq to be repeated when we redeploy out of Iraq. Among the most important reasons for extricating ourselves from Iraq are the looming challenges in the region and around the world to our national security. There is a global threat of terrorism and we have to confront it. Here, too, the policies of the Bush Administration have set us back. America must rely on the intelligence of our allies along with our own, yet the Bush Administration\'s policies have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies. New threats require us to modernize and reform our intelligence services. And we find ourselves often trapped in very short-sighted, unproductive debates triggered by the President\'s and Vice President\'s desire to expand executive authority beyond any previously imagined limit. It is dangerous for us to be caught up in debates about wiretapping schemes and it is dangerous for the administration to refuse to disavow torture. We are in a long term struggle in which our values must be more than rhetoric. But we are weakened by Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and by this administration\'s policies on detainees and torture. I voted against the Military Commissions Act because I believe we have to stand for the rule of law before the world, especially when we are under threat. Democrats and Republicans alike believe that terrorists have to be caught, captured, sentenced, punished, killed. I believe there should be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9-11 and other crimes against humanity. But in the process of accomplishing what is essential for our security we must hold onto our values and set an example we can point to with pride and not shame. The bill allowed the admission into evidence of statements derived from cruel, inhumane, and degrading interrogations. Will our enemies be less likely to surrender? Will informants be less likely to come forward? Will our soldiers be more likely face torture themselves if captured? Will the information we obtain be less reliable? As Lieutenant [General] John F. Kimmons, the Army\'s Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence has said, ""No good intelligence is going to come from abusive interrogation practices."" Allowing coercive treatment and torturous actions toward prisoners violates the rule of law, fails in intelligence gathering, and promotes radicalization. Al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden\'s second-in-command, the architect of many of the attacks on our country, throughout Europe and the world has said over and over again if we would only pay attention  it is on their websites  that torture helps the cause of extremism, watering the seeds of jihad. I\'ve called for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay because it represents in the eyes of the world abuse, secrecy, and contempt for the rule of law. Rather than keeping us more secure, Guantanamo is harming our national security. It compromises our long-term military and strategic interests and impairs our standing overseas. We also cannot allow the failures taking place in Iraq to cause us to lose focus on the war in Afghanistan. The first time I visited Afghanistan in 2003, a young soldier said to me, ""Welcome to the forgotten front line of the war against terror."" This administration is not only failing in Iraq, its inattention risks failure in Afghanistan. During my visit to Afghanistan last January, I heard disturbing reports about continued cross border infiltration from Pakistan into Afghanistan by Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters. The tensions between the Afghan and Pakistani governments were palpable. During my meetings with President Karzai and President Musharraf, I asked if they thought that a special presidential envoy from the United States would help them resolve their disputes and they both expressed the belief that such an envoy could be very useful. When I returned to the United States, I called the White House to suggest a special envoy and to convey the reactions of Presidents Karzai and Musharraf. The White House, however, did not follow up on this idea and the tensions between those two critical countries continue unabated. We must widen the scope of our strength by leading strong alliances which can apply military force when required and promote our values. In the 1990\'s people were looking toward America for leadership. When ethnic cleansing was taking place in the Balkans, the United States led our European allies in putting together a coalition to stop it. There is no better way to combat anti-Americanism than to do our best to demonstrate that America is invested in lifting up people around the world. Some of you have heard this before, but it was striking to me that after President Bush asked his father and my husband to represent our country with respect to the relief following the Tsunami -- they traveled together, they were there when our military was evacuating people and bringing in supplies -- and the public opinion about the United States increased dramatically in a positive direction based on that very visible show of American concern, most notably in Indonesia where there had been tracking of public attitudes toward us before and after. Instability and extremism fester in places where infrastructure, education, and opportunity are also lacking. I\'ve introduced the Education for All Act to provide $10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world. From Pakistan to Sudan, parents want their children to have an education, but too often governments fail in delivering that basic service or find themselves without the resources to do so even if they are willing. Education is a tool to combat HIV/AIDS, empower women, and certainly for economic development. And I believe all of that plays to our strengths. For six years, the threat of terror at home has not been met successfully with a lot of bluster and intimidation; that only isolates us. It\'s not right and it\'s not smart. The attacks which have been prevented are a result of cooperation with other nations in intelligence, law enforcement and money tracking efforts. And those kinds of cooperative relationships have to be deepened and strengthened. Alliances are also essential in safeguarding against other security threats like pandemics, be they acts of terrorism or acts of God. And there needs to be better cooperation globally for us to be prepared to deal with these kinds of threats. I think it\'s important that we also focus on the most significant threat of all: nuclear proliferation. The 9-11 Public Discourse Project, an outgrowth of the 9-11 Commission, argued that ""preventing terrorists from gaining weapons of mass destruction must be elevated above all others problems of national security because it represents the greatest threat to the American people."" We wouldn\'t know it by the discussion and dialogue in this city. The Bush Administration has joined the chorus saying that, yes, that is our biggest threat. Unfortunately, their response has foundered at a nexus of ideology and intransigence. They have followed a policy that permitted North Korea, whose plutonium production was frozen by the last administration, to reprocess enough material in the last four years to make half a dozen nuclear bombs and test a nuclear weapon. In the past few months we\'ve seen signs of reversal, but the damage is already done. Iran, meanwhile, has been given six years of the silent treatment. In this vacuum, Iran continues its progress toward developing nuclear weapons and increasing its influence in the region. After initial talks with Iran and Syria on Iraq, the administration says it isn\'t sure that we need any more discussions with either of them. I think we should keep talking. Rather than engaging those who seek to develop nuclear weapons and working more urgently with allies to secure the nuclear material that al Qaeda and others covet, the administration has abandoned the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and neglected non-proliferation and even promoted two new small nuclear weapons, including the robust nuclear earth penetrator, the so-called bunker buster. I\'m introducing the Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act, a bill based on the report published by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, headed by Senator Sam Nunn. He clearly sees this threat ""outrunning our response."" And my bill seeks to reinvigorate and accelerate our efforts to ensure that the nature and urgency of our response is commensurate with the threat. My legislation would first devote real resources to combating the threat by increasing funding for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to convert research reactors around the world from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium and to remove the highly enriched uranium from such facilities. I was with Warren Buffett last night who has pledged $50 million of his own money to this effort and believes that he could amass an even greater amount of money from the private sector if our government would lead us with some urgency toward taking on this challenge. We need to expand the Materials Protection, Control and Accounting program to lock down nuclear material and invest in forensic measures which advance our ability to discover the origins of a nuclear weapon in the horrific event of an attack. This legislation would also require the president to work to create specific international guidelines to raise the security standards at foreign nuclear sites. To paraphrase Harvard\'s Graham Allison, ""no access to nuclear materials means no nuclear terrorism."" Third, to coordinate these efforts, my legislation would create a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism, responsible for an annual report to Congress listing all sites worldwide with nuclear weapons and weapons-usable fissile material and for developing and coordinating the implementation of a plan to eliminate, remove and secure all such material. Here, too, we will never be served by policies that isolate us from those who can be our allies in stopping proliferation. And I hope that we will turn to this with greater urgency now. We cannot wait 18 months for the next administration. We should be focused on doing as much as possible as quickly as we can. There are so many other challenges across the board from obviously the Middle East to Latin America, from the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the ongoing violence in Darfur. The next president will face a rising China with growing economic, diplomatic and military power. China is using its power throughout the world in new ways that challenge our current thinking and policies. We should neither fear a stronger China nor ignore it. That means engagement and understanding, but also frank dialogue on issues ranging from trade to currency manipulation to human rights abuses and the environment. I remember traveling to China in 1995 to represent the United States at the Fourth World Conference on Women. Shortly before the conference was to start, the Chinese government imprisoned a dissident  as some of you might remember  and many felt that we shouldn\'t go in order to send a strong message of disapproval. But I thought we should send another message. That\'s why I did go and spoke out about the importance of human rights and particularly emphasizing the importance of women\'s rights. I don\'t think we lose by speaking out and engaging with those with whom we disagree, even in profound ways. Latin America presents another challenge, and, again, I think we have ignored developments in Latin America at our peril. The president came into office with great promise but unfortunately it has not been realized. And we must redouble our efforts to create better ties and look for specific projects of development that can perhaps make a difference. The Clinton Foundation just announced a $200 million fund to do just that in Latin America, working for sustainable development and working to train people to do jobs connected with sustainable development. Finally, we face serious challenges in Africa. In Sudan, Zimbabwe and other countries long-term conflicts, external and internal, persist. Certainly in the Horn of Africa we see Islamist extremists attempting to lay down roots. And we are watching the Chinese gain influence, building soccer stadiums and parliament buildings. The Pentagon is creating a separate command for Africa, and I fully support that, but they\'re having a problem figuring out where to place it, because the countries of North Africa are not welcoming us the way that I believe they would have at a previous period. We\'ve seen what happens when we fail to focus on Africa. The genocide in Darfur is a prime example. The United Nations must do more to hold its member countries responsible for meeting basic human rights standards. And the United States must do more to create an environment in which countries are willing to place their resources at the disposal of the mission to end genocide. We\'ve got to look for ways that we can create these opportunities within Darfur. If Sudan does not live up to its commitment to allow a full hybrid U.N. and African Union peacekeeping force, we should work with NATO to take military action. I would suggest a no-fly zone that would be blanketed over Darfur and be focused on the air support that the Sudanese provide to the Janjaweed as they rape and pillage their way through the villages - the bombing comes before, during and after. And I think it is time for us to make a much more serious effort both to support the troops on the ground with airlift and logistics, and to have the threat of the no-fly zone and action taken against those who violate it, in order for this new effort that the U.N. and the A.U. are proceeding with to be successful. But there are some good news stories in Africa that we\'ve got to do more to support, and I particularly am pleased about Liberia. We\'ve seen the very impressive presidency of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. Her commitment to good governance has served as a real example. We have supported debt relief for Liberia, and the Congress is passing that insofar as the American portion of it. But we\'ve got to do more to help the country rebuild, and to try to create some examples of good governance and positive development in Africa with our help. And, of course, there\'s global warming, a particular challenge that has security implications. Eleven retired three- and four-star admirals [and generals], including General Zinni, had come out with a report entitled, ""National Security and the Threat of Climate Change."" It concluded that global warming did present a serious national security threat because of its projected impacts on reduced access to fresh water and impaired food production, the displacement of populations, the mass migrations that will occur, the failed states, the conflicts over scarce resources. I authored an amendment for the Defense Authorization bill to implement many of the recommendations of this report. It is not the first one. The Pentagon actually did their own report, several years ago, which never saw the light of day to any great extent. And it is time that we clearly focus on global warming as a security challenge. Finally, there is a challenge we face right here at home in trying to figure out how to rebuild our military and transform our government to face the threats of the 21st century and to take advantage of the opportunities. I\'m a member of the Transformation Advisory Group, which is a part of the U.S. Joint Forces Command. I was asked to join several years ago. It\'s a unique advisory group, charged with thinking of new ideas to move our military and government into a more forward leaning, forward thinking posture. And it\'s important that we look at the lessons from this group\'s discussion, that it\'s not just about what the military can and must do, but how the rest of the government has to be value-added and work together in a much more coordinated way. Our increasingly interconnected world demands an interconnected strategy that takes into account political, economic, diplomatic and military concerns. When developing military strategy, our military leaders no longer speak of the battlefield, but they talk about the situation. They are much more adept than many people actually understand, that the battlespace goes far beyond the battlefield. And we need that kind of multidimensional thinking, both inside and outside the walls of the Pentagon. So let\'s make an effort to increase the number of soldiers proficient in foreign languages, instead of kicking out interpreters who happen to be gay. Let\'s be sure our policies reflect concern for the will of governments and the perceptions of peoples. Let\'s make sure that we look just not at the Quadrennial Defense Review but at a document that looks at all of the government\'s responses to the threats and opportunities we face. You know, despite the professed attempts at military transformation, much more needs to be done. We do need to increase the size of the Army to address the myriad threats that we still face, even after we begin withdrawing from Iraq. We need to reform the Pentagon\'s acquisition system to rein in the costs of weapons systems and spending on outside contractors. And we need to find the right mix between legacy systems that our service members are currently using and newer programs that will allow us to keep our technological edge.Our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorporate the lessons of asymmetric warfare and train and equip our forces accordingly.Finally, we need to re-evaluate the entire training and education that service members need in the 21st century. Every challenge we face begins with the biggest challenge: restoring our leadership by once again valuing alliances, respecting our values, and understanding that American strength is more than just a show of force. I want to end with a story that I particularly like, in part because it really does remind me of all that America can be when we have leadership that understands all that America should be. It\'s a story that Secretary Albright has told. Back in 1995, she was asked to go to Europe to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. And she was particularly excited about going because she would go to the Czech Republic, having been born and raised in the former Czechoslovakia and having confronted Nazism and communism through her family. So as she traveled around to these various commemorations, she noticed people waving American flags. But as she looked more closely, she realized those flags had only 48 stars. And she kept asking people, ""Where did these flags come from?"" And everyone told her the same thing: when the American G.I.s liberated Europe, they passed out these flags. And people had treasured them, passing them on from grandparent to parent to child. And, in fact, keeping them at some risk to themselves, because if they\'d been discovered under Soviet occupation with an American flag, they could have gotten into trouble. So she asked them, ""Why did you keep these flags for fifty years?"" And everyone said the same thing: because they loved America and they loved the hope that those flags represented and the values that stood behind them. Well, I want to see a restoration of those feelings about us around the world. But I also want to see their restoration here at home. We have to begin believing again in our goodness and our greatness, in our ability to be both smart and tough. You know, 44 years ago this month, President Kennedy spoke just a short distance from where we are today at American University. And he said, ""I speak of peace because of the new face of war."" In this new century, we are confronted by yet another new face of war and a new reality of global interdependence. It is a moment of peril and of promise. How we proceed is entirely up to us. We can repair the damage that has been done to our security and our standing over these past six years. We can rebuild our alliances and restore our moral authority, and reestablish our leadership in the world. And by doing so, we can forge a new American security for this new century. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 10, 2007","b'Speech at the Temple for the Performing Arts in Des Moines, Iowa'","b'Thank you. It\'s an honor and a privilege to be back in Iowa. And I want to thank my good friend your former governor Tom Vilsack for that very generous introduction and for his leadership. During his campaign for the presidency he was one of the strongest voices for a change in the direction in Iraq. And I want to thank Tom and Christie for their friendship and their leadership in my campaign.Today President Bush will speak once again to the nation about Iraq. Our message to the President is clear: it is time to begin ending this war. Not next year, not next month, but today. We have heard for years that as the Iraqis stand up, our troops will stand down. Every year we hear about how next year, they may start coming home. Now we are hearing a new version of that very familiar song from the President. He claims that we can, with slight adjustments, stay the course. There are more troops in Iraq today then ever before. The Iraqi government is more fractured and less effective. The right strategy before the surge and the right strategy now -- post-escalation -- is the same. Start bringing our troops home. America needs a president with the strength and experience to end this war. I will be that president. Our brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country deserve nothing less. As a senator and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have had the privilege of meeting with many veterans in Iraq, here in Iowa and across America. They represent the very best of our country. When called on, they respond, serving with tremendous courage, dedication, and honor -- many of them from our national guard and reserves. And many of them not just once, but with multiple tours of duty. Each mission they were given, they completed. They conducted a thorough search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq -- and found none. They removed Saddam Hussein from power -- and brought him to justice. They helped the citizens of Iraq organize elections -- and vote for new leaders. They gave the Iraqi government the space and time to act -- if they chose to do so. But over the past four years, the situation in Iraq has dramatically deteriorated. The mission today is more about policing a civil war than building a democracy. Our troops now serve alongside Iraqi Army officers and soldiers. Some have their loyalty to Iraq. Others, however, are loyal to sectarian militias -- some of whom serve bravely alongside our soldiers. Others have looked the other way when insurgents plant bombs. Some even have taken up arms against Americans. And our troops are paying the price. 3,598 of them have lost their lives -- 43 from right here in Iowa. These past three months have been the deadliest quarter on record, with 331 fatalities. One Army chaplain told a reporter that he tries to read a unique passage from Scripture over the body of each soldier who has been killed in his unit. But the casualties have been so heavy, he has nearly run out of suitable verses. Then there are the wounded. More than 26,000 so far. Many hurt so badly, they will never fully recover. Many more with ""invisible wounds"" -- depression, anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury. Young people in the prime of their lives unable to work, struggling to relate to their families and reintegrate into their communities. Many aren\'t getting the treatment they need. Some have turned to drugs or alcohol. A few have even taken their own lives. Then there are the families, who pay their own price for this war. Struggling to raise children alone -- trying to find the right answer to all those questions about when mom or dad is coming home. Some forced to explain that mom or dad is never coming home. Our troops\' sacrifice is their sacrifice too. Then there is the price the Iraqis have paid. Tens of thousands civilians -- and several thousand members of the Iraqi security forces -- have been killed. Millions of Iraqis have fled their homes -- nearly 100,000 a month -- under threat of execution by sectarian militias and kidnappings by criminal gangs. Then there are the financial costs. More than $450 billion so far. At the current rate of spending, we could provide access to high quality pre-kindergarten for every four year-old in America, extend health care to all 45 million Americans who are currently uninsured, and make college more affordable for more than one million students. Then there is our work in Afghanistan, yet another casualty of the war in Iraq. When I first visited there in 2003, I was greeted by a soldier who said: ""Welcome to the forgotten frontlines in the war against terror."" Distracted by Iraq, we have squandered much of what our military accomplished in Afghanistan, eroded our position among the Afghan people, limited the potential of President Karzai\'s moderate government, and failed to stem the renewed aggression by the Taliban and al Qaeda. For while the Bush administration has neglected Afghanistan, the terrorists and drug-traffickers have not. A recent UN report found that Afghanistan\'s production of opium -- the raw material for heroin -- increased nearly 50 percent last year, to a total that was more than 90 percent of the world\'s illicit opium production in 2006. The heroin trade finances the very Taliban fighters and al Qaeda terrorists who are attacking our troops and gaining new footholds in parts of Afghanistan. The catalogue of miscalculations, misjudgments, and mistakes in Iraq shocks the conscience. From the unilateral decision to rush to a preemptive war without allowing the inspectors to finish their work or waiting for diplomacy to run its course; to the failure to send enough troops or provide proper equipment for them; to the denial of a rising insurgency and the failure to adjust the military strategy; to continued support for a government unwilling to make the necessary political compromises; to the adherence to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began. As a result of these failures, the next President will inherit some of the greatest foreign policy challenges in our history. Rising terrorism and extremism. Frayed alliances. And the increasingly difficult task of restoring American leadership in a world that has come to view our nation with suspicion and mistrust. We cannot effectively address any of these challenges if we continue our military engagement in Iraq. As long as we stay there, our military strength will continue to erode. Our standing in the world will continue to decline. Our enemies in the region will continue to exploit our failures. Our occupation will continue to serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Our support for Afghan democracy, our conflict with the Taliban, and our hunt for al Qaeda will continue to be compromised. And our brave men and women will continue to lose their lives and suffer grievous wounds. Finally, some of the most respected members of the President\'s own party in the Senate are beginning to acknowledge these realities. Senator Lugar, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and a leading voice on foreign affairs for decades, just recently stated his opposition to staying the course in Iraq. Senators Voinovich and, most recently, Senator Domenici, have also called on President Bush to change course. After more than four years, more than $450 billion, and human costs beyond measure, it is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the crisis in Iraq. It is long past time that the president ended American combat involvement Iraq\'s multi-sided, sectarian civil war, fought for power, revenge, and personal advantage. That is what I have been trying to do in the Senate, after calling for and consistently voting for phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. That is why I voted against a bill to fund the war without any plan for ending it. That is why I\'ve introduced legislation to begin bringing our troops home within 90 days. And that is why I am joining other Democrats to add provisions to the defense authorization bill -- which we are debating in the Senate this week -- that would force the President to change course in Iraq. Among those provisions is legislation I am sponsoring with Senator Robert Byrd to de-authorize the war -- legislation that would actually end the President\'s authority to fight it. I hope and pray that a bi-partisan majority of the Congress will be able to persuade or force the President to change course. In September, General David Petraeus, the Commanding General in charge of Iraq, will issue a report on the progress of the surge. If the past is any guide, the President may still decide to maintain his failed strategy, regardless of what the report says, just as he rejected the thoughtful recommendations of the bi-partisan Iraq Study Group. If that happens -- if the President refuses to end this war before he leaves office -- when I\'m President, I will -- quickly, responsibly, and in a way that will restore -- not weaken -- America\'s leadership in the world. This will be my first and most important mission as President -- one I believe I have the strength and experience to complete. Today, I want to lay out my three point plan for how I would achieve this -- how, as President, I would bring our troops home, work to bring stability to the region, and replace a military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in securing Iraq\'s future and America\'s national security interests. The most important part of my plan is the first step: to end our military engagement in Iraq\'s civil war and immediately start bringing our troops home as quickly and carefully as possible. No permanent occupation of the country. No more neighborhood patrols. No more being caught in the middle of a war whose side we do not even know we should be on. At the end of the day, the Iraqis are responsible for Iraq\'s future. And if we have learned anything these past four years, it\'s that we cannot successfully police a civil war. Therefore, keeping our troops in the crossfire of sectarian violence is not the answer. Bringing them home swiftly and responsibly is. As President, I will convene the Joint Chiefs of Staff, my Secretary of Defense and my National Security Council and direct them to draw up a clear, viable plan to bring our troops home starting within the first 60 days of my Administration. We should do this as quickly as we can, consistent with preserving our security and protecting our troops. I have been long worried that the Pentagon is not adequately planning for the withdrawal of our troops because the White House does not want them to plan for withdrawal. I have written the Secretary of Defense as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and asked them to please let us know in Congress what plans they have. Withdrawing troops is dangerous and difficult. Especially when we will have to convoy our troops and their equipment out of Iraq along the very same roads that are booby-trapped with explosive devices. It requires enormous care and precision, and I hope we will start that process before I\'m president. We should redeploy our troops steadily and consistently, not in fits and starts. And as we bring our troops home, we must ensure that we are fully prepared to care for them -- and their families -- once they have returned. So as the Joint Chiefs and Defense Secretary are drawing up a redeployment plan, I will direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to prepare a comprehensive plan to provide the highest quality health care, disability benefits, and social services for every single servicemember -- including every member of the National Guard and Reserve. And I will make sure this plan is promptly implemented. Today, we are not providing the care our veterans deserve. We have all heard the heartbreaking stories about soldiers languishing in filthy, decrepit facilities. The facilities at Walter Reed were a disgrace which our President recently referred to as, and I quote, ""some bureaucratic red-tape issues."" But sadly, the Walter Reed scandal is just the tip of a nasty iceberg. Today, we have veterans across America who struggle with traumatic brain injury and other wounds, and are told to take a number and wait in line for months. Veterans trying to get disability pay are running into a wall of indifference from their own government. Military families trying to get life insurance benefits they are entitled to are drowning in delay and rejection. When our young men and women put on our country\'s uniform -- when they go into harm\'s way for our American family --they are our sons and daughters and it\'s past time we started treating them that way. That\'s what I\'ve tried to do in the Senate, by expanding health care for our National Guard and Reserve Members, sponsoring legislation to increase military survivor benefits from $12,000 to $100,000, authoring the Heroes at Home legislation to help servicemembers and their families deal with post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. As President, I\'ll propose guaranteed funding for our VA health care system. And a GI Bill of Rights for the twenty-first century to help veterans buy their own homes, build their own businesses, attend college and get the training they need for good, high-paying jobs. The second part of my plan involves working to secure stability within Iraq as we bring our troops home. Right now, the Iraqi government is failing its citizens. Government officials refuse to take the steps needed to advance a political solution, improve the economy and better the lives of ordinary Iraqis. They refuse to do their part to quell sectarian violence -- and some have even chosen to participate in it. As President, I will focus American aid efforts during our redeployment on stabilizing Iraq, not propping up the Iraqi government. Financial resources will only go where they will be used properly. We will no longer funnel money to those government ministries and ministers that hoard it, seal it, or waste it. If, by the time I take office, Iraq\'s central government has proven that it\'s committed to rebuilding the country and striving for sustainable stability and political reconciliation, we\'ll send aid to that government. If not, we\'ll consider providing aid to provincial governments and reliable non-governmental organizations that are making progress. I will also urge the appointment of a high level U.N. representative -- similar to those appointed in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo -- to help broker peace among the parties in Iraq. This representative will press the Iraqis to achieve defined political objectives that will help Iraqis build a stake in their country, including, most importantly, the equitable distribution of oil revenues, so that everyone gets their fair share, and ordinary Iraqis start feeling like they have a stake in the country\'s future. I have promoted the idea of an oil-trust for more than three years because I believe it would help convince Iraqis that they will benefit from a stable Iraq more than the continuing sectarian conflict. I tried to get the Bush administration to adopt this idea which we did in Alaska. When Alaska was discovered to have oil, every Alaskan gets checked so every Alaskan has a stake in making sure that the pipeline is safe and that the process continues. And I believe it would have made such a difference immediately if the United States when we were still the occupying power had created such an oil-trust. I\'m told that my idea which didn\'t have Republican support got as far as the Vice President\'s office where a lot of good ideas apparently die. Third, as we redeploy our troops, we will replace our military force in Iraq with an intensive, diplomatic initiative in the region. To bring about long-term stability in Iraq and prevent violence and unrest from spilling over to other parts of the area, one of the most dangerous parts of the world to begin with. This will be a first step towards restoring Americans moral and strategic leadership in the world-- one that draws on the strength of our alliances and the power of our diplomacy, and uses military force as a last -- not a first -- resort. Over the past four years, we have learned the hard way about the need for a truly multilateral approach in Iraq, one built on sound strategy and long-range planning, not ideology and wishful thinking. The President\'s go-it-alone attitude has diminished our position in the region and around the world. And our diminished position, in turn, has made it increasingly difficult for us to bring about a political solution in Iraq. Our relationship with Turkey is just one example. Six years ago, at the end of the Clinton administration, support for the U.S. in Turkey -- a longtime ally in NATO -- stood at over 50 percent. Today, according to a recent Pew study, it\'s at just nine percent. This is the most spectacular deterioration of relations with a treaty ally in memory. So we\'ve dug ourselves into a pretty deep hole, haven\'t we? But I am confident we can dig ourselves out. I believe we can return to a foreign policy through which, as my friend, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once said, we ""cooperate with others whenever we can and act alone only when we have to. Not the other way around."" I believe we can restore our standing in the world, and begin to restore stability in Iraq, by restoring our use of meaningful diplomacy in the region. That starts with drawing down our troops and drawing upon the international community to make a commitment to Iraq\'s future. So in my first days in office, I\'ll begin work to convene a regional stabilization group composed of key allies, other global powers, and all of the states bordering Iraq. The mission of this group will be to develop and implement a strategy to create a stable Iraq. Working with the United Nations Representative, the group will first work to convince Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Syria to refrain from getting involved in the civil war -- either directly or indirectly, by backing local militants and militias. None of these countries benefits if Iraq implodes and the resulting chaos spills over their borders. Although I believe our military disengagement will reduce the likelihood of regional interference in Iraq\'s internal affairs over the long run, I acknowledge that in the short run, there may well be increased violence and instability following our troop withdrawals. In Bosnia, before the US-led NATO actions resulted in the Dayton Peace Accords, the sectarian violence claimed 200,000 lives and created two million refugees. And Iraq has six times as many people. So unless the leaders of the various insurgent groups, and militias and the government change course, they could reach the per capital Bosnian casualty rates, claiming hundreds of thousands more Iraqi lives and causing millions more to flee. This tragic possibility, however, does not justify continuing our failed policy, but it does intensify the importance of the other elements of my plan. The U.N. led group will attempt to mediate among the different sectarian groups in Iraq with the goal of attaining compromises on fundamental issues like the structure of their new government, the contours of their economic policy, and a system for dividing their oil revenues. This will no doubt be difficult. But achieving agreement on issues like these is a critical step for building a stable future for Iraq. Third, the members of the group will hold themselves and other countries to their past pledges to provide funding to Iraq. And they\'ll encourage additional contributions to meet Iraq\'s extensive needs. As it stands now, the United States is shouldering far too great a share of the financial burden for rebuilding Iraq. As of February 2007, foreign donors had made good on only about 4 billion dollars of the 15 billion in pledges from the Madrid Conference. Some wealthy Gulf nations have come up especially short. Countries around the world also have a stake in Iraq\'s future -- and they should contribute to securing it. Let me say a word about the place of Iran and Syria in this new, diplomatic initiative. There is no question that these two regimes are among the most difficult and dangerous in the world. They pose direct threats to their neighbors, to Israel, our strategic ally and friend, and far beyond the region. Iran\'s President has hosted a conference devoted to denying the Holocaust, placing him in company with the most despicable bigots and historical revisionists. And both countries sponsor terrorism -- directly, and indirectly through Hezbollah and Hamas. Unfortunately, for most of the past six years, President Bush has adopted a simple and fundamentally flawed strategy for dealing with these countries: we don\'t talk to bad people. I think you agree with me that we strongly disagree with this approach. Even during the Cold War, we never stopped speaking to the Soviet Union. Even when they had thousands of missiles pointed at us. Even when their leaders threatened to bury us. Even when they were invading countries and inciting military uprisings around the world. That was the smart policy -- one embraced by both Democrats and Republicans. We know this approach can be as effective now as it was back then. Look what happened when the Administration -- after six years of neglect during which North Korea built up its nuclear program -- finally pursued aggressive, face-to-face talks with North Korea. We got them to agree to suspend their nuclear weapons program -- and we didn\'t have to sacrifice a single American life to achieve that goal. We ended the genocide and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans without sacrificing a single American life. The Administration should learn from the progress made in North Korea and take a similar approach toward Iran and Syria. While they did meet recently with Iranian officials, they now appear reluctant to continue that effort. When I am President, we will deal with Syria and Iran right from the beginning, we will engage them in open, frank, tough-minded discussions about the status of Iraq. And we will convey our strong, bi-partisan position that Iran cannot be allowed obtain nuclear weapons. Now, let me be clear: engagement does not mean a warm embrace. I have no illusions about Iran and Syria. But, we must also be realistic. Diplomacy is difficult and time-consuming. It is frustrating at times, and it may not bear fruit. But it is the best tool we have, given the challenges we face. As we are leaving Iraq -- and after we have left -- we need to engage the world in a global humanitarian effort to confront the human costs created by this war. That is the final component of our diplomatic initiative. Since the start of the war, two million Iraqis have fled their country -- mainly to Jordan and Syria -- and two million more have been displaced from their homes and neighborhoods within Iraq. Many are living in desperate conditions, creating not just a humanitarian crisis, but one with strategic, security consequences for the region. That could become a direct threat to us. As President, I will organize a multi-billion dollar international effort -- funded by a wide range of donor states -- under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Through this initiative, the Commissioner for Refugees will direct aid to build infrastructure and create a social safety net in Jordan, Syria and other countries that have taken in refugees. This money will go to schools, hospitals and housing -- along with initiatives to create jobs and promote economic development. At the same time, the Commissioner for Refugees will be empowered to address the needs of Iraqis who have been displaced from their homes by the violence, but remain inside their country. These efforts will confront the challenges posed by large-scale refugee camps in Jordan, which could destabilize that country and the region. For what we spend in just one month on this war -- $8 billion dollars, plus -- the world can fund this refugee initiative for an entire year and then some. These funds will help ensure a long term solution -- one that addresses the fundamental needs of refugees, rather than resorting to the limited and often counter-productive solution of refugee camps. I stress that because we have to be very careful; not to create cauldrons of distress and outrage, by putting these people into these refugee camps and leaving them there. While we will focus our efforts on improving conditions so that Iraqis don\'t have to flee in the first place, we will also recognize our moral obligation to help those we have put at risk in Iraq -- the interpreters, the soldiers and the workers who have assisted our troops. I have been to Iraq three times. I have met these great people who cast their bond with America. Many of them have been assassinated and members of their families as well. I believe we owe an obligation, particularly to them. So as part of this global humanitarian effort, governments in both the Middle East and the West as well as here in the United States, have to take in asylum seekers, with the Commissioner of Refugees developing a plan to help them return to Iraq once the country has stabilized. Engaging in this humanitarian effort will not require continued military involvement on our part. Just the opposite, in fact. We need to redeploy our troops out of Iraq before we can undertake this diplomatic initiative with any hope for success. Finally, as we do bring our troops home, we cannot lose sight of our very real strategic national interests in this region. If, in the future, Iraq becomes a breeding ground for exporting terrorists, as it appears it already is, as we are learning about those who planned and tried to carry out the attacks in London. That is a great worry for our country. So as we redeploy our troops from Iraq, I will not let down my guard against terrorism. I will devote the resources we need to fight it and fight it smartly. I will order specialized units to engage in narrow and targeted operations against al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in the region. They will also provide security for U.S. troops and personnel and train and equip Iraqi security services to keep order and promote stability in the country, but only to the extent we believe such training is actually working. I would also consider, as I have said before, leaving some forces in the Kurdish area to protect the fragile but real democracy and relative peace and security that has developed there. And as President, I will work to ensure a stable and peaceful relationship between Turkey and the Kurds in Northern Iraq, both of whom are our friends and allies. We must not permit a conflict between these two allies to become another consequence of the Iraq war. Our efforts must also involve a regional recommitment to success in Afghanistan. The Taliban is resurging; they and their al Qaeda allies must not succeed. As President, I will not allow us to fail in Afghanistan. We simply cannot allow al Qaeda to reclaim the country as its safe haven or the Taliban to re-establish its repressive regime. Now, will any of this be easy? Of course not. It\'s going to take tremendous discipline, patience and hard work. But I believe it can be done. I believe we can be a lot smarter about getting out of this war than we were about getting into it. The future of our national security and international standing depends upon it. And we owe our troops -- and their families -- nothing less. I want to end by telling you about one of those service members -- a Chief Warrant Officer in the Iowa Army National Guard, named Bruce Smith, from West Liberty, Iowa. My friend, Tom Vilsack, told me about Bruce Smith and his courageous wife, Oliva. Bruce was deployed to Iraq, in November 2003 the Chinook helicopter he was piloting was shot down near Fallujah. Bruce had to make a split-second decision about how to maneuver the helicopter. One choice would possibly save his life. The other would possibly save his crewmates. Bruce chose to save his crew. And while he and his co-pilot were killed, 17 members of his crew survived. His wife, Oliva has said that in those few seconds, those 17 men needed Bruce more than she and her children would need him for the rest of their lives. Bruce Smith made his choice. He chose to be there for his soldiers. It\'s the choice that so many of our brave men and women in uniform make for each other, and for our country, every single day. Now it\'s time we made the same choice for them. It\'s time we honored their service by bringing them home. If you give me the chance to serve as your President, that will be my first -- and highest -- priority. Thank you very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 24, 2007","b'Speech in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on the Green Building Fund'","b""I want to thank Howard, and John Tabor, and everyone associated with Seacoast Media Group. This is a wonderful idea and a beautiful facility for all of us to meet talk about issues. And I am delighted that the candidates have been invited to come and address you and to answer your questions about some of the really significant challenges we face as a country. The seacoast here in New Hampshire is a perfect place for this conversation. You have many different forms of energy within a very short distance from where we are right now: nuclear, coal, oil, wood. You've got people who are working on harnessing the power of the tides. You've got wind. You have some very exciting local initiatives that you've undertaken by towns across New Hampshire. And certainly here in Portsmouth, Mayor, what you've done to make a real commitment to cleaner energy, more energy efficient buildings, and the lead designation that you got for the library. All of that is really demonstrating so strongly how important it is that local communities be a part of the solution.There's a lot of evidence, as Howard also talked about, that New Hampshire suffers from the failure of the national government to do what we should be doing with respect to energy and global warming. And in very specific terms the impact of pollution, ozone, smog, particulates, mercury that come and deposit themselves on New Hampshire even though they are not produced in this state. When we talk about what we need to do at the federal level, and what I want to do as president, deal with our twin problems of improving our energy system by becoming more independent, therefore, more secure and more efficient. It is also a way we will approach global warming, which will begin to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. Both of those efforts will have an impact on the quality of the environment and begin to reduce some of the damage that is done by the power plants far away from here that drop acid rain and other kinds of pollutants onto you as it does the Adirondacks and the Hudson River in New York. I've done a lot of work on that. So this is an interrelated issue, and I think it's important that we consider it in that way. Because all too often we talk about energy, we have a kind of stovepipe discussion about that. Then we talk about global warming or climate change and we talk about that. And then I also like to talk about the health impact from the environment because I think that's another issue that has to be related. So what I want to do in 20 minutes or so and then get to your questions is talk a little bit about what I'd like to do to address all these issues. And some of it has to come from the federal government, but some of it has to be this partnership that you are so clearly pursuing at the state and local level. But then we also have to address what we can do as individuals. In our homes, and our businesses, our driving habits, and everything else, because we have to have a united front in order to address energy and global warming and environmental health. Let me say, about energy: we all know that we are dependent on foreign oil. We know that about a third of our trade deficit comes from the fact that we have an insatiable appetitive for foreign oil. We are using more money than we were before 9/11. And much of the money that we spend importing and using this foreign oil goes to regimes that are unfriendly to many of our (inaudible). So, we have to address our dependence on foreign oil as a security issue. And its not that these regimes are unstable and unfriendly. But there is one area in Saudi Arabia where 1 out of every 12 gallons of gasoline is produced. If there were an accident or an attack on that site, it would throw the global economy into a tailspin. This is an imperative and frankly, we have been unwilling to face up to this for a number of reasons. Among them are the great power of the oil companies and gas companies: the influence they have in Washington. The fact that after the first oil shock in the 1970s when OPEC came into existence and used their powers as a cartel to really squeeze oil supply and raise demand and prices. You know, we all stood in line and waited to get our cars filled up. I can remember that, getting to a gas station at 5 o'clock in the morning, remember, we were all determined to do something about it. And to Jimmy Carter's credit, he did try, he put into effect a number of provisions that were at least aimed at weaning us off foreign oil, make us more energy conscious and efficient. And then the price of gas fell, because remember it can be manipulated; anybody who tells you its just market supply is naive. It can be manipulated and it has been. The price of gas dropped, so we all go 'oh good, back to low gas prices.' Political pressure's off, we're back to looking for really low gas prices. My late father, we would drive 100 miles to buy gas, in a gas war: you know you have two gas stations one on each side of the street, one would be at 20 cents the other would be at 21. We had that mentality, that's how we grew up that somehow there was an inexhaustible supply that could carry us anywhere we canted in our automobiles. Well, what happened? So, President Reagan came in, totally eliminated all the energy efficiency and conservation and technology research programs that President Carter put in and as citizens, that was fine with us, we were back to cheap gas prices. Now, two places didn't do that. Brazil said 'we don't want to be dependent of foreign oil.' And they began a long-term research project with led to their use of ethanol from sugar cane, which they produce in great quantities. They are e practically independent from imported foreign oil now, because they didn't give up. Political winds blew and changed but they kept on this research project. California did not change their energy conservation laws. They kept stressing energy conservation and in fact, today, in California, the per capita usage of electricity in California has remained constant. Whereas it has gone 50 percent in the rest of the country because we didn't have laws and we didn't have public information campaigns. We can do this. Sometimes, when I talk about getting off of foreign oil and becoming more efficient and conservation minded, somebody who has been brainwashed by the republicans and the oil companies says 'we can't do that, we'll ruin the economy.' Well, the fact is, Brazil did it and California has done and these are just tow things we can do if we are serious about our oil security. When it comes to conservation and energy efficiency, you have a program that we are all familiar with, if you live in cold states like New Hampshire and New York and elsewhere is the weatherization program. Now, it's sending out people to actually weatherize homes, to make them more energy efficient. Out of the weatherization program we've created about 8000 jobs around the country. You can create about 50 jobs in every million dollars you invest in energy efficiency. So, we have 8000 jobs from doing what makes sense: weatherizing peoples homes, helping them save money. Because we know that low income people, people that should be eligible for LIHEAP but do not always get the money because it keeps being cut. One in three forgo medical or dental services for energy reason. They have to pay heat or cool in come parts of the country. And one in four forgo rent or mortgage assistance or they pay forgo for the heat and pay their mortgage instead. So, we know that we can make progress in this area if we are smart about it and create new good jobs. Today I'm announcing another one o my plans, in dealing with this and that is to create a fund called the Green Building Fund: 1 billion dollars a year that will be given in grants to states and localities to help make buildings more efficient and by the way, put 50000 people to work. So we know that we can create millions of jobs if we are smart about how we go about dealing with energy and global warming and the Building Fund would be one example that is very specific about how we would do that. The other parts of my energy security plan would be to create a 50 billion dollar fund. The model for this comes from things we've already done: the Apollo program, the Manhattan Program that we were so good at as Americans. We would see our challenges and would go about meeting them. Well, energy security and global warming are the two greatest technical challenges we confront, just like sending a man to the moon or building an atomic bomb were in the earlier generation. And so what I am proposing is the Strategic Energy Fund that would be funded with 50 billion dollars. Ten billion dollars would come from the oil companies pay royalties on drilling on public land. They have escaped from paying their fair share. Public lands are just that and they need to be paying more. 20 billion would come from removing the tax subsidies that have been increased under the bush administration, remove the tax subsidies from the oil companies, they don't need it they've been making more money than anyone has ever made in the history of the world and that 20 billion will go into these strategic energy fund. The remaining 20 billion would come from a deal that I will offer the oil companies: here's the deal. You all have been hearing how the oil refineries are just all be shutting down. You know, gas is more than 3 dollars a gallon here on the seacoast and every time you turn around, you red about a refinery that had to shut down because it had a mechanical problem or it had some other kind of difficulty. Its just always intriguing to me that refineries shut down in the summer. It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me. And then the oil companies come back and say they don't have enough refinery capacity and the oil companies argue with you when you tell them that you want low sulfur diesel and we want the summer blend of gas and its all too complicated, apparently, for these enormous corporations to figure out. So here's the deal. They can either invest the remaining 20 billion dollars themselves in alternative technology, they can build clean, better refineries that will not break down all the time, they can take steps that will actually put them on the side of helping them to solve both our energy security issue and our global warming issue or we will tax their windfall profits. We will take an average of their profits between 2002 and 20000 whenever we get this passed and we will tae 50 percent above that level. There will be all kinds of crocodile tears and I can hear the guys on cable TV saying I'm going after the oil companies, well, I am going after the oil companies. And with good reason. They are a huge part of the problem we have and they refuse to be a part of the solution. And they have had a friend in the whit house named Dick Cheney who has protected them and helped them to profit so enormously. It is time for them to start contributing to America again. The third thing is, as we go forward on this, we've got to have federal legislation explicitly to deal with global warming. Because what will be done with the strategic energy fund that I've just said (inaudible). We'll start with the 10 or 20 that we start with and go forward but we need to be putting all the technologies that are possibly out there for us on a very fast track. We need the very best minds in America, get our universities get our private sector laboratories get our government scientists all on the same page. Instead of having a president who will not utter the words global warming, we will have a global warming agenda. And we will also make it clear that as we move forward we want every American to participate, we want the best ideas. It is exciting to me that we could unleash a whole new era of innovation, lets call it Energy 2.0, lets be as creative with this as we were with information technology. It is exactly what I think will help tot spur American's competitiveness and put millions of Americans to work. I have signed on to the most aggressive cap and trade global warming bill that we have. Senator Boxer chairs who the environment committee on which I serve. Senator Sanders, your neighbor from Vermont. Have put forward a plan for an economy wide cap and trade system aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions, by 2050, 80 percent below the 1990 level. We will try to get the to 1990 level by 2020. I know these are aggressive targets. But I think that we have to set aggressive targets and set big goals to unleash the genius of the American economy. If you think about the internet, it was really a combination of government research, started in the 1950s after sputnik went up with something called the DARPA, we put billions dollars in, over time, helped to spur the space program, but that is also where the internet started. And people, literally, inventing in their garages and coming up with amazing ideas, being taken to market. So we now have what we see in the world today. The world wide net and all the advances we have. I'm not sure we even know today, what forms of energy we know we could be using in 50 years. That's something I am excited about. That is we really got serious about this, there may be a substitute for the internal combustion engine. You know, yes, right now, we are looking for ways to make it burn more cleanly, we are looking for better sources of fuel from cellulose ethanol and other sources, we're looking at hydrogen. I'm not even sure we know all the possibilities. I want young people to be as excited about pioneering energy and dealing with global warming as 20 30 years ago, people like bill gates were about pioneering the Internet. I also want to accelerate the use of alternative fuels, particularly in transportation. We just passed a senate energy bill a few weeks ago, we did several good things: we raised gas mileage, Though there are many who wish who wish could've gone further and of course I understand that. But just getting fro 25 to 35 and getting the votes we have in the face of tremendous resistance, was a great step forward. We also did work very hard to increase the potential goal for ethanol. And we raised the ratio. People are starting to raise legitimate concerns about the impact of corn-based ethanol on life styles prices, on food prices, the effects on land. So what we've said is that we want to get to 36 million gallons but we want to reverse so we have 15 from corn ethanol and 21 from what's called cellulose ethanol, which is just about anything that grows to see whether we can get the energy out of the plant and turn it into ethanol that can be mixed with gas. And Dartmouth has done some very interesting work on this, creating a process to extract the sugar energy and the carbohydrate energy out of the plant based material and I'm excited because the first plant that will be built to see if the Dartmouth process works, will be in Rochester, New York. So we're really going to see a lot of great work being done now with different forms of ethanol. We also need to look at what more we can do to try to encourage efficiency. I mentioned the green building fund. I've also introduced legislation with Senator Kerry, John Kerry, he and I have legislation to require that federal buildings get more efficient. The federal government owns or rents over 500,000 buildings around the country. They spend $5.6 billion heating, cooling, and powering those buildings and the fact is that if the federal government took the lead on making these buildings efficient, they would create a market that would help the all rest of us. Because you know the federal government is out their saying we want to have florescent bulbs, but we'd like them to have a somewhat better color of their light, than the usual florescent lights, can you come up with some new ideas. With a huge buyer like that, it would really move people. So that compact florescent bulbs might have (inaudible) somewhat softer light. And you know the big problem with florescent bulbs is that too many women tried on bathing suites in front of too many mirrors. And we don't like that color light. So you know my husband walks around the house with bags of compact fluorescents putting them in anywhere he can find a place. And we were taking about it the other day and he said the big objection with those is how to make them those have a slightly softer look to them. So that we all look good. And that's sort of the aesthetics of that. So there's a lot of research we could do there, and if the federal government would lead the way, it would move much more quickly. We also know that right now we could make changes in a lot of our buildings. And I actually teamed up much to everyone's surprise with probably the Congress' leading skeptic on global warming, Jim Inhoffe, the senator from Oklahoma who chaired the environment committee for most of my time in the Senate when I served on the committee. But Senator Inhoffe and I just got passed in the energy bill a provision to tell the federal government to look at how they could power their buildings differently right now. Don't wait. Including looking a geothermal, which in many parts of the country has tremendous possibility. We've done some geothermal work in New York. There's a town Auburn, New York where geothermal is heating and cooling the city hall where their using geothermal in a few other of the facilities. We just want a lot of other different ideas to happen. Solar energy remains an under utilized source of power, particulary electricity. Other countries have moved much more quickly. Germany is getting a lot of their power from solar now. And they're not a tropical climate and yet they have a combination of government incentives and public education programs going on that had moved a lot of people towards photovoltaic cells on their roofs in their construction. We've got to figure out how to incentivize that. One of the problems we face is the resistance to using the tax structure to change behavior because by using the tax structure, you will move people away from fossil fuels, that's where the oil companies and the gas and the coal companies come back in. They don't want us to give a lot of tax incentives. We tried to do that in the energy bill, we got 57 bipartisan votes but we needed 60 under the rules of the senate, so we are going to go back and try again. But the reason we didn't is because if we put more tax money on more solar, more wind, more geothermal it would mean that the oil companies, coal companies, gas companies would obviously start losing market share. So we still have real political challenges here that we are going to try and address. Let me just finish by talking about 2 things that are really near and dear to me that I have worked on since 20012. I'm not new to these issues I care deeply about them and have been involved in them for a long time. The first was something that I understand a lot of your schools are doing and I couldn't find the real brochure so I brought this copy, but back in 2001 I sent out this brochure to every school district in New York and it says 'smart schools save energy.' Because I did a survey about how much money school districts, which are always hard pressed for money in New York and I know here in New Hampshire that most school spend more money on energy than they do on books or computer's. And by simple changes that might cost some front-end money, they would begin to save 25 to 30 percent through better building design, use of renewable energy technology and sensible changes in operation and maintenance. And that was back in 2001 because as a traveled around New York I realized there are a lot of old school buildings, they needed to be weatherized, they needed to be upgraded, with some initial investment, they could save a lot of money of the next 20 to 20 years. The other thing I've done over the last several years is work very hard with Rochester, New York, which, as you just heard is going to be the place of the plant that will use the Dartmouth technology. And I brought in the US green building council and other folks that were interested. And we created a green print for Rochester. We spent a couple of years doing it: bringing everyone to the table, private sector, public sector, outside experts and this report is the result. Looking at how one city could move on all levels at one time. What could be done to make buildings more efficient, to have an outreach campaign to citizens so we would turn off lights when we left the room. We would unplug appliances that would such up energy when they were not working. That we would use compact florescent bulbs that we would try to be more conscious about how we drove, maybe be more efficient in our driving patterns and so much else that we could do on a local personal level as well as a local level through municipal planning. And I am really convinced that we have to move on all these levels at one time. Yes, we cannot be successful if we don't have a president who believes in this mission. I believe in this mission. And I will start be reigniting our international involvement. We cannot sit here, in the united sates and expect to deal with global warming if we do not cooperate with other countries. Getting back into process, you know when president bush took us out of Kyoto, I regretted that but he had an opportunity to start his own process, he didn't want to do Kyoto, do something else. Reach out to India and China they have to be part of this. One of the flaws of the Kyoto process was I don't think people anticipated, even in the early 90s how quickly china and India would grow. China is now growing at 12 percent a year. They are the second highest user of energy but they are now the highest emitter of green house gases in the world. India is not far behind. We have got to get a new international process. The dispute about the science is thankfully over the IPCC finally put that rest last year. So, get that off the table. What is it that we are going to do? What kind of presidential leadership do we have internationally? And then building a coalition here at home to pass the energy legislation to the global warming legislation and lets not forget the environmental health piece of this. And that's the last thing I'm going to say. Every year I have been a senator I have introduced legislation to create an environmental health tracking system. There are really three triggers: genetics, behavior and environment and their interaction.; what we know is that the environment plays a big roll. You know, I represent places in New York City where w25, to 30 percent of the children have serious asthma. It just so happens they live in poor living conditions. They live where there are a lot of bus depots and Taxi depots where lost of cars are running a Spewing out emissions all the time and there is a connection, we know that. And I know, having worked for the last 6 years, on behalf of the victims of 911: firefighters, police officers and others who have been severely affected by what they breathed that day. How anyone could argue that what we breathe does not affect our health, after 911, is just impossible to understand. And we now have people who are dying because of their exposure on 911. So the debate should be over about environmental effects. Clean air is good for us on many levels. But it is especially good for our health; it is especially good for our children's health. So, I am pleased to be here and excited about talking to you. These issues are critical to our country, our security, our environment, and our employment opportunities to create millions of new jobs. And the United States must lead the way and I will do that when I am elected President."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 27, 2007",b'Remarks to the Urban League',"b'Sen. Clinton: Good morning! It is an absolute delight to be with you this morning for this very important conference. I want to thank Mark for the wonderful job that he is doing here at the Urban League, and for his strong leadership on so many issues. I also want to recognize and thank the entire Urban League board and the staff, who have put this together and have labored hard to make sure that it was a productive and important event, not just for the National Urban League, but for all of us.I want to recognize St. Louis\' mayor, Mayor Slay, delighted you\'re here for this important occasion. And other elected officials who are in the audience. Now there are two people who are not here, who I would be remised if I did not mention. I would hear about it from one, and that is our old friend Vernon Jordan, who said, ""You went all the way to St. Louis and you didn\'t event mention me."" So Vernon, wherever you are, we\'re thinking of you. And we\'re grateful to you for your lifetime of service. Another who I want to honor by remembering him, is Ron Brown. Someone who served our country so well, and whom we miss. His brand of leadership and good humor in the face of challenge is always timely and we certainly could use more of it today. And George, thank you for keeping the trains running on time. And finally, I want to thank all of you for ninety-seven years of service. When I think of the National Urban League, I think of the people whom I\'ve known, the projects that I\'ve partnered on. But according to a recent study by Dr. Silas Lee, who I\'m very proud to say is one of my pollsters and given me great advice, and Dr. Bernard Anderson, who served as Assistant Secretary of Labor during my husband\'s Administration, according to their study between 2004 and 2006, the Urban League contributed more than $2.5 billion to America\'s economy. And not only that, in 2006, more than 70 million people were directly and indirectly served through the publications, the seminars, the advocacy and service projects undertaken by the Urban League. That is an extraordinary achievement -- and it\'s one that\'s not often recognized. People don\'t realize that non-profits, like the Urban League, are drivers of economic progress. And I want to thank you, not only for the good work you do, but for the economic impact that work has. I also want to really express my gratitude for this opportunity to continue the conversation that the Urban League is leading in our cities, and to fully endorse your Opportunity Compact -- it is a set of priorities which I strongly support built on 4 cornerstones that every American should be able to agree to. The opportunity to thrive, the opportunity to earn, the opportunity to own, and the opportunity to prosper -- that\'s a pretty good definition of the American dream in my book. Because I don\'t have as much time as I would love for this conversation -- I could be up here for hours with all of you, and loving to hear back from you -- I want to focus on one aspect of this conversation -- and that is an issue highlighted in the Opportunity Compact, highlighted in your State of Black America report, and recently in the Dellums Commission. And that is the crisis of 1.4 million young men of color between the ages of 16 and 24 - they are out of school and out of work. That includes nearly one out of every three young African American men. Young men who are not earning legal wages or learning marketable skills. Over half growing up in homes without fathers, a third wind up in the criminal justice system, nearly 5,000 each year are claimed by guns or violence before their 25th birthdays. Now I don\'t know about you, but I feel like I\'ve been listening to this conversation all my life. And I firmly believe it is the wrong conversation, I reject it. I reject a conversation about 1.4 million young men as a threat, as a headache, or as a lost cause. I reject the conversation about 1.4 million disappointments, failures, and casualties of a broken system. That is not who these young men are. I believe it is long past time for a new and different conversation. It is time for America to begin a conversation about 1.4 million future workers, entrepreneurs, tax-payers, community leaders, business executives. A conversation about 1.4 million future husbands and fathers and role models. A conversation about 1.4 million boys who have the God-given potential to grow into strong, proud, loving, decent, productive, accomplished men with our help and support. That is the conversation I want to have with you and America, and that is the conversation I want to take with me into the White House in January 2009. To put forth an agenda to finish the job. It\'s time, America, for a change. And I have seen the potential. As a young lawyer right out of law school, I didn\'t want to go to Wall Street firms, I didn\'t want to clerk for a judge, all I wanted to do was to work for Marian Wright Edelman at the Children\'s Defense Fund. That was my goal, I had met her, she had gone to Yale Law School about 10 years before me, she was legendary with her work in Mississippi on behalf of civil rights and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. I heard she was speaking at Yale, I went to introduce myself to her during my very first year in law school. Heard her speak, was galvanized, went up to her and said, ""I want to work for you."" And she said, ""Well, that\'s nice, but I can\'t pay you."" And I said, ""Well, that\'s a problem because I\'m working my way through law school, so I have to get paid."" And she said, ""If you can figure out how to get yourself paid, you can come work for me."" So applied for and I received a Law Student\'s Civil Rights Research Council Internship, which paid me to be able to go and do the work that has been the passion and calling of my life through my years of public service, and now my years in public office. And I remember very well one of the first assignments that Marian gave me was to go to a couple of states and find out if we could stop them from jailing children with adults. And then to go door to door and ask people if they had children who weren\'t in school, because back in those days children were kept out of school for all kinds of reasons. Some of them had physical ailments, some of them had behavioral problems, some of them had to help support their families. So I have been focused on what we need to do to help children succeed. And I have to tell you in all my 35 years as an advocate for children and families, I have never met a child without potential. And these 1.4 million young men are no different. And when we write them off and leave them behind -- when we squander their potential -- we squander America\'s potential. And that is nothing short of a moral crisis. But let\'s be clear: this is not just a moral crisis -- it is an economic crisis. And it\'s not just an urban economic crisis. It is not just an African American economic crisis. It is an American economic and moral crisis. And when we let these young boys and men fall through the cracks, we make a decision to spend $32 billion a year on prisons. Now we may not draw the connection all the time, but you and I know that\'s the decision we\'re making. We have decided that we\'re going to spend poorly, instead of spending it smartly. Right now, across America, jobs are going empty because companies can\'t find trained, skilled employees to fill them. So ultimately, the crisis of young men of color is a national crisis. And when I\'m President, I will call for a national response -- and a national commitment -- to address it. I will call everyone to the table. One of the that things I really believe in, is getting everybody out there together, and rolling up our sleeves, and starting to act like Americans again. We\'re the people who are supposed to be the problem solvers. We\'re not supposed to stand on the sidelines, wringing our hands talking about how terrible things are. We\'re supposed to be working together to solve problems. And I want state and local governments, universities, businesses, unions, non-profits, churches, individuals. And I\'m going ask one simple question: ""What will you do -- not what you\'ll talk about -- but what will you do? Not another report, but what will you do in order to deal with this crisis?"" I am not going to accept half-steps or piecemeal measures as an answer. We need a smart, bold, daring, comprehensive approach. One based on the fundamental premise that these young men are all our children. All of our responsibility. Because after all these years, I still believe it takes a village to raise a child. So, that is why today, I am announcing my Youth Opportunity Agenda -- which goes hand in hand with the Opportunity Compact. This is my plan, as your President, to build that village. An America where every child is valued for his or her God-given potential, and where all of us, from our families to our communities to our country, resolve to do whatever we can to help each child realize that potential. Now, I believe the initiative has to start from day one -- the very day a child is born -- with early interventions to help that child get on the right path. That\'s why, as President, I\'m going to focus like a laser on those early years. And it\'s not just focusing on the children; let\'s focus on the parents and the grand-parents, and the aunts and the uncles, and the brothers and the sisters. We know what works; I\'ve been doing this for 35 years. I started off at the Yale Child Studies Center, I\'ve done it through Arkansas, and when I was privileged to work in the White House for my husband, and now in the Senate. We know what works. Let\'s take these proven programs like nurse home visitation programs, where we send in qualified nurses and social workers and others to go in and help these young mothers and fathers understand what they need to do for their children. Let\'s emphasize a program I helped to start during the 90\'s -- the Early Head Start program. Let\'s expand and build on Head Start -- a proven success. And finally, I have made a commitment to universal pre-kindergarten for every four year old -- access to quality, affordable early learning when it really can make a difference in the lives of these children. An astonishing fact, not from me because I believe this based on all the work I\'ve done. But James Heckman, Noble Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, hardly thought to be a hotbed of fuzzy thinking and liberal thought, he did a study, and he concluded that if we had universal pre-kindergarten, we would close by 50% the achievement gap between white and black children. Just with that early investment, children will stay in school longer, they\'ll do better. Let\'s make that one of our priorities. Second, once our children start school, we have to provide early mentoring and support to keep them on the path to success. It is not enough to give young men of color a chance to succeed, if then after they\'ve started down this long and difficult path we step off of it. We need to be holding hands moving forward together. We know that many young men drop out of school. Did you know that a child in America drops out of school every 29 seconds? Many don\'t make it through high school, some don\'t make it through junior high school. That\'s why, as President, I will expand programs like GEAR UP that intervene in middle school to provide mentoring and tutoring. I want college visits to help young people understand this can be part of their future. Programs like the Hillside Work Scholarship Connection -- created with the help of the Rochester Urban League in Rochester, New York -- that develops individualized college and career success plans for middle school students and gives these students a job. Gives them a job after school, during vacations because they have to be exposed to the culture of work and learn all those habits and that discipline. And it has proven to be a great success. I also want to see schools like Eagle Academy in New York, in the Bronx. I was honored to help start this Charter School with the one hundred black men in New York. I think David Banks, who was the principal, is here. We need a thousand of Eagle Academies for young men of color, where they feel accepted, supported, mentored and helped. I want to use a mentorship model that will reach an additional one million students. My Administration will provide $100 million over five years to establish internship opportunities that will match students with businesses, with unions, with non-profits like the Urban League to provide the training they need to thrive in professional environments. This isn\'t just a chance to enrich our children. It\'s not a corporate charity program. We have to give both sides of the equation -- the young men and the employer -- a chance to discover and develop each other, and to have then, an opportunity waiting for that young person. The third part of my agenda involves building comprehensive, community-based programs to reach out to young people who are failing to thrive. Programs that don\'t just keep them from falling through the cracks -- but actually start filling in the cracks. I\'m going to ask our mayors and other local leaders to gather with representatives from across the community to develop such programs. Now, that might mean creating one-stop youth centers like those in Baltimore and Los Angeles where case managers work to connect young people with tutoring, job training, and other support services. It might mean strengthening alternative education and Career Academies, apprenticeships and skills training. I had a visit from the New York Auto Dealers a year or two ago. They said, ""Senator, we have 600 jobs that we can\'t get filled for auto-mechanics. These are jobs in New York starting at $50,000. Where do we go to find such people?"" Well, to their credit, they started a school. But we need to have more partnerships like that. I\'m talking about programs that give young people the skills and confident they need to compete for the high-tech 21ast century jobs, because one of the reasons those auto mechanic jobs are harder to fill is because you have to know about computers. It\'s no longer a low skill job; it\'s a high skill job with a very good salary. Programs like Focus Hope in Detroit that train young people to fill the 16,000 machinist jobs opening up each year in that city. Programs like Year Up that give young people the skills to land good financial services jobs in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Programs that train students for new, renewable energy ""green collar"" jobs. YouthBuild, which have been putting our young people to work -- they\'re beginning to train young people to do this and I have a program that will create 50,000 jobs of people that can\'t be outsourced. If we\'re going to start getting serious about alternative energy and do things like solar, somebody\'s got to climb up there and put that solar panel on the roof. We\'re going to create millions of jobs if we do this right and a lot of them will be in the inner cities. We also need to make sure our young people can get these jobs in the first place. Yes there are problems because of low education and low skills, lack of mentoring and networks. But let\'s be frank here. Some of those problems that stand in the way of young people and jobs is because of discrimination, plain and simple. Which brings me to my fourth point. A recent study showed that when employers were presented -- I\'m almost done, Mark. But you know I\'m just fired up about this you can\'t stop me now. A recent study showed that when employers were presented with similarly qualified white and black applicants, they were twice as likely to hire the white applicants. They even hired white applicants with criminal records at the same or higher rates than black applicants. So we\'re going to get back to a Justice Department and a Civil Rights Division that actually enforces the laws. And finally, we have got to tackle two remaining problems. First, how do we help these young men be responsible fathers? We\'ve got to reverse President Bush\'s dramatic cuts in child support enforcement. We\'ve got to make sure that every dollar goes to the children who need it. We\'ve got to make sure that the young men have the money to pay the child support which means raising the minimum wage again. And we have to confront the devastating impact of the criminal justice system. The brutal revolving door has already claimed so many young lives. And I want to have a second change program that really focuses on how we\'re going to keep our young people out of the criminal justice system, and how we\'re going to rehabilitate then and give them a new chance when they come out. So, I know this is not going to be easy, but I am up for it if you are. I am confident and optimistic we can make this happen together. Now there will be all the naysayers who say, ""Oh my goodness we can\'t do it. Politics is so hard."" Well, we can\'t listen to them James Baldwin once said, ""Those who say it can\'t be done are usually interrupted by those who are doing it."" And so we got to get about the business of doing it. Let me tell you that if we work together, if we elect a president who cares passionately about our young people, understands what it will take to make the Opportunity Compact real in their lives, we\'re going to see change in America. I want to be your partner. I look forward to working with you. Let\'s go out and make it happen. Thank you all, and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 7, 2007",b'Speech on Housing and the Mortgage Crisis',"b'Thank you so much, Christie.And it\'s not easy to come here and do this, for her and for her family. I am just very grateful that she would share her story. Of course, it\'s an abbreviated version of her story. Her husband\'s job was outsourced. He actually trained his replacement. That\'s when they ran into all the problems that they faced with trying to pay the mortgage payments that kept going up. And I don\'t know whether there is anybody in this audience or anyone who, through the media, who might be following this, who could do anything to help Christie and her family, but I hope somebody will try. Because it\'s really important to her and particularly her children. One of her children has a challenge in learning, and being in the school district has worked out really, really well. So I hope that somebody might be able to step forward who has a rental or who has some other way of helping Christie. You know, the bank actually bought the home at higher than market value. So maybe if somebody with the bank or with someone associated with Ameriquest, which started this downward spiral, could step forth and try to, you know, show some humanity and compassion, that would be a good way to start what we need to do to repair some of the damage that is being done to families across our country. You know, before I came out, I met with Michael Dillon and his fiance, Jenna Kresky, and their attorney, Walter Maroney, who also shared a story of deception, fraud, abuse -- just enough to make you wonder what\'s going on in our country. And as Christie and I were talking before we came out, I was thinking how, in 1991 and \'92, when Bill and I were here campaigning as he was running for president, we actually focused on the issue of home foreclosures. Some of you might remember. We had an event in a home, just like the home that Christie shares with her husband and three children, because that home was being foreclosed on. And because of the economic conditions and some of the problems that people in New Hampshire were facing at that time, people were losing their homes. Well, we all took a big sigh of relief during the 1990s, didn\'t we? (LAUGHTER) And we didn\'t face a lot of these economic problems that just cut right to the heart of the American dream for hard-working families like Christie\'s and like Michael and Jenna and others. Well, here we are; we\'re back again. And it\'s a combination now of economic conditions that are not working for the vast majority of Americans and unsavory practices that are undermining the dream of homeownership. So as much as I wish that Christie\'s story was the exception and that no one would ever have to go through what she and her family are going through, the reality is that they are, by no means, alone. Their story is now the story of hundreds of thousands of families across America, including many right here in New Hampshire: families who have worked hard and done everything right, who maybe lose a job, maybe have a medical emergency or some other intervening event. And they\'ve spent years scrimping and saving to buy their home, they have signed exactly where the mortgage company told them to sign and submitted all the right papers. But then some kind of crisis intervenes, or, maybe because of some provision buried in the fine print, they discover that their mortgage rates are actually much higher than they thought. Maybe they realize too late they\'ve been lured into buying a more expensive home than they could actually afford. Maybe they hit the end of a fixed-rate period and their rates double, but they can\'t pay off the principle without facing prepayment penalties. And before they know it, their dream of homeownership has turned into a nightmare of escalating payments and threatening letters. And too many families end up in default, and too many lose their homes altogether. This past June, there were nearly 165,000 foreclosures in America, 87 percent more than the previous June, in 2006. Here in New Hampshire, there were 1,400 foreclosures in just the first six months of this year, compared with 147 for all of 2006. And, according to the New Hampshire banking commissioner, approximately 4,000 New Hampshire households with sub-prime mortgage loans -- that\'s 20 percent of all the sub-prime mortgages in the entire state -- will experience a jump in their monthly payments of between 50 and 100 percent. So a $1,500 mortgage becomes a $3,000 mortgage. And that\'s what we\'re looking forward to. The problems we\'re seeing, however, are not limited to what\'s called the sub-prime market. They\'re not just affecting low-income families. Defaults and foreclosures are spreading, and they\'re hitting middle-income families like Christie\'s. So what exactly is going on here? Well, I think several things. Over the past few years, risky loans have been packaged and resold around the world, mortgage companies have collapsed, and the entire stock market is feeling the effects. Those effects are spreading from Wall Street to Main Street. And Americans who have long counted on their homes as their biggest asset to carry them through retirement are seeing that sense of security be shredded. Now, the Bush administration constantly reassures us that the economy is fine, that everything will be OK. Well, given their track record, that is not exactly comforting or believable. Now, we know the mortgage problem is extremely complex. It has many, many roots. But one of the root causes is the trend in wages. Wages have been stagnant. Housing prices, on the other hand, have been going, literally, through the roof. So we\'ve had an affordability gap. Many families could not afford to buy homes with traditional mortgages. So the mortgage companies came with a really seductive offer. They started offering more high-risk mortgages for people strapped for cash: products like interest-only and no-money-down mortgages. Unscrupulous brokers who get paid based on the size of the mortgages they sell lured many families into buying more expensive homes than they could actually afford. And many families were not told, were not counseled, were not warned, and did not understand the implications of signing on the dotted line. At the same time household incomes have declined $1,300 over the past six years, costs have risen. Health-care costs are up 87 percent. College costs rose 40 percent. Gas prices have more than doubled. So many people started borrowing against the equity in their homes to cover their expenses. Believe it or not, the amount of people\'s disposable incomes that comes from their home equity is double what it used to be. Now, back when mortgage rates were lower and home prices were rising, if you got behind on your mortgage you could refinance your home or sell it, and you\'d be just fine. As my friend Warren Buffet reminds us, a rolling loan gathers no loss. (LAUGHTER) He always has a way of saying things like that. But then mortgage rates started to rise, so people could not afford to refinance anymore. Housing prices started to fall, so it got a lot harder to sell in many markets. Today we\'ve got nearly a nine-month backlog of unsold homes. As a result, many families are finding themselves trapped: stuck with mortgages they can\'t pay and expenses they can\'t afford. So they\'re facing wrenching choices: pay their medical bills or pay their mortgage; put off retirement or lose their homes. And many people who have worked hard their entire lives are receiving the same grim letter in the mail that Christie\'s family received. Now, there are those who will tell you -- they tell me this -- ""Well, that\'s just the way the market works, Hillary. Nothing we can do about it."" Or they\'ll say, ""Buyer beware. People just need to be more careful."" Well, now, that\'s easy to say when it\'s not your home being taken away. And I don\'t think unscrupulous mortgage brokers should be part of how our markets work. I don\'t think families should be lured into buying homes they can\'t afford so brokers and mortgage companies can make a bigger profit. I don\'t think people should have to be on the lookout for unfair clauses buried on page 700 of the fine print. And I don\'t think it\'s right that so many hard-working, responsible families across this country are losing their most precious possession and their most valuable asset. So let\'s be clear: This isn\'t just a problem for families. What happens with mortgages can have a big effect on the economy. That\'s what we\'ve been reading about in the newspapers over the past weeks. Auto companies have recently noted the weakness in the housing market is even affecting car sales. And, as we\'ve seen throughout American history, homeownership is not just about economy stability. It is also about economic growth. Think about what happened after President Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill, which helped returning soldiers obtain their mortgages. Families across America bought their first homes. A thriving middle class was born and flourishing. We had unprecedented economic expansion. So today, we have a clear choice: We can look at the statistics, wring our hands, and continue to do nothing. Or we can do what America has done in times of difficulty: acknowledge that we have a real challenge and confront it head-on with real solutions. Now, I think the choice is obvious. I think we need to act now with smart, practical solutions to strengthening our housing and mortgage markets. We need to put an end to fly-by-night mortgage brokers peddling loans to unqualified applicants based on inflated appraisals. We need to help those facing the pain of foreclosure. And we need to secure the marketplace and put reform in action right now. Now, back in March, I announced an agenda to address abuses in the sub-prime lending market, because back in March, that\'s all anybody thought was going to be at stake. People said, ""Well, maybe there are problems in the sub-prime market, but, you know, that\'s not really going to be that significant."" Well, I disagreed then, and I disagree now. I think the sub- prime market was sort of like the canary in the mine. You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ""There are problems here."" And now the problems have unfortunately spread to the conventional mortgage market as well. In fact, some of the very same tricks of the trade are being used to hurt people in the conventional market that have been long used against people in the sub-prime market. So that\'s why today I\'m announcing a four-part plan for how I, as president, would address abuses across the mortgage industry -- a plan to curb unfair lending practices and hold brokers and lenders accountable, give families the support they need to avoid foreclosure, and increase the supply of affordable housing. I\'ll be introducing this plan as legislation when the Senate goes back into session after Labor Day. We\'re going to try, in the Democratic Congress, to push forward on this agenda. But if the president won\'t sign our proposals that we will send to him in the next months, when I\'m president I will take a very active role in making this a priority, and I will sign into law provisions to do exactly what I\'m outlining. The way I see it, one of the most... (APPLAUSE) You know, the way I see it, one of the most important jobs of the next president is to restore a sense of economic leadership to our country and a sense of fairness to our economy. I believe in shared responsibility and shared prosperity. I see myself as a modern progressive. I believe one of the crowning achievements of the early American progressives was reforming our economic system, making changes that made the economy work for more Americans. That is why lending reform is so important, because abuses in this area affect those who can least afford to lose their homes. And in today\'s world of loan repackaging, these failures can and will have ripple effects throughout the entire economy. So it\'s precisely in areas like mortgage lending, where we see this gathering storm, that we have to act quickly and responsibly to reform the system. And that\'s where I fundamentally differ with Republicans. They believe in letting everyone fend for him- or herself. They believe in what the president calls an ownership society, which is really, ""You\'re on your own."" It\'s the yo-yo economy: Some go up, and some go down, and the strings are pulled by other people. Well, I don\'t think that is the way America works best. I think when we see a problem; we need to roll up our sleeves and get together to fix it. And that is the kind of president that I intend to be: reaching toward big goals like universal health care, ending the war in Iraq, but also making... (APPLAUSE) ... also making the economy work for everyone again. You know, that\'s why, when I was listening to Christie and thinking about where we were in \'91 and \'92, where the economy was flat on its back, where people were being so left out and at their wits\' end, and yet it took a lot of effort and it was politically difficult -- because I\'ll tell you something: Change is not just a word, it is a challenge. And to get the changes we need in America, we\'re all going to have to get together and stand up to those who have a lot to gain from keeping our system the way it is. And it\'s the mortgage industry, and it\'s all the people they sell loans to, and it\'s the people who package them, and it\'s the people who make money off of them. So let me tell you what I would do. First, I would focus on cracking down on unscrupulous brokers who lure unsuspecting families into unfair mortgages. Many families assume their broker has their best interests at heart. But that is often not the case. What they don\'t realize is that the more expensive the mortgage a broker sells, the more money the broker makes. So brokers have a strong incentive to steer their clients toward the biggest, most expensive mortgages, even if clients can\'t afford them. We need to help families go into home buying with their eyes wide open. So I\'m proposing, as a matter of federal law, we require brokers to tell families up front they\'re paid on the basis of the size of the mortgage they sell. That will put buyers on notice that they need to ask tough questions... (APPLAUSE) ... and be wary of the products that are being offered. We also need to do more to screen mortgage brokers to ensure they\'re qualified and that they deal fairly with clients. You know, I had a roundtable event about this down in Orlando, Florida, a couple of months ago. And a former broker from Ameriquest said he could not sleep at night any longer. He quit his job, and he came in and he spilled the beans. And he sat there and he talked about all the tricks and all the pressure that are put on the brokers to make them go out and sell these loan packages that are going to explode in the face of the borrowers. So we\'ve got to do more to really make sure that we have national standards for brokers. Many states don\'t even have basic licensing standards. In a lot of states, you don\'t even have to be licensed to be a mortgage broker. So the average homebuyer has no reliable way to know whether a broker is trustworthy or not. And that\'s why I\'m proposing that the federal government work with the states to develop strong, meaningful broker licensing standards to stream brokers and govern their conduct. I will also require... (APPLAUSE) ... that brokers register with the federal government. That way, we can establish a single database to track rules violations, complaints and employment history. (APPLAUSE) So before you hire a broker, you can get online and do your own background check to ensure you\'re dealing with someone who will deal with you fairly. This is especially important in the home equity refinancing area, because a lot of that business is sold over the phone. People get a call. I\'ll tell you something, some of the brokers don\'t even use their real names on the phone. And so, people are listening, and it sounds really good. And they particularly prey on the elderly. So we\'ve got to have more standards governing brokers. Second, I will also crack down on the mortgage lenders by eliminating prepayment penalties and working to ensure... (APPLAUSE) ... that lenders don\'t lure people into unworkable mortgages in the first place. Now, as some of you know from unfortunate personal experience, prepayment penalties are a gold mine for mortgage lenders and it\'s a trap for homebuyers. The way many high-risk, non-traditional mortgages work is that you pay a low rate for a number of years -- which is probably why you took the mortgage in the first place -- then, once that time period is up, the rates skyrocketed. Then you are faced with this increasing rate. Now, what many people didn\'t know and what seems to me to be so perverse is that, when you first get that new notice that your rate has doubled -- which is going to happen to a lot of people in New Hampshire in the next year, because of the mortgages they already have -- a lot of people say, ""Oh, my goodness, let\'s try to start paying down the mortgage as fast as we can."" I mean, that\'s kind of part of the American ethos, you know, pay down the mortgage, get out of debt. What people don\'t realize is that if you try to pay your mortgage early while you still have the low rate, the lender slaps a huge prepayment penalty on you. So lenders are actually discouraging people from being responsible and paying off their mortgages early, because they want to increase their profits. So it\'s not surprising that loans with prepayment penalties have a 52 percent greater risk of default than those without. That\'s bad for families, and it\'s bad for the housing market, which is why I propose prohibiting all prepayment penalties on all mortgages. I think we should encourage people to pay off their mortgages early. (APPLAUSE) You know, I\'m old enough to remember, you know, mortgage-burning parties, where somebody in the neighborhood would pay off their mortgage; they owned their home free and clear. And all the neighbors would get together, and they\'d burn the mortgage documents. That was like a, you know, a great celebration. Well, we\'re not letting people do that. So we\'re going to change the way mortgage lenders operate. We also need to do more to stop lenders from trapping people in unworkable mortgages in the first place. Right now, lenders have a lot of discretion when deciding whether someone qualifies for a mortgage. In making this assessment, many lenders don\'t take into account whether a family will be able to pay property taxes and property insurance. And too many families, especially first-time homebuyers, don\'t know to budget for these expenses. But once they\'re locked into the mortgage and tax time rolls around, they experience payment shock and suddenly realize they may be in over their heads. That\'s why I propose requiring lenders to take into account their borrowers\' ability to pay property taxes and insurance fees when deciding whether to make that loan in the first place. The requirement would apply to all high-risk mortgage products. These costs for property taxes, insurance, you know are a huge part of what you have to be able to put aside to pay for when you own a home. And lenders say, ""Well, that shouldn\'t be our responsibility,"" but I think it is, because if they go after first- time homebuyers, they ought to be willing and we\'ll require them to be more helpful. Now, I\'ve been talking about how to keep people from getting trapped in unaffordable mortgages in the first place, and that\'s critical. But we also have to do more to help people stay on track and avoid foreclosure once they have their mortgages. And that\'s the third part of my plan. Back in March, when I spoke about sub-prime mortgages, I called for a foreclosure timeout. And we can\'t, you know, make that happen yet, because we don\'t have any legal tools certainly, but we certainly can talk about it, and we can try to persuade the Fed and others to encourage the lenders to think more creatively about how to have a foreclosure timeout: helping people refinance loans, helping people pay a lower rate for longer, doing things that will avoid this cascade of home losses. I propose we expand the role also played by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered and -backed institutions that do so much with homeownership. They should have to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure. They are supported by the federal government. That is a public service that they should be required to perform. They do an excellent... (APPLAUSE) They do an excellent job in helping to provide reasonably priced mortgages for Americans, and they have a lot of foreclosure prevention programs. But we have to expand them, because the numbers of people facing foreclosures are going up exponentially. And I think we should also have a billion-dollar fund in the federal government to support state programs that help at-risk borrowers avoid foreclosure. Now, several states, including New York, have included rescue funds to assist people who are on the brink of foreclosure, people who have often nowhere else to turn and are terrified of losing everything they have. Such a program could help Christie\'s family. You know, her husband did get a new job, paying in the six figures. He will be back on his feet, after having had his job outsourced. If somebody would take the time to sit down and help them and maybe talk to the bank, they will be able to get back into paying for the mortgage on their home. So we need people who are playing that role. Now, this is not easy to implement. Chicago actually tried to have face-to-face counseling and support for people, both before they bought and during the homeownership period. And there was a massive outcry by the lenders and the brokers. So, again, this sounds so common-sensical, but we have to, you know, get together and work to get it passed in order to make it happen, or get Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to also step up and do this on their own, maybe with some prodding by the Federal Reserve. Fourth and finally, we need to make a national commitment to creating more reasonably priced housing options, so people don\'t have to resort to risky or unworkable mortgages in the first place. You know, really, the mortgage issue is partially an affordable- housing issue. Even with recent declines, real estate prices are still quite high, and families are committing more and more of their incomes to mortgage payments. Between 2001 and 2004, the number of households devoting more than half of their incomes to housing increased by 1.9 million. Think about that: half of more of your income going to support your housing. Some families forgo basic necessities to pay mortgages. Others just forgo homeownership in the first place or turn to risky mortgages. I think we should have another $1 billion committed by the federal government over five years to help state, county and municipal governments build and rehabilitate affordable housing across America. Now, that, in and of itself, would not... (APPLAUSE) ... you know, would not do it, but it would incentivize others to do it. We have an affordable-housing crisis. And it is all over the country. It started in high-cost areas, but now it is spreading. We don\'t have enough affordable rental units, and we don\'t have enough affordable homes. There are some good examples across America. There are already, in many states and localities, trust funds in place to help people get into affordable housing. And guess what? That also creates new jobs. So it really is a win-win. And it\'s time the federal government supported these state and local housing trust funds. We also need to look more generally at infrastructure. And I\'ll be back in New Hampshire tomorrow to talk about what we need to do concerning infrastructure. Because, of course, with the collapse of the bridge in Minneapolis, now everybody\'s talking about it. You know, some of us have been talking about it a long time. Our bridges, our tunnels, our roads, our mass transit, our ports, our airports are woefully underinvested in as a nation. (APPLAUSE) And we just have to get serious again, as Americans, that we want to remain the leader in the world. We want to have our children, like these beautiful children here, feeling that, when they grow up, America will be there for them, just as America was there for us; that there will be opportunities to work and to raise a family and to have a home. And, you know, we want to continue to be the strongest, safest, smartest, richest country in the world, don\'t we? Well, you\'ve got to make investments in order to make that happen. (APPLAUSE) You know, together, my proposals and others that people are putting forth can help curb the abuses that have contributed to the problems we face today. And we can assist people facing foreclosures, we can create more affordable housing and protect the American dream of homeownership. Because we know that\'s about more than financial security. It is about laying roots deep in a community. It\'s about knowing who your neighbors are. It\'s about knowing where your kids go to school. It\'s about having that sense of belonging and community. And that\'s what I believe in. You know, my late father, who was in the Navy for five years, and when he came out he wanted to start a small business and start a family. And so, he -- you know, we lived in an apartment when I was born, but for him and my mother it was all about having a home. So he paid for a brick home that, you know, when I was little looked like a castle. When I see it today, it\'s not as big as I remember it, but it was certainly big enough for my parents and my bothers and me. And back in 1975, Bill and I were living in Arkansas and teaching at the law school. And as I\'ve written about in my autobiography, I was trying to decide whether or not to get married. And it was, you know, one day ""yes,"" one day ""maybe,"" back and forth. And one day, we drove by a little red brick house with a for-sale sign in front of it. And I casually remarked, ""That was a really sweet-looking house."" That is literally all I said. Then I went away for a few weeks and came back to start teaching again at the university law school, and Bill picked me up at the airport, and he said, ""Do you remember that house that you liked?"" I couldn\'t remember. And he said, ""Well, I bought it."" (LAUGHTER) So he said, ""Now we have to get married."" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) So actually we did, in the house. (APPLAUSE) And it\'s hard to believe it cost $21,000. And, you know, we thought, again, it was just the most wonderful house. You know, the kitchen needed a lot of work, and it was, you know, a little bit funky in many ways. But nevertheless, we were married in our living room, surrounded by our closest friends and family. And that home meant the world to us. It was where we started our life together. It\'s where we did celebrate, as Christie said, birthdays and holidays and where we hosted our family and friends. Every family should have that same opportunity. That is what America stands for. And... (APPLAUSE) ... I hope that I can earn your vote to become the president who will once again stand up for an economy that works for everyone and stand up for homeownership. And let me end where I started. If you have any ideas about how to help Christie and her family, I hope you will. You know, it\'s heartbreaking to me that our system operates so well for so many in so many different ways. We have the greatest economy in the world. It\'s dynamic, it\'s complex. But it\'s not working the way it needs to right now for too many. And therefore, we\'ve got to figure out how we\'re going to help each other until we finally once again have a president who doesn\'t think his only job is helping those who are already rich get even richer. (APPLAUSE) Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE)'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 8, 2007",b'Remarks on Infrastructure',"b'I\'m honored to have the keychain  actually the keychain is pretty useful. I will be a proud user of that. And I\'m very grateful to the Mayor and I appreciated his comments because I think what he said really set the stage for what I want to talk to you about this morning. It is a problem that has literally affected our entire countryOf course we were watching the news this past week with a heavy heart at the sight of that broken bridge and those submerged cars and the grieving families and the heroic rescue and recovery efforts that are still ongoing. And I know that our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was touched by this terrible accident. There may be nothing that we individually can do to try ease the pain and the difficulties that the bridge collapsing has caused the people of the Twin Cities area, but there is a great deal we can do as a nation to ensure that accidents like that don\'t happen in New Hampshire and across America. This is a real wake up call. And over the last two years the Mississippi River, that great river that goes down the middle of our country, first at its mouth, has reminded us of the importance of infrastructure with the collapse of the levies during Katrina, and now at the near beginnings of the river, we\'ve been reminded once again  we face an infrastructure crisis. I\'ve been talking about and worrying about and working on infrastructure as a Senator from New York for the past six and half years. It\'s not a subject that usually gets headlines. People know we have problems, but there\'s always something that seems more pressing for us to deal with. And as the Mayor was so rightly saying, there are problems right here in Rochester, there are problems throughout the state like there are in every other state. But unless it\'s a crisis, we don\'t really pay attention. Well my point today is  it is a crisis. It\'s a silent crisis. It\'s a crisis with the potential of not only death and injury, property loss and other kinds of dangers and inconveniences, but it is imperative that we address this crisis for our economy and for the kind country we want to be in the 21st Century. Every day, millions of Americans inch their way through bumper-to-bumper traffic. They drive over structurally deficient bridges. Millions board buses and subways which the federal Department of Transportation has deemed poor, substandard, or merely adequate. We get water from aging water pipes  some of the pipes in New York are over 100 years old, and because of the leaks the inevitably come from corrosion and other problems, they waste a billion, a billion and more gallons of water each month. They potentially expose our water  and I have to say New York City is consistently ranked among the very best in public water, so New York City does a great job. But any water system that has been there a long time, or hasn\'t been maintained, has the potential of exposing us to chemicals and toxins. And every single hour, our goods are shipped on under-serviced, overburdened railways. We\'ve had a rash of railway accidents in New York that I have followed very closely and worked both with the state and with the railroad companies to try and remedy. But derailments are becoming more and more common. Goods travel through unprotected, overcrowded seaports or through waterways filled with broken locks. And we know all too well that the results can be tragic. Not only bridge collapse in Minneapolis and the levies collapse in New Orleans, but the collapse of the Big Dig tunnel ceiling, and the highway overpass that collapsed last week in California. This is a wake up call that is screaming. It\'s like when you have an alarm clock and it gets increasingly louder because we don\'t want to hear it or we hit it because we want to get a few more minutes of sleep. Well we\'ve been asleep. And certainly what happened with Katrina  which was a natural disaster that turned into a national disgrace and became international embarrassment and cost nearly 1,700 of our fellow citizens their lives, was the loudest of all wake up all calls. And keep in mind, the bridge in Minnesota, that the Mayor use to live near, was one of nearly 600,000 bridges across America -- more than 60,000 of those bridges are in need of serious repair. Something is very wrong when, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, in the richest country on earth, people are actually nervous about driving over bridges for fear that they might collapse. Or they\'re worried that their levees might burst, or their highways might buckle. And the degradation of our infrastructure isn\'t just a serious threat to our families\' safety  it is a threat to our homeland security as well. More than five years after 9/11, we still have not secured our borders, our railways, our mass transit systems, our ports, our chemical plants, our nuclear facilities and more. And in addition, if we needed even more arguments about why we should act, in addition to threatening our safety and our homeland security  the problems with our infrastructure are also a grave threat to our economy. Did you know that those hours we spend sitting in traffic cost as much as $170 billion a year in wasted time, fuel, productivity and damage to our environment? Those railroads carry half of all freight not carried by air. Those waterways carry roughly one-sixth of our inter-city freight. And those seaports are our gateway to international trade. When there are shutdowns or delays or a lack of capacity, America\'s businesses and workers pay the price. We don\'t always think about this, but I was listening to an NPR report about the consequences of the collapse in Minneapolis and there was a man who owned a trucking firm and he said the price of everything is going to rise. Because we\'re going to spend more on fuel, because we have to take detours, and they began to talk about things we don\'t think about as consequences to the cost of the living and to the economy. In short, we\'re trying to run today\'s economy on yesterday\'s infrastructure  and we\'re jeopardizing tomorrow\'s prosperity. It\'s like trying to run a company today with typewriters, or mimeograph machines or rotary phones. If you\'re lucky, you might break even  but you sure don\'t expect to break much of a profit. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our dams a D, our power grid a D, our drinking water systems a D-, our roads a D. I have to ask, do you really think America is really a country that is satisfied with Ds on our report card when it comes to infrastructure? That\'s not the country I us grew up in, that\'s not the country I was raised to believe in and it\'s certainly not the country we want for our children. Here in America, we\'ve never been content to sit back and make do with what worked for our parents and grandparents and our great-grandparents. When we\'ve caught a glimpse of a new frontier  we\'ve built the infrastructure to reach it. When we\'ve discovered new opportunities  we\'ve built the infrastructure to seize them. In America, our infrastructure has always been the engine of our aspirations. Think back to the early 1800s. I just visited the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. It was started in 1800 as many of you know. Think about the audacity of this new country deciding they were going to build this shipyard. And they kept at it now for 207 years. Think about early 1800s in New York, when the Governor of New York  who happened to be named Clinton  I like that too  persuaded the state legislature to construct a 363 mile canal connecting New York City to the West. Now you can imagine that we had a lot of naysayers in the 1800s just like we do today  why are we building it, it costs too much money, it\'ll never work. If fact, the naysayers deemed the project ""Clinton\'s ditch."" But here is what Governor Clinton said, ""The city will, in the course of time, become the granary of the world, the emporium of commerce, the seat of manufactures, the focus of great moneyed operations."" And he was right. Fifteen years later, the Erie Canal had made New York City America\'s busiest port. Think about President Lincoln, who decided to build the transcontinental railroad in the midst of the Civil War. While he struggled to hold North and South together, he has the vision to lay the groundwork to connect East and West. The completion of the railroad reduced coast-to-coast travel time from months to just a week  and settlers flocked to the new frontier. Or think about President Eisenhower and his belief that, ""Our unity as a nation is sustained by free communication of thought and by easy transportation of people and goods."" Today, we\'re still reaping the economic benefits of the interstate highway system he championed. Now, these leaders and so many others understood that expanding our infrastructure was the key to expanding our economy. They knew we could start all the companies, and manufacture all the products, and grow all the food we wanted  but if we couldn\'t get the goods to the customers  if we couldn\'t get the workers to the jobs  the economy would never flourish. And today, that same understanding extends to everything we need to do in both our physical infrastructure and our virtual infrastructure, like expanding broadband the critical worldwide infrastructure of the modern global economy. Now, we also know that investing in infrastructure creates jobs. The estimates are pretty reliable. For every $1 billion spent on fixing crumbling infrastructure creates nearly 48,000 jobs. But instead of investing in the infrastructure of the future and growing our economy, we continue to make do. We patch and repair. We ignore the advice of our engineers, economists, businesses, unions, community leaders. We try to build our children\'s future with our grandparents\' infrastructure. And we are falling further and further behind. We don\'t need any more warnings. We don\'t need any more wakeup calls. It is time to stop wringing our hands  and start rolling up our sleeves and rebuild America. It\'s time to stop asking how we can afford to fix our infrastructure  and start asking how we can afford not to. It\'s time to ask ourselves, what if we could shave minutes  even hours  off our commutes? What if we could shave hours  even days  off our shipping times? What if our ports could send and receive tons of additional goods each week, safely? What if we had public transit system and a rail system that dramatically reduced our reliance on foreign oil, and our carbon dioxide emissions, and our smog and air pollution? Well, I\'m here today because I believe we can do all of these things. I consider myself a modern American progressive. And in the spirit of those early progressives  who were Republicans as well as Democrats, who I think put country before party, who made commitments to bring us together and work side by side  I think we can do this. And that\'s why I have been working as a Senator and why I think it\'s imperative to make this a priority for my presidency. You know I\'ve co-sponsored, on a bipartisan, the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2006 with my colleague, Senator Voinovich from Ohio. This Act, because we couldn\'t get the kind of program we wanted, we set up a commission to ensure we got the data that would provide the basis for Congress asking, with a new president who actually cared about our infrastructure. We want to know, can our infrastructure sustain economic growth for the twenty-first century? We don\'t think so. How do we get adequate funding? Obviously that\'s big unanswered question. How do we develop comprehensive recommendations  that instead of divvying up the money on political pork barrel spending, we do it on the basis of a real plan for America. This legislation has passed the Senate, I\'m hopeful that it will pass the House and I\'m hopeful the President will sign it because that will give me the basis for what I want to do as president. I want to set big goals as your president. Big goals, like universal health care, quality, affordable healthcare. I want to set a triple goal of moving us toward energy security and independence, dealing with global warming, and creating lots of jobs from dealing with energy and global warming. I want to end the Iraq war and bring that money home. And in addition to all the other goals on education, and stem cell research and reforming our government, I want to make modernizing our nation\'s infrastructure, as the backbone of our prosperity, one of my goals as well. You know, every generation faces tough challenges and they require tough choices. We talk about the Greatest Generation of my father, my late father, because they survived the Depression, they fought and kept our country going during World War II, and they deserve our thanks. But at the very same time they were making commitments to a country that they believed in. And we have to ask ourselves, what commitments have we made? What have we done to sacrifice and share a burden that I think should be the responsibility of each American generation? The reality is that with what we\'ve seen in Minneapolis and New Orleans it\'s hard to answer that question. That is why I\'m going to challenge us, our generation and all of American, to stand up and fix our country - to rebuild the failing infrastructure of the 20th century while we build the new digital and energy infrastructure of the 21st century. It\'s going to take serious resources and a serious national commitment. It\'s going to take a national partnership among all levels of government and between the public and the private sector. It requires a smart, comprehensive plan. And it requires that we deal not only with repairing and expanding our infrastructure, but solving the problems that are created by infrastructure  you know, congestion, urban sprawl, environmental degradation. And that is what I want to talk with you about. My Rebuild America Plan  which will create millions of good new jobs, elevate our standard of living, and enhance our ability to compete in the world marketplace. I start with three emergency initiatives to help states and localities immediately review and repair critical infrastructure. And we\'ve got to have the federal government at the table. I think we should provide $250 million in ""Emergency Assessment Grants"" so that state cans pull together the information that is there, conduct any new assessments and inspections that they need to and give grants to prioritize what things they have to do and in what order. You know if everything\'s a priority, nothing gets done. If you set priorities, you can begin to assess them right away. At the same time, I\'ll invest $10 billion over ten years in an ""Emergency Repair Fund"" to begin addressing the extensive backlog of emergency infrastructure repairs. Right now, 13% of our bridges are ""functionally obsolete"" -- meaning that they don\'t meet current transportation standards, they could go any time. Another 12% are ""structurally deficient""  including that bridge in Minnesota  meaning they\'re deteriorating and losing the capacity to sustain their loads. Right here in New Hampshire, 446 of the 3,699 non-covered state and local bridges are on the ""red list."" That means they\'re bridges of greatest concern. That includes the Memorial Bridge, which I just saw for myself today. In addition, today, nearly half the locks on our waterways are obsolete  that\'s a figure that if we do nothing could rise to 80% within the next 15 years. It\'s time that the federal commitment stepped up and addressed these deficiencies. Now, states are already spending money on these projects. The federal government is also, but together, we\'re not spending enough. My fund will supplement what they\'re already doing. We know states, as the Mayor alluded to, sometimes put off even starting certain repairs because they don\'t know where the money will come from to finish the repairs. One of the problems with the federal government is that we don\'t have a capital budget. That means we don\'t budget smartly for long-term capital projects. If you\'re going to fix the levees in New Orleans you\'ve got know that\'s going to take a couple of years. If you\'re going to fix a lot of our infrastructure that\'s an investment you don\'t get done in one year but the way that our federal budget runs, we budget every year. And that is just a really foolish way if you\'re talking about getting the biggest return on your dollar. That\'s something that I will raise with the Congress. We\'ve tried it before. They aren\'t likely to respond very favorably because every year they get to make these decisions but we need a capital budget. That would help us set priorities for some very big projects and then see them through. I also believe it would save us money. Because if we could actually plan for three to five years, we would have a much better way of controlling costs. So I hope that we\'ll consider that. But, my Emergency Repair Fund will give states the predictability to get certain projects underway and then we can allocate over time and people shouldn\'t have to worry about that. We also need to upgrade the standards. That\'s why National Academy of Engineering and the National Institute of Standards and Technology will be the institutions I ask to give me answers to two critical questions. One: I want them to review the safety certification process and standards currently in place. Those standards may not be rigorous enough for heavy trucks or for increased traffic. You know when some of these bridges were built in the 1960s the projections for traffic and weight on them didn\'t take into account what are now doing, 40 or 50 years later. Two: We\'ve got to set that priority list. And I want an independent group to do that. My second point in my plan to rebuild America involves investing an additional $1 billion in our intercity passenger rail system, which carries 23 million passengers a year, links more than 500 communities, connects communities with airports, city bus systems, providing additional convenience for passengers. And with gas price very unpredictable and traffic worse than ever, airline travel riddled with overbooking, overcrowding and delays  train travel is actually becoming increasingly appealing. But there\'s very little federal funding for these rail systems. They treat them as primarily a state responsibility and I think that\'s the wrong approach. Train travel protects our environment. It reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps alleviate congestion. One of the reasons that some of the Asian countries and some of the European countries are really make progress against us economically is that they have heavy investments in trains. And those trains are high-speed trains. They move quickly both people and goods and this should be a national priority. Third, I think we also need to more to build up our intra-city transportation systems  the subways and buses that comprise our public transit systems. In 2006, Americans took more than 10 billion trips on local public transportation. And those systems serve as a lifeline for so many low and middle-income Americans and for many senior citizens who are no longer able to drive. Public transportation is also one of the best strategies for protecting the environment. Believe it or not, emissions from road vehicles accounted for more than 50% of air pollution in America. If we just increased our public transportation from 5% to 10%, we\'d reduce our reliance on foreign oil by roughly 40%, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25%, and reduce smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions by about one third. But despite the benefits of public transit, today, 84% of public transit spending goes toward maintaining existing capacity  only just 16% toward expanding our systems. I want to change that ratio. So I want to increase federal funding for public transit by $1.5 billion a year. I want to get those funds to communities committed to using them effectively  communities committed to avoiding sprawl by locating homes, jobs and stores nearby, reducing the need for unnecessary car trips. Over the next 25 years, many of the buildings in which we live, work, and shop will be built or rebuilt. So today, we have a unique opportunity to encourage sustainable development. Fourth, I want to work with state and local governments and the private sector to create a national policy to modernize our seaports. You know this is something sort of out of sight of mind. If you\'re not in a coastal state like New Hampshire or New York, you don\'t think about seaports as much as we should. Twenty six percent of our Gross Domestic Product  and a growing share goes through our seaports. 1980, United States ports handled just 8 million containers  by 2006, it was up to 40 million. By 2020 we expect it to be 120 million. The ports simply are just not keeping up. Many are running out of space. They are plagued by navigation channels that are too narrow, or harbors that are too shallow to accommodate larger ships. They don\'t have modern technology including, homeland security technology, yet there is not one, single federal agency responsible for our ports. So while ports are of national economic significance, responsibility for port funding has fallen primarily to state and local governments. That\'s why, we need to bring out ports into the 21st Century and work with our state and local governments, but have the federal government provide support to upgrade technology, expand capacity and reduce congestion. Fifth, I will want to make it a national priority to confront the growing national problem of congestion. You know, right now, traffic has pretty much taken its place alongside death and taxes as one of those things you just can\'t avoid. And between 1993 and 2003, the amount of time Americans spent in traffic delays increased more than 50%  and gallons of fuel wasted increased nearly 80%. If current trends continue, by 2013, moderately dense areas will experience the same kind of traffic problems we see in gridlock in New York City or Chicago or LA. And the rise of communities that are further and further away means longer commutes. And when you think about wit the Internet we need to be figuring out how to promote more telecommuting. I think we should of course increase what we do to be smart about congestion, but why can\'t we be smart about giving more people the opportunity to work from home? Especially mothers who are balancing family and work  because right now we have good evidence that it\'s actually good for productivity but there\'s a reluctance to do it. That\'s true in government, that\'s true in the private sector and I think we need to support initiatives that promote telecommuting. Maybe not five days a week, maybe three days a week but anything we can do to try to limit the traffic congestion actually increases productivity and helps our environment. I think that when we look at technology we don\'t realize that today we can collect real-time information on road and travel conditions and we can actually detect traffic density and adjust their traffic signals and post the information on electronic road signs to warn drivers of congestion ahead. We can have more efficient electronic toll systems, and make sure that we have a good camera system high-traffic areas to monitor accidents and speed the deployment of ambulances and tow trucks. San Diego even has reversible toll lanes, so when traffic is much heavier in one direction than another, they can reverse a lane and ease the congestion. So let\'s use technology as our friend to get us out of these traffic jams that so many of us experience. And sixth, we need to make a serious commitment to modernizing our electric power system. The average power generating station in our country was built in the 1960s. Today, interruptions  some of which are big enough that they really shut everything done, some of which are just sporadic and happen in certain areas  but interruption in our supply of electricity cost us roughly $150 billion a year. And yet, the electric industry devotes fewer dollars to research and development than the dog food industry. We had a brown out in Queens. No body could figure what had happened. And it really interfered with a lot of people who lived in apartments with no operating elevator once the electricity went out. It really put a great burden on a lot of elderly people. A lot of small businesses lost refrigeration  floral shops, ice cream shops. And I went to visit some of my constituents to figure out what we were going to do about it and I was standing outside of a little restaurant that has lost thousands of dollars worth of food because of the shut down, and a gentleman came up to me and introduced himself. And he said to me, Senator, I am from India. I never thought I would move to the United States and see electricity disruptions. And it really struck me. Because we think of ourselves of being so far advanced of any other country, and yet we\'re not keeping that advantage. I think we can do better. That\'s why I sponsored the Electric Reliability Act which has been signed into law, helping to give our federal government more authority to make our electricity system more reliable. This is a disaster waiting to happen. We\'ve got an outdated grid. An outdated transmission and distribution system. Nobody is responsible for investing in it and it is the lifeblood of how we power our economy. Seventh, we need to dramatically increase our investments in broadband deployment. Back in 2001, America was fourth in the world in broadband access. Today, we\'re 25th. Other countries are investing heavily in broadband to connect up their entire country. And I\'ve have seen the power of broadband firsthand. In New York, we started a program where we brought together leaders from the business, non-profit, university, banking, and computer technology communities  including E-Bay -- to give local businesses the capital and technical assistance they needed to expand onto the Internet. I did this because, any of you who have been up in the Adirondacks up in northern New York know how beautiful it is, but we have a lot people who can\'t make a very good living because they don\'t have big market for their goods. And so we worked to put them on E-Bay and we proved that we could take somebody who was making fishing rods in northern New York, or making soap, and give them a global market place. Now, I believe in markets  100%. Markets are one of the great advantages we have for making our economy dynamic. But when the market isn\'t working  when the companies are not wiring certain areas  either underserved urban areas or underserved rural areas - then the federal government has to step in with planning grants, and equipment grants, and tax incentives. That\'s what we had here with electricity. Utilities didn\'t think it was possible to extend electricity to certain parts of our country. And so the federal government had to step in. And I think if we focus on expanding broadband and I\'ve recently called for an innovation agenda to support state and local communities to expand and develop broadband, then we know we can make progress because information highways are to the 21st what canals and railroads were to the 19th century and interstate highways in the 20th. Eighth, and finally, we don\'t just need to build the broadband and electrical infrastructure of the 21st century  we need to build the clean energy infrastructure as well. That\'s why I\'ve proposed creating a ""Green Buildings Fund""  a $1 billion investment in grants and low interest loans to states to improve energy efficiency in buildings. It\'ll help us cut pollution, combat climate change, and create thousands of jobs  what we can call ""green collar jobs."" I\'ve sponsored legislation with my colleague, Senator Sanders of Vermont, because we want to train people to do these jobs. Investing in energy efficient infrastructure is one of the cheapest, cleanest, fastest ways we know to cut energy use and reduce emissions. In fact, the Department of Energy estimates that energy efficiency along, could cut national energy use by 20 percent in 20 years. It\'s a no-brainer  which is slightly higher standard than the current one we have Washington. This is an issue whose time has come. And I\'m proud to co-sponsor Senator Dodd and Senator Hagel\'s National Infrastructure Bank Act that we just introduced to establish a federally-backed independent bank that will evaluate and finance large infrastructure projects by subsidies, loan guarantees, and bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. That\'s what our competitors are doing. They are on the march. You know Japan, and China, and even India, and certainly Europe, they are making progress and we are treading water and being swept backwards. Now, will all this be easy? Of course not. But I believe that it is imperative and it is truly one of the challenges that it is going to determine whether we\'re up to the task of remaining a great nation with the strongest middle class in the history of the world, and a rising standard of living and quality of life. I have faith that we will answer the call. A country that dug a 363 mile canal, by hand with only the help of mules that built a railroad from one coast to the other  that connected communities across America with more than 45,000 miles of highway  that sent a man to the moon  that\'s who we are as Americans. You know, one of the most discouraging aspects of the Bush-Cheney Administration is the way they have talked down America. They have been fatalistic. I reject that out of hand. We can do whatever we set our minds to. We can roll up our sleeves. We can be problem solvers again. And I have faith that we will answer that call. With your help we will rebuild America Thank you very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 15, 2007","b'Remarks in Waukee, Iowa on Long-Term Care Insurance'","b'Thank you, thank you all so much, and I would like to thank Becky for being here and for chairing the democratic party in Dallas County, its was wonderful Becky, thank you so much.We have a full house, some of you know, we were originally planning to do this in a slightly smaller setting, so there are one or two chairs left, but not very many, there are a couple up here for people standing in the back. I see three here, it is not like church where we are going to call you forward, we want to try to give you a char to sit in. I am thrilled to be here and there are a number of people who are with is that I would like to recognize starting with my great friends and your former governor and first lady Tom and Christie Vilsack who are here. Another great friend of mine who has been active in Iowa and active on so many issues in Washington for so many years on your behalf is Ruth Harkin, Senator Tom Harkin\'s wife. I want to welcome the mayor, Mayor Peard, thank you very much for being here; I really appreciate you coming, I saw the State Senator, Staci Apple come in, thank you so much Staci for coming, and in a few minutes I\'m going to introduce you to our very, very special guests who will talk about their own experiences concerning some of the issues that I want to raise today. So you will be hearing in a moment from Pat Twerpy, and Mary Rose Brown, and I am very happy they are here because what they will talk about are issues that are affecting seniors and their families. But I want to start this morning by asking a few questions: How many of you are caring for an aging relative or know someone who is? You can raise your hand. And how many of you have every worried about whether social security and Medicare will still exist when your children and your children and your grandchildren may need it. I think every hand went up on that one How many of you do not want to be a burden on your children either emotionally or financially when you retire or if you have already retired. Yea lots of hands, my mother is 88 and let me tell you that is how she feels. Now, I know that behind me we have got, you know ready to change, and ready to lead. Well I think we\'re ready for changes when it comes to helping take care of our seniors but to recognize, as all of the hands just did, that we are not talking only about issues that effect seniors these are family issues. These are issues that effect all generations together. There\'re really American issues and we\'ve had in the past leader who have called on us as a nation to make smart choices about what needs to be done. Yesterday I was in Dubuque talking about some of the issues that I think are important on this campaign and I mention that it was 72 years ago yesterday, that president Roosevelt singed the social security act. And when he signed the social security act he made it very clear that it was just a corner stone in a structure that was being built, but was by no means complete. And certainly President Johnson 30 years later knew that we had to do something in order to help, seniors who didn\'t have the resources, as they aged to be able to deal with the health problems that do come, the older you get. You know that old story, the good news is, that you wake up in the morning, and the good news is you know that because you hurt everywhere. And so I think everybody knows as we get a little older, and things start to break down a little and you need some more help. And so President Johnson recognized that and when he signed the Medicare bill, he said no longer will this nation refuse to hand the justice to those who have given a lifetime of service, and wisdom, and labor, to the progress of this progressive country. Well I consider myself a modern progressive. I am proud of all of the progress, we\'ve made as a nation. But it didn\'t happen by accident, I didn\'t happen by wishing for it, it happened because people came together, and worked to achieve them. And sometimes over great odds, to reach what we saw as goals for our county. Well today we face a new set of challenges. In part because of the very success of programs like social security and Medicare. The good news is, we are living longer, and we are living healthier lives. But we still have to figure out, how we are going to get our system to catch up, with what is the reality of life today. Long term costs already consume 40 percent of what we spent on Medicaid, and is estimated by 2040, that\'s going to grow by more than 250 percent. The average cost of a private room in a nursing home today is more than 70,000 dollars a year. The average hourly rate for home health aids has gone up 13 percent over this past year. Medicare also faces significant financial challenges they are driven by the spiraling cost of health care. And unfortunately we are not addressing any of these issues and planning for the future. Our current president hasn\'t called on us to make a national commitment to saving social security and Medicare and in fact he\'s tried to privatize social security and instead of focusing on Medicare he has given tax cuts to billionaires and contracts to companies like Halliburton and his answer to the prescription drug needs of our seniors is a plan that takes a PHD in bureaucracy to figure out and as you\'ll hear in a minute, it is not working for a lot of people, Medicare part D. Now this is all consistent with how this president sees our country. He wants to leave everything up to the individual. He believes in the ""you\'re on your own"" society. And if you look at you\'re on your own and you take the first letters, that\'s the yo-yo society. (Applause, describes the up and down) Well I think its time that we talked about and confronted a lot of these issues because for too many people, its like they\'re invisible to the president, we don\'t see what\'s happening in the lives of people here in Iowa, and across the country from this White House, and I think that\'s outrageous because so many people have worked hard their entire lives and they realize they cant afford to retire. I was in Las Vegas two days ago, and I was in a super market, and I was shaking hands with everybody working in the super market, and I met a man, and he looked to be elderly. He looked to be probably in his 80\'s, but ha had a staff badge on, so I greeted him, and I said, ""Are you working here?"" He said ""I have to; I don\'t have enough money for my wife and me to live on."" So what do they have you do? He said, ""well you know I kind of help around and greet people and try to guide people to where they need to go but I don\'t know what I would do if they didn\'t give me a job. In his 80\'s If you\'re a senior who has diligently paid your long term care insurance premiums for years, only to have the insurance companies turn around and deny you benefits because of some technicality buried in the fine print of your policy, well you\'re invisible to. And if you are a mother or father trying to raise your children and care for your aging relatives you\'re at your wits end trying to juggle it all. And you are invisible as well. And if you are that grandmother or grandfather struggling to make ends meet and heartsick at the thought of burdening your children and your grandchildren, it turns out you are invisible as well. Well I want you to know that you are not invisible to me. And you certainly are not going to be invisible to the next president of the United States. Because when we take back the White House, we are going to start seeing our fellow Americans again. (Applause) I have a very different vision of our country; it\'s more in line with Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, than George W. Bush. Because I reject the idea of a ""on your own"" society, the yo-yo society, I think it is far better if it\'s a we\'re ""all in this together society"" where we\'re helping each other. You know, I wrote a book called it takes a village to raise a child; well it also takes a Village to care for your aging relatives. You need these people to be there for you, to back you up. To provide some respite care and we\'re going to try and create support for people to do the most important work any of us will ever do and that\'s taking care of each other. Whether it\'s our children, or our parents, or our spouses. I don\'t think long term care is a burden, I think it is a fundamental obligation. And I think if we work hard together, we can get policy that will help us all do what we should do as members of families. First, when I am president, I am going to take immediate steps, to address the growing problem of fraud and abuse committed against our seniors. And I am going to start with the long term care market. You know in recent years, millions of Americans have done what they thought was the right thing. They have done out and they have purchased long term care insurance policies, they see the adds on TV, they get the phone calls at home, you know, they are talking for their neighbors, maybe a church somewhere people are saying, we got to prepare for the future, so guess what, millions of American have done that, including 128,000 right here in Iowa. And they though they were being responsible, that if they ever needed long term care, it was paid for. Only to find out when they actually needed the coverage the company denied it for no good reason. Or they increase the premiums, or they withheld payments for months and even though people have been paying the premiums for years, they were stuck with the bill. Now the bill can run into 10\'s of thousands of dollars pretty quick. And many of you probably read the heartbreaking series in the des Moines Register over the last week or two and it describes what the means for families here in Iowa. Well, I became concerned about this, and back in march I wrote a letter to the government accountability office demanding an investigation into these practices, what was going on. Because I was starting to hear these long term care policies are kind of new so it\'s only now that people are really starting to try and collect on them and get the help that they need from them. So in my office in New York, and people around the country are starting to hear these stories and I want to know what is really gong on. Now as president, I will require all insurance companies that benefit from federal tax advantages or that want to market their products, through the federal employees\' health benefit plan, which is all of them, they\'re going to have to meet new consumer protection standards. That will be the fastest way to begin to regulate this market, because the federal employees\' health benefit program covers 9 million federal employees to compete for the business. So if they want to compete for the federal employees business, as well as Mary Rose\'s or Pat\'s business, they are going to have to meet standards that will protect against fraud and abuse. They\'re going to have to disclose their average rate increases over the past 10 years so that seniors know which companies inflate their prices. We are going to put all of that in an easily accessible format, so that people can get the information they need before they make a choice. We\'re going to require that they put all of their fine print into easy to understand English. People are going to be able to read it, know exactly what it says, and what they are purchasing. No more hiding behind, loopholes and traps that they spring on seniors when the seniors need the help. We are going to require that insurers offer inflation protection, because many seniors don\'t realize that a nursing home facility that costs 150 dollars a day in 2007 could cost 400 dollars a day in 20 years. So we have to protect against the cost going up and let seniors know what they are buying when they actually give that check over. In addition, I will require that companies be more careful in setting their rates in the first place. So they will be less likely to hit seniors with ballooning premiums later. If a company decides it wants to increase premiums, they are going to have to put a larger share of their increases into paying claims instead of building up their profits. And I will require insurers to sit down with potential buyers and assess whether long term care coverage is really right for them, because Medicaid already covers long term care for low income Americans. I don\'t think it\'s right that some companies are tricking customers into buying double coverage which they do not need. And the way I see it, I don\'t think anybody should have to worry about some clause buried in 700 pages of fine print. Or having some insurance company make them feel that they\'re going to be secure, and when affect what they are doing is just pulling the wool over their eyes. And we are going to put an end to that. We are going to change the regulations we are going to force them and then when seniors do have to move into assisted living or long term care facilities we want to do everything we can to protect them from abuse and neglect. You know, there are thousands of professionals and paraprofessionals who are providing excellent care for our seniors every single day. But sadly, senior abuse cases are on the rise. They jumped 20 percent in the last 4 years. I co-sponsored legislation called the patient safety and abuse prevention act. We need a nation wide system of criminal background checks not only for long term care workers, but home health care workers as well. When someone comes into your home, you need to have confidence that that person will not hurt you, or rob you, or in some other way take advantage of you. But you know elderly fraud and abuse, isn\'t limited to long term care, or home health care. For many of our seniors, it\'s on the other end of their telephone line. Today, 85 percent of the victims of telemarketing fraud are over 65. Fraudsters pray on seniors, offer prizes and sweepstakes, and lotteries that lure people, into a web of deception. I have seen things in what\'s happening in the mortgage market. A lot of seniors were talked into taking out home equity loans allegedly at low interest, and the interest was raised on them. And there are seniors across our country that are in danger of losing the home that they have purchased had paid off, until they bought into a home equity scam. So it\'s not only on long-term care, we have got to send out the alarm, seniors should be extremely careful in buying anything somebody tries to sell you, over the telephone. And once someone has responded to any of these scams, their personal information is often added to a so-called ""suckers list"", which is sold to other fraudsters, making them prime targets for identity theft as well. That\'s why I\'m proposing we give seniors and other victims, the right to sue companies that misuse their personal data to perpetuate fraud. I also think, we need to have a center for telecommunications record privacy, because we\'ve got to stay ahead of the fraudsters, they are a step ahead of us. You know, it started with people calling from I think Nigeria or somewhere years ago, saying that if you just sent me money, somebody will be saved from a terrible persecution and its gotten much more sophisticated than that, so we need people to be up to date about what is going on and we need one person in the government in charge of developing a coordinated strategy to protect personal phone records. And years ago, about 4 years ago I think, I proposed legislation that you could not export people\'s private information unless they agreed to it. Because you know what happens with all these call stations, and other things that are going on in foreign countries, they have no laws protecting privacies so we\'ve got to get smarter about how we are going to protect privacy and particularly protect our seniors Second, when I am president we are going to offer a renewed commitment to social security. We have fought the president on his ill advised scheme to privatize social security, that was a terrible idea, and thankfully we beat him back and we are not going to have to face that. But the problem is that the President has two big priorities, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and the Iraq war, and he hasn\'t paid for either one of them. He has put them on the giant credit card. (Applause) And where has he gotten the money for tax cuts for the wealthy and the Iraq war? Two Sources: Borrowing from the social security trust fund, and borrowing from foreign countries like China. We have got to get back to fiscal responsibility and shore up the social security trust fund. When my husband left office in 2001, because we had a balanced budget with a surplus, the social security trust fund was totally solvent and safe until 2055. Six and a half years later with George Bush\'s reckless fiscal policies, its lost 14 years, its down to 2041. So we have to get back to fiscal responsibility and use those surpluses to shore up the social security trust fund, and I will do that. Third we have got to get seniors a real prescription drug benefit that is truly there whenever they need it. Right now, American seniors pay 35 to 55 percent more for the very same drugs that seniors in Europe and Canada pay. And some pay hundreds, some even pay thousands of dollars a month for their medication. I did not vote for the Medicare part D plan. Because I thought it was a plan for drug companies and not a plan for our seniors. [Applause] And we are going to work, to reform and change that plan. We\'re going to let our seniors through Medicare negotiate for lower prices with these drug companies, something that the bush administration has forbidden, now this makes no sense at all, why wouldn\'t you want to negotiate for a lower price if you were really on the side of seniors. You\'re on the side of drug companies, you don\'t want to negotiate for a lower price, well we\'re going to do that. We are also going to keep our fight up to allow the re-importation of American drugs back from Canada so people can by them safely. [Applause] As a lot of people have done over the years over the years. And I know, I bet there are people, we are going to hear from them in a minute, from Mary Rose, I bet there are more people here who have fallen into the so called doughnut hole under part D of the prescription drug benefit. You know, you spend more than 2500 dollars and get no help until you spend more than 5000 dollars, that just doesn\'t make any sense at all, and we are going to hear a very specific example of that. Fourth, here\'s an issue I care deeply about that nobody ever talks much about and that is we have to support the growing number of grandparents who are raising children. You know it\'s not an issue you hear much about, is it. But believe it or not four and a half million American children are living in grandparent headed households. Nearly 25,000 Of them here in Iowa. Many of these grandparents, and it is mostly grandmothers, find themselves in a very unexpected position. They are living on fixed incomes, they are not as strong and healthy as they used to be and all of a sudden they have to figure our school enrollment forms and health care and keeping up with small children again. I have been working on smoothing I call the kinship caregiver support act, its bipartisan; I introduced it several years ago to give more help to grandparents who are raising children later in life. Programs like the Muscatine community Y here in Iowa provides support groups here in Iowa provide support groups and counseling and educational seminars and recreational activates. I helped to start a housing complex in New York City for grandparents raising children so they can be safe together. They didn\'t want to life in apartments where there were people they did not want to trust with their grandchildren so it\'s all grandparents raising children and they support each other. We have to start thinking about how we are going to do more of that. And finally as President I will continue the work I started in the senate to help seniors keep their independence and live in their won homes and communities. The work starts with our caregivers. The ones who are juggling the needs of sometimes growing children and aging parents. And maybe having to work full time as well. And if everybody who is giving care stopped today it would cost 300 billion dollars to replace [cut off] This is not only the right thing to do; this is an economic service being done to care for people who cannot totally care for themselves. But just because family care giving is unpaid does not mean it doesn\'t cost. And obviously it\'s very rewarding and important but it can be exhausting and expensive. And I was proud to finally pass legislation I introduced called the lifespan respite act, to give temporary relief to those caring for their loved ones. [Cut off] I also think we should consider tax credits for individuals and caregivers, tax deductions for long term care insurance. And now there is a new phenomenon where people are banding together themselves to help buy services that they will need in order from them to stay in their own homes. So I am very hopeful that we can really focus [cut off] on the issues that seniors talk to me about. You know my 88 year old mother who has always been very independent, after my father died in 1993 she did not want to give up her home; she didn\'t want to move in with any of her children, so she held on as long as she could. But it got to be difficult driving and that\'s what really convinced her that she could no longer live on her own because she couldn\'t see well at night to drive and see needed [cut off]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 20, 2007",b'Speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars',"b'I am deeply honored to be here, and I greatly appreciate the privilege of addressing you and the invitation to do so.I couldn\'t help, as I was preparing to come here today, thinking about my late father, a World War II veteran, served as a Chief Petty Officer in the navy training young men during World War II at the Great Lakes Naval Station. I imagine he is looking down and saying ""I never thought I would see my daughter addressing the VFW"" and I\'m sure many of you didn\'t either but I am so excited to have this chance and I want to start by expressing my deepest gratitude to all of you and to the veterans you represent across our country for the service you and they have rendered to our nation. I also want to thank the Commander in Chiefthank you Gary for that very kind introduction. I want to acknowledge and congratulate your Senior Vice Commander in Chief who assume the Commander in Chief position, George Lisicki. And I want to acknowledge both the National Ladies Auxiliary President Linda Meader and Senior Vice President Virginia Carman. Because it is always true that when we send one of our very best to serve our country, particularly when they go to war, their families serve as well. And I am grateful for the service of the family members who are here today. I want to acknowledge a few of your guests and friends of mine. I know that Governor Corzine was here earlierI saw him as he was leaving. Two members of congress who do an excellent job not only for their constituents but for their country and particularly for the values and security of AmericaCongressman Emanuel Cleaver and Congressman Dennis Moore. And two old friends of mine and of yoursHershel Gober and Mary Lou Keener who have served with distinction in the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration and I am very pleased that they could be here with me. I also know you\'ll be hearing from others who are pursuing their party nominations and immediately after I conclude a friend of mine and a genuine American hero will stand here before youSenator John McCain. I want to acknowledge not only John\'s service to our country, his heroism in the face of unspeakable atrocities, but his continuing leadership. I was privileged to go to Iraq and Afghanistan with Senator McCain. He and I were in Baghdad and Fallujah and Kabul together and I have the greatest respect for him. Just like him and all of you, in America\'s darkest hours you answered the call, coming from every corner of our nation  serving every part of the world -- on beaches and in jungles, across deserts and mountains and through bullet-scarred streets. You came from different backgrounds, from all walks of life, but you served because you know that freedom is never granted  it is earned by each generation. The history of America is forged and sanctified by the men and women who loved their country enough to sacrifice their lives for it. You and your fallen comrades know that in the face of tyranny, cruelty, oppression, extremism, sometimes there is only one choice. When the world looked to America  America looked to you. And you never let her down. I know how deeply my own father cared about the young men he sent off to the South Pacific and how heartbroken he was when so many of them never returned. When he died 14 years ago I received letters and pictures from many of the men he helped to train and looking at those pictures of all those young faces reminded me of the incredible sacrifice that not only that greatest generation but every generation of Americans have made. As the poet, Archibald MacLeish, reminds us in his poem ""The Young Dead Soldiers Do Not Speak,"" those we have lost ""have a silence that speaks for them at nightThey say: We have done what we could but until it is finished it is not doneThey say: our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will mean what you make themThey say: we leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning."" How do we give those lives their meaning? How do we continue the work you started at Normandy, Guadalcanal, Chosin, Hue, Mogadishu, Sarajevo, Kandahar, Baghdad and so many other places? How, in the twenty-first century, do we preserve our democracy, protect our shores, keep our families safe, and continue to lead the world toward a better more peaceful future? Your mission says it all. Honor the dead by helping the livingthrough veteran services, community services, national security, and a strong national defense. But we have to begin with clear -eyed understanding of the new challenges and threats we face in the 21st century. From my service on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to my time as a First Lady and Senator, I have been privileged to travel to more than 80 countries representing America. Whether I was meeting in Kabul with President Karzai about the threat of the Taliban and al Qaeda, or Israeli leaders about the threat of Iran, or meeting with defense officials in Europe about shared security interests, or pressing officials in China about human rights  I have confronted the complexities of the world as it is  not as I hoped it would be. Because you have to start with what the world is today and with hope and determination and understanding move it toward what we hope it can be. But I have never lost faith in America\'s essential goodness and greatness. I believe no challenge or threat is too dangerous or difficult for us to meet. If we work together, if we have sensible policies, if we cross the partisan divide that too often substitutes for reason and come together around our shared values and a commitment to that future we want for our children and grandchildren. That\'s the American way, I believe. Throughout our history, when we\'ve faced challenges to our position in the world or threats to our security, we\'ve confronted them head on without fear, without delay, without hesitation. And that is exactly what I intend to do as president. I will start by standing up every single day for the men and women who have stood up for us: our veterans. I know all too well that unfortunately, our veterans haven\'t always felt welcomed, respected and cared for by the country they served. I think particularly about the young men of my generationVietnam veterans, many of whom felt like they returned to America, but never really came home. Well, let me be clear. Every servicemember is a hero who deserves our respect and our gratitude not just on Veterans Day or Memorial Day  but every single day. When they put on that uniform  when they make that sacrifice for our American family  then they are all of our sons and daughters, and it\'s time we started treating them that way. Unfortunately too, we are far from having a government and a system worthy of our veterans\' sacrifice. The truth is that the deplorable conditions at Walter Reed were just one symptom of a much larger problem. I have met with soldiers around our country and around the world. I have been honored to represent some of the very best as a Senator from New York. I have been often to Fort Drum in northern New York, home of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed division in the US Army. I have been to military hospitals. I have listened to the problems and concerns of our veterans and our wounded warriors and their families. Heartbreaking stories of having to confront red tape and bureaucracy after dodging sniper bullets and escaping improvised explosive devices. Stories of struggling just to get the care and treatment they need. It\'s embarrassing and it\'s disgraceful that there is one veteran, let alone scores and hundreds of them, who have such stories to tell. It\'s time we fought as hard for our troops and our veterans as all of you have fought for us going back to the beginning of our country. And that is what I\'ve tried to do as a private citizen, as First Lady, and as a Senator. I remember when I started getting letters in the White House. We have these massive correspondence unitshundreds of thousands of people write the President, write the First Lady, they even write the pets of the first family. Buddy and Socks got a lot of mail during those years. And I remember that the people working in the correspondence units started coming to me with letters that were addressed to me often from veterans or from their wives about what was happening to people who had been in the Gulf during the First Gulf War and who had come home and now were suffering from undiagnosed illnesses. And I took the letters and I went to my husband and I said ""Bill I think there\'s something happening here."" One or two or three lettersthat might be a coincidence, but dozens of letters? Where young men who could run marathons and lift weights before they went to the Gulf could hardly climb up stairs now, can\'t sleep at night. And he said, ""Look into it, find out what\'s going on."" So I worked to establish the Commission that recognized Gulf War Illness for the serious problem it was, and began to address it. I still meet some of those veterans and their families. A lot of them are still suffering but at least they feel that we are recognizing that something happened to them when they were serving us. So when I got to the Senate, I advocated for legislation to track our troops\' health before they were deployed and after they were deployed, so that we would have baseline examination. Because too many of the people who came back from the Gulf War were told that the VA or that within the DOD system that we have no evidence that you weren\'t suffering from something before you went over and I said, ""No wait. We have to make sure that we have a system to track the health of each and every person who serves us and then monitor them for illnesses."" I joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to increase military survivor benefits from $12,000 to $100,000hardly any kind of compensation for the loss of a life but a way of recognizing the needs of the families who are left behind. And I worked for four years with Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, to provide access to Tricare for National Guard and Reserve members. When I got to the Senate I\'m sure many people thought I would never talk to Lindsey Graham, let alone work with him, but I decided that we had a job to do and he in South Carolina and I in New York were seeing the same thingsthat is, our National Guard and Reserve troops were being activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, many of them were considered medically unready because they were uninsured in their private civilian lives. They worked for employers who didn\'t provide insurance, they were self employed and couldn\'t afford it, they were young and didn\'t think that they had to really worry about their health but a thorough exam found problems. So Senator Graham and I said we\'re going to make sure that if you\'re a National Guard or Reserve member, you will have access to healthcare and you\'ll be part of this great American military from the very beginning. We will take care of you and your families. I join with many of you to fight the so called Cares Commission that tried to close down so many VA hospitals. Well we fought them in New York and I\'m proud to say that we had more letters of support to keep Canandaigua hospital in upstate New York open than any other facility in the country. And we were able to keep our hospitals from Canandaigua to Manhattan. At a time when we\'re getting more returning veterans, what sense does it make to shut down facilities when people have to drive hours and wait months before they can see a doctor at a VA. We need more facilities, more outpatient, more outreach in order to help our returning veterans. Last year, I authored the Heroes at Home Act that will begin to help servicemembers struggling not only with post traumatic stress disorder but with the new signature wound of these wars, something called traumatic brain injury. I\'m fighting as hard as I can to expand my legislation which passed last year because this is taking a devastating toll on our veterans and their families. I was recently at Walter Reed and I met a young army captain. He\'d lost his right arm in an improvised explosive device attack in Baghdad. He\'d also lost his ring finger on his left hand because his wedding ring had melted into his finger. And I asked him, I said, ""well captain, how are you doing?"" He said, ""Well Senator, I\'m making progress. I\'m getting great help. The prosthetic is working. I\'m really feeling like I\'ll be able to get mobility back."" But he said, ""Senator, where do I go to get my brain back?"" He was suffering from traumatic brain injury. He said, ""You know, if it weren\'t for my wife who has moved here to be with me and who gives me a list everyday of where I have to go and what time I have to be there, I don\'t know what I would do."" He said, ""You know, Senator I went to West Point and I can\'t remember where I\'m supposed to be at 10 o\'clock or 11 o\'clock every morning."" That\'s why I have proposed providing family members the education and training they need to help their loved ones with TBI and giving them the option to become certified caretakers and paying them for providing this care for their own family members. Two weeks ago I teamed up with Senator Chris Dodd to pass legislation in the Senate to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to families of wounded warriors. This was a recommendation from the commission the president appointed headed by former Senator Bob Dole, a great American war hero and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. They said ""The Family Medical Leave Act is great but it\'s not enough."" If you\'re going to give up your job and move from the west coast to Walter Reed or somewhere else in the country to be with your loved one who\'s been injured, you need more time and you need to make sure your job is safe while you\'re there doing the most important work any of us docaring for those who care for us. When I\'m President, I will continue this work and this record. I will summon the resources and will of this nation to give our veterans the gold standard health care, earned benefits, and support they deserve. Our veterans have served America  and it is time that America served our veterans. I will start first by ensuring that my Veterans Affairs Department is on your side. And that my VA Secretary is a true veterans\' advocate who understands the problems of our veterans. I\'m not going to have a Secretary of Veterans Affairs  I\'m going to have a secretary for veterans, someone who will be qualified and committed and dedicated every single day to help our veterans. I will also work to guarantee funding for VA health. It is outrageous that veterans have to come every year to the Congress begging for the money they need to get the health care they deserve. We\'re going to work toward mandatory funding and end the yearly budgets. Health care for our veterans is not an option. It is a fundamental obligation, and we have seen what has happened the last several years. When many of us have fought for increased funding for veterans, only to be denied  and then to come back later and have to put more money in. But, how do you run a veteran\'s health care system if you don\'t know what your budget is going to be, from year to year? You can\'t make the kind of changes that we were on the road to making in the 1990\'s. Former Veteran Secretary Jesse Brown, a great American veteran, who we lost too soon, and Hershel Gober and others, had the VA headed in the right direction. We were streamlining the health care. We got the computerized medical records  there are articles being written in medical journals today which say that now the VA system takes better care of many veterans with diseases like diabetes and heart conditions than out in the public. And what did that mean? More veterans started going to the VA. I thought that was great, the administration thought it was a problem. Well I want to get back to where veterans want to go to the VA, where they feel the choice is best for them, and where we have the services readily available to take care of whatever problems any veteran might have. Secondly, I have proposed a new GI Bill of Rights for the twenty-first century  and when I\'m President, we will pass it and I will sign it into law. We\'ll have the biggest signing ceremony in the history of the White House. The original GI Bill of Rights was one of the VFW\'s signature accomplishments. It didn\'t just help a generation of veterans build their lives  it helped a generation of Americans build a thriving middle class. So I take personal pride, tremendous personal pride in the fact that the VFW has endorsed my GI Bill of Rights. And I want to pay tribute to my House sponsor, young Congressman from Pennsylvania Patrick Murphy. I met Patrick Murphy when he was a Captain in the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad in 2003 when I was there on my first trip. That was still a time when we could get out of the green zone, we went to Sadr City, and we met with members of the 82nd, one of whom was this bright young Captain named Patrick Murphy. When he left the army he decided to continue his public service in another way. He ran for, and won, a seat in Congress. So when I was thinking about what kind of Bill of Rights, a GI Bill of Rights we needed for the twenty-first century, he was one of the first calls I made  because he had lived it. And together, our bill provides educational opportunities  from college, to trade and technical training, to certification and licensing programs. It expands opportunities for veterans to buy, build, repair and improve their homes. It creates a Veterans Micro-loaning Program to provide loans up to $100,000 at very low interest rates and without collateral, so that veterans can start their own small businesses. And I appreciate your support and we are going to get it done together. Third, as President, I\'ll implement a new, seamless career transition assistance program. It will start the minute a servicemember steps back on our shores  either at a base or at a medical center. Each veteran will be provided a human resources counselor who will be responsible for his or her successful re-integration back into the civilian world. The counselor will have to track and monitor the veteran\'s progress  and if a veteran is struggling, he or she will not get lost in the weeds of the red tape and the bureaucracy, but someone will be there to help him or her get back on track. And let\'s go one step further than that. Many companies already give preference for veterans. Let\'s make that universal. Our veterans have done an extraordinary job fighting for our country  let\'s make sure they have the jobs they need and deserve right here at home. Fourth, I want to transform the bureaucracy, we have a 20th century veterans\' infrastructure and we need a 21st century system. I will do it by appointing a single, high-level experienced veteran, in the White House, reporting directly to me responsible for streamlining and coordinating all health care, educational and career programs for veterans. The reason I recommend this is because my last trip to Ft. Drum, I spoke to 50 of our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who had just came back from Afghanistan, all of whom had been wounded. The Department of Defense wasn\'t talking to the VA, the medical records at DOD didn\'t find them their way to the VA, and this made no sense to me at all. We need a single seamless system, and the way to get it done is to have someone in the White House reporting to the President, who will drive every single agency of this government to take care of every one of our veterans, the way they deserve to be taken care of. I will also ask this person to oversee what has been another disgrace, because I will devote the resources we need to process, the endless backlog, the disability and life insurance claims. I have walked through VA offices and seen stacks of papers that have not yet been processed. I think we\'ve had enough of the delays. I believe everyone should know that their government is working hard to give them what they have earned. I\'ve already sponsored legislation, calling for an independent review of denied disability claims, and assigning more lawyers and social workers to help people through the claims process. I\'ve proposed legislation to require an independent review of every single traumatic insurance claim. It\'s another thing that the soldiers at the 10th Mountain Division told me they would call to get their insurance claim processed, they wouldn\'t get a human being\'s voice, they would never get a call back  well we\'re going to end that. No one should be wrongly deprived of their earned benefits. And we\'re going to make sure when I\'m President we clean up that backlog and make it work for every single one of our veterans. And finally, finally we will end the prohibition on concurrent receipt for our disabled veterans. I\'m a proud co-sponsor of the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2007. This rule is nothing more than a tax on disabled veterans, and when I\'m President, we\'ll do away with it once and for all. Yesterday we had another of the debates, that are seeming to come earlier and more frequently in this election season. And one of the questions was whether a candidate represented change or experience. Well, I think we need both in our next President. And, with me, it\'s not either or. I have 35 years of experience fighting for real change and I will use my experience to change Washington starting on day one. I know it won\'t be easy, I know how difficult this job is, I have seen it in an up close and personal way for eight years. And it\'s going to be especially hard because of all the difficult issues we face. But I believe we can do this, I\'m confident and optimistic that we can pull our country together. And, our first order of business here at home, has to be taking care of our veterans. But when all is said and done, caring for our veterans is about more than laws we pass or programs we fund. It\'s about the values we promote and the culture we create. A woman I met in Iowa provided a perfect example of what I mean. She told me that when military people come into her salon for a haircut, she gives them a discount as a way of saying thank you for serving our country. Now, can a President sign an executive order or pass a law to require this? Of course not. But I believe it is the President\'s job to foster a culture of gratitude and respect for the men and women who serve in our armed forces. So when I\'m President I will call upon our people to come together to support our veterans, in large ways as well as those small important kindnesses and recognition that can mean so much. Whether it\'s offering a job, or inviting someone to your child\'s school to speak, or saying a simple thank you line at church or in the line at the grocery store. We owe them everything and that means confronting our national security challenges with courage, strength and wisdom. We all know that one of our key challenges is what to do about the war in Iraq. I have met with our brave men and women serving in Iraq, and I have seen first hand, the sacrifices they are making. And when the history of the Iraq war is written, I want future generations to know that our troops did everything our country asked of them, everything their commanders asked of them, everything their comrades expected of them, everything they expected of themselves. They were asked to get rid of Saddam Hussein and bring him to justice, and they did. They were asked to provide the Iraqi people with free elections so that they could elect their own government, and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time they needed to do what only the Iraqi\'s could do to stabilize their own country. There is a vigorous debate in our own nation  and probably among many of you  about the right way forward in Iraq. I know we may disagree about whether there is or isn\'t, a military solution to this war. Having been there, having studied it, and having seen the heroism and the accomplishments of our troops, I do not believe that we alone can impose a military solution. And I do not think the Iraqi\'s are ready to do what they have to do for themselves yet. Therefore, I think it is unacceptable for our troops to be caught in the crossfire of a sectarian civil war while the Iraqi government is on vacation. I that it is time that the Iraqi government took responsibility for themselves and their country. Because the American people and our American military cannot want freedom and stability for the Iraqis more than they want it for themselves. As we move forward in these next months, awaiting a report from General Petraeus, we\'ll have some very hard decisions to make. I\'m not sure there are any good options but one decision I know we will make is to continue to honor the service of our own American troops and to make sure that they are given the respect that they so richly have earned. Some of us who disagree, I think the best way of honoring their service is by beginning to bring them home, and making sure that when they come home that we have everything ready for them. But Iraq is not the only serious challenge we face. We have seen in the last months a resurgent Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and along the border with Pakistan. I have been one of those who from the beginning have said we never put enough troops into Afghanistan, and we should\'ve stayed focused on wiping out the Taliban, and finding, killing, capturing Bin Laden and his chief lieutenants. Now we\'re playing some catch up. But Afghanistan is critical, because it is in an arena where the Afghan people are real allies, their government is working hard, they are trying to build an independent, strong military, and we cannot let them fail. These are just some of the challenges we face in this increasingly complex world. One area that I am particularly concerned about is the spread of global terrorism. As a Senator from New York, I am too familiar with the horrors of the attack on our city and our country on 9/11. I was there the day after with a small group of office holders and I saw those fire fighters coming out of that black curtain of smoke and debris, we couldn\'t even see them until they broke clear, having worked around the clock, dragging their fire axes. And at that moment, I certainly made a commitment I have tried to follow through on, and that is not only to do everything I could for our first responders, who like our Gulf War veterans suffered because of the work they did at Ground Zero. Many of them not only getting sick, but now dying of the exposures that they breathed, starting after the attacks. But I also made a full commitment to martial American power, resources and values in the global fight against these terrorists. That begins with ensuring that America does have the world\'s strongest and smartest military force. We\'ve begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas particularly in Al Anbar province it\'s working; we\'re just years too late changing our tactics. We can\'t ever let that happen again. We can\'t be fighting the last warwe have to be preparing to fight the new war and this new war requires different tactics and strategies. We have to be prepared to maintain the best fighting force in the world. I proposed increasing the size of our army by 80,000 soldiers, balancing the legacy systems with newer programs to help us keep our technological edge, reevaluating the training and education programs that servicemembers need in the 21st century. And let\'s be sure that the American military does not fight terrorism alone. It is time that we demanded that our alliances, including NATO, are united with us in this fight and that their intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security systems are working together with ours. And let\'s not forget, that the War on Terror like the Cold War is fundamentally a battle over ideas and values. I\'m fighting for a Cold War medal, for everyone that served our country during the Cold War, because you were on the front lines of battling communism. Well, now we are on the front lines of battling terrorism, extremism, and we have to win. Our commitment to freedom, to tolerance, to economic opportunity has inspired people around the world  they\'re not just what we fight for, they can be our most powerful weapons in this fight. I want to get back to a point, where people respect and admire the United States again not just because that would be a good thing, but because that\'s critical on our fight against terrorism. People have to root for America, they have to want to be on our side. Somebody knowing that another member of their community is perhaps putting together suicide bombs kits has to think twice about whether to say nothing or maybe to tell somebody. Law enforcement in countries that could become havens for terrorists have to believe that American values are not just about America, but they speak to the human dignity that God given spark that resides in each and every person across the world. I want to end with this story because it sums for me what I hope to do as your president. It\'s told to me by my friend, and our former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. As some of you may know she was born in the former Czechoslovakia, her family had to deal with the Nazis, they had to deal with the communists, they came as refugees to America. And in 1995 Madeline was asked if she would represent our country at the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the end of WWII and she immediately said yes. And she went to Europe particularly to countries behind what we used to call the Iron Curtain and everywhere she traveled she saw American flags but when she looked more closely she realized that a lot of those flags had only 48 stars. She started asking people, ""where did this flag come from?"" And everyone told her the same storythat when the American GI\'s liberated Europe, they passed out these flags. And remember, back then Hawaii and Alaska weren\'t states yetthat\'s why there were only 48 stars. And people had saved these flags like family treasures, passing them down from grandparent to parent to child often at great risk because if the Soviet occupiers had found them with an American flag they could have gotten into serious trouble. So Madeline asked them, ""Why did you save these flags all these years knowing you could have gotten in trouble?"" And everyone said the same thing, ""because we love America and we love America\'s values and we always hoped some day we\'d be able to live in freedom like Americans."" They never gave up on America\'s ideals  and neither should we. These are the ideals that will light our way forward just as they have illuminated our past. They\'re the ideals that inspired you to leave your homes and families and everything you knew and loved to fight for our freedom around the world. Standing here with you, I feel that same sense of hope and optimism that has always marked our country. And I want to be the president who restores those feelings about America around the world. We are a good and great nation. We can renew the promise of America here at home and we can stand tall for freedom and democracy around the world again. I believe that with the right leadership and with a country committed to a future that reflects the best of who we are, the twenty-first century will be America\'s century. And we will continue our history in an unbroken line from those first soldiers who fought for our revolutionary ideal that all men are created equal to those young men and women who are fighting for us and our ideals right now. With your help and God\'s help we can once again be the country that all of us love, admire and know is worth fighting for. Thank you all very much, and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 23, 2007","b'Speech at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire'","b'Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you Nancy for your introduction and for your leadership of this great medical center, and to Frank McDougall who has also helped very much in putting this event together. I also want to thank Dr. Susan Lynch for being here. Some of you know that Dr. Lynch did her residency at Dartmouth-Hitchcock and she\'s a pediatrician who works as a pediatric lipid specialist at the cholesterol treatment center at Concord Hospital in Concord.It would be interesting to know just as historic fact when the first pediatric lipid specialist was certified because one thinks about cholesterol as a problem of us, the adult world. And now we know, as Dr. Lynch too well knows, with her advocacy on behalf of physical activity and trying to stem the tide of obesity among our children, how significant this is and I\'m just absolutely delighted that she could be here today. It\'s also a pleasure being back here. I just had the opportunity to say hello to some of the physicians and nurses and staff members who run this great center. And a number of them reminded me that I was here in 1993, I actually met some of them before this occasion and I am thrilled to be back because I cannot imagine a more fitting place to talk about improving healthcare quality in America than at this institution which has helped to set the standard for excellence for more than 200 years. As I travel across New Hampshire -- and certainly around our country -- I talk with people from all walks of life, it is really one of the great privileges of being in public life; I see the speaker here, and others who are involved in the day-to-day life of New Hampshire. You get to meet people you would have never otherwise met; you are invited into their lives, somewhat similar to what you do here, as you take care of them in very significant points of their life\'s journey. Well in the political arena we also have that privilege and no matter where I go, or with whom I talk -- whether it\'s a CEO or a small business owner or a doctor or a nurse or patient or a hospital administrator -- everyone tells me the same thing: ""Our health care system isn\'t working and what can we do about it?"" The costs are too high, the coverage too thin -- or in some cases non-existent -- the care not what it should be. Now I have worked on health care, like Nancy said, for more years than I care to recount. Going back to 1979 and 80 in Arkansas, where I led an effort to try too bring more health care into rural areas, a problem we still have in Northern New Hampshire just as in Eastern Arkansas. And of course most memorably, during the eight years as First Lady. Now despite the scars I carry from that, I also have learned some valuable lessons. And most importantly, that in order to answer any question about what we can do better to provide healthcare for all of our citizens in a cost effective quality driven way, we first have to establish a consensus in America. That this is a goal we intend to achieve together. We have to reach that consensus among providers, employers, employees, citizens, those who pay for, depend upon, and actually deliver healthcare services. And this consensus has to be strong enough to persuade decision makers in Washington and to overcome entrenched opposition among the forces that oppose change for ideological and corporate reasons. Now the good news is that I think we are finally reaching consensus. I see businesses, labor, government and other stakeholders increasingly investing in quality care because they realize that it\'s not only good for individuals and families that it\'s also goof or our economy. We\'ve begun to agree that there is an economic as well as a moral imperative to reign in costs and to extend coverage to all Americans. There\'s a practical imperative to improve quality -- to promote wellness and prevent illness wherever possible. And these are the key components of my health care plan--lowering costs for everyone, improving quality for everyone, and providing coverage for everyone. I list them as three interlocking goals because I think we cannot do one without doing all of them. A few months ago, I outlined my agenda to reduce health care costs and today, I want to talk about health care quality. And next month, I will announce my plan for universal coverage. My order here is deliberate. In order to forge a consensus on universal health care, we need to assure people they\'ll get the quality they expect at a price they can afford. And my recommendations to control costs and ensure quality lay the groundwork for insuring everyone. Now, by all accounts, we should already have the highest quality health care in the world. Our doctors, nurses and other health care practitioners are among the best in the world. They have access to the most cutting-edge drugs, and treatments and medical technologies. And we spend more money per capita on health care, almost $5,700, than any country in the world. But we are far from having the best care. We\'re ranked 23rd in infant mortality and 42nd in life expectancy. According to the 2006 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 51 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the quality of our health care system. According to a RAND study, adults in the United States on average fail to receive about one half the medical care they need. More than one in ten patients may receive care that isn\'t recommended -- and may be potentially harmful. And the Institute of Medicine estimates that as many as 98,000 Americans are killed each year by preventable medical errors. Now in short, too often and in too may places, our health care system hurts us instead of helping us. It hurts doctors, who aren\'t rewarded for providing the best care -- and are often punished for it, financially at least. It hurts nurses, who are asked to work longer hours caring for more patients with fewer resources. And it hurts patients, who are forced to make complicated medical decisions without basic information about their conditions and options. Now I\'m hoping that we\'re getting to a point where the quality of our health care is not a partisan issue. Whether you\'re a Democrat or Republican, a liberal or a conservative, none of us wants to rush our child to an emergency room only to receive the wrong treatment. None of us wants to bring our spouse in for surgery only to see them next in the ICU with a preventable infection. None of us wants our loved one cared for by nurses who are juggling too many patients and too many medications with too little support. And any of us could become seriously ill injured such that we won\'t have a second chance to get the right diagnosis and treatment. And when that day comes, why should we settle for less than the best? But that is exactly what we\'re doing right now. When you buy a TV for your living room or a tire for your car, or a toy for your child, you want to know you\'re getting the best value -- and these days, especially with toys, the greatest safety. So you compare prices, you ask questions, you check the consumer reports and you rely on your government to establish and enforce basic guarantees of safety and reliability. But too often, with the product we care most about --that can mean the difference between life and death, and between billions of dollars wasted and saved -- we don\'t compare prices or quality we wind up stuck with something whether we think it\'s best for us or not. And until recently, government at all levels did not use its enormous buying power to empower providers and patients to demand and deliver quality. We plod along with a twentieth century health care system, unable to take full advantage of 21st century medical advances, stuck in the same rut of fatalistic thinking that\'s defined our healthcare debate for more than a decade. If we try to cover everyone, the argument goes -- we\'ll lower quality. If we try to improve quality -- we\'ll break the bank. Our health care problems are too big, too deep, too complicated, the argument continues, for us to solve. Well, I reject that and I think all of you here at this exemplary institution do as well. America is not a nation that settles. We don\'t wring our hands and make excuses. We roll up our sleeves. We invent. We innovate. We come up with solutions. And that\'s exactly what hospitals and nursing homes and providers across America have been doing with very little support. Many are improving the care they offer and lowering costs. Take the example of Kaiser Permanente. Their management came together with 40 unions representing 90,000 healthcare workers and staff and formed a Labor Management Partnership. The Partnership works to solve problems, improve patient care and give everyone a seat at the table. One example of their work involved a patient complaint that nurses often did their shift handover without input from the patient--so union nurses worked with management to come up with a solution: doing the handover in the patient\'s room, where the patient could join in the conversation. As a result, patients better understand their care, nurses spend more time with patients, and information is being shared more efficiently. Since Kaiser\'s partnership began, costs have fallen, workplace injuries have fallen -- and patient satisfaction and employee retention have improved. And this is just one example of how, across America, workers and management can improve healthcare quality. Or take the example of Ascension Health, America\'s largest non-profit hospital system. Back in 2002, they began a system-wide effort to improve their quality of care -- to meet best practices and provide better treatments. Today, their rate of certain hospital infections is 62 percent lower than the national average. Serious patient falls are 86 percent lower. Rates of bedsores are 93 percent lower. But in the end, quality health care isn\'t just about savings or statistics. It\'s about something much more fundamental: the relationship between physicians and patients, between nurses and patients, between physicians, nurses and hospital administrators. That\'s what\'s at the heart of our quality, how we get along with one another, what our relationships are. The moment when someone in need seeks you out, they\'re scared and vulnerable, they want you to do what can get them better, but too often our healthcare system stands in the way, blocking that relationship, preventing physicians and nurses from doing what they would want to do. So therefore, we have to change the system. Well, I\'m here today because I believe it\'s time we had a health care system that lived up to the Hippocratic Oath. A system that empowers doctors, nurses and hospitals to give the best care. That empowers patients to make the best decisions. And that ensures that payers -- governments and private payers-- value, reward and promote the best results: longer, healthier lives, and money saved in lowering and unproductive and unnecessary hospital and nursing home costs. That is what my Health Care Quality Plan tries to do. We have come to these recommendations in consultation with doctors, nurses and others across the country. We\'ve developed a plan to raise standards, support health care providers, educate patients, realign the reimbursement systems to reward quality, recruit and retain more nurses, and address the health disparities that continue to plague our system. I want to start by talking about how we ensure that our health care providers -- doctors, nurses and others -- provide the best possible care. That starts with providing federal support for doctors\' own quality certification standards. Now, most doctors stay current on their own -- reading up on the latest advances, studying the latest techniques. But changes are coming so fast these days; many tell us they just can\'t keep up. Some might not even realize they\'re no longer using the latest protocols or the best systems. This may explain the dramatic variations in cost and quality from state to state, town to town -- even from hospital to hospital in the same town. Now some of these variations have been discovered and publicized right here at Dartmouth, the studies conducted by Jack Weinberg and his colleagues here have revolutionized how many people think about quality of care. They found that the quality of care for patients with terminal illnesses, just to pick one example, varied greatly. The percentage of patients who died as hospital inpatients instead of at home or in a hospice, range from 32 percent to more than 52 percent despite the fact that the overwhelming number of Americans would prefer not to die in a hospital. Part of the solution to these disparities can be found in doctors\' own voluntary Maintenance of Certification programs, so called MOC programs. They provide lifelong learning opportunities to help doctors stay up to date. They\'re generally run by the boards of the various specialties -- so cardiology runs the MOC for cardiologists, or the pediatrics runs the MOC for pediatricians, and so on. Doctors who participate in certification programs have better outcomes. Heart attack patients treated by board certified doctors were 15 percent less likely to die than those treated by non-certified doctors. Doctors who scored higher on MOC examinations had better outcomes in treating patients with diabetes, and they were more likely to ensure that their patients received mammograms. So as President, I want to lend the support of the federal government to MOC process to help our doctors stay on the top of their game. I will offer higher Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors who participate in qualified MOC programs. And to ensure that the MOCs are sufficiently rigorous -- I\'ll ask that the Secretary of HHS to invest $125 million to recognize and help fund the work of a public-private Quality Trust to certify the MOCs. This Trust will bring together people from across the health care system -- doctors, patients, nurses and others -- who will rigorously review MOCs to ensure they are up to the highest standards. If you have any doubt about whether we need to do this, I\'d refer you to an article from this week\'s New York Times indicating that just 7 percent of diabetics are getting all of the treatment they need -- often because their doctors are not versed in the latest developments. Now, imagine if instead, these doctors participated in certification programs that kept them up to date on nationally recognized standards for diabetic care. The most revealing conclusion in the very long article was that most doctors were vigilant about blood sugar, but not about blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring. Think of how many more lives could be saved and how much more money could be saved if they were. I\'ll also support doctors by creating a Best Care Practices Institute, a public-private partnership to fund comparative effectiveness research and disseminate it across the country. Right now so much of the information on which drugs, devices, surgeries and treatments work best, either isn\'t researched, it isn\'t compared, it isn\'t published, and it isn\'t circulated. It takes years for an agreed upon treatment that a medical center like this one knows is the best practice to be disseminated across our country. So this Best Practices Institute will serve as a central national clearinghouse so no matter where you are, you and your doctor can access information on what the best treatments should be. In addition to helping doctors provide the best care, I plan to finally implement medical malpractice reforms that work for doctors and patients alike. Many of the physicians that I meet say that high malpractice premiums force them to alter their practice-- and even consider leaving the profession altogether. I\'ve also heard first hand from families who\'ve experienced serious medical errors and have trouble getting the relief that they deserve. The current political stalemate on this issue leaves both patients and physicians in the lurch. Earlier before I came in I was speaking to the head of anesthesiology and I really give the anesthesiologists a lot of credit because for the last ten years they have moved toward standards of practice that have not only helped patients but dramatically lowered malpractice premiums and I believe there\'s a lot we can do within the specialties, following the example of anesthesiology, coming up with new approaches. I\'ve offered one solution based on a successful program at the University of Michigan Hospital system. It\'s called the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation Act. In the Congress you have to come up with acronyms so you search for days to try to name a piece of legislation with something that if you take the first letter it spells a word--so that is the MEDiC act for those of you who were wondering. It\'s a novel approach to improving patient safety and the quality of care while protecting patients\' rights, reducing medical errors and lowering malpractice costs. The bill that I have introduced based on the University of Michigan Hospital system would proved liability protections for physicians who disclose medical errors to patients and offer to enter into negotiations for fair compensation backed up by their hospital and their practice. At the University of Michigan, these policies have already resulted in greater patient trust and satisfaction, more patients being compensated for injuries, fewer malpractice suits, significantly reduced administrative costs, and between one and three million dollars in litigation cost savings. But when I talk about supporting providers, I\'m not just talking about doctors -- but about nurses as well. And that\'s the third step in my plan -- to immediately address our nursing shortage and to give nurses the training and educational and support that they need to provide the care patients deserve. The nursing shortage has become a nursing crisis. And that means it\'s a crisis for everyone, because nurses are critical to delivering and improving quality. Our nurses are truly the eyes and ears --and in many ways, the heart and soul -- of our health care system. And when we\'ve got fewer nurses, working longer hours, serving more patients -- the result can be worse outcomes. We currently face a shortfall of 118,000 nurses. If we don\'t take action now, by the year 2020, the estimate is that we will be short as many as one million nurses. In addition to the shortage, nurses are aging. On average a nurse is over 45 in America. So we need a comprehensive solution. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, in 2005, American nursing programs turned away nearly 32,000 qualified bachelor and masters degree applicants. They just didn\'t have the slots. So when I\'m President, I will provide funding to nursing schools to allow them to admit and train more nurses and to recruit and retain more faculty. And I\'ll give first priority to schools with a record of sending graduates to serve in underserved areas -- from rural communities, to inner-cities, to low-income neighborhoods. I\'ll also work to recruit more nurses to the profession in the first place -- reaching out to communities of color that are traditionally underrepresented, providing scholarships and loan forgiveness so we can have a more diverse, culturally competent nursing workforce. But we know that the problem isn\'t just recruiting -- it\'s retaining nurses. Roughly 50 percent of new nurses leave their jobs within the first year -- all too often because they\'re not getting the support they need to do their jobs. I will address that by funding innovative mentoring and residency programs with a proven track record of helping to keep nurses in the profession. Programs like the RN Residency program that was launched five years ago at Children\'s Hospital Los Angeles. This 22-week program provides new nursing school graduates with a comprehensive clinical experience to prepare them for careers in acute care environments. Prior to this program, turnover for new graduates during their first year was 36 percent. Graduates of the RN Residency program have a first-year turnover rate of just 11 percent, and a 24 month turnover rate that has dropped from 56 to 22 percent. Given that it costs roughly $50,000 to replace each nurse -- and thousands more to pay temporary nurses to fill in -- you can see the kinds of savings that Children\'s is experiencing. I also want to do more to empower advanced practice nurses. We\'re going to have to change the practice, acts, and protocols that govern what nurses can do-- nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician\'s assistants, advanced practice professionals. Because it\'s clear that we will not be able to reach our goals for preventive care if we don\'t have better utilization of nurses. We need to empower patients. And that means giving them the information they need to make the right choices. Today even the savviest, best informed patients struggle to choose providers and treatment options and it is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed about these decisions. Now some people will tell you the best way to provide consumer choice is to give everyone a Health Savings Account -- and leave them to find the least expensive, most effective providers on their own. If they\'re in good health, chances are that they\'ll be able to navigate this. But if they get seriously ill, or have an accident that is serious, well I don\'t think that there\'s much hope there. The idea is that we have to really empower patients -- not shift costs on to them under the guise of so called ""consumer-driven"" care. So when I talk about informed consumer choice, I mean no one should have to guess their way through this maze. That\'s why we need a comprehensive, patient-friendly quality database. With the click of a mouse, patients should be able to see which hospitals have the best care, the best specialists, the lowest infection rates, the most efficient discharge policies, the shortest emergency room waiting times, and more. And that is exactly what you\'re doing here at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, publishing comprehensive public reports on everything from the quality of your cancer treatments and pneumonia care to your infection prevention rates. I\'m so impressed by what you\'ve done here and the difference that it is making that I have teamed up with Senator Judd Gregg and introduced bipartisan legislation to create this kind of system on a national scale using Medicare claims data to make risk-adjusted quality reports publicly available. I also empower patients by making sure that the information that they get is understandable. The Center for Shared Decision Making here at Dartmouth Hitchcock is another perfect example. This center approaches medical decisions as collaboration between patients and doctors. Doctors take the time to talk with patients, discuss their concerns and their goals -- and then help them reach the outcomes they desire. And once again the results speak for themselves. 98 percent of patients report they understood their treatment choices. 96 percent said they realized which treatment risks and benefits mattered most to them as they made their decisions. We cannot do this however if we don\'t invest in electronic medical records. I\'ve already proposed this as legislation, a bipartisan piece of legislation that I have worked on for four and a half years, passed the Senate last year, it died in the house. But we\'re back with bipartisan legislation again. It is essential that we begin to do this. Institutions like this have electronic medical records as do other of our medical centers and fine hospitals around the country but we\'re not creating a seamless system. We\'re not creating one where if you\'re a patient here and you\'re visiting family in Florida or if you\'re on a business trip to LA, your record can be easily transmitted. And while Amazon.com knows exactly which books you\'ve bought and what music you like -- an emergency room doctor may have no way of knowing what medications you\'re taking, what you\'re allergic to -- or even what your blood type is. Electronic medical records will change that. They\'ll ensure that patients can have secure, confidential access to their medical history wherever and whenever they need it. This will save, according to a RAND study, approximately 77 billion dollars a year. And it will also save lives. The VA is a great example of a healthcare system that has dramatically improved the quality of patient care. The American Consumer Satisfaction Index Survey shows that VA patients were significantly more satisfied with both inpatient and outpatient care than patients in the private medical system. The New England Journal of Medicine found that VA healthcare ranked higher than Medicare in 12 out of 13 measurements of quality and the VA system achieves better rates of quality care for diabetics than commercial managed care organizations. Now what made this success possible? Well, in part the use of information technology. During the Clinton Administration, a transition to a paperless system was accelerated and today the VA maintains electronic health records in 1,300 facilities for over 5 million veterans. And this enables someone to go from VA hospital to VA hospital and have that record be seamlessly delivered wherever it is needed. The VA medical records system supports the use of advanced technology including mobile devices, wireless interfaces, and a barcode medication administration system in which patients are given a bar-coded ID tag. Nurses scan this tag when providing medications allowing them to confirm that the right person receives the right medicine at the right time. So the VA is doing it, there\'s no reason we can\'t do it across our healthcare system, And through my coverage recommendations which I will be making next month, I want to come up with ideas to incentives patients and potential patients which includes all of us to make better decisions about our own health. Information alone about behaviors like smoking or obesity does not automatically result in change. We need both a renewed public health effort that I think should be lead by the president, stressing better health outcomes and financial benefits to motivate such changes through the way we pay for public and private insurance. I want to emphasize that when I talk about empowering patients -- I mean all patients -- from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are far from that goal now. Our health care system unfortunately is still plagued with racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and gender disparities at every level. And my goal is to eliminate those disparities once and for all. Right now, African American infant mortality rates are more than double those for whites. More than one-fifth of American Indians do not have a reliable source of health care, as compared to 15 percent of whites. Asian-Americans are less likely to receive critical screening tests like mammograms and pap smears. Hispanics living with diabetes are almost 20 percent less likely to receive recommended diabetes treatments. And women are more likely than men to be hospitalized for high blood pressure -- a manageable chronic condition. Minority populations aren\'t just sicker -- they also get lower-quality care. According to the annual National Healthcare Disparities Report released by HHS, African Americans and Hispanics received worse care than whites on more than 70 percent of the criteria used to measure quality. This is simply unacceptable in our country. The quality of your care should have nothing to do with your ethnicity, skin color, or gender. And when I\'m President, I will see to it that it doesn\'t. I will start by directing the Department of Health and Human Services to collect detailed, up-to-date information on healthcare disparities, so we actually can know the full extent of the . I\'ll also invest in developing culturally competent health care for minority population. That means ensuring health care providers have access to the language skills they need to communicate with their patients -- and that patient information is appropriately translated into the many languages that a hospital often has to deal with. Finally, I want to discuss the role of payers -- insurance companies and state and federal governments -- in providing quality health care. I want to start with our reimbursement system. We have to completely re-haul this system. We need a system that actually encourages -- instead of discourages -- quality care. Right now, the incentives in our reimbursement system are upside-down and backwards. They often punish doctors are trying to do the right thing -- like spend time with their patients, trying to prevent, not just treat illness. Doing what\'s best for patients is sometimes bad for business. Hospitals are paid for each episode of care, each hospitalization. Doctors are paid for each office visit, each procedure. People aren\'t paid to coordinate patients\' treatments to ensure they get the best quality care. So let\'s say you are a diabetic with high blood pressure. Your doctor won\'t be reimbursed for hiring a nutritionist to track your weight and help you understand what you can and can\'t eat. Your hospital won\'t be reimbursed for hiring a nurse assistant to ensure you have regular appointments to get your feet and eyes checked. Or to make sure your blood pressure doctor and your diabetes doctor communicate with each other about your care. And healthcare providers who wish to work in teams to coordinate services and treat patients holistically receive lower reimbursements than if they all worked separately. So we wind up treating patients like walking collections of symptoms and diseases -- each to be treated discretely. But that is not how illness works, that\'s not how the body or the mind works. For example, if you are a diabetic with high blood pressure, your high blood pressure obviously affects your diabetes, and vice versa. So there\'s incredible value to coordinating care and in having doctors, nurses, social workers, nutritionists and other professionals working together as a team. That\'s exactly how it\'s done at the Mayo Clinic, one of the most respected health care institutions in America, actually probably in the world. Under their integrated healthcare system, primary care physicians work together with specialists to develop a comprehensive approach to treat each patient. The result is better care, lower costs, and fewer hospitalizations and doctor visits. The result is better care, lower costs, and fewer hospitalizations and doctor visits. In fact, if hospitalizations and doctor visits across America mirrored the numbers at Mayo, for certain conditions, inpatient Medicare spending would decrease 20 percent, Medicare costs for doctor visits would decrease 35 percent. That\'s billions of dollars in savings. But at the same time physicians salaries are above the national average. So when I\'m President, I\'ll support federal reimbursements for precisely this kind of team approach to medicine. We know it saves money -- and saves lives. I\'ll also ensure that the federal reimbursement system rewards care based on how effective it is. Today, we often do just the opposite. In a Pennsylvania government survey of the state\'s 60 hospitals performing heart bypass surgery, the best-paid hospital received nearly $100,000, on average for the operation, while the least-paid got less than $20,000. But at both hospitals, patients had comparable lengths of stay and death rates. And among the 20 hospitals serving metropolitan Philadelphia, two of the highest paid actually had higher-than-expected death rates. Now, we know we have to adjust for risk, and we know that very often the most difficult cases end up at the hospitals that have the greatest capacity. But I think we could do a better job in actually figuring out what we should be paying for -- work that has also been pioneered here at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. With the right incentives, we can make a difference. Take the example of the Marshfield Clinic, in Wisconsin, where doctors are paid based on the quality of care they provide for common diseases like diabetes and heart disease. They could earn up to 80 percent of the Medicare savings that result from their good treatment. Preliminary results revealed a 50 percent increase in electronically documented foot exams for diabetes -- and a 29 percent decrease in hospitalization. Another excellent example of incentivizing good care with smart reimbursement policies is the Bush Administration\'s recent decision to refuse Medicare payments for preventable infections, injuries and errors sustained during hospital stays. A sponge accidentally left inside a patient during surgery, a broken arm sustained when a patient is improperly handled. They\'re known as ""never events,"" because they never should have happened. It\'s not often that I offer praise for the Bush Administration, but it is well deserved for this decision. Now Michigan has had great success with systematic efforts to reduce infection rates in intensive care units. Hospitals in that state have reduced blood stream infections related to catheters, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The hospitals did not use expensive new technology, but followed well-established infection control practices, like covering doctors and patients with sterile gowns and sheets when catheters were inserted. So, As President, I won\'t just sustain these good policies at the federal and the state level -- I\'ll take it one step further. I\'ll insist that any insurance company wishing to provide coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is all of them, has to also refuse to cover these costs. And I\'ll encourage private plans to follow suit. I believe we could not only save billions of dollars but thousands of lives over time. Finally, ensuring that our reimbursement system rewards quality care also means ending insurance company discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Right now, insurance companies have free reign to cherry pick the healthiest patients and shut out everyone who seems like a ""bad risk."" In fact, they spend $50 billion a year on elaborate underwriting calculations and schemes to figure out how not to cover people or that not to pay you for what you do once you\'ve delivered the service. As President, I\'ll put an end to that. I believe we should examine the patchwork nature of regulation of the insurance system. And I believe we have to end insurance discrimination. Now, will all of this be easy? We just elect a new president? Will it just happen? Of course not. But let\'s remember, we\'re gathered today at the school that introduced the stethoscope to the American Medical School curriculum, took the first clinical X-Ray, established the first ICU. The institution that has always been pushing the boundaries, and looking toward that next horizon. Oliver Wendell Holmes, who served as a professor in this school back in the 19th century, put it best when he said, ""I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving."" We may have a long road ahead of us, but I believe we\'re finally moving in the right direction. That we can empower patients to make the right decisions for themselves. We can empower doctors and nurses to deliver the best care that they want to, and are often prevented from doing so. We can have the highest quality health care system in the world and we can do it in a cost-effective manner. That\'s the direction that I\'m headed in. And I\'m proud to be at this institution, which has pioneered so many of the changes that benefit us today, and I hope that you\'ll all join me on this journey to better quality healthcare. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 15, 2007","b'Remarks to the NAACP in Charleston, South Carolina'","b'Thank you. Oh my goodness, I\'m very appreciative on a personal level for that wonderful introduction and it is a great pleasure for me to serve alongside such a great leader as Congressman Clyburn. I don\'t think there\'s any doubt in anybody\'s mind that he is a big dog. And he\'s a big dog who\'s leading the pack for our country and I\'m very grateful that he would be here because obviously I am well aware there is a historic football game being played tonight. You know, when I heard that the dinner was going to compete with the game between the University of South Carolina and South Carolina State University, I thought for a moment that it might just be President Scott and me here. But I appreciate that so many of you are committed to the work of the NAACP here in Charleston, throughout the state, and indeed across the country.And I am deeply honored that I could be with you. I want to thank our two MCs, who have done a wonderful job this evening. Thanks to both Octavia and Rafael. I also want to thank our two musical performers who I thought were unbelievably special, Daniel Davis and Crystal Brown Gibson. It\'s wonderful being here with so many elected officials and I\'m grateful they are here to be with your mayor, whom I\'ve known a very long time and am very proud of the work that has been done under his leadership in Charleston. And of course, it gives me a lot of pleasure to thank Dot Scott and to call her Madame President. I love the ring of that. And I was very moved by the tribute to your fallen firefighters. Obviously, as a Senator from New York, I have some understanding of the pain and the loss, the grief and shock that losing those nine brave firefighters has caused in this community and particularly to their families. It reminds us every day of the preciousness of life and the both opportunity and obligation each of us has to do our part to advancing the cause of freedom, to caring for one another, for walking our individual journeys with a sense of a destination that is better for everyone. And that\'s what the NAACP has done for so many years and now with this 91st annual Freedom Fund Banquet, it continues the tradition. Dot and I went over and met some of the young people, the next generation of leaders for the NAACP, for this city, this state, and this country. I want to thank everyone who understands the mission of the NAACP. It is a big dog, but it\'s a dog with a conscience -- that\'s an unusual combination -- calling us to understand that, as Americans, we have to keep faith with all that came before. The NAACP\'s leadership was evident these past few weeks, as you called the nation\'s attention to an example of present day discrimination happening in Jena, Louisiana. And the NAACP and people of goodwill everywhere stood up and made sure their voices were heard, asking tough questions about the administration of justice. And yesterday an appeals court heard those voices and it took another look and said justice was not done. Let me be clear, there is no excuse for the way the legal system treated those young people. This case reminds us that the scales of justice are seriously out of balance when it comes to charging, sentencing and punishing African Americans. And we cannot forget this is not over yet. There are still questions unanswered. The case in Jena cries out for a full investigation by the Department of Justice\'s civil rights division. And it reaffirms my conviction that the next president must have a justice department devoted to justice and a civil rights division that works for all Americans. This case reminds us that we have so much work yet to do, America\'s long march to freedom, equality and opportunity has been marked by many milestones like the creation of the NAACP, or the Montgomery Bus boycott, the sit-ins at the Orangeburg lunch counter organized by a young Jim Clyburn, that fateful Sunday march across the Pettis Bridge in Selma, Alabama. But these milestones do not mark the end of the journey our country has been on. They are way stations along that journey; the march is not over. And Today, America needs the NAACP and its leadership as much as we ever have before. I\'ve been traveling across our country. I came today to be with you from California; I crisscrossed the country, from one coast to the other, from north to south, and I see the strength and the dynamism of our great nation. But I also hear the voices of so many Americans who are worried about our future. They\'re not sure of the direction we are headed and they ask with concern and even insecurity ""What\'s next?"" They\'re aware that we have an income gap that has grown like a chasm in our country. Between the very very best off in America and all the rest of us, and it\'s a gap that is even greater between African Americans and white Americans. We have a health care gap. The access to health care is not even in our nation, we all know that. The rates for disease and the failure to treat those diseases is a disparity that we should not tolerate. We have an achievement gap between the rates of graduation and access to higher education, between the gleaming corridors of suburban schools and the deplorable conditions along the corridor of shame. And we have an investment gap when inner cities and rural America are left behind because we are failing to invest in either the physical infrastructure or the human potential. And indeed we even have a democracy gap right now in America. When some Americans, particularly people of color, have to wait at the polls for hours while others down the road or in the next town cast their votes within minutes, there\'s something wrong. And as we have seen, most recently, we have a justice gap. Reverend Darby referred to the disparity in sentencing when it comes to cocaine. Well, that is just one of the disparities.15% of drug users in America are African American, but African Americans make up 53% of all drug offenders sent to prison. So how do we close all of these gaps? How do we move forward toward a more perfect union? Continue that progress that has been the hallmark but we cannot let it stop now. I start with my conviction that our families and communities, our churches and civic organizations, our states, and our country have to work together to help each child live up to his or her God-given potential. That, to me, is the rallying cry for America, but instead of tapping that potential and working to bring America together, too many Americans today feel as though they are invisible -- that their problems, their daily struggles, are not covered in the media, not the concern of people in public life or in the boardrooms of America, and indeed that they are being forgotten instead of enlisted in this great American commitment to a better future. Well, indeed that\'s what\'s happened in the last years. You know, we\'ve had an attorney general who doesn\'t respect the rule of law or enforce the civil rights laws on the books. We\'ve seen Supreme Court justices turn the clock back on Brown vs. Board of Education. Tax breaks have been given for drug companies ahead of health care for poor children. No-bid contracts given to Halliburton, while more than 60,000 people still live in trailers along the Gulf Coast. In short, we have seen the creation of a government that turns American values on their heads -- a government of the few, by the few, and for the few. It breaks tradition because, for us, we want to believe that our government represents all of us, don\'t we? It\'s taken many years of struggle to get to that point. Most of us in this room tonight were not in our Constitution. It took a long time before we amended it to include, at least on paper, constitutional rights for us all. And to feel as though the clock is being turned back is unacceptable in our country. This new vision of government that has been propagated in Washington, that Jim Clyburn and I have been fighting against, is called the ownership society. Well, the reality is they own it and want you to work for it. You\'re on your own is a better description. If you take the first letters of you\'re on your own, it spells yo-yo, and that\'s the way a lot of people feel, somebody else holding the string and moving it up and down. Because if you are a child in a crumbling school along the corridor of shame, you are invisible. And if you\'re a young man caught in the brutal revolving door of low skills, no jobs, and a justice system stacked against you, you\'re invisible as well. If you\'re a mother without health care, a father without a job, a family that can\'t get by on the minimum wage, well, you\'re invisible, too. If you\'re a voter, turned away from the polls for no good reason or voting on a broken machine that doesn\'t even record your vote, you\'re invisible. And if you\'re stuck on a rooftop or stranded at the Super Dome during a hurricane, you\'re invisible to this president, even when you\'re on CNN. Well, these people are not invisible to the NAACP, and they\'re not invisible to me, and they should never be invisible to the president of the United States. These stories and these concerns should be there on a daily basis in the Oval Office because when we\'re invisible to each other, we\'re not working together, we\'re not rolling up our sleeves and trying to solve problems, we\'re not seeing each other or listening, and we are the poorer for it. We\'ve got to get America back into the solutions business. When I was growing up, I believed that my country could do anything we set our minds to, and during my lifetime, I saw many examples of that. I saw a Supreme Court come down with the decision called Brown vs. Board of Education. I saw a president who sent in troops to make sure children could go to school in Little Rock, Arkansas. I heard a president say we\'ll send a man to the moon and bring him back safely before the end of the decade. I watched as a president signed civil rights laws and voting rights laws and Medicare and Medicaid to care for the poor and care for the elderly. Republican and democratic presidents alike kept moving us forward. We have been in the grip of a dangerous experiment in extremism the last six and a half years. It has been, it has been a repudiation of the bi-partisanship that together has moved our country. Jim quoted Abraham Lincoln, a great Republican president, and you could pick many others from both sides of the aisle. Our current president campaigned as a compassionate conservative and it turned out he was neither. And we have been paying a price, and this is not about partisanship, this is about being an American again. This is about caring that our country has these challenges and then working to overcome them. Now, all of you in Charleston know how important the ongoing struggle is, and I know later we\'ll have a chance to join hands and sing ""we shall overcome."" Well that story of that song speaks volumes about the power of working with one another and looking out for each other. Sixty years ago the workers of the American Tobacco Company here in Charleston were on strike. These women sang a song on the picket line that many people had known as ""I\'ll be alright"" or ""I\'ll overcome someday."" But the women of Charleston sang it with a very important difference. ""We"" they sang ""we will overcome someday."" And your own Septima Clark would later help change the word ""will"" to ""shall."" And this version echoed across continents and generations, out of the mouths of protesters and the mouths of presidents. ""I will overcome"" was a fine song but ""We shall overcome"" moved mountains and changed the world and we need a President who will make that same change in our government -- the change from ""I"" to ""we."" We are all in this together, and it\'s time we make government work for all of us again. It\'s time that we make government a true partner not just with those who are already privileged but with every small town, every small hamlet, every group of people in our country. I believe that one of the most important jobs of the next President is to define a new vision of prosperity and fairness for the 21st century -- a vision for how we restore prosperity for working and middle class Americans who are the heart and soul of this nation and how we can achieve the promise of our founding: that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. And here\'s what I believe. The foundation of a strong economy is the investments we make in each other -- in education, in health care, in jobs and housing. Sarah Ford talked about the problems we\'re having across America and the very great difficulty people are facing because of the mortgage crisis. We have so many middle class people who are hanging on and so many who used to be in the middle class falling back into poverty. During the 1990s we saw the creation of twenty two million new jobs and more people lifted out of poverty than at any time in our country\'s history. Last month we lost four thousand jobs in America and people are justifiably concerned about what will happen to their home, their health care, their job, their future. Greatness has come in America from our recognition that it is not rich people who made America great -- it is the hardworking middle class and working people who made America great and continues to make us great. We\'ve got to get back to creating good jobs with rising wages and I\'m convinced we can do that. We have to move back to fiscal responsibility. Six and a half years ago we had a balanced budget and a surplus. That has been squandered. The President has had two major goals of his presidency: tax breaks for the wealthiest and the War in Iraq. But he has not paid for either. He\'s put them on the credit card. The way he\'s funded them is to borrow money from the Social Security Trust Fund and borrow money from countries like China every single day. So we are in ""hoc"" as a nation. We\'re borrowing money even from Mexico. We need to get back to a sense of responsibility in the federal government and then we\'ve got to look at how we\'re going to create new jobs by a new energy plan that puts people to work in America by going ahead and combating global warming right here at home -- something important for coastal states like South Carolina. We need to rebuild our infrastructure and I think that if we had a jobs program based no energy, the environment, and infrastructure, we would put millions of Americans back to work again. We need to provide a high quality education for every single child, and I want to have a universal pre-kindergarten program that is especially focused on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, I heard the Mayor talking about that. We know that if children get a good quality pre-school education, they stay in school, they do better, and the evidence is overwhelming that with a good quality pre-school program in our country we would cut by 50% the achievement gap between black and white youngsters by the time they graduated from high school. We\'ve got to make college affordable again and I want to brag on the Democratic congress particularly with our leader here, leader Clyburn, the Democratic congress has just passed legislation to lower interest rates and increase the amount of Pell Grants so we can get back to making college affordable again. And let\'s not forget all of the decent young people who don\'t go to college. Let\'s get more apprenticeship programs, more technical programs, they deserve our help to have a job that makes them competitive in the global economy. I believe we can guarantee every single American quality, affordable health care. It is time. We have 47 million Americans without health insurance. But it\'s not just about insuring the uninsured although I believe that is a moral imperative. In some groups that I speak to some people come up to me afterwards and they say ""I don\'t know anyone that\'s uninsured."" I say ""Well, go to an emergency room some night and sit in that emergency room and watch people come in because they have no where else to go."" So it is a moral imperative that we come up with a health care plan to cover everyone, but it\'s not only that, we have to make sure that the people with insurance actually get taken care of because too many people with insurance when their doctor says they need a certain treatment, the insurance company says no. I have this problem all the time as a Senator. A man from Northern New York called me and said \'Senator, what have I done wrong, I\'ve worked for the same employer for years. I\'ve always paid my premiums. My family has always been healthy. Now my son has been diagnosed with a rare disease and the doctors say there\'s one place in the country where he should be treated and the insurance companies say they won\'t send him there."" Or a mother from Long Island, NY calls and says her daughter has Leukemia and she needs a stem cell transplant but they have to have a donor and it\'s expensive to search for a donor and the insurance company won\'t pay for the search. So I get on the phone and my staff gets on the phone and we argue with the insurance companies and they\'re afraid that we\'ll embarrass them and so finally they say ""fine, the boy can have his operation and we\'ll pay for the donor search"". It should not take a United States Senator to get the health care that a mother and a father need for their sons and daughters. On Monday I\'ll be releasing the third part of my health care plan, the first part is lowered costs for everybody. Premium costs have gone up 87% in the last six years, more and more employers can\'t afford to cover people. Insurance is getting more bare bones, so let\'s get costs down and let\'s improve quality and that includes emphasizing prevention. As Dot and I were walking in, there\'s a poster outside that says 25% of South Carolinians have heart disease. We stopped and starred at it. I was shocked at that high figure, Mayor. We\'ve got to do more to help people keep themselves healthy. We don\'t pay for prevention in America. If you are diabetic, a lot of insurance companies won\'t pay for you to have your feet checked or your eyes checked but if you have to have your foot amputated, they\'ll pay for the operation. That\'s just upside down and backwards. So we\'ve got to get to a point where we are paying for prevention and then we have to cover everybody. I think the time has come because doctors, nurses, hospitals, employers, labor, everybody realizes we are losing jobs in the global economy because we don\'t have the health care system that can effectively deliver health care with high value at lower cost. But then we also have to restore competence to our government. Now I never thought that would be an applause line that you stand up and say ""we got to get our government to be competent,\' but after Katrina. We have to end the no-bid contracts, we have to get rid of the cronyism in government and we have to get back to an old fashioned idea of appointing qualified people to the positions they hold in the United States Government. In particular, we\'ve got to have a Justice Department that functions again. Today I released my agenda to restore and strengthen the civil rights mission of the Department of Justice. It is a five-point plan that will meet the challenges of this time. The first is to begin undoing the damage of the past years. I want an Attorney General who will conduct a thorough review and report back with recommendations on how to restore the Department\'s traditional role in enforcing civil rights and respecting the rule of law. The Attorney General should also review charges of improper, politically motivated hiring and firing to determine whether laws have been broken. Remember it was Republican U.S Attorneys who really sounded the alarm about all the partisan activity going on in the Justice Department. We cannot have that, ladies and gentleman. We have to believe that justice is blind in America. And we have to fully fund the Civil Rights Division. We\'ve got to get back to allowing local communities to look for ways to pursue integration and reduce racial inequality. The court\'s action in its recent case was a big setback to voluntary efforts that local communities had adopted themselves; nobody ordered them to, they decided what they wanted to do. And we\'ve got to give some money and expertise to local communities to help them figure out how best to fulfill the meaning of the equal protection clause. I want to lead a great effort to fight discrimination in the workplace. A recent study found a shocking fact. Employers were twice as likely to hire a white applicant with the very same qualifications as a black applicant. And even hired at a greater percentage, white applicants with criminal records over black applicants without one. Anyone who says that we have gotten beyond racial discrimination is not living with their eyes open. I believe we have to shine a bright light on any discrimination, whether it be against people of color or against women and make sure that we truly fulfill our laws, not just by the letter but by the spirit. I also want to clean up our elections and I have introduced legislation to do that and we\'re attempting to get a bill through the Congress. We have to prosecute and punish deceptive practices, you\'ve heard about them. People come out of church and there\'s a flier on the window, under the windshield wiper and it says you\'re supposed to vote on Wednesday not Tuesday. Or people pick up the phone and a voice says ""we\'re just calling to inform you that if you\'re ever even had a traffic ticket you cannot vote."" All kinds of deceptive practices. And then we\'ve got the new challenge of the identification requirements, which are in many respects, discriminating against the poor, the elderly. I see that in New York, in New York City we have a lot of people that don\'t have a driver\'s license because they take the subway and now in order to be able to vote they have to produce something like a driver\'s license. So we\'ve got to make sure that we are not disenfranchising Americans after having spent fifty years trying to extend the franchise to every single American. I would also like to see us modernize and strengthen our laws against hate crimes and generally reassert our belief that we are stronger when we respect and protect the rights of every single one of us. And of course we must begin to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we can. The reality is this is a sectarian civil war --there is no military solution. Our young men and women who wear the uniform of our country have performed heroically and with great honor and dedication and they have done what they were asked to do. They were given a mission and they have fulfilled it. They were asked to get rid of Saddam Hussein and bring him to justice and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections and they did as well and they were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time to make the political decisions that only the Iraqis can make for themselves. So their mission has been completed. Unfortunately neither the Iraqi government, nor our government, have done what they needed to do politically and diplomatically to deal with the challenges in Iraq. The people voted for change in November 2006. We have been fighting for change in the Congress. And I hope that the President will work with us to start bringing our troops home, engage in a very concerted effort to get the Iraqis to make the tough decisions they have to make and start a diplomatic process in the region and the world to try to bring more countries into the effort to stabilize Iraq going forward. But if the President does not end the war in Iraq, then the next President must. That has to be part of what happens as soon as possible. So I believe that America is ready for change and it\'s change that is part of the American character and experience. You know, we believe in change. We are the people of the future. When you travel around the world as I\'ve been privileged to do, it\'s striking how own in places near and far, they are looking backwards not forwards. When I was First Lady and I would represent our country and I would go to meetings with presidents and prime ministers and other dignitaries, often just as an ice breaker, I would say ""so how are things going here in whatever country I was in."" I cannot tell you how many times people started their answers by talking about something that happened 500 or 1000 years ago. ""Well things are fine except, you know, if it hadn\'t been for that war 800 years ago, things would be a lot better."" We are the people of the future and we need to start acting like that again. There is no problem we face in the world that we cannot meet. If we decide as Americans we will do that. You cannot be a leader if no one is following and right now our country has to rebuild our standing and position in the world because there is no problem we face whether it be global terrorism or global warming or global epidemics that we can take on by ourselves. So it\'s important that we give back so that feeling of confidence and optimism that has marked our country over these long centuries of progress and hope. When Jim was talking about my own life, I did start out as a young lawyer working for a native South Carolinian, Marion Wright Edelman at the Children\'s Defense Fund and I remember being so struck by how dedicated she and everyone working with her were to making it possible to change lives one at a time. I went door to door finding children who weren\'t in school because in those days, so many children were kept out of school if they had minor disabilities, if the had to take care of their siblings. And that was only 30 years ago. We had millions of children who weren\'t even going to school. And then we passed the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act and we began to reach out to every single child. That\'s what I believe we do at our best. We reach out to one another. And I\'m going to do everything I can; working with you to make the change happen that America is yearning for. I know it\'s not easy. There are lots of reasons why people would stop trying to get health care for everyone or trying to get a new energy policy that took the tax breaks away from the oil companies. If it were easy, anyone would do it. We do it because we are Americans. We can\'t let ourselves be stopped by the partisan bickering or the divisiveness or the enormity of the challenges we face. There are those who will say it can\'t be done. There always are. But as James Baldwin once noted, ""those who say it can\'t be done are usually interrupted by others doing it."" For nearly 100 years, the NAACP has been interrupting the nay-sayers; changing laws and changing lives. That\'s why I\'m honored to be with you tonight and I\'m honored to walk alongside you in the march for justice. I look forward to continuing that march in the months and years ahead. Because it leads to the destination that is America\'s destiny -- that more perfect union, that place where not only we look at one another and recognize those inalienable rights, but we work to make sure that every single child has a chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. And that Americas goodness and greatness is recognized across the world. Thank you all and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 17, 2007","b'Remarks in Des Moines, Iowa on American Health Choices Plan'","b'I am honored to be here with you today at Broadlawns Medical Center. For many years, as you\'ve heard, this Center has been providing care for the people of this community including many of those most in need and I cannot think of a better place to discuss America\'s health care crisis than a medical center that confronts the consequences every single day.I want to thank Jody Jenner, Broadlawns\' President and CEO, along with the Board and the staff of this fine medical center. I want to thank Lisa Bechtel, a proud SEIU nurse along with her colleagues who take care of the people who come through the doors here seeking help and support. And I want to thank Susan Kirstein, the Chief Nursing Executive. I\'m a strong, strong supporter of nurses and I appreciate the role that they play and I\'m looking forward to expanding that role because I think it will be important to do so in the future of health care as I see it. And to the entire staff of Broadlawns, thank you for being on the frontline. The statistics that you\'ve heard are just really a snapshot. So many of the patients here come because they have needs that are not being met elsewhere and I hear their stories across our country and I\'ve certainly heard them here in Iowa. I want to start by telling you about Judy Rose, who I met last month in Dubuque along with her husband John. Back in 2001, John lost his job of thirty years when the plant where he worked closed with just one day\'s notice. And so, Judy and John lost not only John\'s job, they lost their health insurance. A couple of months later, Judy was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully a special government program started during my husband\'s administration took care of her treatment and she recovered. But then in 2003, John had a heart attack. He spent hours in surgery and was in the intensive care unit. Fortunately he survived, but when the bills came, their luck ran out. The costs of John\'s care were so high they had to sell the home they lived in for thirty years. That is the tragedy at the heart of our health care system -- The devastation when one stroke of bad luck undoes a lifetime of hard work. That feeling of being right on the edge that eats away not just at the 47 million who don\'t have health care, but many of the 250 million who do. It\'s the heartbreak you feel when your spouse asks, ""can we afford my pills this month,"" and you don\'t know the answer. When your sick child asks, ""can I see a doctor,"" and you can\'t bear to answer. When you ask your doctor, ""will my insurance pay for that,"" and from the look on her face, you already know the answer. It\'s what has led to so many people in so many places over so many years to ask me, ""what are you going to do about health care for America?"" And then more quietly, ""and what am I going to do about health care for me and my family?"" Well I\'m here today because I believe it is long past time that this nation had an answer. That\'s why I\'m running for President, because I believe America is ready for change. Because like you, I remember how we entered the 21st century; filled with hope, ready to seize the promise of a more prosperous nation and a more peaceful world. But like you, I\'ve seen how in the last six and a half years, we\'ve done just the opposite. We\'ve gotten mired in another country\'s civil war, a war without a military solution. We have failed to invest in our future, in our schools, technology, science and infrastructure. And we\'re falling behind. Costs are rising and wages are lagging. Premiums have almost doubled -- up 80, no, up 98% since 2000. And half of all personal bankruptcies in America are caused by medical bills. If there was ever a need for change in America it is now. And if there was ever a moment to do what America does best, to confront the challenges we face, this is it. That\'s what we\'ve always done, whether it was Teddy Roosevelt busting the trusts, or FDR seeking to end elderly poverty, whether it was President Truman sending the GIs to college and into the middle class, or President Johnson ensuring health care for all Americans in their golden years and who were poor. When the time for change came, we weren\'t afraid, we didn\'t look away, we came together and we made American stronger, more prosperous, and more fair. We are and have always been a nation of opportunity -- a nation that believes in giving everyone a chance to make the most of their own lives. And of course we believe in responsibility. But when families are struggling, when they don\'t have the basic necessities that allows them to see these opportunities, we don\'t leave them to fend for themselves. Unfortunately that\'s exactly what we\'ve seen in the past six and a half years. Instead of an era of opportunity, we\'ve had a ""you\'re on your own"" era. So many people, families who can\'t afford health care, young people who can\'t afford college, seniors who can\'t afford to retire, it\'s like they are invisible to the President, like he\'s looked right through them. Well, I don\'t think anyone in America should be invisible. I believe every child should have a world class education, every worker should have a job with good wages and good benefits, every American should have a secure retirement. And today, as we strive for a new beginning to the 21st century, I believe everyone, every man, woman and child, should have quality, affordable health care in America. We should do it. We should do it because in this new economy, when people move jobs more than ever before, their health insurance should move with them. We should do it because doctors and nurses, not insurance company employees, should be calling the shots on patient care. We should do it because solving the health care crisis is key to ensuring American competitiveness in the global marketplace. We should do it because in a nation where we split the atom, sent a man to the moon, mapped the human genome, where we have some of the most promising treatments and cures available, hard working people should get the care they need when they\'re sick. And we should do it because it is the right thing to do. Because we can no longer tolerate the injustice of a system that shuts out nearly one in six Americans. Ultimately this is about who we are as a people and what we stand for. We can talk all we want about freedom and opportunity, about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but what does all that mean to a mother or father who can\'t take a sick child to the doctor? To someone who can\'t take the job of his dreams because it doesn\'t offer health care? To a family filing for bankruptcy or losing their home because their medical bills were just too high? We are the richest country in the world and we spend right now, more on health care than anyone else in the world. Two trillion dollars a year. But we\'re ranked 31st in life expectancy and 40th in child mortality. Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don\'t have health care. Let me repeat that. Here in America, people are dying because they couldn\'t get the care they needed when they were sick. At the same time, over the past six and a half years, the special interests have had a field day at the expense of the middle class and hard-working families. Just look at our prescription drug program. It doesn\'t allow Medicare to use its purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices. So every year, billions of dollars go straight from the pockets of families to the profits of drug companies. This is unconscionable, it is intolerable and it is time to put an end to it. It is time for us to come together and to start living up to our own values. To provide quality, affordable health care for every single American. And I intend to be the president who accomplishes that goal finally for our country. Now as you may know, I\'ve been fighting on health care for nearly thirty years. Starting as First Lady of Arkansas, where I headed a task force to improve rural health care. And most memorably of course back in the early 1990s, and I still have the scars to show from that exercise. But I\'ve also learned some valuable lessons that have shaped how I approach health care reform today. First, I think we have all learned that America needs to provide health insurance for all Americans. The last twelve years have shown how left on their own, this crisis and those who contribute to it, and people from all corners of our economy will see our situation deteriorate. A growing number of CEOs and union leaders are coming together because they agree that now is the right time to renew the national call for quality, affordable health care. When Andy Stern, the president of SEIU stands with Lee Scott, the President of Wal-Mart, and they both demand health care reform that covers everyone, you know we\'re ready for change. Second, I learned that people who are satisfied with their current coverage, want assurances that they can keep it. Part of our health care system is the best in the world and we should build on it. Part is broken, and we should fix it. The first rule of medicine is do no harm. And we will do no harm to the parts of our system that are working. Instead, we will build on them. That means not just expanding coverage, but also cutting costs and improving quality, so that we will have health care for all, and better health care for all. Because we need to address the concerns of those who have insurance, as well as those who do not. That\'s why I started my path to this place here, at Broadlawns, with a series of health care speeches. I gave a speech on lowering health care costs which helps everyone in the system. And I gave a speech on improving quality, which also helps everyone. Third, I learned how important it is to present a plan that is clear and easy to understand. Today\'s plan is simpler, yet still bold. Now I know my Republican opponents will try to equate health care for all Americans with government run health care. Well don\'t let them fool us again. This is not government run. There will be no new bureaucracy. You can keep the doctors you know and trust. You keep the insurance you have if you like it. But this plan expands personal choice and increases competition to keep costs down. Fourth, I learned about how to build the national consensus you need to get health care passed. My plan is the result of discussions with many people: doctors and nurses, hospitals administrators, and lawyers, unions and most importantly, America\'s families, who are frustrated with the system we have now. I have been asking a lot of questions and doing a lot of listening. Having spent six years in the Senate, I know that fixing health care will require political will to get the votes we need, and it will take a movement for change, a solid national consensus for reform that can withstand the impact of the special interests. And I will work to build that movement throughout my campaign and as your President. Because in the end, change is just a word unless you have the strength and experience to make it happen. These are new times and this is a new plan. And when it comes to health care reform, I believe I have exactly the experience we need to get it done in my first term as President. While I was disappointed by what happened in 1994, I did not give up. I continued to fight. I worked to expand coverage step by step, person by person. I began working to expand and improve health care for children, helping to create the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program. It\'s known as the HAWK-I program here in Iowa. That program provides insurance for more than six million low-income children. And I worked to create the Vaccines for Children Program. Today, childhood immunizations are at an all-time high. I worked to ensure that new prescription drugs are tested not just for adults, but for children too. And I wrote legislation in the Senate to get that accomplished, because children should have access to the best and safest treatment and cures available. I also worked as First Lady to ensure that breast and cervical cancer treatment would be covered by Medicaid. And I helped to establish the commission that recognized Gulf War Illness as the serious problem it is for our vets who served in the first Gulf War, and we began to address it. In the Senate I\'ve worked to expand health care to our men and women in uniform. Believe it or not, many of our National Guard and Reserve members, the men and women who have been called to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan did not have health insurance for themselves or their families when they were activating. I\'m proud of the legislation I passed to address that glaring problem. I\'ve been fighting more generally to improve health care for veterans because it is outrageous that so many service members are returning home and being told to take a number and wait in line for the health care they need. And I will pass what\'s called the Heroes at Home legislation that helps those affected by traumatic brain injury and supports their families. I\'m fighting to improve care for our seniors, to lower prescription drug costs by empowering Medicare to negotiate with drug companies and by allowing imports of our drugs from Canada at lower prices. And finally, following the horrific attacks of 9/11, I fought the EPA and the Bush administration when they claimed that the air at Ground Zero was safe -- safe for our first responders and emergency workers; safe for our construction and building trade workers; safe for our residents and our volunteers. It wasn\'t. So I fought for health care for all of the first responders, the workers, the volunteers and residents who have gotten sick and some have even died. And I will keep fighting to protect them until they have the care they need. I know that reforming health care takes a consensus for change. That\'s what I\'ve been doing -- building that consensus vote by vote, working to bring people together, to get my colleagues from across the aisle to join our cause. Unfortunately back in 1993 and 94 too many of our opponents adopted a strategy that allowed them to ""just say no."" They said no, not just to our health care plan, but any health care plan. And the current administration hasn\'t even tried. In fact, the President\'s most newsworthy contribution on health care was his recent threat to veto coverage for low-income children. Well, today Americans are impatient. We\'ve seen that doing nothing makes the problem worse. We\'ve gone from 39 million uninsured in 1994 to 47 million today. From spending 14% of our Gross Domestic Product for health care to spending 16%. And now we are spending 50% more per person than the next highest spending country in the world, Switzerland, which has high quality and good outcomes for the people there. So today we are spending more money and covering fewer people and too many of our families are paying the price. We know we have to act. And so the question is, if union leaders and employers can come together, that the Mayo Clinic has just done an extensive survey including 400 experts coming to a report urging that we have health care reform, if Democratic and Republican Governors and legislatures can work together on health care, if doctors, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, CEOs, small business owners can all agree that it is time for a change, then why can\'t Washington? I believe that together we can change Washington by sticking to our principles and reaching out to find common ground. America faces a choice: continue the status quo as more and more people lose coverage or change our system to cover all of our people. I believe that is America\'s choice, to do something about health care -- America\'s choice to tackle problems of cost, quality, and coverage. It should be every American\'s choice to have the kind of health care that they want. That choice is at the heart of my plan. I call my plan, the American Health Choices plan. This plan is the result of a thorough analysis of the nature and extent of the health care crisis, starting with the reality that roughly eight in ten of the uninsured, those who come through the doors of this Medical Center, come from working families, most are middle class. And families earning between $25,000 and $75,000 dollars a year are the fasted growing group of the uninsured. We all know that younger adults, ages 25-34 and older adults, ages 45-64, are the most susceptible to losing insurance coverage, indicating that it\'s hard to obtain coverage when you first start out in the world of work and harder to maintain it as you age and experience health problems. Finally, employer sponsored health insurance is on the decline. In 2007, 60% of employers offered health benefits, down from 69% six years ago. This is at a time when people are changing jobs more frequently than ever before. Many Americans are now self-employed, running businesses out of their homes and they struggle to buy health insurance. My plan takes all of these realities into account and addresses them head on. And this plan isn\'t just my plan. It\'s the product of hundreds of discussions with thousands of people in hospitals, and union halls, homes and businesses across America and going forward in this campaign and then as President, I\'m going to keep reaching out, asking for ideas, not just in improving and enacting the plan, but in the daily work to make it a reality. Now here\'s how this plan would work. If you have private insurance you like, nothing changes -- you can keep that insurance. If you like the doctor you have, you can keep seeing that doctor. If you like the hospital where you receive care, you can keep receiving care at that hospital. If, however, you don\'t have health insurance or you don\'t like the insurance you have, you can choose from the same wide variety of private plans that members of Congress choose from. I\'m calling it a Health Choices Menu. So essentially the Congressional health care plan becomes the American health care plan. The idea here is simple. The American people should have access to the same array of health care choices and benefits as the Senators and Representatives they elect. You will also have as one of those choices a public plan, just like Medicare is a public plan. You will have access to a public plan that will provide a stable, competitive alternative to private insurance if that is your choice. My plan does not create a single new government department, agency, or bureaucracy. It is not a government takeover of health care. It is a public-private partnership that provides more choices. If you\'re an employer, you choose whichever plan is best for your business. If you\'re an individual, you choose whichever plan is best for you and your family and we will provide tax credit to ensure that you can pay for it. Now whether you keep the insurance you have, or you choose one of the options in the Health Choices Menu, you will have the following guaranteed: First, you will never be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions or risk factors. Insurance companies will no longer be allowed to discriminate against high risk patients or charge exorbitant premiums to screen them out. So whether you were sick in the past or a genetic test shows you may get sick in the future, you will never again have to worry about finding affordable coverage. Second, your coverage will be guaranteed. If you pay your premiums and follow the rules your insurance company will be required to renew your coverage each year at a price you can afford, even if you lose your job, even if you decide to start your own business or stay home with your children for a few years. Third, your coverage will be affordable. My plan provides tax credits to make health care both universal and affordable for everyone. These new tax credits guarantee that you\'ll never pay more than a certain percentage of your income for your premium. No more worrying that one illness or one accident will lead to financial ruin. Fourth, you will always have an option for coverage that is fully affordable. I will require insurance companies in the Health Choices Menu to let you take your plan with you as you move from job to job or even state to state. Now exactly, how will all of this be possible? Well it\'s going to take shared responsibility. Everyone with a stake in our health care system will have to step forward and do their part. While I will be requiring all Americans to have health care, I will be calling on employers to do their part as well. Today, large American companies compete in a global economy against companies in countries that impose far lower health care burdens on employers and many of our manufacturers are struggling to pay for retiree health commitments that our foreign competitors simply don\'t have. Under my plan, large companies will be required to help pay for their employees\' health care. Those that do so can simply maintain their current policy that they choose. Those that don\'t, will need to contribute towards the cost of covering their employees on a sliding scale based on their size and average wages. My plan also helps American manufacturers become more competitive by providing a tax credit for those struggling with the high cost of retiree health benefits. These costs are making it virtually impossible for American manufacturers to compete with their foreign counterparts, who don\'t have these kinds of costs. How can we possibly compete if a car company like General Motors pays $1,635 in health care cost per car produced while Toyota is only paying $215 per car? And think about the retirees who rely on these benefits today. People have accepted lower wages over the years in return for the promise of a secure retirement. The tax credit I provide will help employers cover catastrophic costs above a certain threshold -- costs incurred by a few retirees with the most of your health problems, costs that can run hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single person. This relief will be a temporary measure designed to address the needs of the aging baby boomers and it will be available not just to qualifying private sector manufacturers but to states to help pay retiree costs for teachers, police officers, fire fighters, and others. In return for this assistance, companies will have to modernize their plans with initiatives to cut waste and improve quality -- and they will have to show that they\'re using the tax credits to enhance their competitiveness and support their workers. We also know that health care costs are plaguing too many of our small businesses. That\'s a serious problem, because small businesses are now the engine of job creation in America. According to the Federal Reserve, since 1990, companies with fewer than 20 employees were responsible for 80% of the additional new jobs in America -- jobs that often cannot be outsourced. But at the same time, small businesses face higher premiums because of their limited purchasing power, and they tend to employ lower-income workers. As a result, they cover far fewer of their employees. And that coverage is eroding. Since 2000, the percentage of small businesses offering benefits has fallen from 57 percent to 45 percent. Now, under my plan, we won\'t require small businesses to cover employees. Instead we will provide tax credits to ensure that many of them do. These tax credits will be based on size and average wages, so that small businesses can provide health care without destroying their bottom line. This credit could be as high as 50% of premiums for firms with fewer than 25 employees. It\'s a good start that small businesses are leading the way in creating new jobs. My goal is for them to create new jobs with good health care benefits as well. Government also needs to do its part to promote shared responsibility. Under my plan, the government will provide tax-credits to insure that every single American can afford health insurance. The government will also invest in measures to improve health care quality and cut costs. This will result in dramatic savings which I will use to continue to make health care affordable. I outlined my cost-saving measures in a speech back in May. I proposed a seven-point plan to save $120 billion nationally each year by bringing our health care system into the twenty-first century: by transitioning from outdated paper records to an electronic medical records system; by getting our chronic disease management costs under control; by allowing companies to compete for Medicare\'s prescription drug business, and more. Last month in New Hampshire, I laid out my agenda to improve health care quality: a plan to raise standards, educate patients and help our doctors and nurses provide world-class care. Taken together these policies could save hundreds of dollars a year for the average American family, and make Americans healthier. Individuals will have to share the responsibility as well. Much like drivers in most states are required to purchase car insurance, all Americans will have a responsibility to get and keep health insurance in a system where insurance will now be affordable. The sad reality is that the uninsured don\'t just struggle with costs themselves, they impose costs on the rest of us. It\'s a hidden tax. The high cost of emergency room visits that could have been prevented by a much less expensive doctor\'s appointment, the cost of unpaid medical bills that lead insurance companies to raise rates on the rest of us. Covering these individuals is the only way to get rid of these hidden taxes. The only way to guarantee affordable coverage for everyone is to cover everyone, and that is the choice we need for America. Finally, I\'ll call on drug companies and insurance companies to do their part as well. It is time that we put patients, not drug companies and insurance companies, first. That means changing the way they do business. Now clearly with drug companies we have to do more to get generic drugs to market, including the new biologics that are coming into the marketplace and are often extremely expensive. We do have to provide more negotiation to get drug prices down and to import from Canada and other countries that are similar to ours. Because ultimately, the American tax payer pays for the development of a lot of these drugs through NIH grants and other kinds of research grants; we pay for the clinical trials, and then we pay the highest prices in the world. And we\'re going to begin to rein that in. It also means changing the way insurance companies do business in America. I will start by banning insurance company discrimination. Right now, insurance companies have free reign to cherry pick the healthiest patients and shut out anyone who seems to them like a bad risk. Insurance companies spend $50 billion a year on elaborate calculations and schemes to figure out how not to insure people. $50 billion trying to shut out those who need care the most. And everyday they deny people coverage because of pre-existing conditions or the result of genetic testing. Think about what this might mean down the road with advances in genetic testing. The vast majority of us could wind up being bad risks because genetically most of us will probably show we are susceptible to something and therefore we will become uninsurable. So one of the urgencies behind this plan now is that the insurance industry as it has been constructed and executed over decades now will no longer be able to take care of increasing numbers of Americans if they stick with the policy that eliminates our fellow citizens. This legalized discrimination against the sickest of Americans is unfair and immoral and it defeats one of the central purposes of insurance, which is to share risk. My plan puts an end to this. It forces insurance companies to compete based on cost and quality, not how skillfully they can weed out the sickest patients. My plan also has a prevention initiative, requiring the insurance industry and public programs like Medicare and Medicaid to promote wellness as well as treat illness and provide every American with comprehensive preventive care. Today we pay doctors and hospitals to treat diseases and injuries but not to prevent them from occurring in the first place. In fact, we\'ve made it increasingly difficult for doctors to do that because of the way insurance companies reimburse physicians. Diabetes care is a perfect example. Many insurance companies won\'t pay for a diabetic to see a nutritionist to learn how to eat properly or a podiatrist to get their feet checked, but if you wind up having to have your foot amputated from complications due to diabetes, the insurance company will pay for that. And if you ask why, the insurance company will tell you, they don\'t want to pay for preventive health care because the patient might switch to a different company and they will lose the benefit of the investment in prevention. But if a patient needs his foot amputated, the reason he goes, the insurance company is pretty much stuck with that on their watch. Now that is upside down and backwards and I\'m going to change it because I think it\'s time we focused on keeping people healthy, not just on treating them when they become sick. Now I know that these proposals will not make me the insurance industry woman of the year. But I don\'t think I\'ve been in the running for that title since 1993. At the same time, I truly believe there are plenty of people in the insurance industry who wish their companies did not make a profit by excluding the woman who discovers she\'s genetically predisposed towards getting breast cancer, or by burdening the family whose child has autism with unmanageable premiums. The idea is not to put the health insurance industry out of business, but to help it find a better way to make a living. Under my plan, insurance company employees will have a whole new set of incentives. They will wake up everyday and focus on making profits by providing the highest quality care at the lowest cost and they\'ll never again be torn between turning a profit and improving the health care of individuals who make sure of communities and our country. Now, how will I pay for this plan? First let me tell you how I will not pay for it. I won\'t pay for it by pouring money into a broken system. I won\'t pay for it by raising taxes on middle class families who are already struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. Instead, I\'ll pay for part of it by implementing the cost saving measures I outlined in May. And I will pay for some of it by rolling back part of President Bush\'s fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the highest income Americans. And I\'ll pay for some of it by limiting the tax breaks for people making over $250,000 a year to the same level that ordinary, middle class Americans get. Right now, the highest income Americans get some of the most generous health care benefits and the most generous tax deductions to go with them. Well-off Americans should be able to deduct the cost of the same quality health plan that middle-income families can deduct. If they want to receive extra benefits beyond what most middle income families get, they should pay for it themselves, not have tax payers foot the bill for them. Announcing my plan today is just one step in a larger process. In the coming months, I will continue to reach out to people all across America and ask for their ideas and their reactions. Because, to truly reform health care in America, we need more than a plan. We need a movement -- a movement of people determined to change the system who will not rest until we succeed. Lisa Scott from Greenville, Iowa, whom I met back in May, is one of those people. Six years ago, Lisa\'s daughter, Janelle, began having chest pains and black outs. She was sick for almost a year. Janelle requested a chest x-ray, but she never received it, because while she was working two jobs, she didn\'t have health insurance, and she couldn\'t afford to pay for it out of her own pocket, One week after being denied the chest x-ray, at the age of 18, Janelle died. Her death certificate listed the cause of death as unknown, because Janelle was never able to afford a proper diagnosis, a diagnosis that with care might have saved her life. It\'s too late to help her daughter, but Lisa Scott hasn\'t stopped speaking out and calling on us to come together and fix our health care system. She is determined to help other families, to spare them the loss and pain that her family felt. Now that is who we are at our best. We are a nation where people help those they\'ve never even met. Where we do understand we are all in this together, that when a child is sick and can\'t see a doctor, the family loses everything because someone had an accident, when a mother or a father lies awake at night worrying about how they possibly care for the people they love. That diminishes all of us. Now after 1994, when people asked me if I was going to give up on health care reform, I always had the same answer. Why would I give up on America and the American people? For so many years I have listened to their stories. I carry these stories with me everyday. And perhaps more than anyone else, I know just how hard this fight will be. But that is why I\'m running for President, because I\'m ready with you to help write a new story. The story about how we finally put aside our differences to face up to one of our greatest challenges. The story of how people of good faith and good will came together and worked out a solution because they cared too much about our country and their fellow citizens to let this crisis continue. The story of how everyone took responsibility, we all did our part, and we became a healthier, stronger, more prosperous nation because of it. We owe that to the Rose family. We owe that to the memory of Janelle and to her family. We owe that to every family in America. Today, we have an opportunity to make history together. As President, I will seize that opportunity and I hope all of you will join me. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 4, 2007","b'Remarks at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC'","b'The Carnegie Institution for Science, as President Meserve just briefly recounted, has such a distinguished history. It has a record of supporting groundbreaking discoveries from Edwin Hubble\'s work in astronomy to more recent breakthroughs in our understanding of genetics and the function of RNA and as part of that work was honored with a Nobel Prize just a few years ago.I could not imagine a more appropriate place to discuss our nation\'s commitment to scientific discovery and innovation. Nor could I imagine a more appropriate day. It is not a coincidence that we are doing this today. Fifty years ago today, in a remote, sparsely inhabited region of the former Soviet Union the world\'s first artificial satellite took flight. This hollow aluminum sphere named Sputnik -- which contained little more than a battery, radio transmitters, and an internal cooling system -- caught America off guard and changed the course of history. Sputnik transmitted a signal from orbit and through it the Soviet Union sent a signal to the world. Even ham radio operators could hear it: the Soviets had won the first leg of the space race. Now many of you have probably known before you came today that this is the anniversary of Sputnik and I bet none of you bought an anniversary card. But I have been fascinated by Sputnik ever since I was a little girl and as I have moved on in life and become involved in the public service and public office holding of our nation, I have spent time reflecting on what Sputnik meant and what our nation did in response. Historic decisions were made in the days, months, and years following Sputnik and I think we had a great response as a nation. Less than two weeks after news of Sputnik swept the globe, President Eisenhower called a meeting of his Science Advisory Committee and asked for recommendations. He would come to rely on that panel for unvarnished, evidence-based scientific advice. Shortly after that first meeting, President Eisenhower addressed the nation. It was a sober yet optimistic assessment. Yes, the Soviets had made gains which carried implications for our security and our economy. Yes, we had work to do. But there was no reason to fear, because America, he said, stood at the ready to draw on our ""voluntary heroism, sacrifice, and accomplishment when the chips are down."" Then we set about proving it. In February of 1958, four months after Sputnik\'s launch, America launched DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. By July of that year, Congress passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, creating NASA and ushering in the missions that would define the space race: Mercury and Gemini. In September 1958, President Eisenhower signed into law the National Defense Education Act to advance at every level our ability to compete and innovate: math and science education in primary and secondary schools, college loans, graduate fellowships, vocational training. I remember as though it were yesterday when my 5th grade teacher Mrs. Kraus came into our classroom and told us we had to study math and science because the President said so. I was convinced President Eisenhower had called up Mrs. Kraus and told her ""you tell those children and particularly that Hillary, who doesn\'t really like math that much, that her country needs her."" In 1961, President Kennedy created the Apollo project, and declared that our nation would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth by the end of the decade. By 1969 we had done it. By 1972, we had done it 12 times over. It was a national, bipartisan effort. It was a public, private partnership. We bolstered investment in research -- and encouraged children to learn math and science. We asked young people to become scientists and engineers -- and helped them pay for their degrees with new National Science Foundation fellowships. We believed that we could, by rolling up our sleeves and getting to work, do what we all knew we had to. Begin to demonstrate that America still was the leader in science and innovation. We set big goals. We didn\'t give in to our fears, we confronted them. We didn\'t deny tough facts, we responded to them. We didn\'t ignore big challenges, we met them. Once again, we proved, as President Eisenhower had predicted, that when the chips are down it is always a mistake to bet against America. Fifty years ago, Sputnik marked the dawn of the Space Age and the beginning of a new era filled with new challenges. Fifty years later, there is no single, galvanizing event to steel our resolve and to lift our eyes to the heavens. The challenges we face are more complex and interconnected. From the rise of globalization to the threat of global warming. These challenges require big ideas and bold thinking. But instead of fostering a climate of discovery and innovation, the Bush administration has declared war on science. The record is breathtaking: banning the most promising kinds of stem cell research, allowing political appointees to censor studies on climate change, muzzling global warming experts like Dr. James Hansen, overruling doctors and the FDA on emergency contraception, suppressing and manipulating data on mercury pollution, even delaying one report which found that 8 percent of women between 16 and 49 years of age have mercury levels in their blood that could harm future children, denying the risks of toxins like asbestos in the air after the 9/11 attacks, overruling scientists who sought to protect animals under the Endangered Species Act, eliminating scientific committees at the Department of Health and Human Services that did not parrot the politically accepted ideology -- or packing those committees with industry insiders, altering scientific tests on the lead content of children\'s lunch boxes -- and appointing a lead industry consultant to a key panel formed by the Centers for Disease Control, barring a USDA researcher from publishing or even discussing his work on antibiotic resistant bacteria, censoring government websites on breast cancer research, contraception, climate change, and so much else. To paraphrase Stephen Colbert, this administration doesn\'t make decisions on facts. It makes facts based on decisions. And to further paraphrase - my predecessor, the extraordinary late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynahan, everyone is entitled to his own opinion but no one is entitled to his own facts. For six and half years under President Bush, it has been open season on open inquiry. They\'ve tried to turn Washington into an evidence-free zone. And by ignoring or manipulating science, the Bush administration is putting our future at risk and letting our economic competitors get an edge in the global economy. Well, when I am President, I will end this assault on science. [Applause] I will reaffirm our commitment to basic research, invest in clean energy, combat global warming, create the millions of jobs that I think come from doing both of those, reemphasize math and science education, and ensure that America is training the future innovators of our country. America will once again be the innovation nation. What America achieved after Sputnik is a symbol of what Americans can do now as we confront a new global economy, new environmental challenges, and the promise of new discoveries in medicine. America led in the 20th century, and we saw the benefits of that. As Richard referenced, probably half of our Gross Domestic Product increase since the end of World War II can be traced to investments in science and research in both the public and the private sector, of course fueled by non profit organizations like the Carnegie Institution. With a renewed commitment to scientific integrity and innovation, I know we can lead in the 21st century. First, when I am President, I will lift the current ban on ethical stem cell research. [Applause] In 2001, President Bush issued an Executive Order banning federal funding for some of the most promising avenues of stem cell research. And this year -- yet again -- he vetoed legislation to open up new lines of embryonic stem cells for federal funding. Every day, we are learning more about the opportunities this kind of research offers. Within these cells may lie the cures for Parkinson\'s disease, Alzheimer\'s, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, Huntington\'s and more. 100 million Americans live with these conditions -- and their families live with them too. The President\'s ban on stem cell funding amounts to a ban on hope. It\'s as if these families are invisible to their President. Meanwhile, our scientists and world class research institutions are hamstrung. One report found that researchers have had to set up duplicate systems and equipment to keep federally approved stem cell research efforts separate from the kind that the President has banned by Executive Order. In one lab, researchers use one kind of pen for federally funded research, and another for privately funded research. One stem cell scientist at University of California at San Francisco was conducting research when the power went out -- including the power to the freezers that held the stem cells on which she has spent two years working. There was no back up power and the only freezers cold enough were federally funded. The result? Two years of research literally melting away. States have tried to pick up the slack, as have private individuals. But because states and private institutions are prohibited from doing this research in labs funded by federal dollars, even a penny of federal money disqualifies the labs. They\'ve been forced to build new labs and buy new equipment. So instead of forging ahead on the science, we have spent money on redundancy and duplication. So far they\'ve only been able to spend 15 percent of their funding on actual research. And some of our brightest minds are forced to head overseas to do their research. Two renowned cancer researchers, for example, a husband and wife team, decided to leave the National Cancer Institute right here in our country for the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Singapore. One half of the pair said this: ""We wanted to be in a place where they are excited by science and things are moving upward."" That should be America -- and it can be again. But today, countries from Singapore to the United Kingdom are filling the biotech gap that the President has created. One report recently found that the percentage of research papers on embryonic stem cell science authored by researchers in the United States has dropped from more than a third of all published to roughly one quarter in just three years. And that negative trend may continue. When I\'m President, therefore, one of my first acts will be to lift the ban on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. But we have to go much further than that if we expect to restore scientific integrity. Secondly, I will end the politicization of scientific research that has marked the Bush Administration and restore a climate of scientific integrity and innovation. We will no longer place ideology ahead of evidence. I\'ll reverse President Bush\'s recent directive which expands the power of political appointees in agencies and reduces the role of experts. I\'ll stop political appointees from manipulating scientific conclusions in government publications and prevent the suppression of public statements by government scientists. We\'ll commit to a national assessment on climate change that goes above and beyond any requirement in the law. And I\'ll demand that all agencies prevent political pressure from affecting scientific research and the free and open exchange of ideas. As part of this effort, I will restore the integrity and independence of advisory committees and strengthen whistleblower protections for those who expose potential political interference. When I\'m President, scientific integrity will not be the exception -- it will be the rule. That\'s why I\'ve been fighting for these issues in the Senate. One particular battle that I led involved emergency contraception, known as Plan B, which can prevent unintended pregnancies. Two FDA commissioners -- both appointed by President Bush -- blocked Plan B from being sold over-the-counter for years, overruling the FDA\'s medical experts, advisors, and the recommendation of the American Medical Association. And so, teaming up with Senator Patty Murray, we blocked two successive Bush appointees for a new FDA commissioner until science not politics was allowed to guide decision making. I made it very clear I was not in any way dictating, suggesting, expecting any particular outcome, but I did not want the FDA politicized to achieve an outcome that was not based on the best that science and evidence had to offer. It should not take an act of Congress or an act of a Senator to get the President to listen to health experts on a matter of women\'s health. I will also have an advisor for science in the White House who reports directly to the President. [Applause] And I will work to restore the Office of Technology Assessment in Congress. Back in the 1990s, this office was charged with just one task: tell us the truth about science. For decades, they cut through the myths and the spin on everything from Star Wars to AIDS prevention to solar technology. It\'s time we put them back in business. Third, when I\'m President, we will again invest in research. That\'s a key to creating the jobs of the future, rebuilding the middle class, and meeting the challenges of the global economy. Here too, however, we\'re falling behind. Over the past twelve years, American investment in research and development has remained relatively static. China has doubled the share of its national wealth invested in R&D.; The education pipeline, the source of future innovators, reveals the same trend. Between 1970 and 2000, America\'s global share of PhDs in science and engineering declined from 40 percent to 20 percent. The rate is expected to drop to 15 percent in the next 3 years. At the same time, under the Bush administration, spending on basic and applied research has declined in real terms four years in a row. DARPA -- where basic research led to the precursors of the internet, the computer mouse, stealth technology, and so much more -- is putting less and less of its resources into truly revolutionary, ground-breaking research. I\'ve become troubled by this because, of course, we have very specific issues we have to address. The search for some technology to disable these horrific explosive devices that cause so much damage for our young men and women in uniform and innocent Iraqis and people in Afghanistan is a very important project but I think we can do both. We can do the more applied, specific research to try to solve a problem and we can continue to fund the more visionary research that we don\'t know where it will lead, but who knows, the next internet may come out of it. The private sector devotes only 5 percent of all its resources to basic research. And that is a change from 50 years ago and the years after that. Some of the great research breakthroughs came through private labs like Bell Labs and others and we have not only cut back on government funding but because of the pressures of the global market place, the pressures for quarterly returns, we have seen a cutback in research in the private sector as well. The NIH budget was doubled between 1998 and 2003 and universities and researchers had high hopes for continued funding. In the years since, the rug has been pulled out from under them. The president\'s budget for 2008 actually cut funding for several departments. The consequences of unpredictable and declining resources are halted construction on new laboratories, fewer grants, uncertainty in current projects, and less support for the creative ideas of younger researchers. Nobel Prize winning biochemist Roger Kornberg recently said, ""In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn\'t virtually certain of success, then it won\'t be funded. And of course, the kind of work that we would most like to see take place, which is groundbreaking and innovative, lies at the other extreme."" I visited Memorial Sloane Kettering about a year and half ago to meet with Dr. Harold E. Varmus another Nobel prize winner who led NIH with such distinction and his top staff. And at that time he very clearly said that the way that the grants and now being issued by the NIH means that it\'s less and less likely that young researchers like he was when he did the work that eventually won him the Nobel prize, could be funded. And since that time I\'ve heard this across the country. I will increase support for basic and applied research by increasing the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy\'s Office of Science, and the Department of Defense. We\'ll significantly increase funding over 10 years, with a greater emphasis on high-risk, high-return investments. That combined with the increases again in the NIH to kick start our innovative engine. We\'ll invest more in multidisciplinary research, where the United States has a built-in advantage. No one commands the breadth and depth of excellence across different fields that we do. For instance, we should increase investments in non-health applications of bio-technology. One example: bacteria that could dramatically reduce the costs of cleaning up Superfund sites. I recently saw Craig Venter, who many of you know of or know, and his latest project is trying to create bacteria that will lead to a substitute for petroleum. Well, we don\'t know where this research will lead. That\'s the whole point and the excitement is letting loose our best minds. The failure to modernize our health care system is also holding back research. I have proposed creating a health information technology infrastructure as part of my health care plan, the American Health Choices Plan. I think we can lower costs for everyone, and improve quality for everyone, and cover everyone. A health information technology infrastructure is estimated by the Rand Corporation to save us seventy-seven billion dollars a year. It will prevent errors, it will stop waste, it will cut costs, and it will save lives because it will create billions of new digital data points from which we can glean new observations. I\'ve also called for competitive prizes to encourage innovation. Back in 1957, President Eisenhower, when he met with his Scientific Advisory Committee again, wondered if there were a way to keep people as excited about science as they were about sports and competition. And this was back when reality entertainment meant playing in the neighborhood park. Why not encourage people to innovate through healthy competition? We\'ve also seen a decline in American leadership in space exploration and science. A recent survey by the National Academy of Sciences found that ""the nation\'s Earth observation satellite programs, once the envy of the world, are in disarray."" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been forced to delay the launch of important climate and weather-monitoring satellites. These technologies are critical tools to study climate change: measuring the rates of melting ice, temperature and humidity changes, sea level variations. Meanwhile, NASA\'s budget for earth sciences has been cut by 30 percent and NASA climate scientists have been muzzled. Last year, the Bush administration went so far as to remove the following phrase, and I quote, ""to understand and protect the home planet,"" end quote, from NASA\'s mission statement. It\'s no wonder, the Bush administration has shown little interest in the earth sciences mission of NASA -- and a hostile approach toward the study of climate change. As President, part of my mission will be to reclaim our role as the innovation leader. I will pursue an ambitious agenda in space exploration and earth sciences. I\'ll fully fund NASA\'s earth sciences program, launch a new, comprehensive space-based study of climate change, and reverse the deep funding cuts that NASA\'s and FAA\'s aeronautics research and development budgets have endured in the last few years. You know, this is personal for me because when I was in junior high school, I was just captivated by the space program. It caught my imagination. There was such a great burst of interest. I did my 8th grade science project on space medicine. Some of you know that I even wrote to NASA asking how I could apply to be an astronaut and got back an answer saying that they weren\'t taking women. (Laughter) I have lived long enough to see that change! (Applause) But that great burst of activity led to so many people who are the PhDs, who are the scientific leaders, who have made such a difference to our public life and our private sector. A lot of them are reaching retirement age. They came into school in the 60\'s and the 70\'s motivated by this desire to innovate and in our government we\'re not finding the replacement for a lot of people. I know that at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the workforce issue going forward is a very big one. So this is not just about let\'s have more scientists. This is how we run our economy and how our government retains or should I say regains competence to do what it needs to do for all of us. I think that we\'ve got to make science research, technology, mathematics a career in those fields, exciting again. I think it\'s possible to do that and I think the President, even a President who doesn\'t know very much herself can ignite that interest with other people who are playing the lead roles in demonstrating what it means for us to be the leaders again. We really need a television series about scientists, you know, the study of forensic science skyrocketed after all these CSI programs, so I\'d like all of the scientists in this auditorium to start thinking. Make up a character that can light the same excitement in young people because lightbulb moments require electricity and we\'ve got to look at this challenge comprehensively. We still have a problem in women and minorities to enter science and engineering. And let\'s do a better job of replicating educational excellence in math and science from school to school. Congress recently passed into law the America Competes Act which contains two of my proposals. One would study promising practices in math and science education. We have to quit reinventing the wheel -- if something works in a school, especially where children come from disadvantaged backgrounds, to light their faces up, get them involved, let\'s replicate it. Let\'s work to do what we can to make sure that something happening in New York or Los Angeles is followed in Houston or Miami. [Applause] And I think that one way we can help this is to create new fellowships at the National Science Foundation to allow math and science professionals to become teachers in high-need schools. A lot of people who as they are retiring or are mid-career are looking for some way to keep giving and they face the array of difficulties and obstacles to becoming teachers and I think we have to break through that barrier and give more people a chance to share their enthusiasm, their life\'s work with our young people. I\'ve also proposed tripling the number of National Science Foundation fellowships and increasing the size of each award. NSF fellowships were created in response to the space race. In the decades since, the number of grants has remained largely unchanged despite a three-fold increase from that time until now in the number of college students graduating with science and engineering degrees. We also, as we move toward comprehensive immigration reform have to once again open our colleges and universities to students from abroad who wish to study here and then hopefully stay here as part of the American innovation agenda. What is happening now is we\'re not accepting them and if we do accept them, we\'re not allowing them to stay and work. So we need to get the best minds from the world once again coming to America. Fifth, we need an Apollo-like effort in clean, renewable energy. Last week, the President gave a speech in which he decided to address global warming -- seven years into his presidency. And what he found, unfortunately, is that the rest of the world has passed him by. He spoke of aspirational goals to reduce green house gas emissions while people around the world including right here in America actually aspire to tackle the problem. For nearly seven years, the administration has dodged, denied, and dissembled on climate change. Scientists muzzled. Reports censored. According to a survey of the Union of Concerned Scientists from last year, nearly three quarters of climate scientists felt inappropriate interference with their research was going on. One particularly egregious example is that of Philip A. Cooney, the former chief of staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. A lawyer previously employed by the American Petroleum Institute, he had no scientific background. Nonetheless, he insisted on editing scientific documents on climate change to cast doubt and greater uncertainty than the experts felt warranted. Meanwhile, the evidence has mounted. I traveled to the Alaskan Arctic as well as to the European Arctic with Senator McCain on two occasions over the last several years. We found ourselves in the northernmost inhabited place on earth, the island of Svalbard, in Norway. We met with scientists who\'d been studying the Arctic and we listened to what they had to say. They are seeing first hand the impact of changing climates -- from invasive species to shifting weather patterns to melting polar ice. And then at Point Barrow in our most northern part of America in Alaska, we heard from the scientists who have been studying climate change there for 30 years. As the evidence mounts -- other countries are mounting a lead in the race to develop the next generation of energy technologies. Nations in Europe and elsewhere are working to meet the standards set by Kyoto and to create jobs in the process. Germany, for example, has made major commitments to renewable energy, recently upping their targets to produce more than one quarter of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. Their approach has already paid dividends. In the last two years, employment in the German renewables sector rose by 50 percent to 235,000 jobs. They expect to create more than 400,000 jobs in renewables by 2020. As a German official recently told Congress, ""solar power installations and wind turbines made in Germany are an export hit all over the world."" I believe America can retake the lead. Energy dependence and climate change represent the greatest innovation challenge and opportunity that Americans have faced in a generation -- we can create millions of green collar jobs. I have proposed a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund, paid for in part by closing the tax subsidies and loopholes for the oil companies. [Applause] It is almost impossible to imagine but you and I and all the taxpayers in America are still subsidizing companies that have made the largest profits in the history of the world. [Applause] And that no longer makes sense, and we\'ve got to move now to take our resources and put them where we create a new market. It might have made sense when oil was ten dollars a barrel because it\'s expensive to explore, it\'s expensive to extract, but that no longer is needed. If we have smart legislative policy, we would have triggers on a lot of this. If the price of oil ever did fall again dramatically, and we did have to provide incentives, we could do so. But now what we are missing by failing to provide incentives for solar and wind and geothermal and hydrogen and bio-fuels and the whole array of renewable resources means that we are falling further and further behind. The fund I have proposed would invest in technologies available right now to promote conservation, combat global warming, and end our dependence on foreign oil. It also funds an energy initiative modeled on DARPA, the Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency to bring together the best minds in the public and the private sectors to think outside the box -- and the tank -- to imagine new solutions. Winning the 21st century energy race is as important and potentially profitable as winning the 20th century space race. We can do this. [Applause] The Strategic Energy Fund is only the beginning. In the coming weeks, I will outline in more detail my plans as President to move toward energy independence. Instead of leading the world in oil imports, we can lead in green technology exports. The country that split the atom can end our dependence on foreign oil and launch an energy revolution. We can call it Energy 2.0 because we\'ve got everything it takes except we have not organized ourselves to make it happen. When science is politicized, when the truth is subjugated by ideology, it\'s worse than wrong -- it\'s dangerous. Ending the war on science and once again valuing the ever-skeptical but always hopeful scientific enterprise is about more than our economy. It\'s about more than our security. It is about our democracy. Vannevar Bush, no relation, among his many accomplishments as an advisor to Presidents beginning with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as a pioneering scientist, as a leader who helped shape decades of science policy for our nation, also served as President of this institution. He authored a report at the close of World War II, requested by President Roosevelt but delivered to President Truman. In that report, Dr. Bush laid out his vision for the future of scientific progress in America proposing, for example, the National Science Foundation. He described science as the ""endless frontier."" What could be more American that? I was heartened to learn that after Sputnik went up sales of telescopes and binoculars shot up as well. Actually in my house, my father went out and bought some binoculars, so we could be on the lookout for Sputnik. And my memory of that, of peering into the sky in our backyard in a suburb of Chicago, I don\'t think we ever saw it although my friends claim that they had seen it, was so exciting that somehow we were connected to what that meant. And it was not only a thrill for a young girl, but it really did start me thinking. Fear is no match for the human desire to reach for the stars. And with the right leadership fear gives way to fortitude, to resolve, and to evidence-based action. The free and open exchange of ideas in America, along with our entrepreneurial spirit, our work ethic, and our values, has always been the wind against our backs. It was true in the space race for the 20th century. And it will be true again in the global innovation race of the 21st century. Thank you all very much. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 8, 2007",b'Remarks on Economic Blueprint for the 21st Century',"b'I want to introduce one other person. I don\'t know quite where she is right now but Mary Jo Auliff, where is Mary Jo? Is Mary Jo here? Well Mary Jo Auliff I know was going to try to be here this morning and she is someone whom I met in Iowa City this past weekend. It turns out that Mary Jo and I went to the same high school, Maine East. Just a couple of hours from here in Park Ridge, Illinois. She now lives in LeClair with her husband Russell. They have six sons, two of whom have served in Iraq. And they both work, they work hard.Russell is a fourth generation Iowa farmer and Mary Jo runs her own small business, but because both Mary Jo and Russell have pre-existing health conditions, they cannot afford insurance so they pay for their healthcare out of pocket, $1000 a month for prescription drugs alone. When Russell got sick, and the medical bills started piling up, they had to sell off half of their farm to pay their medical bills. It was their only option. Mary Jo, Russell and their family are doing everything right. They\'re working hard, they\'re serving our country, they\'re taking responsibility for themselves and taking care of each other. There are millions of families like them struggling and coming up short in an economy that just doesn\'t work for middle class Americans any longer. Today I would like to outline several of the challenges that this economy and our people face: globalization, rising income inequality, the growing housing crisis, all at a time of unprecedented fiscal irresponsibility in Washington. This administration has failed to respond to these challenges and in fact, many of their policies have made things worse. I will chart a new course as President. We have to change our economic course just as we have to change course in Iraq, and change course when it comes to health care. When it comes to the economy, I believe I have the strength and experience to make that change -- and to make our economy work again for middle class Americans, and for all Americans. Because in this new global economy, what have we seen? We\'ve seen some jobs shipped overseas, and others replaced with machines. In this decade the jobs that had been created pay 21% less than the jobs we\'ve lost. It\'s an economy that doesn\'t even create many new jobs. Job growth, since 2001, under President Bush, has been the weakest of any economic recovery since the great depression. It\'s an economy that demands more from our workers and gives less in return. Over the past six years, worker productivity - that means how hard you\'re working, how much you put out per hour of your work. Productivity has risen 18%, American workers are the hardest working people in the world. And yet just look around, wages have stayed flat. Corporate profits are at a forty year high but the average family\'s income in America has fallen by nearly $1,000. Income that is sorely missed as college costs have risen 40%, health care premiums have doubled, and gas prices have more than doubled. According to a recent report, over the 12-month period that ended in July of last year, the slow growth in wages for labor accounted for 64% of the increase in corporate profits. So in other words, companies are actually profiting off of their worker\'s stagnant wages. That is not the way it used to be. It used to be that when corporate profits went up, workers wages went up. But the current group of corporate leadership is not sharing the benefits of that increasing profitability with the workers who make the profits possible. It\'s an economy where the gap between the few at the top and everybody else just keeps getting wider. In 2005, all income gains went to the top 10% of households. While, the bottom 90% saw their incomes decline. And the wealthiest 1% held 22% of America\'s income. Now it used to be less than 10% thirty years ago. This is the highest level of income inequality since 1929. Hardly a red letter year for America. And six and a half years of fiscal irresponsibility hasn\'t helped matters. Between the President\'s reckless tax breaks to those at the top and a war that is costing $300,000,000 a day, we have run up record debts and we are now at $9 trillion and counting. Now up until recently, at least housing prices were rising, 86% between 1998 and 2006. So while hard working families were getting squeezed from every direction, and their credit cards were often maxed out, they\'d use their homes as a safety net. When the bills got too high, they could dip in to their home equity to pay them. Then housing prices started to fall, and suddenly the safety net shrunk. At the same time, families who financed their homes with non-traditional high risk loans saw their mortgage rates jump. Now many families finally stuck with mortgages they can\'t pay and expenses they can\'t afford. The result is 1.3 million foreclosures so far this year. Filings in August alone were up 261% in Iowa, and home prices are expected to decline this year, the first annual nation-wide drop since housing agencies began keeping records in 1950. Alex Pollick, the former CEO of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, recently testified before Congress and said that the problems in the housing market could cost America $3 trillion in household wealth. And while we all hope that the housing markets woes remain contained, experts worry that the prices in the housing market could spread throughout the economy. We\'re already seeing some early warning signs. Consumer confidence has weakened. The pace of employment growth has slowed even more since the beginning of this year. Automakers are recording that the housing prices is hurting auto sales and big investment banks are writing off billions in investments and starting layoffs tied to the housing industry. So taken together, the pressures of stagnant wages; rising health, education, and energy costs; increased household debt; and a softening housing market are creating a trap door economy. Too many families are standing on that trap door, just one diagnosis, one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything they\'ve worked for. They\'re bearing all of the risks of the global economy but reaping few of the rewards. So I hear all over as I travel throughout Iowa and America, people asking me, people asking themselves, What am I going to do?\' And I think it\'s fair to ask our leaders, What are you going to do?\' Well for six and a half years we\'ve seen this Administration\'s answers: Their answer to jobs being outsourced? Continuing tax incentives to companies that outsource jobs to tax havens. Their answer to rising inequality? Tax breaks for the wealthy that actually increase inequality. Their answer to 47 million Americans without health care? Veto health care for five million children from working families. Their answer to rising insecurity? Shift even more risk onto the individual by trying to privatize Social Security. Their answer to stagnant wages and anemic job growth? A war on science that has slowed the critical research we need to create the high-wage jobs of the future. Their economic philosophy boils down to this: In the new global economy, according to the Republicans, America can\'t win unless most Americans lose. Think about it. That\'s basically what they\'re telling us. You know, just go along with it. Some folks are doing really well, that\'s what we think it takes to compete and win. And everybody else, we\'re sorry but we just can\'t help you. Now middle class families always end up drawing the short straw. Growth, according to this Republican philosophy, has to be unequal and government can\'t help. Instead, the Bush Administration gives no-bid contracts to political allies, allows no competition for senior citizens\' drug prices under Medicare, and assumes no accountability for outsourcing national security responsibilities to contractors like Blackwater. They won\'t spend money to help working families get health insurance for their kids, but think nothing of giving health care providers billions more to take Medicare patients off the rolls. Well, my economic philosophy is exactly the opposite. It\'s what I learned growing up in a middle class family in the middle of America. My father came back from World War II after having served in the Navy, and he worked hard to build up his small business. He believed you should avoid being in debt at all costs and instilled in me the importance of being responsible with a budget at an early age. It\'s a value I still hold dear today. But it\'s that determination that I saw in my own family that I see across this state and across our country, that work ethic that has created the great American middle class. I believe the middle class is the backbone of our economy, the key to real growth, and the guarantor of the American Dream. And to paraphrase an old saying, as America\'s middle class goes, so goes America. And so I judge the health of our economy very differently than the way this White House judges it. I ask whether our middle class is expanding and getting ahead. Are we on the road to a stronger, more prosperous middle class or not? The administration has failed that test. My administration will not. We will get back to making it clear that we will have policies that support the American middle class and that will be our goal. You know, you can go back in American history and see it works. Throughout our history, whenever we\'ve made strategic investments in our people and our future, the American economy has created unprecedented prosperity. It has spurred scientists to make new discoveries, entrepreneurs to launch new industries. It\'s generated countless rags to riches stories and produced more millionaires and billionaires than anywhere else on earth. At the same time, it has sustained the world\'s largest, strongest middle class and given poor people the chance to work their way into the middle class, and left each generation more prosperous than the one before. The strength of our economy and the rise of the middle class were products of both a free market and good public policy, including sound economic stewardship by Presidents from both parties. Think about Teddy Roosevelt busting the trusts and rooting out corruption. Franklin Roosevelt building the infrastructure that drove this century\'s economy. President Truman ensuring that American GIs had the tools they needed to seize the promise of a great and growing future. President Eisenhower supporting more science and math education. President Kennedy set our sights on the moon and President Johnson worked to end poverty and the insecurity that comes as we grow older. In the 1990s, my husband continued this tradition, combining fiscal responsibility with smart investments in our people. And we did have pay-as-you-go rules that helped to rein in spending. And look at the results. More than 22 million new jobs and the longest economic expansion in American history. Balanced budgets and record surpluses. Rising family incomes, record levels of home and business ownership, and one hundred times as many people lifted out of poverty than during the Reagan Administration. The secret to America\'s past economic success is clear. Whenever the economy changed, we changed with it and we mastered it. We innovated. We invested. We managed downturns and overcame them. And we generated wealth and we made sure that wealth was widely shared. Well in the 1990s we were on our way to creating good jobs, with shared prosperity and the prospect of being debt free and having the resources to fund the retirement costs of the baby boom generation. Then we came to George W. Bush. Well, it\'s a sad story. President Bush, with a Republican Congress that enabled him to fully implement the trickle down economics they\'ve been advocating for a generation, ignored a century\'s worth of wisdom. In this decade, no American was too wealthy to be denied big tax cuts. No well-connected company too prosperous to lose its tax subsidies or protection from competition for government money. Meanwhile America\'s middle class families have been invisible to the President. It\'s as if he\'s looked right through them. As college got more expensive, they cut back on college aid. So if you\'re a young person who can\'t afford tuition, you\'re invisible. As health care got more expensive, they tried to reduce coverage for children. So if you\'re one of the 47 million Americans without health insurance, you\'re invisible as well. As jobs got scarce and paid less, they tried to weaken unions and stopped enforcing our trade laws. So if you\'re a worker who can\'t organize for fair wages and safe working conditions, you\'re invisible too. And as gas prices exploded, they allowed us to become more dependent on foreign oil. So if you pay through the roof every time you fill up your tank, you\'re invisible. Well you\'re not invisible to me. And when we take back the White House, you will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States. Because I do see you and I do hear you. I see families working as hard as they can. I see young people eager for opportunity. I see workers fighting for their basic rights. And I will fight for you every single day of my presidency. Because as President, I want to bring a new beginning to the 21st century and build a new road to middle class prosperity. That is in my view the job of the next President, to restore broad economic prosperity, fairness, and security. It won\'t be easy, but I know it can be done. I saw that for myself in the eight years in the White House as my husband carried out one of the most dramatic economic turnarounds in America\'s history. And for nearly seven years, as a Senator from New York I have been working to build on that commitment, to support good economic policies, resist bad ones, and help, working with local people, to bring economic opportunity to depressed regions of my state. Today I propose a new economic blueprint for the twenty-first century economy: A plan to create the new, good jobs essential to broad-based prosperity, to restore fairness to our economy, and to renew that basic bargain that if you work hard you can get ahead and we will put our fiscal house in order. The first component of my plan is to create millions of new jobs through an all out commitment to a clean, efficient, independent energy future and to end this administration\'s assault on science so that innovation can once again be the engine of our economic growth. For six and a half years, this Administration first denied the reality of our dependence on foreign oil and then denied the reality of climate change and refused to make a serious effort to deal with either. It is heartbreaking to know we are more dependent on foreign oil today than we were before 9/11. You know, but this on the part of the President was just a small piece of a larger war on science and innovation, from muzzling and overruling scientists, to suppressing and manipulating scientific evidence, to denying funding for stem cell research. To paraphrase Stephen Colbert, this administration doesn\'t make decisions based on facts. It makes facts based on decisions. And as a result, our competitors around the world are getting an edge on us in the global economy. I want to restore America to its rightful place as the innovation nation. New discoveries, new inventions are key to new jobs and prosperity. I\'ll start by issuing an Executive Order to end the war on science and restore a climate of scientific integrity and independence. This order will rescind President Bush\'s ban on stem cell research and ensure that government scientists... I will also dramatically increase investments in basic and applied research at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, our universities, and so many other entities that will take advantage of the tax credit for research and experimentation. And I want to invest in the idea-leaders of tomorrow by improving math and science education, expanding fellowships for graduate study, and encouraging more women and minorities to choose careers in science and engineering. To jumpstart our investment in alternative energy, I will establish a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund to develop clean energy technologies like biomass and bio-fuels grown right here in Iowa to combat global warming and end our dependence on foreign oil. We\'ll pay for the Strategic Energy Fund by eliminating the tax subsidies for the big oil companies and requiring them to pay into the fund. I would give them an option, if they are willing to invest in alternative, clean, green technologies themselves then they won\'t have to pay into the fund, they won\'t get the tax subsidies because there is no reason for us to be subsidizing them. Our oil companies have made record profits on the energy system that has reduced our incomes, accelerated climate change, and undermined our national security. It\'s time from them finally to do their part to build a new energy economy that benefits all Americans and secures our children\'s future. We are seeing what the future could be right here in Iowa. You\'re leading the way on harnessing the power of alternative energy to create good new jobs. A few months back I visited with some young men in Crawfordsville. They had grown up on farms and they left home to go to school and they were working elsewhere around the country. They started talking about maybe they could actually go home, use what they learned growing up on a farm and make biodiesel fuel and that\'s what they did. They started a small business and now they have 14 employees and a 10 million gallon capacity. Countries around the world are moving much faster than we are. Employment for example in Germany in the renewables sector has risen by 50 percent in the past two years to 235,000 new jobs. They expect to create more than 400,000 jobs. There\'s no reason we can\'t do the same here in America. I will also harness the power of innovation to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. This is a problem that if we don\'t deal with it we\'re going to be slowing our economic growth. Economists estimate that every $1 billion spent on fixing crumbling infrastructure creates nearly 48,000 new jobs. My Rebuild America Plan invests $10 billion over ten years in an ""Emergency Repair Fund"" to begin addressing the extensive backlog of emergency repairs needed in our country. We need to modernize our roads, our rail systems, our seaports, our public transit systems, and to expand broadband access across America. I\'ve also proposed a $1 billion per year ""Green Building Fund"" to build and renovate public buildings and make them green and energy efficient and the Mayor is applauding and I know he understands it. I believe we can innovate our way to 21st century manufacturing. Now I know there are people in America who say we can\'t be a manufacturing economy any longer and I don\'t believe that. First of all, I don\'t want to believe it because I think that a country that doesn\'t make things is a country that is on a slow slide to income inequality and a rogue economy. But I also believe we have opportunities here that we need to take advantage of. I\'m proud to be the co-chair of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus. It\'s bipartisan, we\'ve worked to come up with ideas that the Bush Administration wouldn\'t implement but I would as President because I want to incentivize manufacturing in America. And this is just the beginning. Later this week, I\'ll be outlining an additional set of innovation initiatives, building on proposals that I\'ve been making through this campaign as well as some new ones. But in addition to creating new jobs with rising incomes to be globally competitive, we\'ve got to do more to restore fairness to our economy, to empower our workers and ensure that all Americans get their fair share. That starts with standing up for our unions so that they can stand up for our workers. Unionized workers make 30% more money than workers who aren\'t in unions. I want to put that up in a great big billboard because a lot of people don\'t know that the difference is that dramatic. But today just 7% of our private sector workplace is unionized. Millions of other people whose jobs are not covered are much more vulnerable to unsafe working conditions, being deprived of benefits, not getting their fair share when it comes to the income they receive for the jobs they do. If more people in America earned higher incomes with better benefits, their consumer spending would increase and that would benefit the entire economy. This should not be a zero sum game where we have winners at the top and losers down the income scale. We need to get back to a win win strategy where we try to empower Americans not only to have a better life for themselves and their families but to be greater contributors to our overall prosperity. As President, I will fight to pass the Employee Free Choice Act so unions can organize for fair wages and safe working conditions. You know it used to be in America when the middle class was stronger it was a lot easier to sign up to join a union. And the reason this is such an important issue, even if you\'re not in a union, maybe you don\'t understand why this is such a big deal, why people stood up and applauded, is that back when we had a strong middle class that was really growing and people were getting a standard of living that their parents and grandparents would not have dreamed of, it was a lot easier. Now, with Republican Presidents and Republican Congresses, it\'s become so hard and there is harassment and there is intimidation and the employers really just push people so that they don\'t feel that a union is in their interest. I want people to make up their own minds. You know, it\'s a free country. If you can decide to join a civic organization you should be able to decide to join a union without fear of coercion and if you don\'t want to decide to join one, well that\'s your choice as well. Unlike the current President, I will actually appoint people to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board who are pro-labor and care about working people... And I will work from day one to ensure that our trade policies actually work for American workers. That they include strong enforceable protections for labor and environmental standards, and that they deliver benefits not just for trading partners, not just for the people at the top of the income scale in America, but for all Americans. Because look at what has happened in the past six years. Our trade deficit has doubled in just six years to $760 billion a year. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that we\'ve lost 1.8 million jobs to China, we\'re paying higher prices for low cost consumer goods some of which have serious safety problems. Now the last 6 years may have been great for China, but is it the best course for America going forward? I don\'t think so. It\'s time for a new approach, one that doesn\'t lead to a race to the bottom, but instead ensures that ordinary citizens not CEO\'s but people who do the work in America and in other nations come out ahead again. I will start by appointing a Trade Enforcement Officer within the United States Trade Representative\'s Office who will be responsible for vigorously enforcing trade agreements. And I will double the size of the enforcement unit. The Bush Administration has filed roughly the same number of enforcement actions under our trade agreements that were filed during one year of the Clinton Administration. That is unacceptable. They\'re abdicating their responsibility, no one should get away with violating trade agreements, and when I\'m President, we\'re going to start enforcing them again and we\'re not going to enter into them unless we think they\'re going to be good for American workers. Next I will work to address specific problems with NAFTA. As I\'ve said before, this agreement has some serious shortcomings. For example, I did a study last year in New York looking at the impact of NAFTA on our business people, our workers and our farmers because we share a long boarder with Canada. But what people were telling me whom I represent is they could not get their products into Canada despite NAFTA\'s promise of equal access. And I did a study and I sent it to the Bush Administration and I said I want answers as to why this is not working. You know I have apple farmers up along the boarder, they couldn\'t get their apples in but apples were coming out of Canada. I had business people who couldn\'t figure out how to get through all of the red tape to get their products in, but products were coming out of Canada. Now we have a great relationship with Canada. But I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they\'re meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA. And finally, I will overhaul our Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to ensure that workers who\'ve lost their jobs because of global competition get the income support, the health care, the job training and the job placement assistance they need to get back on their feet. You know the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is a lifeline for workers across America who can use it. Unfortunately too few people can use it. First, service workers whose jobs are lost to outsourcing should be able to be eligible to receive TAA benefits. It makes no sense to keep excluding service workers because we know we\'re losing a lot of service jobs overseas. Second, TAA should cover all workers whose plants have moved abroad whether or not the plant moved to a country with which we have a free trade agreement. Believe it or not, Trade Adjustment Assistance currently does not cover workers whose jobs are outsourced to China and India because we don\'t have free trade agreements with them. I want to double the funding for the job training program under TAA to $440 million a year and increase TAA tax credits to help displaced workers pay for health insurance. Now ultimately under my American Health Choices Plan, workers will be able to buy into the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the same program that insures members of Congress. I will also work to restore fairness to our tax system. First I will return to the income tax rates for upper-income Americans that we had in the 1990s. Those rates were consistent with a balanced budget and economic growth. And I will level the playing field when it comes to taxes on income. Right now, Wall Street investment managers making $50 million a year pay just 15% on their earnings because they classify what they do as ordinary income. As not ordinary income, but as capital gains. When they go to work everyday, they manage all this money, but they say what they\'re doing is an investment, not management. Well a teacher making $50, 000 a year pays 25%. Those who have been most richly rewarded by the modern economy should not pay lower tax rates on their incomes than nurses or home health care workers or bus drivers or machinists or anybody else and we are going to make sure that they no longer do. For middle class Americans, I will extend the tax cuts including the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, and lower income tax rates that they currently pay. And I will reform something called the Alternative Minimum Tax, the AMT, to make sure it doesn\'t hit middle class families with higher tax rates. It was never intended to do that. I will also expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to help families that are struggling to join the middle class. And I will be providing tax credits to help small businesses pay for health care. I want to take a hard look at corporate tax reform as well. It is simply not right that as corporate profits have skyrocketed, the percentage of taxes paid by corporations has fallen. We can fix that if we close the loopholes, end the unjustifiable tax breaks, and stop subsidizing the movement of jobs to foreign tax havens. We\'re going to get that done... The third component of my plan is to restore America\'s basic bargain, if you work hard you can get ahead because you\'ll have the tools and support you need to succeed in the global economy. That starts with recommitting ourselves to making college affordable for young people. You know I was in New Hampshire yesterday morning and a young man stood up and asked a question, he said he was a high school senior. He wanted to go to college, he hoped eventually he could even go to law school. He said where am I going to get the financial help to do that? He said I\'m one of the top students in my class and I\'m afraid I won\'t be able to afford to do what I want to do to pursue my dreams. Well on Thursday I will outline my plan for making college affordable, including modernizing the HOPE Scholarship Program that provides tax credits to help young people attend college. We know that we\'ve got to improve the skills and education of our workforce. But today, and I have to confess I was surprised, I asked to find out the statistic but even I was surprised. 75% of students at America\'s best public and private universities and colleges come from the top 25% of income in America. Think about that. So that leaves 25% for everybody else. Just 3% of the students come from the bottom 25% of income. It didn\'t used to be like this. We used to believe that if you worked hard and you were college material, you would go to college. We clearly need to make college accessible so that students from all different backgrounds have the chance to fulfill their God-given potential. And for those who don\'t attend four-year colleges, and who need skills and training, let\'s provide more support for community colleges and institutions that help prepare them for good, high-paying jobs. About a year and a half ago I had two meetings within the space of one week. I had a meeting with the auto dealers from New York who came to see me and they said, you know, Senator, we have 600 good jobs for auto mechanics right now that we can\'t get filled because nobody\'s training auto mechanics any longer. And the job is more complicated because we all have these computers in our cars, you know, they talk to us and tell us which way to turn and all that. And the auto dealers say we don\'t know what to do so we\'re going to start our own school because we don\'t know where we\'re going get people to do this important job. Shortly after that I had a visit from some of the members of the machinist union that I work with in New York. They told me they were worried about the aging of the machinists on airplanes, the workforce is getting older, what were we going to do to have a pipeline with more young people? So, this is a problem that we should begin to handle now. We have a lot of decent hardworking young and not so young people who deserve to have a good job. And I believe skilled workers will be in a shortage in the future. So let\'s start giving them the tools they need to be competitive right now. And of course I outlined my health care plan to ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care. You know, the American Health Choices Plan is really simple. If you have insurance you like, you keep it. If you don\'t have insurance or don\'t like the insurance you have, you can choose from the same menu of private plans available to members of Congress or you can opt into a new public plan that will be like Medicare. We\'ll provide those tax credits to make it affordable and your coverage will be guaranteed even if you lose your job, even if it is outsourced. And if you decide to start your own business or stay home with your children for a few years, you will never be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or risk factors. I believe we can save $120 billion a year in our health care system. If we emphasize prevention, which we don\'t do now; if we emphasize chronic care management, which we don\'t do very well now; if we move toward electronic medical records so we don\'t keep losing medical records and people are told they have to take the same test twice, three times over and when you travel from Iowa to see your family in Illinois or Florida you can have that record at your fingertips. So, there\'s a lot we can do. And that will also create new jobs. And finally another component of the basic bargain is homeownership. Years of progress on this front are threatened by the growing problems in the housing market and I think we have to address this crisis immediately. If home prices keep falling, many families will soon find themselves with mortgages larger than the value of their homes. At that point, they won\'t be able to refinance. So we don\'t have any time to waste. I\'ve already announced a four-part plan to address mortgage industry abuses. Crack down on unscrupulous brokers, curb unfair lending practices, support state and community initiatives that help families avoid foreclosure, and increase the supply of affordable housing in America again. Today I\'m announcing three new proposals. The first is what I\'m calling the Save Our Homes Program to rescue families trapped in unworkable mortgages. $50 billion dollars worth of adjustable rate mortgages are resetting in October and approximately $30 billion will reset every month thereafter for the next year. That means hundreds of thousands of Americans will see their mortgage rates jump and too many will go into default. The Save Our Homes Program will enable these two federally chartered entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as state housing finance agencies, to replace these unworkable mortgages with stable, fixed-rate loans that families can afford. My second proposal is the Realizing the Dream Program to make more mortgage credit available to responsible homebuyers now. Right now because of market conditions, many banks are reluctant to write mortgages even for responsible, credit-worthy buyers. They\'re especially reluctant to write mortgages larger than those that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy from them. So my plan would temporarily increase the size of the mortgages that Fannie and Freddie, as we call them in Washington, can purchase and that would encourage more banks to continue making loans to more Americans. My third proposal is a Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act to crack down on the unscrupulous consultants. I already said let\'s crack down on the unscrupulous brokers. Now we\'ve got a whole new field of unscrupulous consultants that are knocking on the doors of people who are at risk of losing their homes. They\'re claiming to be able to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. They\'re taking hefty fees and they\'re disappearing. No actual assistance - spread the word. Anybody you know, don\'t listen to anybody who calls you on the phone or knocks on your door and tells you they\'ve got a great way of saving your home. If it\'s too good to be true, it probably isn\'t true. So what I want to do is to create a federal statute imposing criminal penalties on these fraudulent consultants and allow victims to collect damages so that they don\'t get even more victimized. As you know in America, homeownership isn\'t just the key to financial security, it\'s about laying down roots in your community and building the life you want for you and your family. And I will make sure that the dream of homeownership is not lost. And I will also protect retirement security. We\'re going to stand up for Social Security and Medicare. I\'ll be outlining in more detail my plan to help Americans save, invest, and build wealth for retirement tomorrow because we know we\'ve got to tackle that as well. And I don\'t think we can do all of this unless we return America to fiscal responsibility. And what we\'ve seen from this President is increased spending at more than double the rate of the previous administration. Anybody who tells you that the Republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility, just roll your eyes because the facts could not be more different. How has President Bush paid for these tax cuts to multi-millionaires, oil companies, and other interest groups? How has he paid for the War in Iraq and the no-bid contracts and the tax cuts that seem to have no end in sight? I\'ll tell you how he\'s done it. He\'s run record deficits and he\'s borrowed money from foreign countries like China. When he took office we had those budget surpluses and we were on track to be debt free in a few years. Now with a national debt of $9 trillion, up nearly 60% since President Bush took office, he\'s left our children and our grandchildren to pay the bill. Did you know that every baby born in America today starts life with $30,000 of national debt on his or her tiny shoulders? That is the largest birth tax in history. And trillions of it is owed to countries like China, and Japan, and Korea, and Middle East producers of oil, we even owe money to Mexico. Put simply, we are borrowing money from abroad to give tax cuts to President Bush\'s friends and special interests. So when people ask me, why is it so hard to get tough on China and other trading partners, I tell them because they\'ve been turned into our bankers. We owe them. How can we truly enforce trade laws against a country like China whose manipulated currency puts us at unfair disadvantage, but our economic stability depends on them continuing to provide massive loans to us every single month? I want America back in control of our fiscal destiny. It may take a few years but we have to move back toward a balanced budget and a surplus. We have to find a way both to increase long-term investment and to stop borrowing money from other countries for current consumption, whether it\'s for our soldiers in the field or for tax cuts for millionaires. We have to develop a set of budget rules similar to those we had in the 90s that required us to fund new expenditures with new revenues or cut spending. I think it\'s going to be a challenge to do this but I believe this is the change that America wants. If we do it right, we will spark broadly shared prosperity even greater than the growth we enjoyed in the 90s. I look at the world we\'re in now and yes I see a lot of threats, a lot of challenges, but I see tremendous opportunities. Seventy-one years ago this month during a campaign stop in Kansas City, Missouri, President Franklin Roosevelt said: ""To a greater degree than any other peoples, we have sought to give each rising generation a little better chance in life than the one that preceded it."" He spoke also of our ""faith in the future -- a faith under which America has only begun to march."" Well, it\'s time for America to march again, toward rebuilding our middle class and restoring our faith in the future our children and grandchildren deserve. It\'s a forward march I want to lead and I hope you will give me the honor to do that. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 9, 2007","b'Remarks in Webster City, Iowa'","b'Thank you, so much. Thank you, David, for that very kind introduction. I appreciate your being here with me.In a few minutes, I will be having an opportunity to discuss some of the issues that affect middle-class families here in Iowa and across America, with three local residents who have been kind enough to participate. And then we\'ll have a chance to throw it open to the audience. I appreciate David Mitchell (ph) and Katy Vanderpool (ph) and Don Cousins (ph) for being part of this discussion. And I also want to thank Janet Adams, your former state representative and my county coordinator, for helping to put this event together. Yes, let\'s give Janet a round of applause. (APPLAUSE) I\'m delighted that Mayor Eugene Gray is here. Thank you for welcoming me to your city. And I also want to introduce someone else who I\'m proud to call a friend and also one of my national co-chairs at my campaign, and that\'s your former governor, Tom Vilsack. Tom, thank you. (APPLAUSE) Today, we\'re going to continue the conversation that I\'m having across Iowa and America about how we rebuild the road to a strong and prosperous middle class. Yesterday, in Cedar Rapids, I proposed a new economic blueprint for 21st century America, a plan to create new jobs, to make a commitment to clean energy and innovation, which will be a job engine and creator, just as it is being now here in Iowa, to restore fairness to our economy. It\'s not right that people at the very top are doing so well and everybody else is marking time. We have the largest inequality in our country that we\'ve had since the Great Depression. That is not a recipe for success for the vast majority of Americans. We need to put our fiscal house in order again. Six and a half years ago, we had a balanced budget and a surplus. That has been squandered, to our great detriment. (APPLAUSE) I want to renew the basic bargain that I grew up with, that I was taught about, that if you work hard and you\'re responsible, you can get ahead in our country. And today I want to speak about one important part of that basic bargain: the promise of a secure retirement. You know, as Americans we believe that if you help make America stronger, safer and more prosperous, then you should be able to count on your retirement years being better, healthier and more secure. But the reality today is far different from what that basic bargain used to deliver. Fewer than one-half of American families have retirement savings accounts in any given year, and those who do contribute are saving too little for their futures. Nearly one-third of all households entering retirement do not have enough savings to replace even one-half of their income, and that is including Social Security. One-half have saved just $15,000 or less in a 401(k) or IRA type plan. The private savings rate last year fell to its lowest level since the Great Depression. All of this fits together. If you\'re not making money that is a part of a rising economy, it\'s hard to save. And if the costs of health care and education and energy keep going up, it\'s even harder to save. So many Americans have worked hard their entire lives. They\'ve contributed to their communities, they\'ve done everything right. But when it came time to retire, they came up short. They worry that their children will have to support them. They worry that they\'ll have to keep working. And I have met people across our country working not just into their late sixties or seventies, but into their early eighties because they just don\'t have enough to keep things going for them. They worry that Medicare and Social Security won\'t be enough to make ends meet. And then the younger generation is trying to raise their own kids, care for aging parents, plan for their own retirement. And as their government turns a blind eye, they face the pressure themselves of stagnant wages and all of these increasing costs -- and, on top of what\'s happening now, a softening housing market, which has always been the main source of wealth and security for most Americans. Too many families in America today feel like they\'re standing on a trap door. They\'re just one diagnosis, one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything. What\'s been the Bush administration\'s answer to these real-world problems? Well, it\'s always the same answer: help those with the most and good luck to everybody else. They want to privatize Social Security and let individuals bear the risk. They want to create retirement savings accounts, which allows the wealthiest Americans to get the best deal. They have little concern for everybody else. They put tax breaks for drug companies and oil companies ahead of retirement security for hardworking Americans. During the last six and a half years, on President Bush\'s watch, the share of American workers covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans has fallen below 50 percent for the first time. Four million fewer workers have access to employer sponsored pensions than they did when President Bush took office. Now, they call their vision of our country the ""ownership society."" The reality is, they own it. You work for it. I call it the ""yoyo society"" -- you\'re on your own. That\'s how they seem to think that America should be. I reject that. For six long years, the middle class in our country has been as though it were invisible to their president. You know, if you\'re working hard, you\'re paying your bills and you have nothing left over to save at the end of the month, you\'re invisible. If you\'re working two jobs, like a lot of people are today, but neither of them has a retirement plan, you\'re invisible, too. If you\'ve worked all your life to do what is right, only to realize you cannot afford to retire, well, you\'re sure invisible as well. Well, you\'re not invisible to me. And when we take back the White House, you will no longer be invisible to the president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) I believe it\'s time for a new bargain with the American people, a bargain that reflects the changing global economy and the new realities of our aging. I believe if you do work hard and you contribute to your country, you should have the opportunity to save and invest. And through the discipline of good planning and the miracle of compound interest, you should be able to build wealth for yourself and a better future for your family and a secure retirement. That\'s what I want to talk about today: My plan to help a new generation of Americans save and build wealth. You know, it\'s really kind of ironic, because part of the American dream has always been you work hard today to build a better future and to make it better for your children and your grandchildren. That\'s how I was raised. You know, my family lived better than my grandparents. Bill and I lived better than my parents and his. Our daughter is living well. We want every generation to do better. If you look at what\'s happening today, older people have actually more assets, even though it\'s not enough to retire comfortably, than their own children and grandchildren do. Think of all of the children moving back to live with parents. Think of all the single moms struggling to raise children, and grandparents having to help. So this is not only about securing a better retirement for those who are on the brink of retiring but helping to build more assets and wealth for young people, like the ones you\'ll hear about in a minute. I think every American deserves a chance to build a solid next egg, to help save for that new home, to send a child to college and to secure that comfortable retirement. I believe strongly that we can do this. And it\'s important that we do it. Because right now our savings rates are below what they were in 1929. We don\'t have much of a nest egg to fall back on. We sure don\'t have it any longer in our government because we\'re back into deficits and debt. And every day we borrow money from foreign countries. And what do we borrow it for? For President Bush\'s two main priorities: tax cuts for the wealthiest and the war in Iraq. We need to change those priorities. We need to start once again respecting the Social Security Trust Fund and beginning to bring our troops home from Iraq so that we will have those resources to spend here at home. (APPLAUSE) Look at what happens today. We spend as a government -- as our government, we spend about $200 billion a year to encourage retirement savings. But under the tax code, about half of that $200 billion goes to the top 10 percent of earners. But only 10 percent goes to the bottom 60 percent of earners. We are subsidizing the most the people who need it the least. Many workers don\'t even have the opportunities that would encourage them to save. When you think about how few employees now actually have access to an employer who sponsors a retirement plan, you wonder what\'s going to happen to everybody else. But even those who have access to a retirement plan, not nearly enough of them are encouraged or given the opportunity to save. So we\'ve got a lot of workers, more than half in America right now, without any employer-based retirement savings account, including 770,000 workers right here in Iowa. Think about that: 770,000. It\'s maybe not something you talk about with your neighbors, but that\'s a lot of people right here in Webster City and across Iowa. And many parts of the workforce are even worse off. Think about how it affects women, particularly single women. Women who work full- time are likely to have on the same level as their male counterparts a retirement plan. But a lot of women don\'t work full-time, they work part-time or, I like to say, they work two part-time jobs to try to make enough money to support themselves and their children. You know, yesterday for lunch we stopped at a Maid-Rite on our way from Cedar Rapids to Marshalltown, and the waitress who served us was a single mom. She\'s raised two boys; they\'re now in their twenties. She and her boys have worked hard every single day for a lot of years. She works at a nursing home and she works at a Maid-Rite. She doesn\'t have much to count on when it comes to retirement except for Social Security. A lot of these workers are left behind. But I think we know what to do. We just need a president who believes it\'s important to do this. When people have access to retirement accounts like 401(k)s that provide generous matches, they save more. In a recent study, middle- class Americans saved eight times more when they were given a 50 percent match. And we know that by making it easier with automatic enrollment, direct deposit and diversified investment options, people are more likely to build up their nest egg. That\'s why I\'m announcing my plan today to provide every single American with an easy, automatic opportunity to save for future through an account I\'m calling an American retirement account. These accounts will take the best of the 401(k) plans and make them available to every working family. They will help families and individuals who are falling through the cracks. They will reduce the way the tax code skews for the wealthy. They will begin to bring down this inequality that is eating away at our social contract. And they will encourage national savings and economic growth. This is a major commitment to how I think we can begin to right the balance again. Here\'s how American retirement accounts will work: To give a strong incentive for saving, my plan will offer working and middle-class families generous matching tax cuts. For families making up to $60,000 a year, the government will match dollar for dollar the first $1,000 you save. For families making between $60,000 and $100,000, the plan will provide a 50 percent match on the first $1,000 of savings. That means tens of millions of middle-class families will be eligible for matching tax cuts of up to $500 and $1,000 to help them build a nest egg. The new American retirement accounts will build upon and strengthen the existing employer-based retirement savings systems. If you like your current retirement savings options, you keep them as they are. No change is necessary. But if you don\'t have a retirement savings plan or you don\'t like the one you have, you will be able to open a new American retirement account that will provide no hassle, portable savings opportunities throughout your career. These universal accounts will allow you to contribute up to $5,000 a year on a cash deferred basis. You will get the generous government matches on the first $1,000. So although 401(k)s now are only available to some, they will be available to everyone. Saving in the accounts will be easy. It should not require a Ph.D. to save for retirement. We\'ll encourage employers to let employees directly deposit a portion of their salaries into the account. Savings will happen automatically unless a worker opts out. We\'ll provide expanded tax credits to smaller businesses to help cover the start-up costs of establishing direct deposit options. And we\'ll ensure there are secured, diversified investment options in these accounts. Your account will be yours. You will be able to take it from job to job and roll over any existing retirement savings into the account. This is particularly important for women. Women, as we know, are more likely to go in and out of the workforce. As a woman who has worked -- I started working, I think, when I was 13 in the summer time, and I got my first Social Security then. I worked part time. I worked full time. And, of course, when Bill was president I didn\'t work outside the home, as we might say. And so I know that women go in and out of the workforce to raise children, to take care of their parents -- so many issues that affect our lives. I would also make it easier for small businesses and for self- employed people, who often get the worst of all worlds -- they can\'t afford health care, they can\'t afford to save for retirement. We\'re going to address that. Why should we be satisfied with our current system, a system in which a mother who chooses to stay home and raise her children misses out on savings opportunities that others can access? Why should we be satisfied with a system in which starting your own business means passing up employer-sponsored retirement benefits? Why should we be satisfied with a system in which part-time employees don\'t have incentives or an easy way to save? Well, I\'m not satisfied. That\'s why I want to change the system, and I want to make it available to every American. Under my plan you\'ll also be able to use the savings in your American retirement account to make major life investments, like buying a home or paying for higher education. In addition, in light of the growing economic uncertainty facing American families, we should consider ways to let workers access a portion of their savings to weather difficult times, like an illness or an accident that has affected you. In short, my plan will help tens of millions of middle-class families go from just getting by to getting ahead. Now, I know some people will say, ""Well, we can\'t afford to invest in the American people."" Well, I think we can\'t afford not to invest in the American people. We need to do it, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way. We will cover the cost of these middle-class retirement tax cuts with a portion of revenue from freezing the estate tax. For every one wealthy estate facing a less-generous estate tax exemption, thousands of middle-class families will receive a tax cut that will help them save, invest, and one day own an estate of their own. I think it\'s imperative that we start giving people the chance to acquire wealth again. Otherwise, we\'re going to become a two-tier society. We\'ll have the rich, and we\'ll have everybody else. That is not the America I grew up in. And I don\'t think that\'s the way America works best. As we encourage individuals to save on their own, we will shore up existing employer-sponsored pensions. I fought in the Senate to ensure that companies funded 100 percent of their defined benefit pension obligations. I want to strengthen defined benefit coverage. We\'re going to finally close the loophole when I\'m president in our pension laws that allows companies to cut their employees\' pensions when they sell off subsidiaries. One of the most egregious examples of this was when Halliburton used this loophole to rob its employees of $25 million in pension benefits they had earned. And then they turned around and rewarded their then-CEO, Dick Cheney, with a $20 million sweetheart retirement deal. You could not have a clearer example of what is wrong with America. Why on Earth should any company be permitted legally to deprive workers of what they\'d earned in order to give a CEO the same amount in benefits? (APPLAUSE) We also need to examine our bankruptcy code, to ensure that companies are not using bankruptcy to get out of their obligations to workers. You know, bankruptcy is an unfortunate fact of life for some struggling companies. But when a company runs into hard times, we need to give workers and retirees a fair chance to negotiate for the benefits they\'ve earned. I would also restore the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to its historic role as an advocate for worker retirement benefits. I\'ll continue the work that I\'ve done in the Senate to secure retirement benefits for law enforcement officers, military veterans and September 11th heroes. And I\'ll work to strengthen spousal protections to ensure that widows and qualified divorced widows receive the retirement benefits they are due. Finally, the bedrock of my retirement savings agenda is a fundamental commitment to Social Security. I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that we\'ve got to fight and finally bury the idea of privatizing Social Security. It is one of those bad ideas that deserve to be totally buried. (APPLAUSE) When I am president, privatizing Social Security will certainly not be even discussed. I reject the view of President Bush and others who have given large tax cuts to the wealthiest, failed to crack down on offshore tax dodgers, and handed out no-bid contracts to companies like Halliburton, and then insisted that we needed to cut benefits to middle-class retirees. How can they get the top 1 percent of Americans a tax cut large enough to essentially fix Social Security and then turn around and say, ""Oh, we have no choice but to cut Social Security benefits""? Don\'t you believe all these people running around crying wolf about Social Security. That is exactly what they\'re doing. They\'re trying to get people confused and upset and agree to a bad deal. When I am president, we\'ll have our priorities in order. We will return to fiscal responsibility and fair tax policies first, and then we will address the long-term challenges facing Social Security. But I\'m not going about demanding sacrifice from seniors and having others dismantle Social Security because they claim they can\'t cut back on the tax breaks for wealthy Americans and big corporations. When my husband left office, because we had a balanced budget and a surplus, there was a plan in place to extend the solvency of Social Security until 2055. That gives us plenty of time to figure out what else we need to do. Once George Bush came in and we went back to deficit spending, the last six and a half years what we\'ve seen is a decrease in the life of the Social Security Trust Fund to 2041. Well, when we get back to fiscal responsibility, we\'ll start paying back the Social Security Trust Fund. And that will give us a strong foundation to go toward fixing all of the long-term challenges that Social Security faces. In my work, I will be guided by a belief that each generation owes a great deal to the ones that come before it and owe a great deal to the ones that are coming after. I\'m grateful for what my parents did for me and what their generation did for all of us. You know, my father was kind of old-fashioned. He had a small business and he didn\'t believe in debt. In fact, it was the explosion of the deficit during the 1980s that turned my rock-ribbed Republican father into an open-minded voter. (LAUGHTER) He began to say, ""You know what? Your mother and I saved until we could buy our house. We saved until we could buy a car. We saved. And now my government\'s going into debt."" I think there\'s a lot of wisdom in that. You know, it\'s the same father who taught me to turn off lights when I left a room. We got to get back to some of those habits. You know, I think in the world in which we are facing challenges from new competitors, threats and dangers that are real, we\'ve got to start acting like Americans again. We got to roll up or sleeves and claim that this country is worth fighting for and saving, and (inaudible) that we get back on the right track. (APPLAUSE) So I\'m excited to be here to unveil these plans, because I believe that we can do this. I\'m absolutely confident and optimistic. I know everybody says, ""Well, we can\'t get anything done in Washington."" But when you think about it, President Bush really wanted to divide America, unfortunately. I regret that deeply. There\'s a lot we can get done if we\'re working together. That\'s what I\'ve done in the Senate. You know, before I got to the Senate a lot of people didn\'t know whether I could or would work with Republicans. One of the Republicans famously said after I got elected, ""Well, maybe lightning will strike before she gets here."" (LAUGHTER) Well, thankfully, it didn\'t. (LAUGHTER) But when I got there, I rolled up my sleeves, because I was elected to help the people who sent me to the Senate. When I\'m president, I\'m going to roll them up even higher, and we\'re going to get to work together. And one of the things we\'re going to do is to help Americans once again face the future with security and have a retirement plan that really helps middle-class Americans. That\'s what I pledge to you. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 11, 2007","b'Speech on College Affordability at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, New Hampshire'","b'Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you so much.I am so happy to be here at Plymouth State and to be with all of you. To have a conversation about what is at stake in this election and I want to thank my friend and your senator Deb Reynolds. Deb is so committed to representing her constituents and trying to come up with creative good ideas that will make a difference for them. I also want to recognize and thank someone else who is here, who is the speaker of the House of Representatives in NH, Speaker Terie Norelli. (Applause) And President Sarah James Dean, thank you for welcoming me to this campus, President Dean has the great privilege of being able to preside over a campus whose reputation is so excellent and growing and whose students go on to do so many important things on behalf of New Hampshire, our country and the world. And I want to thank Trevor, Trevor Tanridge, student body president, thank you for welcoming us and thank you for having this student sponsored series that is going to be taking place here at Plymouth State. I think that\'s a terrific idea and I congratulate you and everyone who worked with you on it. We\'re going to have a conversation today and we\'re going to start by talking about an issue that might be of particular interest to all of you and your families and that is college affordability. How we can do more to make college affordable for hardworking young people and their families. I have a couple of people with me who you will meet in a minute who are going to really illustrate some of the challenges that students and families here in NH and across the Country face when it comes to affording college. Ill be introducing them in a few minutes. But I thank them for being part of this discussion. After we finish talking about college affordability we\'re going to throw it open for you to ask any questions you are interested in because I know how important this election is for the future and in fact it is probably more important for the future of the students here than for the rest of us because the next President will make decisions to chart the course of our country through much of the 21st century. Now I obviously believe that among the tasks of the next President will be reversing the damage that has been done by our current President. We won\'t be moving forward with confidence and competence into the future, tackling the challenges we face, understanding that there is no guarantee and we will remain a great nation with a growing economy and shared prosperity and the opportunities available that were present for previous generations unless we do the work that is necessary to make that happen. And one of the key to a strong and confident America is a system of higher education that is acceptable to all who are motivated to seek it out. And yet as I travel across our country, I have confirmation every day about how much more difficult it is for many students to afford to start college, continue college and graduate from college than it was 20 or 30 years ago. But I\'d like to start off with a few questions. How many of you have ever worried about whether you could afford college or if your family members whether the young people in your family could afford college? How many of you have ever had to worry about that. That\'s a lot of hands. How many of you have taken out college loans. How many of you are totally baffled by the college loaned format? How many of you have ever wondered how we\'re going to pay back those loans? Well, we don\'t exactly make it easy for you, do we? College costs are up 35 percent in the last five years alone. The average student graduates with $20,000 in debt. That number is even higher in New Hampshire. New Hampshire has one of the highest costs of college in the country. Therefore, students graduate with higher debt. Higher education has never been more of a financial burden, but in today\'s global economy it\'s never been more important. Graduates from four-year colleges earn nearly twice as much as high school graduates, an estimated $1 million more over a lifetime. Forty-two percent of all new jobs this decade will require some post-secondary education. That\'s a big jump from even six and a half years ago, when it was only about 29 percent. Countries across the world, from Japan to South Korea, from Canada to Ireland, are educating their young people at higher rates than we are in America. That is news. Our higher education system has historically been the envy of the world. We know that in other countries (inaudible) the future was determined at the age of 12 or 16. But they have changed, and they now value college much more, and the rates of young people going to college are actually higher than we have now in America. And China and India are not far behind. When it comes to higher education, we should not be playing catch-up with the world, we should continue to be leading, because the skills and knowledge of our workforce will determine whether America can compete and win in the 21st century. Americans work harder than anybody in the world. When you measure productivity, which is a term for determining how much output we get per hour, per worker, Americans are by far the hardest-working people. But there is a mismatch between what Americans are being compensated for in terms of all that hard work and whether our skills are keeping up with the new job challenges that await us. This is at the heart of what I\'ve been talking about this week. How can we rebuild the road to a strong and prosperous middle class in America? After what this administration has done the last six and a half years, it will not be an easy task. I believe we need a new beginning, so I\'ve been outlining how I would change course, how I would change course in education, how I would change course in the economy, how I would change course in heath care, how I would change course in Iraq and our policy around the world. I started talking about an economic blueprint for a 21st century economy. We\'ve got to create more jobs. I think we can do that if we had a serious set of policies to address energy independent and global warming. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I believe that we can create jobs if we end the war on science and begin to respect scientists and researchers... (APPLAUSE) I believe we can create jobs if we invest in our infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges, our public transit, and our virtual infrastructure, which is why I appreciated Deb talking about my Connect America plan. We are falling behind in access to high-speed Internet. We used to lead the world. Now other countries have made investments. They\'re moving more quickly on the information superhighway. We also have to restore fairness to our economy. We have more inequality than we\'ve had since the Great Depression. The rich are going so much richer, the middle class is running in place, and people are falling back into poverty. Contrast that with what we did during the \'90s: 22 million new jobs and more people lifted out of poverty that in any time in our country\'s history. (APPLAUSE) I believe we can get back that level of (inaudible) if we put our fiscal house in order, getting back to where we were six and a half years ago with a balanced budget and a surplus, start paying as we go again, instead of borrowing billions of dollars every single week from countries like China, Japan, South Korea, the gulf states. And we even now owe money to Mexico. So I think we should get back to fiscal responsibility, because you begin as a nation to lose control over your destiny when you owe money to countries whose interests are not the same as your own. (APPLAUSE) See, I want to get back to the basic (inaudible) that I was raised on. If you worked hard and you\'re responsible, then you and your family can get ahead. It\'s pretty simple and it works. Yesterday -- Tuesday -- I outlined how I want to help more Americans save for retirement. We\'re going to preserve and protect Social Security and then we\'re going to give Americans a change to make investments so that they can build up their own retirement funds. And yesterday I talked about innovation, and I went to an innovative company right here in New Hampshire, GT Solar, which should be the model for what we do around the country. They\'re actually exporting technology to China. Don\'t you think that\'s what we ought to be doing instead of the other way around? And we can if we have the right policies again. Well, today I want to talk about how we open the gateway to the middle class by making college affordable and accessible. Back when I went to college my late father said to me that he\'d saved enough money -- he was a small-business man -- to pay for room, board and tuition, but I wanted to buy a book or anything else, I had to earn the money. That was our deal. CLINTON: That was fine with me. Then I graduated from college and I decided I wanted to go to law school. So I told my father, and he said, ""That\'s not part of the deal."" (LAUGHTER) So I had to get a little scholarship, and I had to keep working. But then I borrowed money. And I borrowed money from the federal government. I borrowed it, as I recall, at something like 2 percent interest. It did not bankrupt me. It did not cause me to have to take a job on Wall Street. Instead, I got to do what I wanted to do. As a young lawyer, I wanted to work at the Children\'s Defense Fund to defend the rights and needs of children. And now, what is happening is so many young people come out with debt and have to take jobs solely for the purpose of paying off their student loans. I think we\'ve got to get back to the great American tradition of making it possible for you to go to college. You know, Harry Truman had the G.I. bill, that led to a thriving middle class. President Eisenhower started loans for math and science education. He adopted Pell Grants and the Hope scholarships. And we have all understood, for a long time, that (inaudible) college education is not the (inaudible) for all of us. Unfortunately, our current president has a different approach, more focused on providing handouts to Halliburton and tax cuts to oil companies than he is to making sure that we take care of getting the next generation educated. So I\'m going to reverse that, because too many people today feel like they\'re just invisible when it comes to affording college. You know, if your parent work as hard he knows how and you still haven\'t saved enough money, then you are invisible to this president. If you\'re a young person who went ahead and applied, and then didn\'t get enough financial aid and had to put that acceptance letter in a drawer somewhere, you feel pretty invisible as well. And if you\'re a recent graduate who wants to maybe be a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a social worker -- and then you look at your student loans and you figure out you can\'t pay them off if you be what your heart wants to be, you\'re invisible as well. Well, you are not invisible to me. And you will not be invisible to the next president of the United States, because we will... (APPLAUSE) I have been working to open the doors to college for a long time. CLINTON: You know, when I was first lady in Arkansas I served as the founding board president of something called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship program. The idea was to help single parents access higher education and better jobs so they could better provide for themselves and their children. (inaudible) that program in 2000 and found that 80 percent of the recipients have graduated and 92 percent have found employment that paid more than what they had before. In the Senate, I sponsored a Student Borrowers Bill of Rights to ensure that students\' monthly payments would not exceed a certain percentage of their income and that the interest rates would be fair and not unpredictable. I\'m proud that the new bill that the Democratic majority just passed and was signed into law provides an income-based loan repayment program like I had in law school and based on what I championed in the Senate. My bill of rights would also protect students from loan company schemes to exploit them with exorbitant rates and to give you the best information available. I\'ve also proposed a new G.I. Bill of Rights for the 21st century. This bill would provide the full cost of tuition and fees and a living allowance for 36 months of schooling for those who give four years of active duty military service. And I\'ve also... (APPLAUSE) I\'ve also proposed creating a United States public service academy, modeled on our military academy, that would give tuition-free education to young people who would go into education, government, public health, environmental conservation and more. CLINTON: This academy would give young people committed to a life of service the chance to get the skills and training and leadership abilities that they would need. And today here, at Plymouth State, I want to unveil my plan as president to expand access to the American dream. Here\'s what I will do. First, I will create a new, $3,500 college tax credit. I will do that by taking the old HOPE tax credit and more than doubling the maximum benefits that students can receive under it, from $1,650 to $3,500. This new tax credit will cover more than 50 percent of the typical cost of public colleges and universities and the full cost of community colleges. This tax credit is the heart of my plan, because I want to reward people who are trying to do better for themselves. I will make it partially refundable, so that people with low incomes will also be able to have something. Second, I will make applying for financial aid in the first place a lot easier. Now, as you know from your experience, you practically need a Ph.D. to understand how to fill out these forms. This form, called the FAFSA has three times as many questions as the typical tax refund, and it\'s five times as long. Families are sometimes required to submit it before they even receive the tax information they need to fill it out. And if they do send it in, what they get in return is a card that says, ""Based on the information you have submitted, we have used the standard formula to calculate your (inaudible) which is"" -- then there\'s a dollar amount. CLINTON: And then it goes on to say your school will use this number determine what types of aid and how much you are eligible for based on your educational (inaudible). If you don\'t know what that means, you are not alone. And the form does not provide an explanation. For those who are curious, EFC is expected family contribution. Listen to this. We did a lot of research to get this number. Americans spend 100 million hours a year filling out these forms. That is the equivalent of 55,500 full-time jobs. (LAUGHTER) But 25 percent of the qualifying expenses never get claimed. These forms are tedious, confusing and 100 percent unnecessary. That\'s why I\'m getting rid of them... (APPLAUSE) Here\'s what you\'ll do when I\'m president. You\'ll check one box on your income tax return. Doesn\'t matter whether you\'re long form or short form, one box. That\'s it. Then you\'ll receive a letter from the Department of Education with a couple showing the amount of federal aid, grants and loans, you\'re entitled to. You\'ll include this information on your application. Your college will collect the money directly from the Department of Education. And you\'ll be on your way to getting the diploma. This will save families and students 100 million hours a year. It\'ll save the government money. And it will increase, we estimate, the college-going rate by about 5 to 7 percent. Think that\'s a pretty good payoff for eliminating piles of paperwork. (APPLAUSE) Third, under my plan we\'ll work to hold college costs down and we will hold colleges accountable for the results. I will create a college cost calculator by asking colleges to submit to the Department of Education information -- anonymously, of course -- about their students\' income and the aid that is received. We\'ll then use that information to create a user-friendly Web site where students can type in their family\'s income and immediately learn roughly how much they would pay to attend a particular college. I will also instruct the Department of Education to release information about graduations and graduate employment rates for every single college in America. And I will require state and local colleges and universities to set a fixed rate for each entering freshman class that will last for multiple years. CLINTON: No more sudden tuition hikes. No more scrambling to scrape up the cash you need just to graduate. And when you start college, in year one, you should know what you\'re going to have to pay until you graduate. And we\'re going to move in that direction. (APPLAUSE) Fourth, I would make college more affordable for those who serve in AmeriCorps. After my husband created AmeriCorps in 1993, the program covered 40.7 (ph) percent of the total cost of attending a four-year public college. Today, 13 years later, tuition costs have skyrocketed, but the amount of tuition assistance is exactly the same. I will address this by doubling the education awards that AmeriCorps volunteers receive for the service they render. These young men and women are building homes, mentoring children, providing disaster relief, and so much more. They\'re serving our country every day. And I want our country to serve them in return. (APPLAUSE) And I was very pleased today that (inaudible) AmeriCorps educational (inaudible). (APPLAUSE) Because the school believes so strongly in this program. (APPLAUSE) I would like to see more (inaudible) lead. Fifth, I\'d strengthen community colleges. They offer some of the most important, cutting-edge, worker training opportunities in America. CLINTON: And some provide a high quality education, yet, too often, they are treated like second-class citizens. If they\'re not four years as a college, even though they often provide a better education than some of our four-year colleges, they still don\'t get the respect and support they deserve. They\'re not ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Four-year colleges often refuse to accept their course credits, making it virtually impossible for millions of promising community college students to go on and receive a B.A. I will work to support our community colleges by providing incentive grants, a partnership between community colleges and four- year institutions, for lower tuition, increased graduation rates, and create what are called articulation agreements that enable students to transfer more smoothly from two-year to four-year colleges. Fifth, I\'ll establish a graduation fund to increase graduation rates. The United States used to rank first in the world in the percentage of our young people with a post-secondary degree. We have now fallen to seventh, not because our young people don\'t start college, but because fewer than two-thirds who start actually finish. Some can\'t keep up with the work, and others simply can\'t keep up with the tuition. My graduation fund will set out to close this diploma gap. This grant to four-year colleges that will hold down tuition costs and provide greater support for students, especially struggling students. A lot of first-generation college students are really bewildered by the college environment. They don\'t have a brother or a sister or a parent to call and say, ""Gosh, you know, I don\'t know what to do."" I remember, how homesick and lonely I was when I went to college. My mother had never gone to college. My father went to college on a football scholarship, so that didn\'t exactly relate to my experience. And I just felt like I was in over my head, that everybody in the college was smarter than me. And I called home, and I said, ""You know, I want to come home."" CLINTON: And my parents said, ""You have to stick it out until the end of the semester,"" and luckily, things changed. But a lot of people have nobody to talk to about that. And we need to do more to provide effective help. Seven, I will challenge America\'s most selective colleges to recruit, retain and ensure the access of more low-income and minority students. (APPLAUSE) If you look at the income breakdown of the so-called most select colleges and universities -- I recognize that it\'s also our country -- there has been a dramatic shift. An increasing and very high percentage of the students in those institutions come from the wealthiest of American families. It used to be you had a much broader income distribution. And that no long is the case. While these schools have done leaders in expanding (inaudible) 75 percent of students at America\'s elite colleges come from the top 25 percent of income in America. Only three percent of the students there come from the bottom 25 percent. And we\'re talking about motivated, qualified students. The top wealthiest schools in America have endowments worth a total of $155 billion, yet they continue to raise tuition year after year. Well, I am challenging these schools to set an example -- devote substantially more of their endowment to recruiting more low-income and minority students and ensure that they graduate, that every child in America should have a shot at going to the best schools in America no matter where they\'re born or how much money their family has. That should be part of the American dream. (APPLAUSE) Finally, for those who don\'t attend college or those in the workforce who need to update their skills, I\'m going to provide $500 million to support innovative on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs. You know, when you look -- yes, let\'s applaud for that. (APPLAUSE) Because, you know, even though I\'m 100 percent committed to encouraging and enabling more young Americans to go to college and graduate, the fact is that in any age group, more young people do not go to college than do. In fact, it\'s close to 60 percent that do not. What are we doing for those 60 percent hardworking, motivated young Americans? I don\'t think we\'re paying enough attention to them. Apprenticeship programs that prepare specialty skilled workers in manufacturing have decreased dramatically in number and size during the past 20 years, creating an urgent need for skilled workers, particularly in the trades and manufacturing. I had the New York auto dealers come to see me a year or so ago. And they said, ""Senator, we have 600 jobs right now we cannot fill for auto mechanics. Because being an auto mechanic today means you\'ve got to understand computers. Nobody\'s training auto mechanics any longer. These jobs pay starting at $50,000, because they are highly skilled. And what the auto dealers decided to do is start their own school. And I want to help them do that. About a week later, the airline mechanics came to see me, said, ""The average age of an airline mechanic is getting older, and it looks like we\'re going to be losing a lot of people to retirement. What are we doing to help train the next generation of airline mechanics?"" You don\'t want to get on an airplane that hasn\'t been checked out by a good airline mechanic. Think about what builds America, what runs America, what keeps America going. It\'s a lot of hardworking people, and I think we should do more to give them the training and the apprenticeship programs that fill the gap that now exists between what they can do and what they should be able to do, if they\'re provided -- were provided that opportunity. (APPLAUSE) So I\'m going to make that part of my American dream. Now, if I had been giving this speech to you six months ago, I would have a lot more to say about what I wanted to do because we were so out of balance. But I want to tell you, one of the reasons why it was good for America that the Democrats took back the Congress in 2006, because we have now passed a college bill that solves some of our problems. I\'m zeroing in on the remaining ones. The college bill we have passed -- and I want to thank President Bush for signing it. He didn\'t veto it; he signed it -- has (inaudible) subsidies by $22 billion, increases the Pell Grant to $5,400 by 2012. The legislation includes my proposal to make student loans more affordable by limiting the loan payments to a percentage of your income. The bill also includes something I strongly supported, a public service loan forgiveness program. So if you work in a public service job, and you\'ve made 10 years of payments, you will be done paying off your loan. And we\'re going to try to encourage young people to... (APPLAUSE) But I believe America\'s ready for change. And I believe that change is just a word, if you don\'t have the strength and experience to make it happen. And I hope that you will give me the opportunity to lead that change. I think the best days of America lie ahead, if we not only have new leadership that is confident, optimistic and effective, getting results here at home and around the world, but if we have people of all ages in America, committed once again to seizing the opportunities that are available for those who work hard and are responsible, and themselves are taking on the future with confidence and optimism as well. Thank you all very much. CLINTON: And now we\'re two, three people, with two different stories that really fit into what I\'ve been talking about. And I think it\'s important that we get these stories out before us because I think it will trigger some of your own stories when we get to the question time. Our first guests are Kim and Ashley Beauregard. Kim is Ashley\'s mother, and Ashley is a high school junior. She is a junior at Laconia High School and is the junior class president, so congratulations. (Scattered Applause) CLINTON: She has worked hard, she has been a successful student, she is very interested in going to college. She has three brothers, one is in the military, one went to tech school for mechanics, one is a painter, but she is really motivated in her desire to go to college, and the Beauregards are concerned about how they will afford college for Ashley. So Ashley and Kim, thank you for joining us today. (Applause) Ashley Beauregard: Well being the youngest in my family I\'ve always known that I wanted to go to college and it wasn\'t affordable for the rest of my family but they\'ve always supported me and knew that I wanted to go. So my oldest brother decided to go into the military because after a few years out of high school he realized that he wanted to go back to school and he had no way afford it. So it was kind of a struggle for us watching him have to go into the Air Force and wonder what might happen because of the war and things like that. So we were kind of nervous, but glad that he went to school and we\'re glad that he\'s doing what he\'s doing. My other brother Chris went to a tech school and I\'m very proud of him, and my brother Matt is actually going to school today at a technical college in Laconia and trying to get an education but it\'s still hard for us to afford it. And so I\'ve been doing different programs trying to learn how to afford it. But there are some things as a high school student that I\'m not really aware of, like the Pell Grants, which you mentioned. I mean, I\'ve never heard of it and I\'m sure that other students in my school haven\'t and other students around New Hampshire and the United States haven\'t heard of different programs and scholarships that students can get to afford school. So I\'m really interested in how to pay. (Laughter) CLINTON; That\'s the right question to ask. Kim, do you want to add something? Kim Beauregard: There\'s a student educational talent search for families that are financially stable but might not have the money to pay 50,000 dollars for school, and they brought us around to the different colleges in New Hampshire, Plymouth State was one of them. And I learned a lot about the different colleges but they never showed us how to pay. And we didn\'t know of any of the options that would be open to her and some kind of scholarship definitely would help her. But we would take out a home equity loan on our house. CLINTON: You would consider taking out a home equity loan? Kim Beauregard: We would sell the house if we have to. CLINTON: You would sell you own house? Kim Beauregard: If we have to, to pay for college for her/ CLINTON: Well Kim as a mom myself I have to say I\'m really moved by that. What Kim said it that not only would they take out a home equity loan to pay for Ashley to go to college, but they would sell their house if it were necessary. Because she is their youngest and she\'s always dreamed of this. And like most mothers Kim wants to do whatever it takes to help Ashley live up to her dream. I just don\'t think that a hard working family like yours should be put in that position. And that\'s what we\'re going to try to fix. (Applause) Kim Beauregard: Senator, the things you said today really give me a lot of hope. And all of your, not just today, but you health care plan and all your other proposals are wonderful and I\'d just like to thank you. CLINTON: I think that it would really be in America\'s interest if Ashley could pursue her dreams. She\'s a motivated, obviously ambitious young woman who\'s done well. And I think the point you made about how this information is so hard to gather is definitely something to address. Now with the internet all we need is a simple website where everybody can go. That way you can go to one place, put in the name of any colleges your considering and you could see what the costs are, you can see what the offers are, you can see what you eligible for. Because these are huge decisions, especially for a family like the Beauregards who a willing to make such a drastic decision of maybe selling their home. We need to get number one, the best information possible, number two we need to get more help. This is an issue, I won\'t, but I could talk about for a long time. We have moved away from what used to be called ""need based aid"" and meritocracy. Now that sounds really good, cause we\'re a meritocracy and we should award merits. The problem is that need based was often used to help young people from families of more modest means afford to go to college. But if you push it so far towards merit based aid and you have no financial limits a lot of financial aid is now going to families that can afford to pay all or most of the college costs for their own children. And that means that a lot of good, hard working B students who are trying hard, with good college stats are just left out. So we\'ve seen changes in the last twenty years that have really tilted strongly against middle class families. That\'s why I\'m putting forth this agenda today, because if we don\'t get back to a better balance we\'re just going to see more and more colleges with students coming from the top twenty-five percent of our income. I\'ve got nothing against that but I like an America where people up and down the income scale are going to have a chance to live up to their dreams. (Applause) CLINTON: I\'m going to turn know to Gene, Gene Barton is a junior here at Plymouth State, he is the junior class vice president. He has been working since she was fourteen years old. He has had to take out both scholarships and loans, to his own credit, to put himself through college. He had a challenging life story, but now he\'s majoring in political science, he\'s planning to go to law school. And I know that his mother is very proud of him. And I think you could see in Gene\'s story exactly what you want America to be. His mother, and I have a quote here from Gene, ""He always wanted to go to school and go to college. He always wanted to be a lawyer and be a judge one day. But in order to get where he wanted to be he had to go to a four-year college. And he\'s worked really, really hard, not only to obtain that educations but to make the most of it."" Gene do you want to share your thoughts with us? Gene Barton: Inaudible CLIONTON: Are you advertising? (Laughter) Gene Barton: Inaudible CLINTON: I hear this a lot because if you get over the hurdle, Kim and Ashley are facing the first hurdle, \'can you afford to get in?\' And the second hurdle is \'can you afford to stay in?\' And then the third hurdle is, \'if you graduate, can you afford to do what you want in life?\' Whether it\'s graduate school, professional education or the job that you want, because of debt that you incur. Now I\'m a big believer in individual responsibility, and I like that people have to pay, like I said, I had to pay for law school and the rest of that. But I think we\'ve made it really, really hard. It\'s so hard now that we are losing young people who could make a contribution. One of the proposals I made the day before yesterday about retirement security is to create what I call ""American Retirement Accounts,"" that you can put money into, as soon as you start working. And then if you do need money for college, or if you buy a home, or other necessary expenses like that, you can draw it out tax-free. It goes in tax free it would come out tax free, for you to be able to use that money, because we need to create more savings. Part of the reason we\'re in the bind we are right now, about why it\'s so hard for so many families to afford college is that middle class incomes have stagnated. The average family income has lost a thousand dollars the last six years. And so here we have people working hard, two jobs, sometimes three jobs and their not getting ahead while health care costs, education costs, and energy costs are going up. So we\'ve got this perfect storm where everybody\'s working hard and their not getting ahead and we\'re not making it easier, we\'re making it harder. One of the things that I\'m proposing, that will help Gene do, is to get more resources to rely on to be able to go forward, and I wish you well on that. The whole point to the road to the middle class and trying to make the middle class more prosperous is that that is what America is. You know you can find rich people anywhere in the world. And with all do respect rich people did not make America great. They\'ve made their contributions, but, the people who sacrificed, who fought the wars, who made the economy grow, who did the hard work, have been part of this unique American invention, this huge middle class. You know other countries are following in our wake, you see them raising the standard of living. But we\'ve been the pioneers, and that enabled generations of Americans to live better than their parents and grandparents. Well, know we are in danger of stalling, and I don\'t want us to be the first generation of Americans to leave our country worse than when we found it. And that means we\'ve got to have a new commitment to doing what it takes to get the engine of economics and prosperity for all, moving again. And I\'m confident we can do that. But we\'ve got to help people to afford to make some of these life decisions. So I want to thank Kim, and Ashley and Gene for sharing their stories. It\'s not easy coming up in front of all of you and doing that, thank you. (Applause) CLINTON: Does anybody have a microphone on them somewhere? Do we? Okay, so we\'re going to call on people from now until the bell rings or whatever happens around here. So why don\'t we, I see a hand there, the man in the blue shirt. Q: Thank you for coming to Plymouth State, my question also relates to education. My father got laid off three days ago from his job. He was a thirty-five year Eastern truck driver. My concern is paying for college after we come to school is a great idea. But for me, as a student, right now as a student, things like food and gas are a luxury. I just got my car payment in and I work two jobs. And you know, it\'s hard. How can we help students not only pay for college, but how can we help them pay for the rising cost of gas, text-books, and other issues that come up in a college career? CLINTON: Well, how many people can relate to that question? (Applause) CLINTON: You know I\'m sorry about your dad and I hope that things turn around for him. You know when I think about what we need to do to make is possible for people to start, continue and graduate, I think we need to find ways to provide more aid that can be flexible. It\'s great to pay for the room, the tuition and the board. And what I propose will give you more resources to do that and then enable you to shift some of that money that you\'re earning on your two jobs away from living expenses. But it is still going to be a stretch for some people. And I tell you, when I was in school there were a couple of times when I had some expenses that I couldn\'t meet, and we had, I went to Wellselly, which is a woman\'s college, outside of Boston, and we had what we call the student aid society. And you could borrow money in an emergency to meet your living expenses, with the promise that you would pay it back, when it came time to pay it back. You just signed you name, there was no big checking you out or anything like that. You were a student and you made a promise to pay it back. That helped me out on more than one occasion, I have to tell you, because like my dad said, if I wanted to buy a book I had to earn it myself. And I had to go and borrow money from this student aid society to do exactly what you\'re talking about, to meet living expenses and other needs. I don\'t know how many colleges do that, but I think it\'s something we ought to encourage more people to think about. Secondly, I reference the program I started, it was made for single parents, but it doesn\'t have to be, it was ""Philanthropic Dollars"" and we did not give people grants for room, board and tuition, we gave them grants to handle living expenses. Because, you know, if you can\'t get to class because your car breaks down, you\'re not going to be able to continue your education. If you\'re a single parent and you can\'t find affordable childcare, you\'re not going to be able to continue your education. If you have a medical emergency and you\'re an uninsured student, you might be in trouble too. So I think you\'re exactly right, we need to look for some creative ways, get some private dollars in to supplement the public dollars that I\'m talking about with tuition tax credit and other things. And I would just throw that out as an idea. A lot of students, and I respect this young man standing up, like when I felt so distraught and homesick when I was at college because I didn\'t know if I would fit in. Well, a lot of students feel that way, and they think they are the only person who is struggling with this kind of issue. But if we made it more transparent and said look we know we can help more people, lets get creative about it, I think that would be a way of helping tide people over and then you pay back, it\'s like a revolving loan fund. You know, when you get ahead you do that. I think we need to look at other ways to do this because that\'s the main reason a lot of people drop out. There living expenses explode on them, there emergency expenses explode on them. And there are a lot of hard working people in this state and around the United States and I think we ought to think of ways we can help them more. (Applause) CLINTON: That had right there, yes. Q: Hi, I just wanted to ask, I\'m an age out foster student. I wanted to know, there are other states that are helping age out foster students that get into college and everything like that, and I wanted to ask how you were planning to make the acceptance of an independent age out foster youth? CLINTON: Let me thank you for asking that question again, that\'s a courageous question. And I thank you for that. You know I have spent a lot of my career as a lawyer representing and working for kids who are in the foster care system, and what she\'s referring to is what\'s called an age out foster youth. What that means is that in the foster care system you haven\'t been adopted into a permanent home, it\'s not a good idea for a lot of reasons to return to your birth home. And the foster system says \'we\'re finished, when you turn eighteen and graduate high school\' in some states whichever happens first. I have represented foster kids who when they turn eighteen and have a semester left in high school and the state sends a worker with a big, black garbage bag to wherever the foster child is living, they put your belongings in it and you\'re on your own. I\'ve know a lot of foster kids who have been very resilient and resourceful and been able to survive that, but I\'ve also known a lot that haven\'t. A lot of kids who age out of foster care finish high school and they want to go to college. Now imagine if it\'s as hard as it sounds for all of you imagine what it is like to have no family, to have no credit, they have supported you and know it\'s over. So I have focused on helping a group you may have heard of. It\'s got an unfortunate name, but it\'s a wonderful group called the Orphan Foundation. The Orphan Foundation, and if somebody in your staff will find this young woman, I will connect you up to The Orphan Foundation, which helps to pay for college for aged out kids. (Applause) CLINTON: You probably don\'t think about it a lot, but something on the order of twenty to twenty-five thousand kids age out of foster care every year. And the ones who do get to go to college, I try to have a foster care student and college intern program and I\'ve got a couple of great students who have interned in my office. And one thing you don\'t think about that they\'ve educated me on is they go to college which is a huge accomplishment, but where do they go for the holidays? One quote, one woman said that ""all I ever wanted was to have some place to go for Thanksgiving."" And I think that this is another area where if we could pay a little more attention to each other, if we listen to each other, we can try to help each other, you never know what that help might mean to somebody. And how that person in turn can help someone else. So make sure that you connect up with somebody on my staff. Thanks. (Applause) CLINTON: Yes sir. Q: Thank you Senator, I have two questions, the first is you talk a lot about students which is fantastic. Would you have to raise taxes to do that? The second question is, in the Senate, you supported raising the minimum wage. And as a business major I\'ve been educated that this devalues the dollar and it also puts a lot of small businesses out of business, creating opportunities for big business. Would you care to comment on that? CLINTON: I\'d be happy to. Thank you and good luck in you business career. The first question \'how would I pay for what I want to do for college?\' Well I have proposed a number of ideas that I think are important for America and put forth on my website HillaryClinton.com, how I would pay for each and every one of them. Here\'s how I would pay for improving affordability for paying for college, I would freeze the estate tax at what would be the 2009 level. I other words if you have an estate when you die of seven million dollars or less you will not pay taxes. If you have an estate more than seven million for a couple, you will. (Applause) CLINTON: I happen to believe that inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not good for America. (Applause) CLINTON: I am supported in that belief, not just by Democrats, but remember the estate tax was first proposed by progressive Republicans, who believed in a meritocracy, who understood that if we began to move towards concentrated, inherited, generational health, we would begin to undermine the motivation of the meritocracy. So the estate tax, if we freeze it at the seven million dollar level, and please go out and tell people, there are people who make fifty thousand dollars a year who are worried they\'re going to be taxed when they die, the Republicans have done such a good job confusing this issue, and frankly misleading people. So you can tell them under me unless they make seven million dollars, an estate of seven million, there are no taxes. But if we tax the estate above seven million, that will bring in four hundred billion dollars in ten years. That\'s how much money it would give back. (Applause) CLINTON: I respect people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet who\'ve stated one hundred percent, that they oppose the repeal of the estate tax. Because they know what inheritance wealth does to their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren. So if Warren Buffet said, \'I\'m doing this in the interest of my family\'s DNA. I don\'t\' want lazy people who\'ve inherited their money from me thinking that they don\'t have to do anything in their life. And I don\'t want a lazy America.\' And that\'s the end of that. So that\'s how I would pay for because with that money I would pay for retirement accounts to help middle income Americans pay for retirement and I will help put more Americans off to work. With respect to the minimum wage I have looked at all the research. We raised the minimum wage in 1997 during one of the great expansions of job creation in America. Small businesses in the last twenty years have created eighty percent of new jobs in America. And there is no credible evidence that raising the minimum wage puts businesses out of business. What it does is enable people to move toward a more credible standard of living. I know there are comments on the other side, but the weight of the evidence is very clearly in favor of that. We just raised the minimum wage again and the idea that raising taxes always kills jobs is kind of hard to justify on the basis of our last fifteen years of experience. One of the ways my husband moved us from to surplus and a balanced budget was by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. And during that eight years we saw the creation of twenty-two million new jobs. President Bush never met a tax cut for a wealthy person he didn\'t want to cut. And we have not seen the kind of job creation that was promised by enacting those tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans. (Applause) CLINTON: Okay they tell me I have one more and I saw this ladies hand way back there, if you could get her a microphone. Q: I heard a rumor, and the rumor was that you were on the board of directors at Walmart. The issue that pertains to me is the one of medical marijuana, thank you. CLINTON: Well, I was on the board at Walmart. I was on the board at Walmart in the late nineteen eighties. I worked very hard when I was on the board to increase diversity for women and minorities at Walmart. And I also created the first committee to look at environment impact of Walmart. That was way back in the 1980s. I tried to encourage Walmart to be more energy efficient, to use more recyclable materials and so much else. Now I know that Walmart\'s policies are ones that do not reflect in my view, the best way of doing business and the values that I think are important in America like having big companies provide healthcare to the people who work for them. And I intend to have a healthcare plan which I propose having an American Choices plan that would require Walmart to provide health care to all employees and I think they can afford it, and I look forward to having that happen. (Applause) CLINTON: I also am a strong supporter of the Employee Free Choice Act, making it easier for people to organize unions because I think that the right to organize a union is a fundament human right, not just a fundamental American right. So there are changes that will come when I become president. With respect to medical marijuana, we\'ve had a lot of rhetoric and the federal government has been very intent upon on trying to prevent states from being able to offer that to people as an option to people who are in pain. I think we should be doing medical research on it. We ought to find were the elements that claim to be existing in marijuana that might help people who are suffering from cancer and nausea related to treatment, we ought to find that out. I don\'t think we should decriminalize it. But we ought to do research and to what if any benefits it has. Remember most painkillers come from poppies. You\'ve got all kinds of drugs that have benefited Americans and we ought to be doing some research, if there\'s something that could be made available that would be legal we should look into that. There are a lot of people that are suffering from debilitating pain from medical treatment that they undergo and there\'s no reason they should suffer needlessly if we can have a legal, ethical framework to alleviate that pain. Thank you all very, very much. (Applause)'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 16, 2007","b'Remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire on Helping Parents Balance Work & Family'","b""I want to thank the YWCA for opening their doors to us today, I'm a big supporter of the Y. And I've worked with the YWCA for many years on issues having to do with women and girls. And the crisis services and support that is provided and particularly the tools that the Y helps parents acquire to raise strong healthy children, and provide what I see as the village. They are part of village. It takes a village to raise a child. And the Y has been an absolutely essential part of that village here in Manchester and beyond.I want to thank Monica Zoloff, the director of the Y, and her staff. I want to thank my old friend Senator Betsey DeVries who has been a strong supporter of the Y and the work that it does in the community. I also want to recognize Tom Donavan the Democratic nominee for the Mayor of Manchester. [inaudible] I look forward to working with you and a lot of people are very excited about your campaign. You know, Marcy's story is all too familiar: You know you have to take an unpaid leave of absence when you're pregnant. You have to take vacation days to care for your sick children. You're stretched to the breaking point by the cost of raising two kids on your own. You know, raising a family in today's world is hard under any circumstances. I actually think that it's harder today than when I was a young parent. There's just so much going on and the cost of everything's going up. And all of the incoming influences over your children you really have no control over. And doing it by yourself makes it more than doubly hard. And so everywhere I go I see the anxiety and the frustration of families trying to strike a balance between their obligations at home and those at work. You know, from the parents of young children who are caught at the office or the work place long into the night. To the adult children who are both caring for aging parents and raising their own children. To the young women who often come up to me after I finish speaking and ask how I balance a family and work. Now I've been fortunate to have so much support as a working mother, but I understand what it means to be pulled in a million directions at once. The panic of having to get up early to get to an appointment when your child has a fever of 102 and the child care center is closed or the babysitter is sick. I remember one time I had to be in court when I was a young lawyer, Chelsea was a baby, we had a woman who did come in and help me she' come in early then after that she'd go home. Chelsea was sick and the babysitter wasn't there and then she called and she was sick too. And it was just that gut-wrenching feeling and I was lucky enough to have a friend who could come over and watch Chelsea while I ran to court then ran back home. But I know that happens every day. And there's so many pressures on young parents. Or the little mental bell that goes off in your head at the exact moment school lets out and you reflexively reach for the phone to check in and make sure your child has made it home safely. And if you have fewer resources, greater challenges, or an unsympathetic employer, then the struggle to balance family and work can simply be overwhelming. Too many Americans today feel trapped between being there for their kids and being a good there for their employer. And our government's policies have just not kept up with the new realities of American life. The traditional family -- the way I was raised- with one breadwinner and one homemaker -- is now the exception rather than the rule. Today, 70 percent of families with children are headed by two working parents or by an unmarried working parent. And the economy is changing as well. Over the past six years, Americans are actually working harder than ever before. And if you look at the surveys, Americans work harder than anybody else in the world. And yet family incomes have dropped by nearly $1,000. For all that hard work it's not paying off in material terms to help buy a little more faith and maybe a little more help in dealing with these obligations. At the same time, health care premiums have nearly doubled, college costs are up 40%, and gas prices have more than doubled. Highly skilled workers are working more hours than ever, and lower-skilled workers often need to take an extra job just to get by. As a result, American parents have twenty-two fewer hours a week to spend with their kids than they did back in 1969. And 67, two-thirds percent, two-thirds of all of working parents say they do not have enough time with their children. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act has been a significant step forward in the struggle to balance work and family. 50 million Americans have benefitted from this Act, which guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child, to care for a sick relative, or to tend to a personal medical problem. However, Family and Leave only covers those who work for businesses with 50 employees or more, and the leave is unpaid. Now, I've had countless people come up to thank me and thank my husband for Family and Medical Leave but a lot of people don't know about it or can't afford to take it. So it's been a tremendous help, but it leaves so many Americans out. But too few of those who are eligible, even for unpaid leave, can take advantage of it. I'm particularly worried about those critical days and weeks that really are important for bonding between new parents and their own children when they're forced to go back to work. Three out of four workers who report that they needed leave, but didn't take it, cited lost wages as the principal reason. You know, the sad fact is that our country is only one of a handful of countries that don't guarantee a legal right to paid maternity leave. And in the US only 7 percent of men have access to paid paternity leave, and less than 20 percent of women with a high school degree receive paid maternity leave. Now, for professional women, the story is somewhat better. Access to paid leave has steadily risen -- from 14 percent in the 1960s to 63 percent in the 1990s. I remember when I was pregnant I was working as a lawyer. The firm had never had a pregnant lawyer. And I just kept ignoring I was pregnant and the lawyers just kept sort of walking down the hall looking away and nobody would talk about it because I didn't know what I was supposed to say and they certainly didn't know what they were supposed to say. And so Chelsea came early and I was actually ending a trial and thinking Gosh now I'll have three weeks, maybe a month to get ready. And she must have had a different time table. So the morning after she was born I'm in the hospital and one of the partners in the law firm calls me up and says Well, I heard you had a baby. And I said Yeah that's what usually happens when you're pregnant. And he said well; want me to pick you up on the way to work? I took that as a joke. I said, well no, And he said, what are you going to do? I said, no no no, let me think about this. So you know, I was able to take time off, and I relished that time. I don't know what I would have done without it. Because as I once told Chelsea late one night, she was crying inconsolably, I said, Chelsea you've never done a baby before, I'm never done a mother before, we're just going to have to work to figure this out. And we had the time to do that, but a lot of young mothers don't. And I think that's bad for them, I think it's bad for their babies, and I think that's bad for all of us. Because you don't get that good beginning that really the foundation to so much more that is going to lead to success. So I think we've got to take a hard look, not only though at what happens with trying to care for children, but now increasingly for aging parents. You know, we have nearly half of our workers who work in the private sector, 57 million workers altogether in our country who have no sick days at all. And that means that it's really hard when you're responsible for an aging parent who has to get to the doctor. When there may be a parent who may live far from where you're living now, and you need time to go to make sure that he or she is okay. We have a lot of figures that show how much productivity we're losing in the economy because we're not figuring out a way to help family members do what we want them to do, which is care for each other. A flexible schedule would give caregivers an enormous amount of help. I think we should look for ways to do that. And certainly a lot of women who are employed with children, more than 60% would prefer to work part time, but that's not in the cards, because it's hard to manage that and it often doesn't pay enough to make it work for them. So I think that part of what we have to do is get real about what's happening with families today. I want to make it easer for people both to work and to fulfill their most important responsibilities. It's as though a lot of people in our society just feel like they're struggling all by themselves, and I think it's time we brought this conversation out into the open. You know, if you're a worker who gets sick but doesn't have sick days, well you are invisible. And if you're a single mom who can't afford childcare then you're invisible too. And if you're a parent who can't take time off to take your child to the doctor or to care for your aging parents, well, then you're invisible. And if you're a new mom, that wants to spend those critical early weeks bonding with their child, whether it's your birth child or an adopted child, and your fortunes turn to work, well you feel pretty invisible as well. Middle class Americans may be invisible to George Bush. But they're not going to be invisible to me. And when we take back the white house they will no longer be invisible to the President of the Untied States. It's time for a new administration that actually cares about the middle class. It's time for change of course in this country. We have to change our economic course, we have to change our course in Iraq, and change course when it comes to health care. The Bush economy has be3en a trap door economy. Too many families are just one diagnosis, one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment away from falling through. It's time once again to say, that America is only as strong as its middle class. And one of the keys to strengthening the middle class is supporting middle class families. That's why I've been so passionate about reauthorizing the Children's health insurance program that I helped to create. And that's why I've been so outraged over the Republican attack on this. And let me tell you one story that made me really angry. The story about a 12 year old boy named Graeme Frost, he was in a terrible car accident, but thanks goodness he was covered by the Children's health insurance program. And recently Graham and his family came to congress, to ask us to cover more children. But the President doesn't want to do that, so the Republican attack machine went after Graham, a 12 year old boy. Well they can come after me any time, but shame on them for attacking a child. And shame on them for opposing health care for our children. I think we've had enough of this cruel and destructive politics in America. And as President I'm going to return our focus to supporting middle class and hard working families, especially when it comes to caring for children, an issue that I've worked on my entire life. During law school I focused on how the law affects kids. After I graduated I turned down law firms to go door to door for the Children's defense fund, trying to figure out why so many children weren't enrolled at school. That led to the landmark federal special education law. During my years in Arkansas, I founded a group called Arkansas advocates for children and family and developed a scholarship program to support single moms. When Bill was elected President, I worked very hard to support the family medical leave act and would proud it was the first bill that he signed into law. It's been such a success that it's hard to remember how controversial it once was, it was actually vetoed twice before my husband was elected. And I want to pay special tribute to my colleague and friend Senator Chris Dodd who was the champion of the family medical leave act for all of those years. I also worked to create early Head Start, to ensure investment in Head Start and childcare funding, and I planned and to carried out the historic white house conferences on early childhood development and childcare. I continued this work in the Senate. [inaudible] legislation I offered to provide respite care for family caregivers, a bill to give families more flexibility in finding child care, and grandparents more help in raising their grandchildren. I co-sponsored legislation to provide seven paid sick days a year to help parents care for sick parents or children. And I've worked with FLAN the Family medical leave act, and to extend it for up to 6 months for family caring for wounded soldiers. But as far as we've come, it's clear that we have a long way to go. I'll never forget a newspaper advice column I read in the early 1980's, I was working at a law firm and my daughter was about 3 years old, someone had written this advice column, and they asked I'm about to get a big promotion and I'm going to have my own office. What kind of decorations are appropriate for my office? Well the advice columnist responded that he needed to know if the writer was a man or a woman because it would affect his answer. If you're a man, he wrote, and you have a family, put up lots of pictures of your family because people will think to themselves this is a stable person with good family values. But if you're a woman, don't put out any pictures of your family in the office, because people will think you can't keep your mind on the job. Well of course I immediately filled my little office with family pictures. Because I thought that that would [inaudible] Now, that was a long time ago, but it still sums up the attitude of America's policies toward women and parents in the workplace: Keep your family life to yourself and don't let your family affect your work. Well, I think we've had enough of that. It's about time we stopped just talking about family values and started pursuing policies that truly value families. So today, I'm handing out my agenda that I hope will make a difference in helping young families particularly strike that balance between family and work. For me this is a very personal issue because we all have a stake in the next generation. Sometimes people say to me well if you just focus on families with children. Well that's unfair to everybody else but I couldn't disagree more. Today kids are tomorrow's doctors and nurses, teachers, innovators, police officers and firefighters. So many other positions that we desperately need in our society. So a generation of healthy children raised by strong families is in America's best interest. And I think it's integrally related to our nation's future. The first part of my agenda is to promote paid family leave, which is critical for giving new parents the opportunity to bond with their children at the most important time in their development. Parental leave rules may give many families time off, but families of modest means too often simply can't afford to take it unless that leave is paid. I believe we should set a goal of every family in America being able to take time off when their children are born or adopted, and at least some of that time should be paid leave for those who need it. Everyone should be able to take the time to start their children off right. No one should miss out on those critical early days. Now this is a goal that will take some time to achieve. But what I want to do is propose that we have a Family Leave Initiative with federal government leadership and state level innovation. Many states that considered legislation, for example California now guarantees six weeks of family leave that employees paid at 55% of their wages up to $882 a week. I will submit $1 billion per year to an innovation fund that encourages a kind of state level solution. What worked in California may not work in Arkansas may not work in New Hampshire. We'll offer competitive matching grants that covers startup costs and help pay an equal part of the costs. We're not going to dictate from Washington what approach states should take but we will seek out and support the best innovation. I also want to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act. It currently only covers firms of fifty or more workers, it has not been an imposition on businesses. All of the nay-saying and the sort of Chicken Little predictions have not come true. I want to lower the threshold to twenty-five workers that will include an additional 13 million Americans. I also will reinstate a regulation I fought for during my husband's administration. Select states use their unemployment insurance system to provide paid paternity and maternity leave. President Bush was wrong to overturn it and we will bring it back. I also want to make the federal government a model workplace by providing paid parental leave. For a relatively modest cost, we can provide that for all federal employees. Doing so would set a standard and would make government service more attractive for younger workers. Parents also need access to leave at times other than the birth or adoption of a child and we need to recognize that reality. I will also work to promote flexible work scheduling. And guarantee the rights of parents and other caregivers who request a flexible schedule without adverse consequences. Now this initiative simply requires employers to consider flexibility seriously. It is not a mandate. All employers can grant such requests. The goal is to shift from a presumption of no flexibility to a presumption of some flexibility with a cooperative approach. United Seasons passed a similar law in 2003 which produced a promising result. It was done without a major imposition to business or destruction to the workplace. I believe that we could encourage people to start having these conversations in the workplace. Because I think it's important that we look for ways to be more flexible. Second I will promote model workplaces in corporate America and reward employers who help their employees balance work and family. We'll establish a public-private partnership program on model workplaces at the Department of Labor and establish awards to highlight businesses that establish such innovative workplace flexibility programs. The partnership will provide grants to businesses to expand models to serve more employees and work to spread the word. We'll also promote the most innovative workplace approaches in areas such as telecommuting. You know reduced work schedules, flexible arrival and departure time, offering on-site services such as child care, providing predictable work schedules, offering a cafeteria of many new benefits that different families can choose for themselves. I want to offer telecommuting because it will not only give more flexibility but it will also reduce rush-hour hardships, improve the environment, and lower our emissions. This has been one of the principal recommendations, to try to get cars off the road particularly at choke-point times. Third I will work to ensure better access to high quality child care and to help parents who want to stay at home with their children. I will increase funding to the child care development block grant to get back to providing funding that has been dramatically cut back during the Bush administration. We have to improve the quality of child care by helping states improve and enforce licensing and safety standards and there's a lot we can do to get more flexibility in child care. I particularly want to allow eligible stay-at-home parents to receive child care subsidies through the child care development block grant. Currently only parents who place their children in child care are eligible to receive that assistance. That makes no sense to me. Why should we pay for other people to care for your children but not give you the support to stay home and do it yourself? By including stay at home parents, we can give families more options and more time together. We'll also begin to find a way therefore to give parents the choice to stay home instead of rushing back to work. And finally, I'll work to protect workers against pregnancy discrimination. I thought we had put this to rest 30 years ago, but unfortunately we had not. No woman should be fired for being pregnant or giving birth. And no dad should be fired for taking a few days off to help his wife recover from childbirth. Or care for their newborn or adopted baby. But today women can be fired just for being pregnant if an employer has a no-leave policy. If that sounds horribly outdated, that's because it is. It's time to bring our laws against pregnancy discrimination into this century. That means banning it from out workplaces, which is exactly what I will do as president. Now I assume I will have one hundred percent support from the Republicans who care deeply about supporting pregnant women and their families and I look forward to having that [inaudible] Now will all of this be easy? Of course not. But Americans who are working hard and taking responsibility deserve the chance to do right for their children and their parents. And this is not expensive. This is totally affordable, everything I propose in this campaign I tell you how I will pay for it. Because we're going to get back to fiscal responsibility. But I think we also have to get back to family responsibility [inaudible] You know, when I was a young mother, I was so grateful for the help that I had. You know, my parents would come and stay with us for a couple of weeks at a time or Bill who was then Governor of Arkansas and needed to take a trip. And I wanted to go and they'd come and take care of our daughter. And we had this network of friends and family that was always there for us. In addition to doing what I want to do as president which includes policies that I've outlined, I really want to speak out about how we've got to support young families more in our community. We need to be there for a lot of these young moms like Marcy, who are working as hard as they can. And look for ways within our neighborhood or our communities, using institutions like the Y to really make a difference. It's not just what our government does, in fact that is probably the least of it. It's how we feel for helping those who are doing the most important job in our society, raising the next generation. So I think we'll have some ideas that people can you know look to take for themselves, such as volunteering at a childcare center, looking for more intergenerational programs. We have found great support of daycare for the elderly mixed with daycare for children. We need to look to see how we support institutions like the Y that we all of the nonprofit support that they can get to do these important work that they do every single day. So if we're concerned and I think we should be. That we are putting so much stress on young families. And I believe we're seeing some of that come out in some of the behaviors of our young children. Then we each have a stake in trying to be there be part of that village. You know when I wrote that book back in 1995 and 96, and said it takes a village to raise a child, some people said well that doesn't apply to us. That's an old African proverb. I think it applies to any society. We may be implement it differently. It may not look the same but I think there's more than enough ways we can recognize we're all in this together. I reject the Bush administration's attitude that everyone is on his or her own. I don't think that will be a strong society and I know it is not how we build strong family and support for raising up children. So I'm going to be asking all of us to think of ways we can help to make it just a little easier so that our young parents know that the most important job they have is not going to be undermined by the job they have to do to bring home the income that supports them and their family. Thank you all very much."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 24, 2007",b'Mary Louise Smith Lecture at the Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University in Ames',"b'Thank you so much, Maggie, for that wonderful introduction and for your student leadership and concern about all of these issues and I\'m delighted that your family could be here with you to see the excellent presentation you just made.And I want to thank Dr. Dianne Bystrom for her outstanding leadership as well. And to the Catt Center and Iowa State for hosting this event -- and for all their work to promote and celebrate women in politics. I also want to recognize Bonnie Campbell, Iowa\'s former Attorney General, Elaine Baxter, Iowa\'s former Secretary of State, and all of the elected officials who are here. Also, Christie Vilsack, former First Lady, and my many friends who have gathered here for this occasion- including some of my friends from Arkansas who are travelling around Iowa this week. And especially to the students and faculty of Iowa State. Its wonderful being here and having this honor to actually talk for a few minutes about women and politics and women in politics. I could say that it\'s a pleasure being up here with all of the women running for President in 2008. But I\'d like to make a prediction: that while there may be plenty of room on this stage tonight -- some day, there will be enough of us to transform this event from a lecture into a debate. [Applause] Finally, I want to thank the members of Mary Louise Smith\'s family who have joined us tonight. Talk about a trailblazing woman in public life. Mary Louise Smith started at the grassroots right here in Iowa, working her way up to become the first woman Chair of the Republican National Committee. This was not an easy feat for a woman in 1974. But with her signature poise, and her intelligence and integrity, Mary Louise Smith proved to be more than up to the challenge. In addition to being an accomplished organizer and leader, she was also a passionate advocate for women\'s rights, reproductive choice, and many other important causes. She was a role model and an inspiration for many, and I am honored by this chair that bears her name. And of course, there is this Center\'s namesake, the great Carrie Chapman Catt. I and every other woman who holds this chair does so in part because of her life\'s work. Raised right here in Iowa, a graduate of this university, she served as a teacher, a school principal, a superintendent, and a reporter before joining the women\'s suffrage movement and realizing her talents as a gifted organizer and dynamic orator. She did two stints as President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and she helped to found the International Woman Suffrage Alliance to reach out to women across the world. In the end, it was Catt who devised the ""Winning Plan"" for the suffrage movement -- a plan to campaign simultaneously for suffrage at both the state and national levels. The rest, as they say, is history. And it really is quite a history, isn\'t it? There has never been a better time to be a woman in America. It\'s almost hard to explain to young women today how much things have changed -- even just during the course of my lifetime. Growing up, there were sports we couldn\'t play, schools we couldn\'t attend, and jobs that essentially had a ""men only"" sign on them. As an eighth grader I was captivated by space-travel. I wrote to NASA asking how to apply to be an astronaut -- they wrote back explaining that these positions weren\'t open to women. Well today, Iowa\'s own Peggy Whitson has been appointed the first female Commander of the International Space Station. [Applause] Years later, when I was deciding where I wanted to attend law school, I was coolly informed by a Harvard Law professor, and I quote, ""We don\'t need any more women at Harvard."" So I went to Yale. [laughter] And my entering class at Yale Law School -- where I decided to go instead -- had 235 students, of whom just 27 were women. Today, women are the majority of students in law schools. As a young lawyer, when I told a colleague that I might want to practice courtroom law, he replied that, that was impossible, because I didn\'t have a wife. He asked me, ""When you\'re in trial, and you\'re busy, who will make sure you have clean socks for court?"" [laughter] Well, I had honestly had never thought about that. I had always washed my own socks. [laughter] Today, women are serving across America as judges, partners, as law professors -- and yes, even successful courtroom lawyers with clean socks. The norms are changing on Capitol Hill. Back in the mid-1980s, women were not allowed to wear pantsuits on the Senate floor. Clearly, I would not have survived. [laughter] And today, we\'ve sworn in the first Madame Speaker of the House of Representatives. [Applause] We\'ve even seen, much I\'m sure to that old Harvard law professor\'s chagrin, the first woman President of Harvard University. Women are now a majority of students in colleges -- and the majority of those who voted in 2004. It is nothing short of breathtaking when you stop to think about it. But all of this progress is not a quirk of fate. It didn\'t happen by accident. It is the result of the contributions of women and men from every background, serving at every level, using their diverse array of skills and talents to move our nation forward. Contributions from national leaders like Carrie Chapman Catt and her colleagues in the suffrage movement. Trailblazers right here in Iowa like Arabella Mansfield who, in 1869, became the first woman in America formally admitted to the Bar. Women like Sojourner Truth who campaigned both against slavery and for women\'s suffrage. Or Harriet Tubman who risked her life time and again so others could taste the fruits of freedom. Courageous women around the world like Aung San Suu Kyi who has been a virtual prisoner for decades in the cause of freedom for the Burmese people. Women who run for office in their own countries against some tough odds like Angela Merkel in Germany and Michelle Bachelet in Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in Liberia. But it is not just the women leaders in the history books who\'ve made history. It is also those unsung heroes who transform lives and communities every single day. The teachers who tell our daughters, ""You are just as smart and capable as the boys, don\'t you fail to live up to your potential."" I think about my 6th grade teacher Mrs. King quoting from the Bible said not to hide your light under the bushel basket. The women on the PTA who wonder why aren\'t more girls in those honors math and science classes. I remember when my daughter was in first grade joining up with a couple of other mothers to do extra science programs for our first graders. And all those mothers who work all day -- sleep a few hours -- do the night shift, because they want something better for their children. Some women have fought lonely battles, forging ahead on their own when no one else would stand by their side. I think of Edna Griffin, called the ""Rosa Parks of Iowa."" On July 7, 1948, she was refused service at a Des Moines lunch counter. But Edna Griffin responded by organizing pickets in front of the store -- and when no one else joined her, she would picket alone. She took her case all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court -- and she won. Other women have had the benefit of networks of women drawn together by shared experiences and aspirations. I\'ve had the privilege of traveling to more than 80 countries. And everywhere I\'ve been as First Lady and now as Senator, I have tried to find time to meet with women in the countries where I find myself- to ask them what their lives are like, what kind of opportunities and challenges they face. I remember a woman in Northern Ireland by the name of Joyce McCartan. Joyce, a Catholic, had lost more than a dozen family members during the so called ""troubles"" -- including her own seventeen-year old son who was shot dead by Protestant gunmen. But instead of retreating into anger and grief and wanting revenge, she brought together a group of both Protestant and Catholic women to set up a safe house for women of both traditions to talk about their needs and their fears over cups of tea. I sat down with those women one day and I listened as they talked about how they had discovered that they all worried when their husbands and sons left their homes, and they were all relieved when they returned safely. And despite their differences, they wanted a better future for their country and their children. It was these women -- and others like them -- sitting around at kitchen tables, sharing pots of tea, who helped chart the path to peace. Here at home, during my time in the Senate, I have cherished the opportunity to work with my women colleagues in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle. Now we may not see eye to eye on everything, but we get together and we trade those very important bits of advice like what kind of shoes to wear on marble floors when you\'re on your feet all day. And when it comes to the issues that we can agree on -- whether it\'s afterschool funding or healthcare and education for women here in America or for women in Afghanistan-- we are a force to be reckoned with. I\'ve been honored to work throughout my career on issues like foster care and adoption, family leave, equal pay and preschool for our children. And I have always been struck when people label these as women\'s issues. I disagree with that characterization. While these so-called ""kitchen table"" issues are certainly women\'s issues -- they\'re also men\'s issues and children\'s issues. They\'re issues that we all have a stake in. Today, too many men have to choose between health insurance for themselves or for their children, because they can\'t afford both. When women make just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns -- it\'s not just women who are affected, but families with less income to pay the bills. We\'re all worried about whether the next generation of children will have the tools they need to compete in the global economy. Today, many fathers are struggling to spend more time with their families just like mothers always have. In fact, the issue of family leave provides a particularly good example. I\'ll never forget a newspaper advice column that I read in the early 1980s. I was working at a law firm at the time and my daughter was about three years old. Someone had written into this column asking: ""I\'m about to get a big promotion and I\'m going to have my own office for the first time. What kind of decorations are appropriate for my office?"" Well, the advice columnist responded that he needed to know if the writer was a man or a woman because it would affect the answer. If you\'re a man, he said, and you have a family, put up lots of pictures of your family because people will think when they come into your office ""this is a stable person with a good set of family values."" But if you\'re a woman, don\'t put any pictures of your family in your office because people will think you can\'t keep your mind on your job. So, of course, I immediately filled my office with pictures of my family. Well, a lot has changed since then. But unfortunately this attitude is still around. It kind of sums up too many people\'s feelings towards women and parents in the workplace: Keep your family life to yourself, struggle on your own to meet the demands of work and family and don\'t let it affect your work. But think about this for a minute. A lot of working fathers wish they had more time with their children. All employers want employees to be focused and productive -- which is hard to achieve when work and family are out of balance. And every American has a stake in how the next generation is raised -- after all, we\'re raising our future innovators, our college professors, our nurses, our business leaders, our farmers, teachers and so much more. So when we fight to strengthen family leave -- that helps not just women, but all Americans who want to spend more time with the people they love and care for. That\'s why I\'m fighting for paid family leave -- because no one should have to worry if they need a couple of hours to take their child to the doctor. And no one should be denied the chance to bond with their newborn or adopted baby or to care for an aging parent. I think we should encourage the development of families working to take care of one another. There\'s so much care giving that goes on in our country, we sometimes overlook it. But if all the caregivers, people who devote most or all of their time caring for a child, caring for a parent, caring for a loved one with a disability, if all of those Americans were to decide tomorrow to stop giving that out of love, to replace that care would cost 300 billion dollars a year. People give it because they love, they have a sense of family obligation, they want to do the right thing and we make it very, very hard for families to care for one another. Instead of focusing on what is really going on in people\'s lives, too often our politics is about distractions. Who\'s up, who\'s down. What people are wearing more than what they are saying. Well, there will always be that kind of analysis. But in the end, none of that really matters very much. What matters are the lives of people I meet every day who feel like they\'re invisible. Like no one\'s paying attention to them and their struggles. Like the woman I met from LeClair who had to sell half her family farm to pay for her family\'s medical bills. She sure feels invisible. Or the woman I met at the Maid-Rite in Toledo who was working two jobs and still struggling to get by and she wonders whether anybody really sees how hard she\'s been working. The woman in Greenville whose daughter got sick, but didn\'t have health insurance. She died a year later. She was just eighteen years old. Her death certificate listed the cause of death as unknown, because she was never able to afford to get a proper diagnosis. Well, I don\'t think that any of these people should be invisible in our country. They\'re certainly not invisible to me. I see them, I hear them, and I carry their stories with me where ever I go. And they shouldn\'t be invisible in our political process. One of the aspects of politics that has changed dramatically with the entry of some many women is that a lot of these stories are now just out there, people are talking about them, trying to determine what to do to give someone who is struggling a better chance. When I think about the struggle that women had to even get the vote I don\'t get discouraged, I get inspired. The first women\'s convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848. It was a hot July and a group of women decided that they wanted to meet together at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls to see if they could draft a statement claiming their rights as women. At that time of course our laws didn\'t really give women rights in any aspect of life, not just at the voting booth but in inheritance and marriage and child custody and so much else. So these women and a few brave men joined together on that hot July day to begin a process that led to the Declaration of Sentiments. It was the first document that we know of anywhere in the world where a group of people had come and said women deserve their rights. Only one woman who was there are that convention lived long enough to see women get the vote in America. It took more than 70 years from the start of the movement until nineteenth amendment was passed. More than 70 years of faith and devotion, protesting and lobbying. And when I think about the challenges we face today in politics, I always am in awe of how hard these other women had to struggle to get what we take for granted. Ultimately, they did succeed, because even in the face of the most heartbreaking set-backs, they never lost sight of what mattered and they refused to give up. I\'ve always loved the story of how, back in 1915, Catt and her colleagues believed that winning in New York was critical to winning at the federal level, so they fought their hearts out. They held 10,300 meetings. They handed out seven and a half million leaflets. And they raised nearly $100,000 -- a staggering sum in those days. But in the end, they lost by nearly 200,000 votes. That night, Catt was asked how long this defeat would delay their fight nationally. She replied, ""Only until we can get a little sleep."" And two days after that loss, they started a new campaign with a new slogan: ""Victory in 1917."" I\'m grateful to her and countless others because I know that every day I walk in the paths they cleared and benefit from the victories they won. Now, some might say that their work is finished in America since women no longer face legal obstacles to education or employment or the right to vote. But we know that even though legal barriers have fallen away -- economic and attitudinal ones still remain. And that so long as there are gaps between our aspirations and our reality, their work and ours is not finished. That more perfect union still awaits. If we truly want to finish what Catt and her colleagues had started, then it is time we stopped paying women 77 cents on the dollar when they work 60 minutes of the hour, just like men. [Applause] We can see that we are still not where we need to be because just this year the United States Supreme Court heard a case of a woman named Lilly Ledbetter. Lilly Ledbetter worked in a factory in Alabama. She worked there for over 20 years. She was a good worker. She became a supervisor- the only woman to become a supervisor and year after year she did the same work that all of the male supervisors did. And about 20 years into her work she learned she had never been paid the same as all of the men. Men with lesser seniority, younger men, and she wondered why. And she tried to find out and basically her employer wouldn\'t answer her questions. And Lilly Ledbetter didn\'t want to take that for an answer. So she started talking to people in town and somebody sent her to a lawyer and the lawyer said that\'s against the Equal Pay Act, we\'ve had an Equal Pay Act on the books since 1963- they can\'t do that. The lawyer called the factory and the factory wouldn\'t talk to the lawyer so the lawyer brought a law suit. And Lilly Ledbetter won in court and the factory appealed it. And she won in the appellate court and the factory appealed it to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has changed in composition as you know and all of a sudden after everyone thought that the cases had been settled, that if you were discriminated for doing the same job as a woman that a man is doing you are entitled to back pay for as long as you have been doing that job as a way to deter other employers from practicing discrimination and to make good on the many hours of work that were not fairly compensated. Well, the new Supreme Court found a reason to deny Lilly Ledbetter back pay for all of those years. They came up with a theory that nobody had ever heard of before. So don\'t believe that the hard work is over- we still have a long way to go. If we truly want to finish what Catt and her colleagues started, then it\'s time we did more than just talking about family values -- we need to adopt policies that truly value families. [Applause] We stand for universal pre-kindergarten all the way through to affordable college. [Applause] From quality, affordable healthcare for every American to retirement security for every American. Paid leave. Flexible workplaces. We need to recognize the challenges that so many people face today. You know, the economy is much more difficult. The average American family has lost a thousand dollars in income in the last six years but the costs of everything else have gone up- health care, education, energy and gas. It\'s much tougher for young families to really pull together the time they need for each other. The biggest concern that a lot of young families tell me is that they don\'t have enough time. They\'re working as hard as they can, they\'re worried about their future, they\'re anxious about everything from whether they have enough to put away to tide them over on a rainy day to what happens in the mortgage market and what\'s going on if somebody in their family gets sick. If we truly want to finish what Catt and her colleagues started, then we need to do something about our national debt -- $9 trillion and counting. [Applause] Every baby born today starts life with $30,000 of debt on his or her tiny shoulders, the largest birth tax in history. And if we truly want to finish the work that Carrie Chapman Catt and her colleagues started, then we must truly use the power of the vote to make our voices heard. To take our leaders to task. To build the kind of future we want for our children and grandchildren. In 2004, more than 35 million women did not vote. You know, for so long, Carrie Chapman Catt and all the women who worked with her were silenced by others. Today, too many women silence themselves. As Catt once said, ""The vote is a power, a weapon of offense and defense, a prayer. Understand what it means and what it can do for your country."" Today, more than ever, we know what the vote can do for our country. I meet people who are ready to use it who have never used it before. I\'m always struck when someone tells me they\'re voting for the first time. Often it\'s a young person turning 18. Sometimes it\'s a much older person who has just never registered and never voted. And then I meet people who never miss an election. They believe it\'s their duty and responsibility to show up whenever the polls are open. I\'ve meet a lot of women in their nineties who\'ve told me they were born before women could vote, and they want to live long enough to see a woman in the White House. [Applause] And I love it when I hear mothers and fathers whispering to their little girls, ""See honey, in this country you can be anything you want to be."" Well, that\'s what I believe about our sons and our daughters. There should be no limits on any of our children in America. But we have to do the hard work to make sure that is true. And all too often, people give up their beliefs and convictions because they don\'t vote leaving the field free to those who may not share their views, don\'t care about the same issues that they care about, but are willing to be there when it counts. We need to do everything we can to heed Carrie Chapman Catt\'s admonition to ""Roll up your sleeves and set your mind to making history"" That\'s what Americans have been doing for over 200 years. It wasn\'t by accident that the first meeting ever held in the world to talk about and write down what rights women were entitled to happened in America. We have to keep faith with the work, the struggle and the sacrifice of those who have come before. We have to be reminded from time to time that freedom isn\'t free and equality cannot be taken for granted. Every generation faces new challenges and every generation has to step up and be heard and exercise their constitutional rights to make a difference. That\'s what we do when we\'re at our best in America. I want Americans to start acting like Americans again. We face a lot of challenges here at home and around the world. We need to set big goals, goals that will bring out the best in our country, goals that will unite us, goals that will respect each and every one of us and cherish the contribution that we can make to this great nation. I know that there\'s a lot of work to be done but I relish the opportunity to be part of making history with all of you because this country deserves the very best that each and every one of us can offer. Thank you all very, very much. [Applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 1, 2007",b'Remarks on Student Activism at Wellesley College',"b'Well, I\'ll tell you, I know how we\'re going to solve the energy crisis.(LAUGHTER) We\'re all going to do it together. This wonderful hall that has meant so much to me over so many years, the site of a lot of great memories for me is a place that I return to with so much love and affection. And standing up here with my -- looking out at all of you is just an overwhelming experience. I am so grateful to be here. And I thank Maya (ph) and everyone who is working with her here at Wellesley, the entire Wellesley College students who are putting this team together to support my candidacy and who put this event together today. I also want to thank the students from all of the colleges and universities. I know we have students from B.U. and Harvard and Yale and Brown and others... (APPLAUSE) ... who have traveled to be here. And welcome to Wellesley and welcome to this event. It\'s not exactly a mixer, but I hope you get to meet each other. (APPLAUSE) There are a lot of friends in this audience, people whom I have known for a long time, but there are two that I want to recognize, because they\'ve meant so much (inaudible). That meant two out of four feet had to be on the floor at all times. Try it sometime. (APPLAUSE) Now, that is a rule that I and many of my classmates became actually nostalgic for when we had college aged children of our own. But while times have clearly changed, what makes this college special has endured. The world class faculty and staff who push you and challenge you, those late nights and long lunches where you challenge each other and learn from each other, the camaraderie that develops when smart, ambitious young women come together in a community of learning. In so many ways, this all women\'s college prepared me to compete on the all boys\' club of presidential politics. (APPLAUSE) This was a place where you could try out all different kinds of leadership styles, where you could ask for critique and support from your friends and the faculty with whom you had an ongoing relationship. It was a place that truly did prepare women to make the best choices that we thought were right for our own lives. I have to tell you, though, when I came to Wellesley, I never in a million years could have imagined I would one day return as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. Back then, I didn\'t even know for sure I would return for my sophomore year. (LAUGHTER) I had grown up in the Midwest, outside of Chicago. (APPLAUSE) I had serious doubts about this whole going east for college idea and just one month after I moved into my room in Stone Davis, I felt... (APPLAUSE) ... I felt like all my worst fears had been confirmed. So many of my classmates had traveled the world. They learned and spoke multiple languages. I was struggling in my classes, in fact, to the point where my French professor said to me, ""Mademoiselle, your talents lie elsewhere."" (LAUGHTER) And I called home. In those days, you called collect. And my parents took the call, which was a good thing, and I said I just didn\'t think that I could do this. It wasn\'t for me. Now, my father said that was just fine. I think he missed me. But my mother, who never got to go to college, would not hear a word of it. She said, ""Hillary, I don\'t want you to be a quitter,"" to which I\'m embarrassed to admit I responded, ""All right. But if I don\'t like it at the end of the year, can I quit then?"" (LAUGHTER) Well, I stuck it out and I am so glad I did, because my four years here were among the most exhilarating and informative of my life. And the friends that I made here have been the friends of a lifetime. They have sustained and supported me every step of the way on my journey, as I have tried to do for them. And we started that journey at a tumultuous time in our nation\'s history. We were embroiled in a war that many of us opposed. Here at home, so many of our fellow citizens were marginalized and denied their most basic rights. We were uneasy about our future, uncertain about America\'s role in the world, and unwilling to trust a government that didn\'t share our values. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn\'t it? (APPLAUSE) But we were inspired by our Wellesley motto not to be ministered onto, but to minister, and we took it to heart, probably more than some of our professors and administrators at the time would have liked. We protested the Vietnam War. We marched for civil rights. We fought to bring more minority students and faculty to Wellesley. And at the end of our four years, my classmates convinced our skeptical college president, Ruth Adams, to have the first ever student speaker at graduation and then they convinced me to do the honors. (APPLAUSE) Well, when the time came, President Adams introduced me as, and I quote, ""cheerful, good humored, good company, and a good friend to all of us."" I\'m afraid she probably wanted to take it all back once I opened my mouth. (LAUGHTER) My thoughts on the indispensable task for criticizing and constructive protest wasn\'t exactly her idea of a commencement speech. Now, when I go back and read it today, I have to admit, it wasn\'t the world\'s most coherent address and I sort of cringe when I read that I actually said things like ""coming to terms with our humanness and authentic reality and inauthentic reality."" (LAUGHTER) I tell you, Wellesley gets into you and... (APPLAUSE) But I still believe as strongly today as I did then in my statement that politics is the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. That is what I have believed ever since I was a student here. That\'s what I have tried to do throughout my life, starting after law school, as when Maya said, I didn\'t want to go to work for a law firm, I didn\'t want to clerk for a judge. I went to work instead for the Children\'s Defense Fund and my first assignment there was trying to figure out what we could do to get more kids into school. I went to New Bedford, Massachusetts to try to figure out why there were so many children in the census who didn\'t appear on any school enrollment forms. And I went door to door and in home after home, I found children who were blind or deaf or in wheelchairs. They were kept home because the schools wouldn\'t or couldn\'t accommodate them. They wanted to learn. They wanted to succeed. But they never had the chance. I knew then that I wanted to spend my career being a voice for children, children particularly who had been left behind, children who drew the short straw in life. I wanted to fight to give them the same opportunities that I had growing up. And like many of my classmates and many of you, I did want to make a difference. Now, that wasn\'t always easy. Back then, women weren\'t always taken seriously back then. When I was first deciding where to attend law school, I was invited to go, after I had been admitted to Harvard and Yale, to a cocktail reception for prospective students at the Harvard Law School and I knew a couple of the male students who were there and they were showing me around. And we ran right into Professor Paper Chase, large, imposing, three-piece suit, watch chain, looking down at everyone, and one of my friends said, ""Professor so-and-so, this is Hillary Rodham. She\'s trying to decide between us and our nearest competitor."" And he looked down at me and he said, ""Well, first of all, we don\'t have a nearest competitor."" (LAUGHTER) ""And, secondly, we don\'t need any more women."" So I decided to go to Yale. (APPLAUSE) There were 235 students, of whom just 27 were women, and today women are the majority of students in law schools. (APPLAUSE) As a young lawyer, when I once told a colleague that I wanted to practice litigation courtroom law, he replied that this was clearly impossible, because I didn\'t have a wife. He asked me... (LAUGHTER) He asked me, totally seriously, ""When you\'re in a long trial and you\'re so busy, who will make sure you have clean socks for court?"" I had honestly never thought about that. (LAUGHTER) I had always washed my own socks. And I have been thrilled to see women serving across America not only in the legal profession, but the medical profession, in academia and so much else. But back then, the idea of a woman running for president would have been greeted with derisive laughter. Well, times have changed. Despite the challenges we faced, we have found ways to serve our country in every way imaginable, in our professions, our communities and our families. And looking at your generation, I see that same desire to give back. We saw it especially after September 11. While the president didn\'t ask us to do anything, except go shopping, which hardly ranks up there as a call to action and sacrifice from an American president, the young people of our country had other ideas. Between 2000 and 2006, applications to teach for America nearly tripled. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, applications to the Americorps Vista program jumped 50 percent. And in recent years, the Peace Corps has seen the highest number of volunteers in three decades. We\'ve seen a resurgence of activism on college campuses. Students are Brown have created a sustainable foods initiative, organizing farmers\' markets and convincing dining halls to switch to local foods. Students at Keane State College in New Hampshire hosted a concert to raise money for victims of the genocide in Darfur. Students at the University of New Hampshire are working to protect our environment by reducing energy and water use on campus. And here at Wellesley, just recently, students organized a day of awareness and a rally to protest the unfair treatment of the Jena 6. They\'ve also traveled to New Orleans to help rebuild after Hurricane Katrina and... (APPLAUSE) ... I especially want to thank you for working together through a group called Sisters Keepers to help student mothers finish their education. (APPLAUSE) And to those who might sometimes here on television say that your generation is disengaged, that you\'re not as passionate and committed as we were, I say come to Providence, come to Keane, come to Durham, come to Wellesley, travel across our country, take the same opportunity that I\'ve had to actually meet and talk with the young people of America, see how every day you\'re standing up, taking charge and making the impossible possible. Unfortunately, for nearly seven years, we\'ve had a president who hasn\'t been much of a partner in your work. If anything, he\'s actually created more work. He\'s undermined women\'s right and gay rights and appointed Supreme Court justices who chipped away at reproductive rights, undermined equal pay, and turned back the clock on school integration, decisions that will affect you and your children for decades to come. He\'s continued to wage a war in Iraq that has taken more than 3,800 of our best and most dedicated young men and women and costs us more than $300 million a day, a bill that, again, you and your children will be paying, unless we reverse course. He\'s run up our national debt to $9 trillion. So every baby born today starts life with $30,000 of debt on his or her tiny shoulders, a birth tax that will only increase for your children and grandchildren if we don\'t end this reckless spending. He\'s waged a war on science, cutting off promising stem cell research, banning his own surgeon general from talking about contraception, failing to address the threat of global warming, that we know not only could, but is leading to increased storms and floods and heat waves and droughts, affecting millions of people across America and the world. To paraphrase one of my most recent opponents, the philosopher, Stephen Colbert... (APPLAUSE) ... this administration doesn\'t make decisions based on facts, it makes facts based on decisions. (LAUGHTER) As a result, my generation is in danger of being the first ever to leave America worse off than when we found it. And whether you\'re a Democrat or Republican, Independent, or you don\'t even care about politics, I think we can all agree that your generation, my daughter\'s generation deserves better than that. The challenges you face today are no less profound than ones faced by previous generations of Americans and you deserve a president who will meet those challenges head on, a president who is committed to your future, a president who will never again play politics with women\'s health and women\'s rights, who will never again... (APPLAUSE) ... who will never again put ideology over science and the cures and breakthroughs of the future, who will never again engage in reckless spending and stick you with the bill, who will confront the challenges that we face without fear or fear-mongering and leave America better off. If you give me the chance and the honor, I will be that president for you. (APPLAUSE) I will start by making college affordable again so that middle class and hardworking families can go. (APPLAUSE) Back when I went to college, my father told me, ""Here\'s the deal. Got enough money for your tuition and board, but anything beyond that, like buying books, you pay for yourself."" And I had worked summers and holidays since I was 13, so I was fine with that. But when I decided to go to law school and I told my father, he said, ""Well, you\'re on your own for that one. That wasn\'t part of the deal."" So I kept working and I got a scholarship from Wellesley, the Vida Dutton Scudder scholarship, and I borrowed money from the federal government at a low interest rate. I didn\'t have to worry about some for-profit student loan company ripping me and my family off, raising the interest rates or changing the terms of the loan. I didn\'t get stuck with a massive debt that would have derailed my dreams of a career in public service. When I\'m president, I will restore that basic bargain. I proposed a new college tax credit that will cover more than 50 percent of the typical cost of public colleges and universities or the full cost of tuition for community colleges. And for those who don\'t go to college, I think we should invest more in apprenticeships and job training and lifelong learning opportunities. There are so many... (APPLAUSE) There\'s so many hardworking young Americans, I think you probably know as many as I do, who don\'t go to college, but who deserve to have a shot at a high wage, high skill job, and we\'re going to have a lot of shortages in high skill jobs. So we need to start doing more for them, as well. Let\'s start creating those jobs by investing in a new, clean energy industry and addressing the threat of global warming right now. (APPLAUSE) We all know the science. There\'s no longer a debate. Global warming is real. It\'s one of the greatest environmental, economic and international security threats we face, and I was, as I\'m sure all of you were, so proud of Vice President Gore when he got the Nobel Prize for raising the alarm about global warming. (APPLAUSE) But we need a policy and that is what I will do as president. I\'ll create a $1 billion green building fund to build and renovate public buildings. We\'ll make buildings green and energy efficient. I want to establish a strategic energy fund paid for by a $50 billion investment in clean, renewable technologies by taking away the tax subsidies from the oil companies. They don\'t need them to make a profit. (APPLAUSE) Next week I\'ll be unveiling a broad agenda to address our energy and global warming challenges and I\'ll be talking a lot more about those issues all next week. But today\'s challenges aren\'t just at home. We have to face those in order to make sure we have a strong and prosperous middle class. That has been the engine of economic growth in our country. That\'s why we have to tackle energy. That\'s why we have to make college affordable. That\'s why we have to have an education system that starts with universal pre-kindergarten, that fixes the unfunded mandate of No Child Left Behind. (APPLAUSE) And that\'s why, finally, we need a health care system that provides quality, affordable health care for every single American. (APPLAUSE) But we know that our challenges are not just here at home. After nearly seven years of a stubborn, preemptive, go-it-alone foreign policy, we have our work cut out for us to restore our leadership around the world. That starts with bringing our troops home from Iraq as responsibly and quickly as we can. (APPLAUSE) There is no military solution and we should not be asking our brave young men and women to serve as referees in their sectarian conflicts. It has to be done as carefully as possible, because it is dangerous withdrawing troops. I\'ve laid out may plans to bring our troops home from Iraq and demand that the Iraqis take responsibility for their own country, replace our military involvement with an intensive diplomatic initiative in the area. And let me be clear, if George Bush doesn\'t end this war while he is president, when I am president, I will as quickly as I can. (APPLAUSE) But, unfortunately, our problems go far beyond Iraq. Take out the globe and look at it. We have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies across the world. I have said I won\'t even wait until I\'m inaugurated. The day after I\'m elected, I will ask distinguished Americans of both parties to travel around the world with a new message, the era of cowboy diplomacy is over. We\'re going to start working with people again. (APPLAUSE) And, you know, I have come to a rather obvious conclusion based on my Wellesley education. You can\'t be a leader in the world if no one is following. And we have got to get back to leading, leading with our values, leading with moral authority, leading on behalf of bringing the world together, because when it comes to the challenges we face from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics and global competition, we cannot do this all on our own. And I want to lead the world to end the genocide in Darfur and we need to act immediately. Every day we fail to act is a betrayal of our common values. As president, I will speed the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force. I will provide them with more support to do the job we\'re asking them to do and create real consequences for anyone who continues the bloodshed or obstructs the peace process. We need to lead the world... (APPLAUSE) ... to stop the brutal violence in Burma and insist that the regime release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. (APPLAUSE) We need to lead the world in fighting the AIDS epidemic that is creating a global generation of orphans and destabilizing countries. That\'s why I was proud to sign the pledge to invest $50 billion by 2013 to combat AIDS across the world. We need to lead the world... (APPLAUSE) We need to lead the world in standing up for women\'s rights. Twelve years ago, when the U.N. convened a historic conference on women in Beijing, I was proud to represent our country and proclaim to the world that women\'s rights are human rights, because when women... (APPLAUSE) ... when women continue to be raped as a casualty of conflict, trafficked for commercial advantage, denied education and health care and family planning, not given access to credit, denied their rights as citizens, that not only affects them and their countries, that compromises the dignity and the human rights of the entire human family. If we don\'t stand for women\'s rights, we will never stand for our best values. That has to be a part of American foreign policy. (APPLAUSE) We need to lead the world in providing opportunity to the world\'s children, because when 100 million children in the developing world don\'t attend school and 150 million more drop out before finishing first grade, that is a recipe for poverty, extremism and instability. That\'s why I\'ve introduced the bipartisan Education for All Act, $10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world. And, finally, we need to lead the world by living up to our values here at home. As we seek to promote the rule of law in other nations, we must accept it for ourselves. As we counsel liberty and justice for all, we cannot support torture and the indefinite detention of people we declare to be beyond the law. (APPLAUSE) I realize this is an ambitious agenda. Would you expect anything less from a Wellesley woman? (APPLAUSE) And I know I can\'t do it alone. I need your help. I am thrilled that we are launching 120 student chapters on college campuses across America today. We have a new Web site called Hillblazers at Www.Hillblazers.Com to help young people get organized. And in the coming weeks, I need your help to make the calls, to knock on the doors and organize the events and talk to your friends and family. That\'s what I did back in 1968, when a group of my dear friends and I jumped in a car that one of us finagled to have on campus, and we would drive from Wellesley to Manchester, New Hampshire, stuffing envelopes and walking the precincts for Eugene McCarthy. He was running for president on a platform of ending the Vietnam War. I am running for president, in part, on a platform to end the war in Iraq and most important of all, I need your help on election day. I need you to get the vote out and get your friends registered so they can vote. In 2004, while the voter turnout rate for 18- to 34-year-olds was higher than in 2000, more than 25 million still never cast their votes, enough to possibly change the course of history. For so long, young people have been ignored and silenced by others. Today, too many young people silence themselves. It\'s up to all of you to change that. I know that politics can be frustrating, but it seems like we get bogged down in distractions and trivialization, who\'s up and who\'s down, people\'s hairstyle or their laugh or what they\'re wearing rather than what they\'re saying. But in those moments when you think you\'re never going to break through the noise and you just want to give up, I urge you to think about all of the people who came before you. Many of them, we\'ll never know their names. They\'re lost to history. But so many others, we can read their stories, be amazed at their strength and their courage. Think about those audacious women and a few brave men who gathered in Seneca Falls, New York for the declaration to issue the very first statement ever in the history of the world calling for women\'s full equality. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the key organizers, was just 32 years old. One attendee was just 15. It took more than 70 years for them to win the vote, more than 70 years of protesting, organizing, lobbying, going to jail, doing hunger strikes, chaining themselves to the gate in front of the White House, but they never gave up. And just one woman from the Seneca Falls Convention lived long enough to actually cast a ballot. Think about the civil rights movement. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was just 26 years old when he led the Montgomery bus boycott. My dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, was just 25 when he led that historic march across the bridge in Selma, a march that ended with teargas, hoses and the crack of night sticks against and his and others\' skulls, as the marchers knelt down to pray. Think about that. They were attacked as they knelt down to pray. They were, as Congressman Lewis put it later, using our bodies as a witness to the truth and they forced America to bear witness, as well. They were willing to put their lives on the line and together they made the impossible possible. I stand here today because of those brave men and women and I am inspired every day by the people I meet on the campaign trial. You know, the mothers and fathers who lift their little girls on their shoulders or lean over and whisper in their ears, ""See, honey, in America, you can be anything you want to be."" The women in their 90s who come to my events, they stand there, they hold themselves up in a walker, they may be in a wheelchair, and as I meet them, they tell me, ""I was born before women could vote and I want to live long enough to see a woman in the White House."" I know the challenges... (APPLAUSE) I know the challenges we face are daunting, but I still believe what I said in my commencement speech nearly 40 years ago. Fear is always with us, but we just don\'t have time for it, not now. So let\'s roll up our sleeves and get to work together. We\'re ready to shatter that highest glass ceiling. It\'s what Americans have been doing for more than 200 years. It\'s what I believe has created the space for the transformative changes that we have been the beneficiaries of. I think we\'re ready for that kind of change again. Change is just a word if you don\'t have the strength and experience to make it happen. I believe I do and I believe together we can make it. We can make history. I like to think that it will be young people driven by Dr. King\'s fierce urgency of now who will make the difference in this election, because when I am president, my presidency is about your future. It is about what you will have to make your lives, to make your choices however you choose, to be responsible for yourselves, those whom you love, your communities, our country and the world. There\'s a lot of work to do and I hope you will join me in doing that work. Thank you all very, very much. (APPLAUSE)'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 2, 2007","b'Remarks at the Granite State Independent Living Forum in Manchester, New Hampshire'","b""I am thrilled to be here and I have to say having the endorsement of this extraordinary senator, leader, champion  means the world to me. Lou, I am thrilled to have you on this team. It's a winning team and we're going to go together to the White House and get the changes that America needs. I am very happy to be here. I want to thank Clyde Terry, the executive director, who in his remarks pointed out something that all of you know so well, that he was one of the driving forces to help form the Granite State Independent Living organization. And I salute him for that. And you've been blessed with good leadership to keep it going and keep it growing. Clyde thank you, thank you for your efforts. It's also wonderful to be here with Ted Kennedy, Jr. He is a great leader in the tradition that we would expect. And I'm going to proudly tell his father, when I see Senator Kennedy, that I was with his son and his son is much better looking. It is great to being here with all of you. I want to make a few remarks and then I know you've got some questions. It is really important that you're holding this forum. The Manchester Community Television is covering it and you've got more than 20 national disability rights organizations that have come together to host this. I've already seen friends from New York and Washington, DC who are here today. Well you are doing are doing what has to be done. And that is standing up and fighting for the rights of people with disabilities. My friend and supporter, Senator Maggie Hassan, was just telling me  she said you know, it's a lot easier to be kind than to be just. And we want both. We want both kindness and justice for people with disabilities. Disability rights are civil rights  the right to be treated equally. They are human rights  the right of all people to fulfill their God-given potentials. And they are an urgent issue for America  because America will never achieve our potential until all Americans can achieve theirs. Now obviously we have come a long way in this country. But, we have our work cut out for us if we're going to keep the promise that we should  that we will continue to work for a more perfect union that includes Americas. For the past seven years, it's as though people with disabilities have been invisible to this President and his administration. If you're a child who can't get the special education classes you need  you're invisible. If you're a citizen who wants to vote, but the polling place doesn't have the right equipment or the right help  you're invisible. If you're a worker wants a job, but can't find one that accommodates your disability  you're invisible too. Well, people with disabilities may be invisible to George Bush, but they are not invisible to you, and they will never be invisible to me. This is a cause I've been involved with for throughout my 35 years. My first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund. I did not want to go to work for big law firm. I didn't want to work for federal judge. I wanted to work on behalf of children. I was assigned to go to New Bedford, Massachusetts as part of a nationwide effort to understand why so many children were not enrolling in school. And how did we know that? Because we had census figures of how many children there were in a community between the ages of five and 18. And we had school enrollment figures. And they didn't match. Where were those children? Knocking on those doors was eye-opening and heart-breaking experience. I found children who weren't in school because of physical disabilities like blindness and deafness. On the small back porch off her family's home, I met a girl in a wheelchair who told me how much she wanted to go to school. But she knew she couldn't go, simply because she couldn't walk. These children were kept home because the schools couldn't, and wouldn't, accommodate them. They wanted to learn. They wanted to succeed. But they never had the chance. I knew then that I wanted to spend my life fighting to be a voice for children who had been left out and left behind. I wanted to give them the same opportunities I had growing up. The Children's Defense Fund submitted our results to the Congress. And, with the help of strong leaders like Senator Kennedy, and all of you who are advocates, it led to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  mandating that children with physical, emotional and learning disabilities be educated in the public school system. My work on this issue came full circle, when as a Senator, when I helped write the IDEA Reauthorization Act in 2004, to ensure we have targeted resources dedicated to teacher training. In the Senate, I have also worked to pass the Community Choice Act, which will finally, we hope, eliminate the institutional bias in our Medicare and Medicaid systems. I have aggressively fought to investigate the linkages between environmental toxins and disabilities. And I have strongly supported the ADA Restoration Act, and look forward to signing it into law as President  and you're all invited to the signing ceremony When I am President, my White House will welcome you. Our government will be a partner with you. And new opportunities will be open to you. I have laid out an agenda to increase employment among people with disabilities. These reforms are long overdue. Americans with disabilities have half the employment rate and double the poverty rate of those without disabilities. Even those who have graduated from college work at only two-thirds the rate of others. We need to provide more opportunities for people with disabilities to break into the middle class  not just to survive, but to thrive. One of my first acts will be to reinstate my husband's executive order that committed the federal government to hiring 100,000 people with disabilities. President Bush was wrong to abandon that commitment, and I'm going to get us back on track. I'll also double our investment in work-enabling technologies, by providing more low interest loans for purchasing them. I'll provide real-time support for employers so they can make the accommodations necessary for their employees to do their jobs. I want to also propose, and work to pass, a $1,000 per worker tax credit to offset the expenses of work and transportation for workers with disabilities. In addition to the positive agenda that I will pursue, I want to get rid of the disincentives for work in so many federal programs. Right now, people with disabilities can lose their Social Security Disability Insurance, their Supplemental Security Income, their Medicare, and Medicaid benefits when they earn even a tiny salary. That is absolutely upside-down. So just think about it. It makes no sense. Even if you can work and want to work, there's a penalty if you try to work. We are a nation that believes in work and we want people to make a contribution. We believe it's in the individual's interest, as well as the country's. That's bad for taxpayers, it's unfair to people with disabilities, and we need to end it once and for all. One of the proudest accomplishments of the Clinton Administration was to sign the Ticket to Work and Work and the Work Incentives Improvement Act into law. As a result, 31 states have enacted policies to reduce the disincentives to work. That's significant progress, but state policies are still uneven. That's why we need to move at the federal level. As President, I'll help working individuals with disabilities buy-in to Medicaid; eliminate the Medicare eligibility time limit on the number of years an individual can work; and conduct a review to determine where disincentives to work still exist in federal benefit programs and where we can and must do better. I think we can break down these barriers to employment and empower people with disabilities to find the jobs and careers that are fulfilling and important to them and the rest of us. Finally, I want to mention my health care plan. It's called the American Health Choices Plan and it has real significance for people with disabilities. My health care plan will let you keep your existing coverage if you are satisfied with it, but it provides affordable choices if you don't have coverage or you are dissatisfied. And it covers every single American. Everyone will have access to the same choices Members of Congress have now. We have a Congressional plan that covers members of Congress and federal employees. It works pretty well and you pay for it. It provides more than 250 options and it has a lower cost than you'll find through most employers and certainly on your own in the marketplace. I believe if it's good enough for Members of Congress, it's good enough for you and every other American. And under my plan, you will never be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or risk factors. Right now, health insurance companies spend $50 billion a year trying to figure out how not to cover people. I mean that's their business model. They claim they're in the health insurance business, but they're really in the health no insurance business. They're trying to avoid covering people, and then if they some how get caught, and they actually cover you, they try to avoid paying for the services that you receive. I think that's wrong. And I'm offering a new business plan. And in fact, I'm going to save them a fortune. Because here's the new policy: more discrimination, period. Cover everybody. My plan requires insurance companies to compete based on cost and quality, not how skillfully they can exclude patients with the greatest medical needs. We're also going to start covering prevention. I believe we can actually avoid some disabilities if we provide prevention. The clearest example of that is that government and health insurance plans, rarely pay for a visit to a podiatrist for a diabetic. But they pay for the amputation of the foot. Therefore we have a created a disability instead of preventing a disability. And there are many other examples that I could through in the absolutely backwards way that the health care system currently operates. My health plan, my disabilities agenda, and all of the policies I've put forward have one unifying principle: that we're all in this together and it's time to start acting like it again. I do not believe in the Bush Republican policies of you're in this on your own. They call it the ownership society. And they are trying to put the entire burden of coping with all of life's unpredictable events on the individual. That was what was behind their attempt to privatize Social Security. That is what is behind their efforts to cut back on support from other systems that enable people to fulfill their God-given potential. Well I believe that whenever anyone in America can't live up to his or her potential that diminishes all of us. And we owe all of our people wise, sensible policies that recognize the dignity, the value, and the humanity of their all Americans. I know that's what most Americans believe. We just need our political system once again to show the leadership necessary to make it happen. I am excited by my campaign because of the broad support I am receiving across New Hampshire. But I know we have a very tough two months plus to go. And I'm going to do everything I can to travel this state to meet with as many citizens as possible to answer your questions. But one thing I that am proud to be representing is the change that Americans deserve to have. Now change is just a word unless you have the strength and experience to make it happen. But I don't any people who are stronger, than people with disabilities, who get up every single day and do the best they can, reach out to others, and I want to recognize that strength. So, yes, kindness is called for from all of us to one another. I believe that we've got to get back to treating each other with that sense of recognition and respect. But never forget that justice is at the core of the American Dream. And we must once again stand for just here at home and around the world. Thank you all very much."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 5, 2007",b'Remarks on Comprehensive Strategy to Address the Climate and Energy Challenge',"b'Thank you all so much. Thank you Senator Hogg. Thank you all for being here. This is such an exciting day because we are in this facility being part of the future that we will make together for our country. I want to thank Senator Hogg because he has campaigned on climate change, he has campaigned on renewable energy, he\'s campaigned on the future we need for our children.And I\'m thrilled to have so many others here with me today. I want to thank County Supervisor Jim Houser. I want to thank Justin Shields from the Hawkeye Labor Council. I want to thank State Representative Swati Dandekar, I want to thank State Representative Todd Taylor. I want to thank my dear friend Christie Vilsack who\'s with me and I want to especially thank Clipper Windpower because other people are talking and you\'re doing. You\'re making it happen. [Applause] I have been looking forward to being here because I know how important it is that those of us who are running for President, asking the good people of Iowa for your support, that we tell you what we will do when we\'re President to deal with the big problems facing America. And today I want to focus on energy and climate change. Two years ago as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, I traveled to Barrow, Alaska. That\'s the northern most point of the United States. And I also traveled through on my way there the Yukon Territory in Canada. Traveling over those vast coniferous forests that blanket those harsh unforgiving latitudes, I looked down to see dead trees as far as the eye could reach. These trees are part of an ecosystem formed to survive brutal conditions. But the giant spruce trees of the Yukon, some centuries old, are no match for a relative newcomer: a tiny insect known as the bark beetle. The forests, it turns out, were once protected by cold, cold winters. The beetle could not survive. But warmer temperatures have allowed this invasive species to travel into higher latitudes and wreak unnatural havoc. In once pristine forests, there was devastation. Millions of acres infested. Whole swaths of land - once green - now brown. When we arrived in Barrow, virtually everyone I spoke to had a personal wake up call about what was happening in the climate. A visit to a boyhood watering hole revealed a dried up lakebed. A native village uprooted by erosion. I met lifelong participants in dogsled races who told me they no longer even needed to wear gloves during those races. At the top of the world, you hear stories -- affirmed by decades of scientific investigation -- of changing weather patterns, melting ice, retreating glaciers, unprecedented wildfires, eroding coasts, and invasive species. You can see the evidence with your own eyes. There are no climate change skeptics inside the Arctic Circle. Of course, this is a story about a place thousands of miles from here, in one of the most remote regions of our planet. But I share it because it is not an isolated experience any longer. It is a part of our story. It is part of Iowa\'s story and America\'s story. Alarming climate changes, a stagnant economy, our health weakened, our national security compromised -- because of our failure to move to a clean, efficient energy future. It is our story because the climate crisis portends drastic changes to our way of life. The last two decades of the 20th century were the hottest in 400 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that 11 of the past 12 years are among the warmest since 1850. Rising sea levels along the coastal United States could cost $170 billion in the coming decades. Beyond our shores, you have African countries experiencing water stress, Asian countries contending with increasing flooding. It\'s our story because our dependence on foreign oil threatens our economy. America\'s national and economic security has taken a backseat to the driver\'s seat. Gas prices have doubled over the past six years. Nationwide, diesel recently hit an all-time high. You know gasoline prices, depending upon where you shop, are around $3 a gallon. Two thirds of Americans now say that rising gas prices are a hardship for their families. One in four low income families have already missed a mortgage or a rent payment because of rising energy costs. Meanwhile, we are more dependent on foreign oil today than we were on 9/11. And one third of our trade deficit is the petroleum we import, as we transfer massive amounts of wealth to undemocratic governments that use those funds to stifle opposition and finance extremism. It\'s our story because the carbon economy compromises our health, the air we breathe, and the environment in which we raise our children. One study found that pollution from power plants causes 24,000 premature deaths in our country each year. Nearly a third of our childhood asthma cases are caused by air pollution and environmental contamination. And finally, it\'s our story because the President has systematically undermined our path to a clean energy future. Instead of recognizing the irrefutable evidence, this Administration has launched a war on science itself. Political appointees have censored studies on global warming, silenced climate experts. According to a survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists, nearly three fourths of climate experts witnessed inappropriate interference in climate research. And just this past March, the Administration issued a gag order to employees of the Fish and Wildlife Service forbidding them to speak about the plight of polar bears without prior official approval. Instead of an all out optimistic assault on the problem, the Bush Administration launched an assault on the problem solvers. The President took seven years to recognize climate change. He refused really to engage in talks with other global leaders at the United Nations and even tried to stop individual states from taking their own action to reduce CO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act. This is the biggest challenge we have faced in a generation. It is a challenge to our economy, to our security, to our health, and to our planet. And it\'s time for America to meet it. It is time to get back into the solutions business. And that is what America does better than anybody else. [Applause] You know, when America confronted a Great Depression, we did not wring our hands. We rolled up our sleeves. Try rolling up your sleeves while you\'re wringing your hands. It can\'t be done. And we created the New Deal and invented Social Security. When the Greatest Generation was called upon to save the world from tyranny in World War II, our whole country responded. While young men fought overseas, Americans did their part to support the war effort here at home. When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, we didn\'t minimize the challenge or silence the scientists who wanted to get out and meet it. Instead, within one year, President Eisenhower had created the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, created NASA, and passed the National Defense Education Act that fostered the next generation of scientists and engineers. Our nation was so united and determined that we answered President Kennedy\'s call to land an American on the moon and return him safely to earth within the decade. For this generation of Americans, climate change is our Space Race. It is our home-front mobilization during World War II and it is our response to the Great Depression. According to studies, the negative economic consequences of climate change will affect every part of our country, virtually every sector of our economy, and strain our local governments, cost jobs, and extract a horrific human toll. I\'m very proud that Vice President Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just won the Nobel Peace Prize for sounding the alarm that all of us must respond to. [Applause] There are also security implications. A group of retired 3 and 4-star generals and admirals issued a recent report describing in detail the threat that global warming poses to our national security, from increased conflict over natural resources to instability and migrations. Earlier this year, the Senate passed my legislation to require the Department of Defense to integrate this issue into our planning. And for those who still believe that we can\'t afford to tackle climate change, the price of inaction is far higher than the price of action. I believe America is ready to take action, to break the bonds of the old energy economy, to prove that the climate crisis is one of the great economic opportunities in the history of our country. Seizing it will unleash a wave of innovation, create millions of new jobs, enhance our security, and lead the world in a revolution in how we produce and use energy. It can literally be a new beginning for the 21st century. [Applause] After 35 years of advocacy on behalf of children and families, I believe solving the climate and energy crisis is critical to leaving our children a world as healthy and welcoming as the one we inherited. [Applause] After eight years in the White House and seven years in the Senate, I believe I know how to get the job done. I know that a true American response offers us a way not just to bridge the economic divide, but to heal the partisan divide that has paralyzed our politics and compromised our future. There is something for everyone to do, and success will require each of us do our part. So, if you\'re ready for change, I am ready to lead. [Applause] When I am President, we will set three major energy goals for America. One, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050, the amount necessary to avoid the most dangerous and destructive consequences of climate change. [Applause] Two, to cut foreign oil imports by two thirds from projected levels by 2030 to move America toward energy independence. And three, to move us from a carbon-based economy to an efficient, green economy by unleashing a wave of private-sector innovation in clean energy and energy efficiency. I believe that will create at least five million good new jobs from clean energy over the next decade. [Applause] Now, how will we achieve these goals? Well, first, as President, I will lead a national commitment to energy efficiency. This is the cheapest, cleanest, fastest way to reduce energy consumption and save energy costs, and to create good new jobs that cannot be outsourced. The Department of Energy estimates that we can reduce energy use in residential buildings 20% by 2020. We can do better than that I believe. By some estimates all the future growth in energy demand in North America, all of it, could be met through investments in efficiency alone. And we know how to do this. Since 1970, three-fourths of all new demand has been met simply by using energy more efficiently. Over the past three decades, California has held its electricity use per person flat. In other words, there\'s been no increase in electricity use per person in the entire state of California for 30 years. They\'ve done it through practical steps in conservation and efficiency. During the same 30 year period, energy demand in the rest of country, skyrocketed by 50%. California\'s flat. We\'ve all gone up 50%. Now, did California get left behind? Did people flee California because it was no longer a good place to live? Just the opposite. It has prospered. A study released earlier this year by the University of California Berkeley found that cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, through further improvements in efficiency, could create more than 1 million new jobs in California alone. And if American electricity use had fallen at the same rate as California use, our whole country would be using 43% less electricity today. So when I\'m President, increasing energy efficiency quickly will be priority one. We will set a goal of reducing electricity demands 20% by 2020. We must change the way utilities make money. Today the incentives are backwards. The less we conserve, the more carbon we emit, the more money utilities earn. We\'ll change that with energy efficiency targets for utilities and incentives for saving power instead of generating more of it. This seemingly simple change, called decoupling, has transformational potential because utilities are in the best position to help businesses and families make investments in efficiency. Fourteen states already have some form of efficiency goals for utilities and more utilities are embracing that as well. Decoupling permits a utility to invest in efficiency. Duke Power and other utilities have committed to go beyond that. They are offering energy audits to all of their customers. They\'re helping their customers come up with plans to cut consumption and to finance the implementation over 20 to 30 years, as if efficiency gains were mini-power plants. It works like this: the installation of solar power and cold resistant glass and other improvements cut your utility bill 30%. The utility pays the upfront cost of those improvements and then a portion of the efficiency savings goes to you to cut your bills, and the other goes to the utilities to pay off the cost of the improvement. You get a lower utility bill, they get more power with no more CO2 emissions. In the process a lot of jobs are created - installing the new product, manufacturing, distributing and selling. The system is user friendly, faster, cheaper and more labor-intensive than building a new power plant. A lot of people who build things for a living, say \'well, but if we don\'t keep building power plants, we\'re going to lose jobs.\' It\'s just the contrary. If we\'re building millions of mini-power plants we\'re going to create more jobs. That\'s what I want to see for us. Once we have nationwide decoupling, every utility should implement this type of system and maximize efficiency before building any new power plants. And that\'s just the beginning. At your office, you probably have a desktop computer, a thousand times more powerful and half the price than computers available 20 years ago. An i-pod can hold more songs than you can listen to in a month. We can talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time using 21st century information technology, which has transformed our economy. But all of this depends on a power grid all but unchanged in half a century. It is time to start building a 21st century grid. Right now the system runs on auto-pilot. The only connection between your home and the grid is the power you draw. But what if we harnessed all of the advances in information technology? Imagine if you could time your air conditioner, or your dishwasher or you dryer to turn on when demand for power was less and the cost lower. Imagine if you could charge your car in your garage at night, and sell power back to the utility when your car is parked at work during the hours of peak energy demand. Imagine if you could sell back the excess power you generate with solar panels on your roof. Imagine if the system could manage the stresses on the grid continuously, cutting peak demand to avoid brown outs, conserve power and save money. Just a 5% drop in peak demand would save $35 billion in energy costs over 10 years. We can harness this technology. As President I will fund ten ""Smart Grid Cities,"" provide smart grid tax incentives to utilities and encourage state utility commissions to provide incentives as well. We will also make appliances more efficient, saving consumers $54 billion between now and 2030. You know the EPA\'s successful Energy Star program provides valuable information to consumers about how to save energy and save money by purchasing more efficient products. Let\'s take it further and create a Climate Star initiative, to provide consumers with information to compare the carbon footprints of products that they buy. We will also phase out the incandescent light bulb -- the technology that Thomas Edison pioneered. I think Thomas Edison would support this idea. In fact, he\'d probably be there helping us develop the replacements -- from L.E.D.s to compact fluorescents. Compact florescent bulbs - they may look funny - they use a quarter the amount of energy and last 5 to 10 times longer than the typical incandescent bulb. If we move to compact fluorescent, or other equally energy saving alternatives, we will cut our national electric bill by more than $10 billion over just 8 years. I also want to launch a Green Building Fund to invest $1 billion per year into energy efficiency in public buildings like schools, police stations, firehouses, and offices. We\'ll help 20 million low-income families modernize their homes to be more energy efficient. Buildings account for 40% of America\'s carbon emissions -- and there are so many simple, cost effective steps we can take to reduce heating bills, light bills, save taxpayers\' money, and cut pollution. In the process we can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. I will also create a program called ""Connie Mae,"" that stands for the Carbon Neutral Mortgage Association. This is a great idea that Vice President Gore has championed. The extra cost of thicker insulation and efficient window coatings, for example, are often shunned by builders and buyers looking to save money -- even though these green products actually pay for themselves in lower utility bills. Connie Mae will make it easier for families to secure affordable loans from private lenders to improve the efficiency in their own home. It\'s a win for the bankers, homebuyers and the planet. Yesterday night I was at the Great River Medical Center. It\'s in West Burlington, and I learned it is the most energy efficient hospital in America. This is happening in Iowa right now. It\'s just happening so rarely and on such an individual basis that we don\'t realize all of the benefits that we can get. The Great River Medical Center is powered by the world\'s largest lake-coupled geothermal heating and cooling system. I thought that was pretty neat. Right here in Iowa. The most energy efficient hospital in America. [Applause] The second piece of my agenda asks the national government to set the rules and lead the way. As President, I will put in place a market-based cap and trade system to reduce carbon pollution. Here\'s how it will work: the federal government auctions permits for 100% of the nation\'s carbon dioxide emissions. Companies purchase those allowances but they can be traded, borrowed, banked, bought, and sold. The market will determine the cost of carbon pollution and companies will be rewarded for cutting emissions. In combination with efficiency, fuel economy standards and other proposals, this system will ensure we meet our goal of reducing our contribution to global warming below 1990 levels by 80%. We know this can work. It was exactly what we did in the 1990s to reduce acid rain, cutting sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons below 1980 levels. While setting down the rules, the federal government will also set an example. All new federal buildings designed after noon January 20, 2009, when I become President, will have to be carbon neutral -- that is zero emissions. No new federal buildings that don\'t meet that standard. [Applause] I will ask the Department of Housing and Urban Development to strengthen energy efficiency standards for public housing and develop model standards for all new construction. And we will make energy efficiency a core mission for the Government Services Administration, which manages federal buildings. I also want to help local governments go green. More than 700 mayors have signed a pledge to cut their city\'s contribution to climate change and meet the standards set by the Kyoto Protocol. Third, I will ask automakers to play a role. Today, your car may have a CD player, a navigation system and GPS. We have front and side impact airbags, anti-lock brakes, technology that senses tiny changes in road conditions. Henry Ford would be dumbfounded until he opened the hood. Because he would recognize the internal combustion engine underneath. It is the same basic concept that he put in to the Model T almost a century ago. In fact, that Model T got better gas mileage than your typical SUV does today. We can\'t continue this. It\'s time for a change. For two decades, U.S. fuel economy has stagnated. Cars and light trucks account for 40%of the 21 million barrels of oil consumed every day in America. I believe America should do what we do best: lead the innovation race. Imagine if over the past century, we\'d advanced as far in powering our cars as we have in keeping our cars safe. As President, I will raise the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 and 55 by 2030. [Applause] That will save consumers more than $180 billion dollars in fuel bills each year and save us 4.5 million barrels of oil each day. But I\'m not going to ask the auto companies to do it alone. I want to be a partner, a good partner, to help them transition to a clean energy future. I\'ll provide $20 billion in ""Green Vehicle Bonds"" to help domestic automakers retool their older plants to manufacture new, more efficient cars and trucks. We\'ve also got to invest more in new batteries, transmissions and other technologies. I will create a tax credit to help auto makers cover the legacy health care and retirement costs they face. Next, we\'ll accelerate the production of plug-in hybrids. These are vehicles that can be filled up at the gas station and charged up in a standard outlet. A vehicle powered by electricity releases one-third less global warming pollution, even if the electricity comes from coal. These cars can offer the promise of 100 miles to the gallon. And if the plug-in is a flex-fuel vehicle running on E85 ethanol, it could potentially travel 500 miles for every gallon of gas consumed. [Applause] Now, the good news is, Detroit is already embracing this existing technology. It is poised to be a world leader. General Motors plans to bring a plug-in hybrid to market in 2010, and Ford is looking at plug-ins as well. But the plug-in revolution can\'t happen fast enough. As President, I will invest $2 billion in research and development to reduce the cost, improve the capacity and the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries. I will offer consumers a tax credit of up to $10,000 for purchasing a plug-in hybrid. And I want to add 100,000 plug-in hybrids to the federal fleet by 2015. At the same time, we\'ve got to increase access to public transportation. For every mile you travel on a subway, a bus or a train instead of in a car, you produce 95% less carbon monoxide and half as much carbon dioxide. If we have clean buses, more efficient locomotives, the reductions could even be greater. I want to increase funding for public transit by more than $1.5 billion each year and link that to smart policies that discourage sprawl and congestion. Fourth, we\'ll ask the oil companies to do their part. I have proposed a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund to invest in the clean energy technologies of the future. Here\'s how we\'ll pay for it -- by ending the tax breaks that oil companies receive to maintain the existing oil dependence economy. [Applause] Oil is now over $90 a barrel. A lot of folks think it\'s going to get to over $100 a barrel. The oil companies don\'t need your tax dollars to help them. We\'re going to give these companies that have made the highest profits in the history of the world a choice: pay into the strategic energy fund or invest more in renewable energy. We cannot let the middle class pay twice to solve the energy crisis, in higher prices at the pump and in bearing the largest burden of transitioning to a green economy. A portion of the oil companies\' profits should also be used to spark the R&D; that will help America the world\'s leader in exporting that technology. I will also require oil companies and other major gasoline retailers to install E85 pumps at half of their stations in the next five years and all of their stations in ten. It\'s time for the oil companies to become energy companies. That\'s good for our country and they must begin to do it. Fifth, we will support the innovative companies, the skilled workers, the creative entrepreneurs and the path-breaking researchers who are driving the next great discovery. Germany, Japan and other countries have surpassed us in the production of solar, wind, geothermal and other vital technologies. We\'ve always been the innovation nation, and it\'s time for us to lead again. Tomorrow, I will be in Newton outlining my energy jobs agenda. But we need look no further than Clipper Windpower. [Applause] In a few short years, Clipper Windpower has set an example of how creating clean energy can create good jobs. This is a 330,000 square foot facility. You employ more than 250 people helping to develop and deploy the next generation of wind technology. Just one of the turbines that will be fueled by these great generators, which is really the brain of the windpower, can power 800 homes without producing any pollution at all. [Applause] As President, I will be a good partner for Clipper and for other companies and innovators who are not only contributing to their bottom line and creating jobs, but I think being real patriots. This is the new challenge. What does it mean to be a patriot for America in the 21st century? End our dependence on foreign oil and an old energy system that undermines our growth and our future. [Applause] I will also increase the goal for biofuels to 60 billion gallons by 2030, with almost half of that coming from advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. We will accelerate the production of advanced coal technology. Coal currently provides 50%of our electricity in America, but it comes at a high price in greenhouse gases and other pollutants. We need to accelerate the development and deployment of technology that can safely capture and store carbon dioxide emissions. That is why I will provide funding immediately for 10 large-scale projects. At the same time, we need to stop building coal plants the way we have in the past. I will require utility commissions to evaluate whether the energy efficiencies that decoupling makes possible can meet expected demand before permitting any new coal plant. In any event, I will require all new coal plants to be built so that capture and storage technology can be added as soon as it is available. I will strongly support a renewable portfolio standard, with 25% of electricity coming from wind, solar, and other renewable sources by 2025. [Applause] We have lost so much time in the last years. Today America produces between 2% and 3% of our power through renewable sources. Meanwhile, Denmark plans to meet one half of its energy needs with wind by 2025. Last year, Germany produced half of the world\'s solar electricity. While these countries provide incentives for energy independence, their companies are exporting new technologies around the world, boosting their economies and creating new jobs. In just the last two years, the German economy added 85,000 new jobs in renewable energy. As a point of comparison, since we have almost four times the population they have; they have 82 million, we have a little over 300 million, we could have added some 300,000 good jobs from the same sources if we had been leading the way instead of dragging our feet. And clean energy will also improve both the health of our families. Asthma rates are soaring in part because of the way we produce energy. No one, can any longer, ignore the health affects of dirty energy. The International Olympic Committee is considering canceling some events at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing due to poor air quality. So China is now rushing to institute tougher emissions standards to clean up the air before the games begin. As President, to help us reach 25% by 2025, I will make the production tax credit for wind and solar permanent. No more guessing what you\'re going to get as you move forward with your production. [Applause] I will also provide tax incentives for homes and businesses to install technologies, and establish a national net metering standard -- so, families and companies that install these new technologies can sell power back to the grid for a fair price all over the country. That happens in some states, but it stops at the border. We need to make it national. Finally, the Strategic Energy Fund I\'ve proposed will double investment in energy research and invest in a new initiative called the Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency. I want to bring together the best minds in the public and private, and academic sectors to think outside the box. If we have the best minds thinking about an alternative to the internal combustion engine, who knows what we would create? We need to be doing this. The agency that helped us win the space race, that literally creating the internet, can be the way we deal with our new energy challenges. America can lead the world\'s green revolution. Our entrepreneurial capacity, our capital markets, our research institutions and our skilled workforce are unmatched. We are the best in the world, let\'s start acting like we\'re the best again. [Applause} This will create at least 5 million jobs. You\'ve heard of white collar jobs. You\'ve heard of blue collar jobs. These will be new ""green collar"" jobs all across America. [Applause] Think about it. Entry level jobs insulating houses and installing green roofs on buildings. High-wage construction jobs modernizing our grid and building green buildings. Farm jobs planting and harvesting bio-energy crops. High-tech bioengineering jobs in cellulosic ethanol. Management jobs in new, clean energy companies. High tech jobs developing new, affordable forms of clean energy. And last but not least, manufacturing jobs building wind turbines, solar panels and other products, just like here at Clipper. [Applause] Sixth, shaping our own clean energy future will enable America to play an indispensable role in shaping the world\'s clean energy future. We can\'t meet these challenges alone. We could be as clean as all of us hope to be in 10, 15, 20 years, if other countries like China and India are polluting the atmosphere, all of their pollution will get up in the wind currents and fall right down on us. We can\'t just act like the world doesn\'t need our leadership the way we have for the last 6 and half years. Other countries like China and India, they see we\'ve done nothing. They feel free, therefore, to do very little. That is not the way we can lead. We have to prove that moving away from a carbon economy is good for growth and lead the world to a new binding agreement to reduce emissions dramatically. The President\'s failed unilateral energy policy is a part of our failed unilateral foreign policy. It\'s deprived us of the credibility and the leverage we need to solve the climate crisis. I\'ll change that by leading the process to develop a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012. One of the worst messages the President sent was when he took office and rejected completely Kyoto. He could have said we don\'t like Kyoto but we\'re immediately starting a new process. But that didn\'t happen. Well, come January 2009, I\'m sending a different message. I want to act quickly to help develop a new treaty. I will engage in high level meetings with leaders around the world every three months, if that\'s what it takes to hammer out a new agreement. My goal will be to secure a deal by 2010. We can\'t wait for two more years. I will establish an E8 that\'s modeled on the G8 which is where the big industrial economies come together. We need the world\'s major carbon-emitting nations to come together to tackle these challenges. I want to focus on international attention to solve the problem of global deforestation. We\'re losing our forests dramatically. They play such an important role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and we need to figure out how to have a win-win strategy for that. We\'ve seen how good leadership can make a difference in solving global climate and environmental problems. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher understood the urgency of ozone depletion, called a meeting in London and was a driving force in banning ozone-depleting chemicals worldwide. Seventh, every single American will have a role to play. Everywhere I go, I meet people, and particularly young people and children, who ask me what they can do to fight global warming. What they can do to be more energy independent. Now, I always tell them about my late father who turned off every light before he left any room and he used to turn off the thermostat when we went to bed at night. As he used to say, \'I\'m not paying to heat the house, so get more covers.\' That sounds kind of funny, but that\'s what our parents and our grandparents used to do. We\'ve got to be more conscious of how we live today. On Wednesday, I will outline in greater detail the ways individuals, communities, colleges, schools, all of us can play our role. It starts by asking every American who wishes to sign a pledge to do so to reduce your personal contribution to global warming -- encourage your neighbors to do the same. If every home replaced - this is astonishing and I kept saying are you sure this is true, listen to this - if every single one of our homes replaced just one 60-watt incandescent light bulb with one compact fluorescent, it would save enough energy to light more than 3 million homes and prevent the greenhouse gas emissions equal to the amount produced by 800,000 cars in a year. So when people say well we\'ve got to wait for the government, we got to wait for great companies like Clipper, that\'s not true. There\'s something every one of us can do. I\'m going to challenge individuals and businesses to set their own energy saving goals. I\'m going to challenge schools, colleges, and universities and students to do the same. And give awards so we can really hold up the best leaders. I\'m going to challenge communities to do the same as well. We\'re going to invest in new management tools so that cities and communities can keep track of what they emit And when I\'m President, the United States Treasury will issue ""Energy Independence Bonds"" dedicated to the Strategic Energy Fund. During World War II, Americans purchased more than $33 billion worth of war bonds. More than 6 million Americans volunteered to participate in bond drives. I have no doubt that we can appeal to that same sense of duty and patriotism today. As Vice President Gore says, political will is a renewable resource. Eighth and lastly, I am outlining more than a plan. I have a strategy to make this real. I have tried throughout this campaign not to just to make speeches about what I want to do, but to tell you how I will pay for it and how I will do it. One of the biggest problems facing those countries that did sign the Kyoto Protocol was turning good intentions into actual, economically beneficial results. As President, I will create a National Energy Council, modeled on the National Economic Council and the National Security Council, to bring together all the relevant players in the federal government to ensure that we all have the same priorities and we follow a rigorous implementation plan. For example, the Energy Department will work more closely with the Education Department on good models for school construction. The Transportation Department will work more closely with the EPA on highway congestion. The Council will be led by a National Energy Adviser with a direct line to the President to coordinate our government-wide efforts and maintain accountability. I will also reform the Department of Energy. This energy today is focused primarily on carbon-based fuels and nuclear power, with much less attention to renewables like wind. I will focus the mission of the Department of Energy on moving us toward energy independence, with a new approach to solar and wind and biofuels and hydropower and geothermal and other renewables. This is a transformational challenge for our nation and our government. I will start meeting it on day one. In one of America\'s darkest hours - soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, long before victory was assured - President Roosevelt addressed the nation in one of his Fireside Chats. The President did not mince words. He spoke honestly and in great detail about the scale and scope of the threats we faced. He even asked Americans to take out a map of the world so they could follow along what he was talking about. The President said, \'the task that we Americans now face will test us to the uttermost. Never before have we been called upon for such a prodigious effort. Never before have we had so little time in which to do so much.\' Americans were up to that task. While young brave troops served, and bled and died overseas, here at home Americans did their part. Men and women went to work in factories to build ships and planes. Americans grew victory gardens, purchased war bonds and conserved fuel and electricity. The task before us commands the same urgency and demands the same resolve. Tackling the energy crisis is the calling of our time. And when I am President, it will be the calling of our nation. And it will involve all of us. And just as the Greatest Generation rose to the occasion, I believe the Greenest Generation will do the same. [Applause] In my campaign, I have defined the four big goals for our country: restore our leadership in the world, rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class, reform our government and reclaim the future for our children. Meeting the energy and climate change challenge is essential to reaching every one of those. I do not want to be part of the first generation to leave America and the world in worse shape than when we found them. It will not happen on my watch. [Applause] If you want America to be in the solutions business again, if you want to end the destructive partisanship, if you want to bring people together -- join with me in embracing one of the greatest challenges we\'ve ever faced. It will be an exciting, noble, and rewarding adventure, taking us to places we can\'t even imagine today. Just like those Clipper ships opened up the world to America, we\'re going open up the future to our children and grandchildren. And if we do it right they will look back with pride on this moment when Americans came together to turn a threat to our future into the triumph of this new century. [Applause] Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 10, 2007",b'Remarks at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Des Moines',"b""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you Iowa Democrats. Thank you all. Thank you. What a night. What a great, great night. Thank you all. There's no better place to be than right here in Iowa with the great elected officials that you have: your governor, your lieutenant governor, your congressional delegation, our wonderful friend, Senator Tom Harkin and his wife Ruth. Isn't it a special treat to have the speaker of the house, madam speaker here tonight?[Applause] You know, on January 20th, 2009, someone will stand on the steps of the Capitol and raise his or her hand - [Applause] - to take the oath of office as the 44th President of the United States of America. And we are here tonight to make sure that that next president is a Democrat. [Applause] Because, we know, after seven years of George W. Bush, seven years of incompetence, cronyism, and corruption, seven years of a government of the few by the few and for the few. We, as a nation cannot afford any other choice. We have to have a Democratic president because we have big challenges to meet. We have a war to end. We have an economy to revive. We have a 47 million Americans to insure. We have an energy crisis to solve. We have a homeland to protect, we have alliances to rebuild and we have a world to lead. So, we are ready for change. [Applause] But, you know what? Change, change is just a word if you do not have the strength and experience to make it happen. [Applause] We must nominate a nominee who has been tested, and elect a president who is ready to lead on day one. [Applause] I know what it is going to take to win. I know it's going to take all of us and millions more and a candidate who will work and fight every single day for the next year and then will go into the White House determined to bring about that change that we care so much about. Fortunately, I have a little experience standing up and fighting for what I believe is right and what I think America needs and how we can get there together. [Applause] I have spent 35 years making a difference and fighting for what I believe matters to people. As a young lawyer, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, fighting for abused and neglected kids, fighting for kids in the foster care system, fighting for kids with disabilities, kids without health care, kids without educational opportunities. In Arkansas, I helped to expand health care into rural areas and to reform the school system so that every child would have a chance to succeed. As president, I will continue those fights. Continue so that we leave no person and no child out of America's promise. As first lady, I fought my heart out for health care, and, well - [Applause] - we might not have been successful that time, but I am so proud that I played a part helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program and to insure 6 million children. When I'm president, we are going to finish the job and provide quality affordable health care for every single American man, woman, and child. [Applause] And, as Senator, I have continued to fight for family farmers and for workers. To fight for soldiers to get the body armor they needed, and for first responders to get the health care they required after 9/11. I have fought against the privatizing of Social Security and against the failed policies of George W. Bush at home and around the world. [Applause] And, when I am President, I will work to reverse the damage of the eight years of George Bush and I will restore the pride and progress in America that should be our birthright. That is who America is. We want to be proud again. We want to be progressive again and we will, when I am president. [Applause] Now, there are some who will say that they do not know where I stand. Well, I think you know better than that. I stand where I have stood for 35 years. I stand with you and with your children, and with every American who needs a fighter in their corner for a better life. Now, I know how easy it is in a campaign to get distracted; to focus on who is up and who is down, and who says what about whom. But, that is not what this election is about. This election is about those Iowans and those Americans who feel invisible in their own country; who feel invisible to their own president. This election is about the woman I met in LeClair. She and her husband both work really hard, but they had to sell half the family farm to pay their medical expenses. This election is about a veteran I met in Sioux center, who bravely fought in Iraq and came home and had to keep fighting to get the health care that he needed. This election is about the mother from Greenville, whose daughter got sick and they did not have insurance, and she died. And on her death certificate, they could not even put a cause of death, because nobody had ever made a diagnosis. She was just 18-years old. There should not be any invisible Americans and when I am president, there will not be. We will have a president again, who gets up every day, worries about, thinks about, and fights for every single one of us. That's what America deserves, and that is what my candidacy offers. [Applause] Now, we are getting closer to the Iowa caucuses. They are going to be earlier than ever before. I know as the campaign goes on, that it's going to get a little hotter out there. But that is fine with me. Because, you know, as Harry Truman said, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. I'll tell you what, I feel really comfortable in the kitchen. [Applause] So, we have to ask ourselves, what is this election going to be focused on? Well, I will tell you what I want to do. I am not interested in attacking my opponents. I am interested in attacking the problems of America, and I believe -- [Applause] -- we should be turning up the heat on the Republicans; they deserve all the heat we can give them. [Applause] You know, you listen to the Republicans who are running this year, they see eight more years of George Bush. They see a nine trillion dollar debt and say let's spend trillions more. They see that we had one rush to war and then say, wait, wait, why have one more? Well, I think we are going to tell them, in the course of this campaign, that they do not have any more time. America is done with the Republicans and their failed policies and their refusal to give America back the future that we deserve. But we Democrats, we have to decide what we are for. We Democrats believe that the middle class is the backbone of our country and the guarantor of the American dream. so, when the Republicans stand by and watch rising gas prices and rising health care costs and increase in college tuition and falling housing prices, and struggling families, and they have turned china into our banker, what are we going to do? Turn up the heat! And we Democrats, we believe that every child has a god-given potential that we want to help unlock. So, when the Republicans cut Head Start, and refuse to fix No Child Left Behind? What do we do? Turn up the heat! And when we Democrats fight for universal health care and the Republicans veto health care for child and the let the insurance companies and the drug companies undermine health care for the rest of us, what do we do? Turn up the heat! And we Democrats, we believe in labor rights and women's rights and gay rights, and civil rights. [Applause] And we believe in a department of labor that is actually pro labor, and a Department of Justice that delivers justice. So, when the Republicans tried to turn the clock back on women's rights, when they tried to stomp out labor unions, when they try to undermine civil rights, what do we do? Turn up the heat! And we Democrats, we believe in protecting the environment and we believe in solving the energy crisis. So, when the Republicans turn over our energy policy to the oil companies and deny global warming, what do we do? Turn up the heat! And we Democrats, we believe in a government that works for all Americans again. We actually believe in appointing qualified people to do the jobs in the United States Government. So, when the Republicans stock the government with their cronies, when they give no-bid contracts to Halliburton and legal immunity to Blackwater, what do we do? Turn up the heat! And we Democrats, we believe in the power of science and innovation. We know it can lift up lives and grow the economy, so when President Bush declares a war on science, when he bans stem cell research, when he tries to turn Washington into an evidence free zone and put ideology in front of facts. What do we do? Turn up the heat! And finally, we believe that our country is both great and good. And as president, I will end the war in Iraq, end the era of cowboy diplomacy and restore America's standing and leadership in the world. [Applause] So, when the Republicans engage in fear-mongering and saber-rattling and talk about World War III, what do we do to them? Turn up the heat! Well, that is what it's going to take. We are going to turn up the heat on the Republicans and we are going to turn America around. But, we cannot do it if we are not united and together; not only Democrats, but independents, and even Republicans who reject this radical experiment in extremism. I know we can win this election and I know we don't have a choice. I am proud to have the support of so many Democrats and Democratic leaders from across America. And I am especially proud to have the support of so many Democratic leaders from the so- called red states to know that I can win. Leaders like the governor Beebe of Arkansas and Senator Bayh of Indiana and Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio, who is here with me tonight. [Applause] Because, Democrats know, when we win Ohio, we win the White House. [Applause] I am so grateful to all of the Iowans who are supporting me and I absolutely appreciate everything you have done for me and for all of the candidates throughout the campaign. I ask all of you to join my campaign. I ask you to go and stand for me in the caucus on January 3. If you will stand for me for a night, I will stand and fight for you every day in this campaign and every day in the White House. Because together, we are going to restore America's leadership, rebuild a strong and prosperous middle-class, reform the government and reclaim the future for our children. Let's do it, Iowa Democrats. Let's make sure that we turn up the heat and turn America around. Thank you and God bless you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 12, 2007",b'Remarks via Satellite to the National Congress of American Indians Annual Convention',"b""Hello everyone. I am so sorry I can not be with you in person today. But I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk with you via satellite on the first day of your 64th annual convention.I especially want to thank Joe Garcia and the Executive Board for their outstanding leadership. And I'd like to recognize Arlan Melendez, one of my campaign co-chairs, and Melanie Benjamin, for their tremendous support and friendship. Finally, I want to honor all of you gathered here today for your leadership and service in your nations -- and for your contributions to our shared future. Your commitment to our environment, to the ties of family and community that bind us to each other, to making decisions based not on just their impact today -- but on generations to come -- is important for all of us to remember. Unfortunately, the United States has not always honored its obligations to Native Americans -- and Indian Country still feels the effects every single day. During the past seven years, the situation has only gotten worse. We've seen funding cuts and failures to honor tribal sovereignty. President Bush has discontinued the tribal government liaison position within the White House and Intergovernmental Affairs Office -- a position started by my husband. Five of the eight U.S. Attorneys fired by Attorney General Gonzales were leaders in prosecuting violence on Indian lands. Well, I believe it's time for a new beginning. It's time for our government to work together as partners again, like we used to. I'm proud of what we accomplished together during the 1990s. I was honored to visit reservations during my time as First Lady and to work with tribal leaders to support my husband's initiative to train and fund 1,000 new Native American teachers. And as President, I will restore that partnership and renew our shared mission to lift up our families and build the future our children and grandchildren and future generations deserve. I will start by fully supporting tribal sovereignty and honoring the government to government relationship between tribes and the federal government -- not just with talk, but with action. I'll sign an Executive Order that commits our government to regular and meaningful collaboration with tribal governments. And I will always honor our federal trust responsibility -- it's not just a law, it is a fundamental moral obligation, nothing less. Second, as President, I will appoint Native Americans to key positions throughout the federal government. I'll restore the senior position in the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. This person will serve as my liaison to Native American communities. And I'll work to appoint Native American judges and others who truly understand tribal sovereignty and respect the needs of Native communities. Third, improving healthcare in Indian Country will be at the top of my national agenda. It is unacceptable that the average life expectancy for American Indians is nearly five years less than the rest of the population. It is unacceptable that Native Americans are more than four times as likely to die from diabetes and more than 50% more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza. It is unacceptable that while the federal government spends nearly $6,000 for each Medicare recipient -- it spends only $2,000 per person for Indian Health Service medical care. I was proud to co-sponsor the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendment. This bill will expand coverage for qualified Native Americans in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, a program I helped to create as First Lady. It will also elevate the Indian Health Services Director to the Assistant secretary level. When I'm President, Indian healthcare will be a national priority along with quality, affordable care for every single Native American family. I won't rest until I get it done. Fourth, I will work every day to ensure that every child in Indian Country has the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I'll start right at the beginning, by increasing funding for the Indian Head Start program. A National Geographic study from last September revealed that tribal languages are the most vulnerable to extinction in the entire world. That's one of the many reasons why Head Start is critical. It provides a foundation for the continuation of native languages and support for tribal cultures. In fact, more than 80 different languages are spoken in Indian Head Start programs. I've also proposed universal pre-Kindergarten for all Native American children, because studies show that providing four-year olds with a high-quality early education leads to higher achievement and graduation rates and higher-earning jobs. I'll increase support for Tribal Colleges and institutions serving Native American students. These institutions play a critical role, providing culturally-relevant teaching, community outreach, and research services to tribal communities. So it's time the federal government gave them the resources they deserve. Fifth, as President, I'll work to improve housing for Native American families. Today, roughly 90,000 Native American families are homeless or under-housed, and an estimated 200,000 housing units are needed immediately in Indian Country. So when I'm President, we'll invest in building and rehabilitating affordable housing on Indian lands. That means both increasing funding for the Native American Housing Block Grant and modernizing the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act. Sixth, I'll work to support energy efficient development in Indian Country. I fully support the rights of tribal governments to shape their own environmental policies. I'll support your efforts by creating and expanding federal-tribal partnerships to promote solar, wind, and other renewable sources of energy. As part of a national weatherization initiative, I'll work to weatherize every low-income home in Indian country. Last winter, the average fuel bill for our families was nearly $900 -- it's expected to jump to $1,000 this winter. So weatherizing homes is a win-win proposition: good for the environment and for our budgets. Seventh, we need a renewed focus on law enforcement efforts on Native lands. It's simply outrageous that when American Indians are twice as likely to be victims of violent crimes, there are fewer than half as many police on tribal lands as non-tribal lands. And with the methamphetamine crisis affecting so many communities, the need for law enforcement resources in Indian Country is greater than ever. I'll start by improving the collection of data on crime in Indian country. We can't truly fix the problem unless we truly understand it. I'll also make the investments we need to step up law enforcement in Indian Country and promote state-tribal cooperative agreements to reduce crime and keep our families safe. Finally, on this observation of Veterans Day, I want you to know that as President, I will stand up for our veterans every day. As you know, Native Americans have one of the highest rates of service of any group in America. At the end of the twentieth century, we had nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in America. I believe one of the most fundamental obligations of the next President is to keep faith with these veterans -- to provide the healthcare and benefits they've earned and the respect and gratitude they deserve. So I'll fully fund the VA, I'll cut the red tape, I'll create a new GI Bill for a new generation of veterans. I will never back down and never stop fighting for those who fought for us. In closing, I want again to thank you again for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today -- it means a great deal to me. And I urge you to do everything you can to make your voices heard in this election. Your votes can make the difference in electing a President who is a true partner with Indian Country. If you give me the honor of being elected, I will be that partner. Thank you all very much."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 19, 2007","b""Policy Address in Knoxville, Iowa on America's Economic Challenges""","b'Thank you. Oh, my goodness, thank you all so much.Jackie, thank you. That was absolutely wonderful. And those of you from Knoxville know Jackie Duffy as the choir teacher, the inspiration for the choral performances at the high school. And I asked her how long she\'d been teaching, and she said, ""Twenty years."" And let\'s give her a round of applause for her dedication to education. Thank you, Jackie. [Applause] I also want to thank Dr. Randy Flack, Knoxville community school superintendent, for being here. Thank you so much, Dr. Flack. And Tim McGee, Lucas County assessor and one of my precinct captains, I thank him for coming. I also want to thank and recognize Marcia Nichols, who is the political director of AFSCME Council 61. And there is someone else I want to introduce. That is Sari Bourne, the field organizer for Marion, Lucas and Wayne Counties. Where is Sari? If she can wave or -- there she is back there. Thank you so much. And someone else who is very, very dear to me, who has served Iowa for many years and has been such a great champion of education and libraries, and that is Christie Vilsack. Thank you so much, Christie. Now, I\'ll be all over the state today and tomorrow, and then I think we\'re all going to give you a break for Thanksgiving. Don\'t you think that\'s a good idea? So everybody can gather with friends and family. That\'s what I\'ll be doing; going back home and working with my daughter to create Thanksgiving dinner, something that we like to do every year. Then we\'ll be back over the weekend, traveling the state, meeting as many Iowans as I possibly can. But today I wanted to come to Knoxville to really sound the alarm about our economy. I think it\'s important that we take a few minutes to soberly look at what\'s happening in the American economy, because the next president will inherit, unfortunately, a lot of problems. Now, this is kind of a familiar situation for me, because when my husband became president he inherited a lot of economic problems. As someone said the other day, there seems to be a pattern here: It takes a Clinton to clean up after a Bush. And so... [Applause] And so I want to spend some time telling you how I see this problem and talking about some of the things that I want to do to address it, because I believe that the next president will not have a minute to waste. You know, we\'ve got an economy that is increasingly interconnected with the global economy. It is shaped each day, not just by the billions of decisions that 300 million Americans make, but by billions more that are made around the world. And something that now happens far away from Iowa can have a ripple effect that impacts the quality of life and the standard of living for Americans. Our economy in recent months has been the subject of increasing worry. We\'ve got rising oil prices; we\'ve got a deepening housing crisis; we have a falling dollar, in terms of its value; we have a ballooning national debt; and we have weakening consumer confidence. Just 13 percent of Americans say that economic conditions in our country are positive. That is the lowest reading since the Gallup polling organization started asking the question back in 1991. And in 1991, it was the lowest that it had been in 40 years. So we understand that we\'ve got real problems, but we see nothing happening under this president to address those problems. Unfortunately, the president either doesn\'t see them or refuses to deal with them. And the net effect of it all is that the economy is not working for middle-class families. Now, we all hope that the economy will remain resilient, and we know that, if we make the right choices, the American economy can, once again, create millions of jobs and lift up the middle class. But instead of positive policies aimed at making that happen, we\'ve had the opposite: reckless fiscal policies and a president with a tragic habit of ignoring problems until they become crises. The next president will be a steward of our economy at a time when the bills from eight years of neglect and mismanagement will be coming due. The next president will have to turn around our nation and our economy. More than ever before, workers will need good job training for the jobs of this new century, but there is one job we can\'t afford on- the-job training for: That is the job of our next president. That could be the costliest job training in history. Every day spent learning the ropes is another day of rising costs, mounting deficits, and growing anxiety for our families. And they cannot afford to keep waiting. We need a president who understands the magnitude and complexity of the challenges we face and has the strength and experience to address them from day one, a president who has faith that the American people and the American economy are up to the task. And if you give me that chance, I will be that president for all of you. [Applause] In recent months, we\'ve seen a number of troubling developments. First, we have a growing crisis in our housing market that is threatening our families and unsettling the capital markets. Over the past seven years, as incomes fell, wages stagnated, many families were lured into risky mortgages to finance their homes, with rates that would jump beyond what they could afford. And regulators did little to crack down on fly-by-night brokers peddling loans to unqualified buyers. The result is 1.6 million foreclosures so far this year, nearly 1,500 in Iowa alone this past three months. That is almost double the figure from last year. And home prices across America are dropping. And unfortunately, a lot of experts predict they will drop even further. That\'s serious no matter how you look at it, because 60 percent of the total wealth of middle-class families is in their home equity. And home equity withdrawals accounted for more than 8 percent of a family\'s disposal income in the last couple of years. So as housing prices decline, people have less money to draw on for everything from medical bills to college tuition. To make matters worse, all of these mortgage woes have unsettled the capital markets. Banks have suffered enormous losses on securities linked to mortgages. They\'ve written down more than $30 billion in their holdings. Investors are increasingly risk-adverse, companies are struggling to raise the capital they need to expand, and banks are increasingly unwilling to provide mortgages and other loans to families. Second, skyrocketing energy prices are squeezing middle-class families already struggling with falling income and rising costs. You know, after September 11th, we had a historic opportunity to call Americans, to call all of us to energy independence. Instead, we outsourced our energy policy to Dick Cheney and the oil companies. And today we are even more dependent on foreign oil than we were on September the 11th. Oil prices have increased more than 70 percent since the beginning of this year. Prices are moving up. It\'s now nearly $100 a barrel. Gas hit $3.11 per gallon nationwide, the highest price ever for this time of year. As a result, average families are spending roughly $2,000 more a year on energy costs, for electricity, home heating, and gas. That\'s a huge increase. It\'s like a $2,000 energy tax in just the last seven years, more than three times what the typical American family received from the Bush tax cuts. I talk to a lot of people who are worried they\'re not going to be able to get through the holidays and the winter months. We\'ve been blessed; the weather has not yet gotten cold. So a lot of people have been holding their breath. But if we do have a cold spell, you know what will happen: So many folks will find it difficult to pay the price. Third, while corporate profits are reaching new heights, our labor market is just not working for middle-class families. The Bush administration bragged about the fact that the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent. But do you know one of the reasons it\'s 4.7 percent? It\'s because millions of unemployed people have stopped looking for work. We\'ve had millions of Americans just drop out of the labor force. If you compare where we are today with where we were when President Bush took office, if you had the same number of people actually working and actively looking for jobs, the unemployment rate would be closer to 6.7 percent. Corporate profits, however, are at a 40-year high. So here we contrast very high corporate profits, and the average American family has lost $1,000 in income in the last seven years. And over the 12-month period that just ended in July, the slow growth in wages actually accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase in corporate profits. What does that mean? Well, the profits go up, but unlike every other time in our history, the CEOs and the boards of these companies are not sharing the wealth. So companies are actually profiting off of keeping workers\' wages stagnant. And American workers? We\'re working harder than ever. We\'re the hardest working people in the world. So even though American workers are increasing their productivity, their wages have remained flat. And the gap between the rich and everybody else has only gotten broader. In 2005, the last year I could find the numbers for, all income gains went to the top 10 percent of households, while the bottom 90 percent saw their incomes decline. That is not the America that I grew up in; that is not the country that I believe is holding out the promise of prosperity for people willing to work hard and take responsibility. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans held 22 percent of America\'s income. That\'s an astonishing figure, and it is the highest level of income inequality since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. Fourth, seven years of fiscal recklessness has driven up our debt, eroded confidence in our economy, and left us vulnerable to foreign creditors. Since President Bush took office, we\'ve seen the most dramatic deterioration in our nation\'s financial health in history. Reckless tax cuts for the wealthy, bloated spending that wasn\'t paid for have pushed up our national debt to $9.1 trillion. Think about that. When President Bush became president, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus, a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we\'re back into deficits, and we have a $9 trillion debt. That forces us every day to borrow money from foreign countries like China. So when people across Iowa ask me why it\'s so hard for the Bush administration to get tough on China and other trading partners, I tell them because these countries are now our bankers. We\'re their debtor. How can we truly enforce trade laws against a country like China when we have to borrow money to feed the massive debt that George Bush has driven up? America\'s economic standing in the world has deteriorated. The value of the dollar has been dropping. It is now less valued than other currencies, something else that causes a lot of anxiety, if you look out and see what that might mean in years to come. Finally, we face new threats that neither the president nor federal regulators have adequately acknowledged or addressed. Take the risk of so-called derivatives and other new financial products that Wall Street is selling. These products offer new opportunities for investors to diversify portfolios and protect themselves against certain risks. For example, a farmer here in Iowa who\'s worried about the price of corn could buy a derivative that increases in value when the price of corn falls, so regardless of what happens with his crop, he has a chance to break even. But derivatives also create new risks. They can swing wildly in value. It isn\'t always clear who owns them or how much they are really worth. Owners don\'t always understand the risks, which is why even the investment banks that created them are losing billions of dollars on these derivatives. And the ripples are being felt from Wall Street to Main Street. I believe in our markets, but markets work best when there is information flow. And a lot of these new financial products are not transparent. The market doesn\'t have enough information about them, and certainly buyers don\'t. Today, we need a sensible middle ground between heavy-handed regulation and a hands-off approach to a risk that can hurt the innocent, as well as the sophisticated buyer. Another new challenge on the horizon is the growth of sovereign wealth funds. Now, what are these? These are investment funds owned by foreign governments. They\'re not businesses. A government of a big oil-producing country creates a fund of money, puts a name on it, calling it an investment fund, and runs the investments out of this fund. They\'re using these funds to buy up billions of dollars worth of American stocks, real estate, and corporations. Now, where exactly are countries getting the money for these funds? They\'re getting it from us. Our dependence on foreign oil means we send billions of dollars to countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Our trade deficit and our ballooning debts mean we send billions of dollars in payments to countries like China. These countries then turn around and use our dollars to buy chunks of our economy. Today, sovereign wealth funds hold an estimated $2.5 trillion. Within a decade, it\'s predicted they\'ll hold five times that much. We have never seen anything like this, and you don\'t hear a peep out of the Bush administration. Now, why exactly are these sovereign wealth funds cause for concern? Well, let me ask you this: How would you feel if a foreign government used its sovereign wealth fund to buy an American car company and moved it overseas? Right now, that government might be our banker, but what if they became our boss, as well? And how would you feel if countries used their investments in America to influence our foreign policy? What if a country set out to buy companies that compete with their national industries and shut them down? I don\'t think we\'d be comfortable with our own government speculating in real estate or buying up companies, and we should be doubly uncomfortable with the idea of a foreign government doing these things in our country. In short, these sovereign wealth funds represent a potential threat to our economic sovereignty if we don\'t act now to assess their impact on our economy. So today we face an array of serious and growing economic challenges that call for a president willing to make responsible economic stewardship a key priority, willing to confront complex problems and devise comprehensive responses, a president who always puts the middle class first. But for seven years, we\'ve had just the opposite. In fact, we\'ve had a president who\'s guided the economy with just one simple principle in mind: Take care of those at the top and let middle- class families fend for themselves. He calls it the ownership society, but it\'s really nothing more than ""you\'re on your own."" And what do we get from President Bush when the fact is that middle-class families\' income has dropped $1,000? A call to cut taxes again for America\'s largest corporations. As our trade deficit has doubled and we\'ve lost an estimated 1.8 million jobs to China, what was President Bush\'s response? He threatened to veto trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers. When foreclosures doubled last year, what was President Bush\'s response? Nothing. When families and community groups reported that crooked buyers and lenders were preying on homebuyers, nothing. But when the housing crisis started to threaten large Wall Street investment banks, the Bush administration sprang into action. It convened meetings and conference calls with the heads of major Wall Street firms, eager to help however they could. What was President Bush\'s answer to seniors who can\'t afford to retire? Privatize Social Security. What about rising oil prices? Veto funding to help low-income families pay their energy bills. Nine million children without health care? Veto health care for needy children. His answer to middle-class families who feel like they\'re standing on a trap door, just one pink slip or one medical diagnosis or one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything? Tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest of Americans. Now, it\'s no surprise that the president continues to stand by his failed economic policies. This is, after all, a man who believes that stubbornness is a virtue. What is truly amazing, however, is that the Republican candidates for president are determined to continue these failed policies. In fact, we can describe their approach to the economy in four simple words: more of the same. They see $9 trillion in debt and say, ""Why not trillions more?"" They see tax cuts for wealthy Americans and big corporations and say, ""Why not more?"" They see one attempt to privatize Social Security and say, ""Why not one more?"" In short, they see eight years of Bush economics and say, ""Why not eight more?"" Well, here\'s my response to that: You\'ve got until January 20, 2009. And not one day more will we put up with these failed policies. [Applause] I can\'t wait to get on a stage to debate the Republican nominee as we make the case for change and they argue for the status quo. To them, it\'s ""leave no Bush economic policy behind."" But today, America is ready for change, but change is just a word without the strength and experience to make it happen. It\'s easy to give a speech about restoring the middle class, but it is hard to actually do it. It\'s easy to make up a program that addresses every economic problem, but it\'s hard to figure out how to pay for it. We\'ve been here before with a president who leaves the economic cupboard bear on Election Day. This time, however, we won\'t just have to clean up the economic mess he made. We\'ll also have to end the war he started and address the health care crisis he left behind. [Applause] So we don\'t need more Republican scare tactics about a Social Security crisis. And we don\'t need a trillion-dollar tax increase that will hit families already facing higher energy, health care and college costs. What we need is to focus on the real crises of health care and Medicare and on expanding opportunities for poor, working and middle- class families who are struggling now. If the gathering economic challenges strike all at once in a perfect storm, these families, America\'s families, will be the hardest hit. So, in short, President Bush has abandoned the middle class, tilted the playing field against them, and said, ""You\'re on your own."" Republicans running to replace him say, ""It\'s time for more of the same."" And I say we need a new direction. We had an economic strategy that worked in the 1990s. We believed that fiscal responsibility could spur economic growth, so we balanced the federal budget. We saw record surpluses, 22 million new jobs, the longest economic expansion in American history. We believe that investments in our people were investments in our economy, so we expanded the earned income tax credit, provided health insurance to six million needy children, invested in Head Start and student loans. We saw historic declines in child poverty, family incomes up on average more than $8,000, and many Americans joining and staying in the middle class. So today we face 21st-century challenges, some of which we could have never imagined back in the 1990s. But I believe the principles that guided us then are still relevant today. These are the principles that are truly at the start of my plan to help restore our economy. I believe in an optimistic, progressive, modern approach to the economy. There\'s no limits to what we can do if we set our minds to it. And I believe that we can begin on day one to turn the economy around. I have four components: creating new jobs, good jobs, essential to broad-based prosperity; restoring fairness to our economy; renewing the basic bargain that if you work hard you can get head; and putting our fiscal house in order again. We\'re going to ask everybody to participate, but I am not going to ask the middle class to do more than it has already done. Staying afloat during the Bush administration has been a major accomplishment. [Applause] So we\'re going to take away the tax subsidies from the oil companies, and we\'re going to put those to work on behalf of clean, renewable, alternative energy. [Applause] We\'re going to force the pharmaceutical companies to compete. We\'re going to make them have to negotiate with Medicare to get those drug prices down. [Applause] We\'re going to tell the health insurance companies who have denied so many people coverage that they will no longer be able to discriminate against the sick, and we\'re going to insure every single American for quality, affordable health care. We\'re going to fight any ill-advised effort to privatize Social Security. We\'re going to keep Social Security rock solid for generations. And we\'re going to help families save for retirement with new retirement accounts. [Applause] And when it comes to trade, we\'re going to have real, enforceable standards and protections for our workers and our environment. And unlike the current president, I will make trade enforcement a top priority again. [Applause] We\'re going to have a manufacturing policy, because I don\'t believe we can remain a great country with a strong economy if we don\'t make things in America. And I\'m going to focus on making sure that we continue to do so. [Applause] We\'re going to pass laws that help people be able to join unions and bargain collectively for good wages and fair benefits again. We\'re going to focus on family farms, instead of corporate farms, and we\'re going to give family farms the support and the tools that they need to be successful. And we are going to finally close the tax loopholes and stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. Enough with outsourcing American jobs using taxpayer dollars. [Applause] But I\'m going to go further than that: I will provide tax relief for the middle class, because you heard me say that, given the increase in energy prices since 2000, on average $2,000, that is far more than any middle-class family got out of these Bush tax cuts. We\'re not going to be fooled. We\'re going to get back to real tax relief for middle-class families. I\'ll extend the middle-class tax cuts, give generous tax breaks to help families afford health care, offer up to $1,000 in matching tax cuts to help families save for retirement. I\'ll expand the earned income tax credit, increase tax credits for child care, and provide a new $3,500 tax credit to help middle-class families send their children to college. [Applause] And I will tie the minimum wage to congressional salaries so that Congress can\'t get a raise until working men and women get a raise in the minimum wage. [Applause] That\'s what I will do as president, but there are things we should do right now, immediate action to face the economic challenges. That starts with steps to prevent as many housing foreclosures as possible. I\'ve already announced a series of policies to do just that, including a $1 billion fund to help states work with at-risk homeowners to prevent foreclosure. Today, I call on the president to convene a crisis conference, bringing together all the stakeholders in the housing crisis, from lenders to homeowners to community groups, to figure out a solution to the housing crisis. The time for hand-wringing and blame-placing is over. We need urgent action. And instead of just trying to help the big banks, how about helping America, Mr. President, to deal with this foreclosure challenge that we\'re facing? [Applause] Second, we need to immediately address the impending home heating crisis that could affect so many families this year. Now, the only long-term solution to high energy prices is reducing our dependence on foreign oil and lowering the carbon intensity of our economy. I\'ve outlined a comprehensive plan to do that that I talked about outside of Cedar Rapids, at Newton, and other places throughout Iowa, and I have set goals to be able to move toward achieving that. But it\'s not going to happen until we see the end of the Bush administration. And I believe, if we do it, we can create five million new jobs. You know about blue-collar jobs and white-collar jobs. How about green-collar jobs for people who are going to put solar panels on rooftops, do the work on bio-fuels and everything else? But with oil approaching $100 a barrel, it\'s going to cost families 20 percent to 25 percent more to heat their homes this winter. Too many families can\'t afford that. So I was outraged last week when President Bush vetoed emergency energy assistance funding for families. Because of his veto, state agencies right here in Iowa and across America have been forced to turn away needy families. If President Bush gets his way, one million families will be cut off from heating assistance this winter. That is unconscionable. I\'ve lived in the White House. They keep it warm in the White House. And maybe the President should get out of the White House and come to Iowa and meet some of those families who are going to get cut off of energy assistance because of his veto. I call on the President to put partisan politics aside and commit emergency funds today, not months down the road, when millions of seniors and low-income families have literally been left out in the cold. Let\'s ensure that no eligible family gets turned away and that assistance keeps pace with the rising energy prices. In addition, we should commit $1 billion to an emergency home conservation program to lower costs for families in cold-weather states. This program will allow states to make weatherization kits available to three million families. These kits would include easy-to-install items, like a wrap, an insulating wrap for your water heater, caulking for doors and windows. We know from experience this can reduce a family\'s heating bill by up to 20 percent. Third, we need to work with governments around the world to set guidelines to make these sovereign wealth funds more transparent. You know, here in America, we would never fear people from other nations who have confidence in the American economy and want to invest and create jobs here. But when the investor is a foreign government, we need to be vigilant about ensuring that the investments don\'t threaten our economic sovereignty. Currently, these sovereign wealth funds don\'t have to disclose their holdings, their investment objectives, their investment returns, or their management structures, so it\'s hard to assess whether they\'re introducing unnecessary risks into our markets, hard to know whether they\'re buying or selling assets to make a profit or make a point. So today I call on the Bush administration, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund to begin immediately crafting transparency guidelines for these sovereign wealth funds. Strict disclosure requirements are critical to help us understand how these funds are operating. And, finally, we need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products. You can\'t let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don\'t work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought. So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent. But I would hope that the Bush administration would do it before I\'m sworn in. I don\'t want to see another 14 months of potential risks being injected into our economy with all of the other factors at work. You know, President Franklin Roosevelt, who said a lot of really smart things, said economic laws are not made by nature. They\'re made by human beings. Never before has America been at such an important economic crossroads. The threats to our success are many; they\'ve been aided by misguided government policies and failed economic leadership and an effort to turn our government into a government of the few, by the few, and for the few. But, you know, America\'s strengths are legendary, and I think we\'re ready to come together again and do what it takes to succeed. We just need a president ready to change our policies and lead our people. I believe I can provide the economic leadership we need to make the changes that are so desperately required, and I ask for your support and your counsel and your help as we make this journey together. Thank you all very, very much. [Applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 24, 2007","b'Remarks at the Autism Event with Sally Pederson in Sioux City, Iowa'","b'I\'m delighted to be here. I apologize for being a little late. Apparently, there was more of a headwind than tail and it took us a lot longer and I apologize for that. And I thank you so much for being here and being part of this event today. I want to recognize a few people because I\'m so pleased that we could have this event here at the Boys Club. And that wouldn\'t have been possible without Roger Friesen and the Boys Club of Sioux City for hosting us today. And I want to thank my good friend Tom Vilsack, former Governor Vilsack, who\'s here. I want to also thank Danny Holeman the head of AFSCME here in Iowa... I want to thank Representative Roger Wendt and his wife Anita, thank them for being here, Teresa Wolff the Democratic Chair for Woodbury County. Also I want to thank our guests up on the stage here who you will hear from in a minute. In addition to Sally Pederson the former Lieutenant Governor and a member of our women\'s leadership council here in Iowa, Sally has a lot of experience on the subject I\'m going to be speaking about in a minute, as do our two other participants. One is Jane Seely whose daughter Sara Seely asked me a question last week when I was here in Iowa and it turned out that Sara is autistic and asked me an excellent question and it got me thinking about all of the families that are dealing with autism and all of their challenges. And Doctor Patricia Gilbaugh who is one of Sara Seely\'s care coordinators and care givers is with us now. Now I see a lot of people holding these bumper strips over their eyes because the lights are so powerful on their eyes and that\'s not good, is it? So maybe if somebody could hear my voice and we could do something about these lights... I\'m sorry about that, but that\'s Mother Nature and we\'ll have to put up with that. ell, today we are here at the Boys Club because of the work that the Boys Club does every single day here in Sioux City. And one of their missions which they have recognized is the critical need for services for children with autism. So the Boys Club began providing those services. Now Sally has been a strong leader and advocate on behalf of families with autism for years. As Lieutenant Governor she led the Vilsack-Pederson administration\'s initiatives for health care and human services, and she has been an effective advocate for people with disabilities. Her work with The Homestead, which serves adults living with autism, is an example that I\'d like to see replicated across the country. She came to this as most people who are advocates do, because of her own child. And to the extent we\'re addressing autism today as part of the presidential campaign, it\'s because of parents like Sally who fought for their children when no one else would even acknowledge there was a problem. Driven by their love and devotion, mothers and fathers across the country have raised awareness, demanded funding, and opened our eyes to the needs of so many children. Now, when I was in law school, I took a special year at the Yale Child Study center. That was back in the very early 1970\'s. At that time, science was still blaming parents for autism. And they particularly blamed mothers. And I remember reading some of the so-called research and in particular the work of one scientist who had a lot of national and international prominence for his theories. And I thought, you know, that just can\'t be right, there\'s got to be more to it to that. I later moved to Little Rock where one of my friend had a son with autism. And I spent time in her home, I spent time with her and her son and my instinct perhaps as a mother was that this could not be the explanation. Now, despite what science used to do, blaming the parents for autistic kids, now we know that parents are the child\'s best hope to deal with what is a very complicated set of conditions. I wanted to discuss this issue today because the recent increases in autism are alarming. The number of children with an autism spectrum disorder, that means across the spectrum from what\'s called Asberger Syndrome, where kids with it may be or adults with it may be not as socially interactive as you or I would be but they can function pretty well, all the way to the most severe forms of autism including seizures and mental retardation - all along this spectrum there\'s so many different symptoms and different capacities that people have. The number with the autism spectrum disorder has grown from 1 in 10,000 in 1993 to 1 in 150 in 2007, and the numbers continue to rise. The Autism Society of America estimates that 1.5 million Americans and their families are now affected by autism. They believe that could reach four million in the next decade. Autism affects people of all racial, ethnic, and social groups, although it is four times more likely to strike boys than girls which is why the Boys Club tackling this here in Sioux City is such a great contribution. And autism is costing the United States at least 35 billion dollars a year. The symptoms have become all too familiar. The child who never makes eye contact, doesn\'t notice when his dad comes home after work. The child who stacks blocks over and over and over again. The child who would rather twirl in a corner by herself than play with other kids. These children have so much to contribute, but they are often trapped inside their own worlds, unable to communicate. Yet for all the people autism affects, we don\'t know that much about what causes it and why it is increasing in number. We don\'t know how to cure it and we don\'t even know the best ways to treat it. We don\'t have enough services to care for those who have it or support their families. I think it\'s time we had a government and a President that recognized the seriousness of autism and addressed it head-on. I am committed to this cause, and as Sally said I have been fighting for children, particularly children with needs, children with disabilities, children who are abused or neglected, children without adequate education or health care for my entire adult life. Once I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund, my first assignment was to go door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts and figure out why so many children who were listed in the census figures weren\'t enrolled in school. I went door to door, and home after home, I found reason; I found children who were blind or who were deaf; children in wheelchairs; children with behavioral problems. They were kept home because schools wouldn\'t accommodate them. I knew then that I wanted to spend my life being a voice for children - children who had been left behind and too often forgotten. I wanted to fight to give all children the same opportunities I had growing up. Today, one of the most urgent - and least understood - challenges facing our children is this rising tide of autism. That\'s why as First Lady, I fought hard for more awareness and more funding for autism. I was very proud when my husband signed the Children\'s Health Act of 2000, which had a special focus on autism research and launched a long-term study on environmental influences on children\'s health. In the Senate, I helped develop and co-sponsored the Combating Autism Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President Bush. The bill authorized $1 billion over five years to combat autism through environmental research, surveillance, awareness, early detection and early intervention. And in March of this year, I introduced the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act along with my colleague, Senator Allard from Colorado. This focuses on improving the quality of life for individuals living with autism, attaining appropriate services that will cross the life span. And as President, I will build on my work with a strong commitment to fighting autism. I\'ll start, first, by investing heavily in research to understand the causes of autism and hopefully to start finding cures. I will invest a total of $1 billion over five years to help fight autism, because President Bush signed the bill but refused to provide the funding, a familiar story. And he just vetoed a bill that Congress included funding for autism in. Specifically, we need to fund research to identify the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes. That includes expanding our system for health tracking, so that we can look for links between the environment and the rise of autism and other diseases. That\'s something that I\'ve been fighting for since 2001. I\'ve introduced an Environmental Health Tracking bill every congress since then because I think we need to face up to the fact that there are three main causes of illness or conditions that impact people: genetics, behavior and environment and usually it\'s a combination of one or more of those triggers. And we haven\'t done enough to really figure out to what it is we are exposing ourselves and our children to from the environment that triggers, perhaps, a genetic response, that makes people who are susceptible to autism show that. Usually it\'s diagnosed around 18 months, if you\'re lucky to find somebody who knows the conditions. Lots of times it doesn\'t happen until the child is 4 or 5, and that means that you\'ve delayed the treatment and intervention that could help. I\'ll also create an Autism Task Force charged with investigating evidence-based treatments, interventions, and services. I\'m modeling this after what has happened in breast cancer. Breast cancer survivors became partners with physicians and scientists and researchers in finding what was going on that caused breast cancer and what the best treatments were. Once the task force has done its work, I\'ll act on its recommendations. More research is our best hope for combating autism, and, as President, I will fund it. For the children and adults who have autism, I\'ll invest in the best possible care throughout their lifetimes. I\'ll commit $500 million annually to provide care and improve the quality of life for individuals living with autism. This starts with better screening. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently called for a universal autism screening for all children under the age of 2. Now, I applaud this and we\'re going to have to really encourage the Academy and pediatricians and other physicians to learn about the signals and symptoms and begin to coordinate information so they can identify it earlier. To reinforce those efforts, I\'ll ensure that we get screening information to professionals who deal with young children through federal programs such as Head Start, Medicaid and CHIP. Next, I\'ll expand access to post-diagnosis care so that we have a seamless transition from diagnosis to treatment. Today, the number of children affected is growing far faster than the care available. That means parents often have to hear a doctor say: ""Your child has autism,"" and then get sent away with no good options for care. This is especially tragic because we know early intervention can make all the difference. As autistic children reach school-age, we\'ll support them in public schools wherever possible. The number of children in public schools with autism has doubled in the past three years alone. But the training for teachers hasn\'t; in fact, a lot of teachers get no training whatsoever. I will provide funding for teacher training so they can fulfill their mission of teaching every child. And we won\'t stop caring about autistic individuals just because they grow up. With access to the right types of services, including housing, vocational rehabilitation, we can help adults with autism live rich and full lives. So I will help states create and provide appropriate services for adults with autism. For parents, we\'ll create an online national technical assistance center to provide the best possible information about autism treatments, interventions, and services. And finally, as President, I will fund quality, affordable health care for every single American. My American Health Choices Plan lets you keep your existing coverage if you like it, but it provides affordable choices if you don\'t have them, and it covers every single American. What happens in families of autism, or families with diabetes or families with a history of cancer or heart disease or any other condition, is that oftentimes insurance is so expensive you can\'t afford it, when the insurance doesn\'t cover the very thing you need it for. Everyone will have access to the same choices members of Congress have, which includes mental health care. I always say, if it\'s good enough for Members of Congress, it\'s good enough for American families. Under my plan, you and your child will never be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or risk factors. Parents will no longer be burdened by unmanageable premiums just because their children have autism. And when all Americans have regular healthcare, we\'ll be able to reach so many more children early on. My health plan, my autism agenda, and all of the policies that I\'ve put forward are united by my belief that it\'s up to us to reclaim the future for our children, and ensure that every child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have learned that children and adults with autism have great potential indeed. These are not only special needs individuals, these are special individuals. They have a lot to offer. Just last week, at an event in Vinton, Sara Seely, a young woman with autism - I had no idea, I was just looking out at a crowd like this, and she was eagerly waving her hand with that big smile on her face, asking a question about pollution and problem of deforestation. And she said later, she is ""obsessed with tigers."" Now, I have no doubt that she will make a difference in our world, and I am so pleased to be joined by Sara\'s mom - Jane Seely - and her doctor - Dr. Patricia Gilbaugh - today. Sara\'s not alone. So we should never give up on any child; I think that is one of our obligations. And together, we can help all those living with autism to live up to their potential. And we can commit ourselves to conquering this really difficult and very frustrating and discouraging condition that strikes children, literally out of the blue. There is no marker for it, we don\'t know it\'s coming, and oftentimes they are not quite sure what is happening until the diagnosis is delivered. So, now I want to turn to three people who have lived with it, who can add to what I said before we turn to take your questions on any issue that\'s on your minds. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 28, 2007",b'Excerpts of Remarks on Health Care',"b'Draws Key Contrasts with Obama Health Plan Hillary Clinton delivered remarks today about her health care plan, continuing to define the contrasts between her plan and Senator Obama\'s. For more information on the differences, please visit: www.facts.hillaryhub.com. The following is an excerpt from her speech: ""Among the Democrats, all of us except Senator Obama have universal health care that have put forth a plan. [Governor] Richardson, Senator Edwards, Senator Dodd. We\'ve put forth universal health care plans because we know if we don\'t cover everybody we\'re going to leave millions and millions of people out. It\'s a substantive and important difference because if you don\'t start with the goal of covering every American, you will never get there. ""Here\'s how my plan works: If you already have private insurance and you\'re happy with it, nothing changes - you keep that insurance. But if you don\'t have health insurance - or if you don\'t like the insurance you have - you can choose from the wide variety of options that are available to members of Congress. ""Now all Americans will have a responsibility to get and keep health insurance. I believe when you make this the law of the land, Americans will follow it and will purchase health insurance - far more than if we don\'t have that requirement. We\'ll provide tax credits to ensure that people can afford it - and we\'ll give tax credits to small businesses so that they can cover more of their employees. ""If you want to cover everyone, you have to make health care a shared responsibility. I know you need to have the willingness to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and demand universal coverage. And that\'s why I don\'t understand why we have this difference on the Democratic side because, if anything, Democrats should stand for universal health care. That distinguishes us from the Republicans. The Republicans don\'t believe in it, Democrats do and we should fight for it. ""And we\'ll need a president with the experience and the strength to make that happen, otherwise we will be right back here in another 10 or 12 or 14 years, and we will still have 10\'s of millions of people uninsured. And, in fact, our problems will be even worse because we would have lost more jobs because employers won\'t be willing to provide insurance, they will move jobs offshore because they don\'t want to have those benefits and we will not be either competitive or living up to our ideals. It is impossible to get universal health care if you don\'t have a mandate. That is a key difference between my plan and Senator Obama\'s plan. Now, when Senator Obama was a State Senator in Illinois, he helped to create a health care task force that looked into how to best cover everyone in Illinois with health insurance. They released their report earlier this year, and they made it very clear if you want to cover everyone, you need to require people to get health insurance. Otherwise, you will fail to cover 60-90% of the uninsured. ""Now there are a number of ways of doing this. One sensible step would be to use what\'s called default enrollment. If you don\'t make a choice, well, we set up a system where people are automatically enrolled when they come into contact with the health care system or with schools or colleges. You could also work with employers so that they automatically enroll people. The Congress has ideas about this and we\'ll work to make sure that these mandates are enforceable. ""But what\'s strange is that Senator Obama\'s plan actually does have a mandate, but only for children; no requirement for adults. Now, I\'ve worked on this issue a very long time. If you believe you can enforce a mandate on children that means you enforce the mandate on the parents of the children to enroll the children. So why would you leave out the parents of the children? Because what happens when you leave out the parents is that they\'re less likely to get health care for their own children. You see, this is all connected. And I\'m proud that Senator Edwards agrees with me, Senator Dodd agrees with me, Governor Richardson agrees with me Congressman Kucinich has a different approach, but he gets everyone covered to have universal health care. ""If we don\'t get universal health care, then we will be betraying the Democratic Party\'s principles. And it\'s important that those who will caucus on January 3rd understand this difference. Senator Obama\'s plan does not, and cannot, cover all Americans. He called his plan universal, then he called it ""virtually universal,"" but it is not either. When it comes to truth in labeling, it simply flunks the test. ""He\'s been saying there\'s no difference between our plans. But his plan would leave at least 15 million Americans uninsured - including more than 100,000 people right here in Iowa. So why don\'t we just say everyone against the wall, don\'t get insurance, we\'re very sorry but we\'re just not going to have a plan that covers you. Who\'s going to choose who doesn\'t get covered, who\'s going to leave out 15 million, or 100,000 people in Iowa? That\'s more than half the population of Des Moines. That\'s a huge difference for those who get left out like the daughter of the woman that I met in Greenville. And it\'s a huge difference to me to leave 15 million people virtually invisible, because that is what we would do. ""Well, when I am president, there will be no invisible Americans and there will be no Americans without health care. That is one of my highest priorities, and I know it\'s going to be a tough fight.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 29, 2007","b'Remarks at the Global Summit on AIDS and the Church at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California'","b'Well I am so honored and personally delighted to be here, and I want to thank Rick and Kay Warren for bringing us together this week around World AIDS Day. And I want to thank their tremendous staff and the volunteers and everyone who helped make this happen. I\'m grateful for the opportunity to share our commitment about dealing with the global scourge of HIV/AIDS. I also want to recognize two first ladies: the first lady of Zambia and the first lady of Rwanda. I am delighted that they are here representing their countries and their people. And first, [applause] let me first say how relieved Bill and I were to hear that Saddleback was spared from the recent wildfires - and how impressed and moved we were to hear about the love and support that you gave those who were not so fortunate. It\'s another example of the way in which this church is not measured by numbers. Yes, the numbers are big, they\'re certainly impressive. But it\'s measured by your impact. It\'s measured by the meaning that you give to lives here within this complex and so far beyond its boundaries. And the commitment that you demonstrate both to our faith in God and to doing His work here on earth is exemplary and that is one of the many reasons that I wanted to be here today. You know, Rick has helped so many people with his lessons for a 40-day spiritual journey. But he knows those 40 days are just the beginning. My own faith journey is approaching a half a century, and I know how far I still have to go. But I have been blessed in my life, both starting in my family and in the church of my childhood, to be guided every step of the way. A mother, who taught Sunday school and made sure that my brothers and I were there the minute the church doors opened. A father, who kneeled by the side of his bed every night of his life to say his prayers. A minister of our youth fellowship, who took it as part of his mission to show the group of white, suburban, middle class kids that there was a bigger world outside. And a prayer group that formed for me shortly after I came to the White House - a group of extraordinary women, both Democrats and Republicans, whose love and support sustained me. I\'ve often been asked if I\'m a praying person and I have always responded that I was fortunate enough to be raised to understand that the power and purpose of prayer, but, had I not been, probably one week in the White House would have turned me into one. [Laughter] It\'s wonderful to know that the sustaining power of prayer is there for so many of us. One of my favorite passages in Scripture is that famous line in James that faith without works is dead. But I have concluded that works without faith is just too hard. It cannot be sustained over one\'s life or over the generations. And it\'s important for us to recognize how here, in what you\'re doing, faith and work come together. You understand that. Or as Rick might say: creed and deed! And what extraordinary important work your faith supports - fighting against spiritual emptiness, corrupt leadership, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases like AIDS around the world. Twenty-five years ago, when men - mostly young gay men - began dying from a disease that had no name, we could not have, and certainly did not, talk about it in church. It would not have been proper. It would not have been polite. It would have been discomforting for so many of us. But the disease itself was not polite, and ignoring it did not make it go away. It only made the problem worse, because the disease fed on ignorance and fear and, let\'s be honest, on prejudice. We are taught to heal the sick. To love them as our own. But twenty-five years ago, too many died alone, ashamed to tell their families what had made them ill. In the Gospel, we learn that one-third of Christ\'s ministry was healing the sick. And if you read those moments, when Jesus is presented with someone who is ill, it becomes abundantly clear that Christ had a choice. He could have been too busy. He could have thought you know this is not the message of the day. I don\'t need to do this; I\'ve already done it in Capernaum so I don\'t need to do it again. But he made the choice. He never asked why someone was sick. He just healed and ministered those in need. That is what Saddleback has chosen too. Other churches, nonprofits, and governments have also chosen to heal, to help, to redeem. For many of us the Golden Rule calls on us to act. And so we\'ve come a long way. Not only can we talk about AIDS in church, but churches are leading the way. Thanks to leaders like Rick and Kay, Christians have embraced the sickest among us, and have fought the disease itself. We\'ve had breakthroughs in treatment that allow those with this disease to live much longer, and we are hoping for breakthroughs in vaccines and other cures. But let us not grow complacent or too comfortable. Let us not feel that because we\'re here at this conference or as a member of Saddleback or some other church represented today that we are doing our part, because we have such a long way to go. Here in America, we still have an AIDS epidemic. HIV infection rates are rising among gay men again and among African Americans and Latinos. The disease takes a disproportionate toll on the poor and communities of color. And it is an outrage that HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34 in the United States of America. Around the world, AIDS remains a plague of Biblical proportions. In too many places, ignorance about AIDS prevails and the stigma remains strong. And where ignorance and prejudice live, the disease thrives. When I walked through the World Vision village, I was told the story of Kambo - a young Kenyan boy who lost first his father and his mother to what is called the ""big disease."" And for years his grandmother had told him he did not have it. But after the death of his mother, he began to sicken, finally was tested and found out he was positive. Even before the positive results came in, the boys he played soccer with began to shun him. It became increasingly uncomfortable to go to school. So the stigma is one of the real evils that has to be combated if we are to take on HIV/AIDS around the world. We should take heart that the United Nations recently revised its estimate of the number of people infected with HIV downward from 40 million to 33 million. But please don\'t take any comfort. There are still 6,800 people infected and 5,700 who die from AIDS every day. AIDS is still the number one cause of death in Africa, where 90 percent of the HIV positive children in the world live. Don\'t let anyone tell you that the time for alarm has passed. We can\'t slow. We can\'t rest. And we can\'t quit. I\'ve seen the tragedy of AIDS firsthand. From a dear friend, who told me in the early 1980s - much I must confess to my surprise in those days - that he was gay. He had the unnamed disease, and he died shortly after. To the twelve year-old girl that I met in Northern Thailand at a shelter for former prostitutes. She had been sold into prostitution at the age of eight by her family for a satellite television. She was put to work in Bangkok\'s brothels. She contracted AIDS and was turned out and returned home to a family that would not take her in. She did find refuge in the shelter. When I met her she was in a wheelchair, so weak she didn\'t have the strength to talk. As I knelt down beside her, I could see the skin stretched tightly across her cheekbones. I thought of my own daughter and of all the girls her age who speak with such excitement about their futures, and about how cruel an injustice it was that this child would never know hers. A week after I returned to America, people running the shelter contacted me to tell me she had died. To this day, I think of that gentle face and those warm eyes and what might have been done to spare her the fate she met. She may have died on the other side of the world, but AIDS is not just an African problem, it\'s not just an Asian problem, and it\'s not just an American problem. And it\'s certainly not someone else\'s problem. It\'s a problem of our common humanity, and we are called to respond, with love, with mercy, and with urgency. As President, I will wage the fight against AIDS with the passionate commitment it demands. I will ask for $50 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, [applause] and I will ask for more money to tackle tuberculosis and malaria around the world as well. I will build on the funding levels in PEPFAR and on the leadership that the President and Mrs. Bush have shown, to demonstrate that the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria is an American commitment that exemplifies what we can do if we seek bipartisan solutions to nonpartisan problems. If we start acting not as Republicans and Democrats but as Americans again. This is also a great opportunity for partnership. There are many churches and faith based groups here in our country and increasingly in other parts of the world who are understanding the urgency of this mission. There are many foundations and not for profit organizations like the Gates Foundation or my husband\'s work for the Clinton Foundation. They are supplementing what we are doing through the government, and they are doing what the government cannot do. And it is that partnership that is uniquely American. When I was privileged to represent our country around the world, traveling to more than 82 countries, I was often struck by how so much of the rest of the world did not understand the voluntary sector in America. As Rick was saying, the private, the public, the parish - there was no sense that individuals would volunteer their time, give up their money to help meet a common need. But we are setting forth that example, as well, in the work that is now occurring. By doing this, which is the right thing to do, we are also helping to improve America\'s standing in the world. We are putting a different face on our country; we are reaching out in a common search for answers. And we will be able not only to build on that work, to save lives, to prevent the spread of this disease, but also to create a broader platform for the values and ideals that we hold dear. In order to accomplish my goals as president I have laid out a very comprehensive HIV/AIDS agenda. First, my administration will invest in treatments and capacity building by improving health systems across Africa and doubling the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment with U.S. funding in five years. Everyone who is HIV positive must have access to these drugs. I want particularly to target mother-to-child transmission. We know how to stop the spread of the virus from mother to child but we don\'t have the resources and the system behind delivering the drugs that are necessary. I believe we should do much more to encourage voluntary testing, but in order to do that it must be accompanied by counseling and there has to be a public education and outreach effort to undermine and diminish the stigma. Some countries are beginning to do this and we should encourage them. Secondly, I\'ll invest heavily in prevention, teaching young men and women how to be responsible; how best to protect themselves. I visited Uganda ten years ago to highlight their A-B-C program, and it produced results. Abstinence, be faithful, use condoms if necessary. And this has to be a message that we do much more to communicate effectively throughout areas that are particularly vulnerable. Third, I\'ll continue to invest in research to develop an effective vaccine and eventually a cure. There will be setbacks, as we have recently seen, but that doesn\'t mean we can afford to quit. And finally, I\'ll restart the battle against AIDS here in America. But I know that neither money nor government alone will solve this problem. Corinthians tells us that the body is made up of many parts, and ""though all its parts are many, they form one body."" Well we need, as though we were one body, to use every resource at our hands, our disposal. Because as Kay and Rick have advocated, the fight against AIDS must be done hand-in-hand, building relationships with churches around the world and here at home. Because if we fail to engage churches in combating AIDS, we will fail to conquer AIDS. As you have shown, there are six things churches can do: Care for those who are infected and their families. Encourage testing, even become testing centers. Unleash volunteers. Reduce the stigma by showing it\'s not a sin to be sick. Champion healthy behavior. And be treatment coaches for those taking medication. I would add that churches also must tend to the spiritual side of this crisis. Because AIDS is not just a medical emergency. Who will comfort the orphan dying alone after losing both parents to AIDS? Who will heal the emptiness that leads thousands of girls to be trafficked for a satellite television or a few dollars into prostitution and modern-day slavery each year? Who will provide stability and hope in communities devastated by AIDS? Who will welcome the drug addict using dirty needles or the gay teenager seeking safety and guidance? Just as in my own life I need both faith and work to be whole - healing the world will take both faith and work as well. We are compelled to address AIDS because it\'s the right thing to do. But we can also acknowledge it\'s smart, as well. AIDS is turning back the clock on the development that we have seen in Africa and elsewhere. It is destabilizing countries and undermining economies. In some places, AIDS can be even more destructive than war. It is watering the weeds of volatility and despair, and we should be planting seeds of hope and progress. And nothing will help America more to win hearts and minds around the world more than showing America\'s true heart on problems like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In fact, we know our values are the source of our greatest strength. As the PEACE Plan has recognized so clearly, however, we can\'t address AIDS in isolation. AIDS is deeply intertwined with so many other crises, and if we are serious about beating this disease, we have to address them as well. To end AIDS, we need to end malaria in Africa. Malaria is overwhelming the health infrastructures in the developing world, accounting for 40 percent of health spending in many countries - money we need to fight AIDS. Malaria is a challenge to our conscience in its own right. It is appalling that more than a million people die every year from a bug bite. And nearly all of them are children. A child in Africa dies from malaria every 30 seconds. We made a decision to eradicate malaria in North America and in Europe. And we can do the same in Africa and Asia. So I\'ll set a goal of ending all deaths from malaria in Africa by the end of my second term. We can do this if we are committed together. We also need to aggressively confront tuberculosis - a disease that takes the lives of so many AIDS victims before they should go. A disease that is mutating to become drug-resistant. That endangers all of us. It may start in Africa or in a prison in Russia or in some other far away place, but it endangers all of us because in a world without boundaries, people and viruses move freely. To end AIDS, we also need to educate all the world\'s children. Education not only reduces poverty and improves health, it\'s a key form of prevention. It is what you might call a ""social vaccine"" against the spread of HIV/AIDS. But today, 72 million young children - most of them girls - will not set foot in a school, and hundreds of millions will not go beyond primary school. In fact, there are more young children out of school in Africa, than there are children in school in America. Every day we don\'t act, we deny more children the childhoods they deserve. We deny future mothers the ability to read a story to their children or a warning on a medicine label. We deny what is at the heart of human dignity: the power to learn, to discover, to grow, to reach one\'s God-given potential. So as President, I\'ll work to pass and then sign my bipartisan Education for All Act to help provide a quality, basic education for every single child around the world. And finally, to end AIDS, we need to stand up for women\'s rights. AIDS takes a particularly harsh toll on women and girls - about 60 percent of people living with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa are women. They are young girls who are taken in marriage or in rape. They are women who are abused and mistreated; who have no say in their own lives, who work from sun up to sun down; who never believed they have any way to speak up or be heard. Their societies and their country don\'t recognize their rights to health care or education. They don\'t participate in the economy in a formal way, although their work keeps people alive and thriving. I remember once driving through Africa on a bus with a group of distinguished experts and in field after field and marketplace after marketplace we saw women working, women working hard, carrying firewood, carrying water, selling their products in the villages. And the economist said, ""Well, it\'s too bad that all of their work doesn\'t matter in the formal economy."" And I said, well, if they stopped all of their work, the formal economy would collapse. And it is time we pay tribute and respect to the hard work of such women. And it is long past time that we do everything we can to stand up for the proposition that women\'s rights are human rights. As I saw so starkly at that shelter in Thailand, girls denied their human rights are girls at risk of AIDS. And even in our own country today, women are now the face of AIDS. In 1995, I went to Beijing on behalf of our country for the United Nation\'s Fourth World Conference on Women. I said what most of us believe here in America, that women\'s rights are human rights, but it was considered a radical statement. I remember being on the Voice of America shortly after I came back. It was a call in radio show that was beamed throughout the world and a caller from Iran called and he asked me Well, what did I mean by saying that women\'s rights were human rights? And I said, I want you to stop for a minute, maybe close your eyes and think about all the rights you have as a man. The right to work, the right to pursue an education, the right to start a business, the right to be active in your country\'s affairs. Those are the rights I\'m talking about. The rights that are the real core of who we are as human beings. It\'s important we continue to work to empower women to take responsibility for themselves and their futures with initiatives on everything from maternal health to micro-credit and entrepreneurship. I\'ll continue the work I started as First Lady and now as a Senator to end the buying and selling of girls and women into modern-day slavery. Now, I know this won\'t be easy. But I also know the power of America at our best, and I know the power of faith and of people of faith, when we heed Isaiah\'s call to lift up our voices like trumpets. The faith community lifted up its voice against slavery and helped lead America to end that evil. The faith community lifted its voice against discrimination here in America and against apartheid in South Africa and helped end both. The faith community lifted its voice for debt relief for the world\'s poorest countries, and gave many countries a fresh start in the jubilee year. Today the faith community is speaking out against genocide in Darfur. Taking on global warming and we can see from this room the awesome power to address the AIDS pandemic. Together I believe, we can write the next chapter in this history. It is a proud and grace-filled history. Thank you, thank you to Saddleback. Thanks to all of you for the work you are doing and for living your faith in such a visible way. And I appreciate the opportunity to add my voice to yours. Thank you all very much and God speed.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 3, 2007","b'Excerpt of Remarks in Clear Lake, Iowa'","b'Hillary Clinton delivered remarks in Clear Lake, IA today about her experience and vision for a new America. The following is an excerpt from her speech: ""A couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. They\'ve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I really would prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns. ""But I have to set the record straight. Because often what you don\'t know can be far more important than what you do know. The people of Iowa, I know, are good people who are trying very hard to make the right decision in this caucus. But people can only act on what they know. And I\'ve heard a lot of talk about turning the page, but what about the action to back it up? ""When it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes it\'s acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I don\'t think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. That\'s why my health care plan covers everyone ""When it comes to Social Security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I don\'t think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Social Security, I have always stood up against privatization, and as President, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep Social Security as a sacred promise to our seniors. ""When it comes to Iran, I took a stand for aggressive diplomacy. One of my opponents made a different choice: He didn\'t show up for the vote. He didn\'t speak out during a presidential debate that night. And finally, he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed - a vote for diplomacy - was really a vote for war. Well if he really thought it was a rush to war, why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote? ""Now, there\'s been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people don\'t know that for legislators who don\'t want to take a stand, there\'s a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but ""present"" - which is kind of like voting ""maybe."" Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted ""present,"" instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a woman\'s right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence - one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds. ""A President can\'t vote ""present."" A President can\'t pick and choose which challenges he or she will face. My opponent\'s campaign said that voting ""present"" was a strategy to provide political cover. The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass. Instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass, we need a President who will take a stand and stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country. ""Standing up for America\'s values and protecting our country and our people is the first job of the President. Bringing us together to end the war, fixing our economy, and taking on big challenges like immigration, health care, energy independence, climate change and so much else is what I will do. ""A President can\'t dodge the big fights, can\'t find political cover, or have words speak louder than actions. A lot of words we have these days aren\'t matched by action. And much of the actions I see, I simply disagree with. I have a very clear record on all of these issues. A record of 35 years of fighting for children and families, fighting for working people, fighting for our future  and as President, I will keep on fighting. But I\'m running on more than just my record and my experience. I am also running on my vision and agenda of a new beginning for America. ""We need a new beginning on health care. We need to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and provide health care for every single man, woman and child, at a price that people can afford and we\'re going to give them the help to do that.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 5, 2007",b'Remarks on Wall Street on Housing Crisis',"b'Thank you all very much. It is a real pleasure to be here and I appreciate those kind words. It\'s wonderful being back in the city - and to have a chance to come here again, I believe for the fourth time, and to have a chance to speak with you about an issue that is on the minds of everyone, whether I\'m here in New York or in New Hampshire, or in Iowa or any of the other places I\'ve been traveling to lately. It\'s a topic of conversation that has to be put at the top of our nation\'s agenda. Now we know that not far from here Wall Street is humming. The phones are ringing, the blackberries are buzzing. And people are making billions of transactions that raise capital for corporations and deliver value to shareholders every day. And what happens on Wall Street today - like every day - will ripple across the country and the world. I\'m proud to represent New York, to represent the financial capital of the world. I see a lot of people who I recognize in this audience that are integral to what happens in our markets, how we create wealth, how we provide a dynamic economy that will hold out the promise of a better life for so many of our fellow citizens, but indeed for people far flung from here. I do want to recognize Speaker Silver, Shelly Silver, thank you very much for being here with me. And we in New York, probably more than anyone anywhere, know how critically important is it for our economy and for the global economy, that Wall Street stay on the cutting edge of finance and remain what it always has been, the global finance capital of the world. But we know that the standard for any economic system is not just that it creates growth, but that it lifts up families across America who work hard and dream big every day. As we\'ve seen the home foreclosure crisis these past few years build, the ripples from Wall Street we know, can have a significant impact on families far away in Pahrump, Nevada, where I recently was and other places that might never give much of a thought to what goes on here, but whose daily lives will be impacted. As we\'ve seen with the home foreclosure crisis, too many American families are not sharing in the growth that is created and driven from this city. Now, productivity has risen 18 percent among American workers over the past six years, yet wages have stayed flat, and family incomes have fallen by nearly $1,000. There are five million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000. On top of stagnant wages, we\'ve seen a rise in economic anxiety. Students struggling with the skyrocketing cost of college, families burdened by health care costs, premiums have doubled in the last six years, and we see the increasing role that energy prices play in people\'s lives. Gas prices have doubled in the past seven years. Home heating costs continue to rise. In fact, the typical family is paying $2,000 more for energy this year than in 2000. That\'s like a $2,000 energy tax - more than 3 times what the typical family got under the Bush tax cuts. We\'ve seen people hit hard by a deepening housing crisis. Families who\'ve worked hard, thought they were doing the right thing. Who\'ve spent years scrimping and saving to buy a house, but their dream of homeownership has turned into a nightmare of escalating payments and threatening letters. In short, we\'ve seen too many middle class families struggling in an economy that is simply not working for them right now. An economy that, in recent months, has been the subject of increasingly worrisome headlines about weakening consumer confidence, about a declining dollar and ballooning national debt. Now these economic problems are certainly not all Wall Street\'s fault - not by a long shot. But the reality of our interconnected economy is that what happens on Wall Street impacts main streets across America. It happens sometimes within minutes, sometimes over the course of months or even years. If we\'re honest, we need to acknowledge that Wall Street has played a significant role in the current problems, and in particular in the housing crisis. A ""see no evil"" policy that financed irresponsible mortgage lending. A bond rating system riddled with conflicts of interest. A habit of issuing complex and opaque securities that even Wall Street itself doesn\'t seem to understand. I believe we need a new beginning in our economic policy - one that strengthens our middle class and ensures that prosperity is widely shared, and is based on an ethic of shared responsibility. A new beginning that makes Wall Street shoulder its responsibility for this crisis, and that gives homeowners the breathing room they need. One that makes the most well-off among us pay our fair share and gives the middle class the help it needs for education, health care, and retirement security. Our economy has been at risk by investment schemes aimed at making not just a few, but many extra dollars, and we need to start insisting on the right rules and transparency so this doesn\'t happen again. So I\'m here today to call on Wall Street to do its part - to help end the foreclosure crisis that is devastating middle class families and threatening the health of our economy. Wall Street needs to be part of a comprehensive solution that brings to the table all those responsible and calls on them to do their part. Wall Street helped create the foreclosure crisis, and Wall Street needs to help us solve it. Let\'s start with an honest, clear-eyed assessment of what went so terribly wrong. Over the past seven years, as incomes fell and wages stagnated, many families were lured into risky mortgages with rates that later jumped beyond what they could afford. Now, we can debate what was technically illegal; we can debate what should be defined as predatory. But there is no debate that what happened did not reflect the best of our financial system. It did not reflect prudence, transparency, or even an understanding that behind large bundles of securitized mortgages are real families who were led into bad situations by people who should have, and even did, know better. As a result, 1.8 million foreclosure notices have gone out this year, an increase of 74 percent from last year. And the worst may be yet to come. The rates on 2 million mortgages are set to escalate over the next two years. Meanwhile, there\'s been an unprecedented national decline in home values. Middle class families can\'t afford to refinance their loans, and it\'s gotten a lot harder to sell their homes. Many families are finding themselves trapped - stuck with mortgages they can\'t pay and expenses they can\'t meet. So they\'re facing wrenching choices: pay their medical bills - or pay their mortgage. Put off retirement - or lose their homes. And many people who worked s hard and did try to follow the rules are receiving that same grim letter in the mail that says ""get out now."" I met a woman in Derry, New Hampshire - a stay-at-home mom with three children - whose husband lost his good-paying job. He was in the computer industry. They kept making their loan payments for six months after he was laid off, but just at that time, their interest rate ballooned from about 8 percent to about 11 percent. They tried to file for bankruptcy, but the bank still foreclosed on their home. And even after her husband found a new, high-paying job within a year, they were unable to make their back payments. Basically the door was shut in their face. When I met her, it was literally the day before her family was being forced out of their home with nowhere to go. As the foreclosures mount, the housing crisis is also becoming a municipal crisis. Cities and towns face the prospect of blight, higher crime rates, vacant properties marring neighborhoods, cutting tax receipts, and dragging down property values. And I believe the housing crisis also threatens the economy as a whole. Even Americans who don\'t face foreclosures are feeling the impact. 60 percent of the total wealth of middle class families resides in their home equity. And home equity withdrawals accounted for more than 8 percent of families\' disposable income in 2005. So as housing prices decline, people have less money to draw on for everything else, from medical bills to car payments to college tuition. We know that consumers are the backbone of our economy that has been true from the beginning. It\'s been especially true in the last years. And right now consumers are hurting. I talked with CEOs of the some of our large discount retailers. They tell me that the amount of money being spent is down. The number of shopping days has decreased. People come in the beginning of the month when they actually get paid and in the middle of the month but otherwise they\'re much scarcer as consumers than they used to be. With the holidays quickly approaching, a lot of middle class families are feeling the pinch. And the global financial markets are also suffering. Risky loans have been packaged and sold around the world. Mortgage companies have collapsed. Financial firms have recorded losses in the tens of billions, and there\'s predictions for tens of billions more. Central banks have had to step in to keep the system running. And banks are reluctant to give out loans, so companies are finding it harder and harder to get the capital they need to grow and create new jobs even if they\'re not in the home industry. Now, who\'s exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that\'s always a question that the press and people ask and I think there\'s plenty of blame to go around. Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print. Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of. Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities. And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don\'t deserve our sympathy. But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn\'t have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not. Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, but Wall Street certainly had a hand in making it worse. We also must recognize, though, that good things have happened in the housing market. Home ownership is at the heart of the American Dream, and ownership rates rose to a record 69 percent in 2006. That means millions of new stakeholders in their communities. And the largest gains were among low-income and minority families. The challenge for us is to preserve the best of this system - which has allowed people to own their own homes - while getting rid of the abuses. And to do that, we need to look at this problem, as complex as it is, honestly. We also need a President who understands the complexity and magnitude of the challenges we face because obviously it\'s not only about the mortgage industry and the credit crunch, it\'s about our debt, about the declining dollar, about all the challenges we face in the global economy. I\'m confident we can navigate through this but we can\'t do so acting like ostriches or in a fit of denial. We have to be willing to roll up our sleeves and start doing what we do better than anybody in the world and that is solving problems. Earlier this week, I wrote to Treasury Secretary Paulson urging him to fashion an agreement with the mortgage industry and Wall Street that matches the scale of the problem. I\'m heartened that the Administration has heeded an earlier call of mine to convene a ""crisis conference"" of housing stakeholders - lenders, investors, mortgage servicers, regulators, representatives of homeowners, and others - to convert unworkable mortgages into stable loans that families can afford. This is a moment for shared responsibility in America. Investors, lenders, and homeowners all have a part to play and sacrifices to make. If the agreement is inadequate, or the talks fail outright, the cost to our economy will only increase. For this ""crisis conference"" to succeed, Wall Street must be on board. Wall Street has a responsibility for the past as well as an enormous stake in the future. So today, I\'m calling on investors who control the mortgages that need modifying to be part of the solution. You are at the end of a long chain of decision-making and responsibility. But without your cooperation, a voluntary solution can be of limited effectiveness. I urge Wall Street and the mortgage industry to voluntarily agree to the following three steps: First, we need a moratorium of at least 90 days on foreclosures of subprime, owner-occupied homes. The moratorium will stop foreclosures until lenders and servicers have contacted borrowers and frozen mortgage rates. It will also give financial counselors time to work with families. Second, we need to freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, with the freeze lasting at least five years until the mortgages have been converted into affordable, fixed-rate loans. A rate freeze is critical. An average of $30 billion in loans will reset each month next year, and the average reset will increase monthly payments by 30 to 40 percent. These rate resets are the major driver of the foreclosure costs. The long rate-freeze will give the housing market time to stabilize. It will give families an opportunity to rebuild equity in their homes. It will also give the mortgage industry the time - and incentive - to convert mortgages that were designed to fail into loans that actually can be repaid. Third, the mortgage industry must provide status reports on the number of mortgages it is modifying. Accountability is essential. Despite all the media coverage, despite all the hearings, despite the Secretary of the Treasury, despite all that has gone on in the last 30 to 60 days, the mortgage industry has only modified about 1 percent of at-risk mortgages this year. That\' is simply not enough. Now, I hope everyone will voluntarily agree to these steps, because we cannot fail at this. The costs are just too high. If we cannot reach a voluntary agreement, I will consider legislation to address the problem. Mortgage servicers can work with borrowers to modify their mortgages. In the process, they can save families their homes, save investors from losses down the road, and help the economy. But this is unchartered territory for them, and many are worried about opening themselves up to lawsuits from the investors who actually own the loans. I\'m prepared to consider giving legal protection to servicers and others who administer these loans and who do the right thing by balancing the interests of homeowners, the investors, and our economy. All of these proposals build on the work I\'ve done throughout this year to urge immediate action on problems regarding housing. I\'ve called on the mortgage industry to observe a ""foreclosure timeout."" I\'ve put forward a plan to crack down on unscrupulous mortgage brokers, to end lending abuses, and expand the financial counseling programs that have been shown to reduce defaults and foreclosures. I\'ve proposed that we allow the state housing finance agencies to issue tax-exempt bonds to help families refinance their mortgages. On Monday, the Bush Administration said it will give this idea a try, and I\'m pleased to hear that. But I wish they\'d done it when I proposed it two months - and more than 225,000 foreclosure notices ago. While we work to solve the immediate housing problem, I am also calling on the Administration, the regulators, and the mortgage industry to ensure that the abuses of recent years don\'t happen again. We need an industry-wide commitment to tightening underwriting standards and disclosure obligations. We need to vigorously enforce federal prohibitions against abusive lending practices. And we need to eliminate prepayment penalties. This has been one of the most heart breaking elements of this crisis. I did an event about this down in Orlando, Florida early last spring talking with a lot of homeowners who had gotten into sub-prime mortgages. They fit the profile - many were first time homeowners. One got in trouble because he thought he was doing the right thing. His family and everyone told him, ""Well as much money as you can save, pay off the loan as fast as possible."" So he began putting more and more money aside to begin paying over what his mortgage payment was only to find out he had triggered the prepayment penalties and found himself with an increasing interest rate that forced him into foreclosure. We obviously need to clean up the standards and make all of the disclosures much more understandable to everyone but we do need to prosecute mortgage servicing fraud and foreclosure rescue fraud to the fullest extent of the law. And we certainly need to expand financial counseling for homeowners and buyers. What I\'m proposing is a comprehensive ""work out"" - not a ""bail out"" - of our most pressing economic problem. And I do hope that many of you here and a lot of our leaders on Wall Street will join with me and others in helping to find these solutions. I was pleased that Mayor Bloomberg announced today a fund that will be a non-profit fund along the lines that I\'ve been advocating to help homeowners here in the city facing foreclosure. Because addressing this issue with the right leadership and a commitment to shared responsibility will solve the problem. But let\'s remember that addressing the housing crises is only one piece of what has to become a broader agenda for creating shared prosperity for Americans again. That\'s why I\'ve put forward a package of middle class tax cuts that will help restore the basic American bargain. If you work hard you can get ahead - with dignified work, a college education, affordable health care, child care, savings and wealth creation. We need to change our tax code to reward middle class families and by doing so, we can get money into the pockets of tens of millions of people who will spend it. I also will extend middle class tax cuts, including the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief. I want to give generous tax credits to help families afford health care. My plan called the American Health Choices plan includes health care tax credits so that individuals and small businesses will be able to afford health care through the congressional plan that I will open up to everyone. It\'s a really good plan. It\'s not government medicine, it is government-administered and Congress people love it. You get more than 250 choices at an average cost that is less than what you can find through your employer or in the market place. Unfortunately it is limited to federal employees. By increasing the pool dramatically we will lower costs and be able to deal with some of the other cost drivers in the health care system. I\'ll also offer up to $1,000 in matching tax cuts to help families save for retirement. We also have a savings crisis. We have the lowest rate of savings since 1929 and coincidentally we have the highest income inequality gap since 1929. That was not a good year for America. So I think we need to be smart about how we\'re going to move forward together. I want to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, increase the education tax cuts. It was interesting as I started traveling around the country last winter. I would be in small groups with my supporters and a lot of my wonderful donors, some of whom are here today, and I\'d go through my list of what I wanted to do as President and I would say I wanted to increase college affordability and people would nod and they would be in obvious agreement but if I said it in a gymnasium in front of 2,000 people in Concord, NH, they stood up and cheered and kicked the bleachers because it has become so expensive. We are shutting the door on college for a lot of worthy and motivated young people. I believe we should tie the minimum wage to Congressional salaries, so that Congress can\'t get a raise unless working men and women do too. We have to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax, and I give Congressman Rangel a lot of points for courage in trying to take this on because it will increase the tax rates on millions of New York taxpayers and millions of others throughout America just at a time when we need stimulus so we\'ve got to deal with the AMT. It\'s a stealth-tax that most people were never meant to pay. But, the growing concerns in our economy should prompt us to consider whether working families need more immediate assistance in the form of economic stimulus. Just like the housing crisis, the Administration has been asleep at the switch as overall economic conditions have worsened. We need a President who will wake up every morning focused on keeping our economy on track. And if we wake up to the current economic forecasts, a vigilant president should be talking about the right kind of stimulus today. And by right kind I mean broad based. We have, as my husband and I often say, certainly benefited over the last seven years of this administration as we\'ve seen the vast majority of Americans basically stall. So if we talk about stimulus lets talk about the right kind of stimulus. More and more economic forecasters and even just families across America worry we may face an economic set of issues that will stall growth even more, hit much harder on the income and the assets of people who are living in what I call the ""trap door economy"" right now - one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything. That\'s why I have called for up to $5 billion in immediate assistance to help communities and distressed homeowners weather this foreclosure crisis. If we can help stabilize the patient we\'ll have a lot better chance of getting all of us healthy again. I\'ve called for $2 billion in emergency energy assistance for families facing skyrocketing heating bills this winter. We need to be aggressive in getting this assistance out fast to working families and seniors so that they can spend it and protect themselves. These are initial steps and I believe we should be ready to take further steps if the situation deteriorates. We should do this in a way that makes economic common sense. In 2001, President Bush used stimulus as an excuse to force through long-term tax cuts for the most fortunate among us. The result was a weak stimulus that continued us on a path to higher deficits, ballooning debt, and increased borrowing from foreign governments. This time around, let\'s make sure we get it right. Let\'s make the stimulus temporary and not an excuse for long-term fiscal recklessness. Let\'s focus on hard-working families. Let\'s support them because they\'re the most likely to really provide what the economy desperately needs - a jumpstart. The Administration was asleep at the switch but we can\'t wait until we have a new President. We need to make sure we do everything we can to get this President and this Administration to take action. And we need then to have a President starting in January 2009 who is ready to change our policies and lead our country. That means anticipating economic problems that may arise in the future and taking action to ameliorate or eliminate them. It means calling together immediately those who are stakeholders and decision-makers. America is at its best when we work together. We haven\'t really been called to do that in the last seven years. Many of us in New York waited to be called for some kind of commitment, sacrifice, responsibility after we were so horrifically attacked on 9/11. The call never came. I think it was a missed opportunity of historic proportion. What we need always to be ready to do is to respond as Americans. We need to start acting as our best selves again. We need leadership who will summon us to do that. And I\'m calling particularly on those who are so able and so smart and so resourceful to help us find our way forward here. Don\'t wait for the Administration or Secretary Paulson to call. Call yourself. Make sure that you\'re part of this ongoing work-out. It\'s the right thing to do for the economy, but even more importantly it\'s the right thing to do for America. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 16, 2007","b'Remarks at the Every County Counts Kickoff in Council Bluffs, Iowa'","b'Thank you all so much. It is such an honor to be here, back in Council Bluffs, with all of you, especially with friends like Connie Gronstal and her daughter Kate and her husband Mike. Connie\'s a great leader of my campaign. Both she and Kate have been just devoted and working hard. I\'m sure they\'ve harassed a lot of you to be part of the team we\'re putting together. And I also am absolutely overwhelmed personally to have my friend of 25 years, Bob Kerrey, endorse me with such a vote of confidence. As Connie said, Bob has given a lifetime of service to our country. He has literally been on the front lines fighting and standing up and advocating for the values that we believe are really at the root of the American dream and this great country\'s journey toward progress. I also want to add, in addition to everything else that he has done, he served with great distinction on the 9/11 Commission. That was especially important to those of us in New York. He tried to get to the truth; he tried to hold people and institutions accountable. Bob and I have talked at length about what we need to do in America to make our country safe, to deter and defeat terrorism and to make our intelligence services as effective as possible. Bob Kerrey is the embodiment of patriotism in action. And it is a tremendous privilege for me to be here with him back across the river from Nebraska where he served with distinction as he sets forth the reasons for his support of my candidacy. He knows something about courage and leadership. He\'s got some experience in tough fights, so I am thrilled to have him on my team. Thank you so very much Bob. We are kicking off today our ""Every County Counts"" tour right here in Council Bluffs. Over the next five days, I and my friends and supporters will blanket Iowa. We\'re going to be in all 99 counties. We\'re going to be knocking on doors and making phone calls, visiting people\'s homes, their places of work, all with a very simple but urgent message - the road to the White House for the next president begins here in Iowa. Iowans have an awesome responsibility, especially this year. Because we have to make a decision that will not only help us figure out who will be the next democratic nominee, that\'s important, but even more so, who is ready to be President and who is ready, willing, and able on Day One to do the job that we need done. So I\'m excited about our 99-county blitz. I\'m actually even going to get in a helicopter after I leave you. We\'re calling it a ""Hill-a-copter,"" and we\'re going to be able to cover more ground that way. But I have friends of a lifetime who have come to Iowa to help me, including my best friend from elementary school with whom I am still very close, people I have worked with in Arkansas, New York, across the country, and I am thrilled to introduce them to Iowa and to have so many Iowans hear their stories about why they would take time from their busy lives to come here on my behalf. I was especially honored by the endorsement this morning of my candidacy by the Des Moines Register. It was an important event in this process. I am very grateful that they have zeroed in on the work that needs to be done by the next President, by my vision for our country, my plans for change, and my ability to lead. Now with Bob Kerrey\'s endorsement, with Congressman Leonard Boswell\'s endorsement of a few days ago, our campaign is energized, we\'re picking up momentum, and we\'re going all the way to January 3rd with your help. I can feel the excitement growing and it really spans all ages. I was talking to an Iowan on the phone as I was driving from the airport to come here and he told me that his daughter is turning 18 before the caucuses, they live in Des Moines, and she\'s going to caucus for me. Then I got a report that a 102-year old man is also going to caucus for me. We are appealing to every generation. And that\'s the way it should be because we need everybody in America committed to the changes that we have to make together. It is inspiring to me that people in their 90s and now in their second century will care enough about the future to say ""you know what, no matter how inconvenient it is, how difficult it might be, regardless of the weather, I want to be there to stand up for Hillary Clinton."" And young people whose whole lives are before them understanding what is at stake in this election. So I could not be more pumped up. I am thrilled at the vast and growing support we have across the state. But as Bob Kerrey said, we have to translate that into action on January 3rd. And I want to make to you a case for my candidacy because as I also am reaching out and meeting with as many people as possible, and traveling all those miles, I have to rely on all of you the way I rely on Connie and Kate to be my eyes, my ears, really to speak for me. And I hope that you will impress upon people what a critical election this is. And that I am asking for your support based on my 35 years of work, my understanding of the changes that we need, my commitment to apply the persistence, the perseverance, and yes, the perspiration to get it done. Because I understand very well what\'s happening in America today. I grew up in a middle class family outside of Chicago, right here in the Midwest. My father came home after serving in the Navy for five years and he wanted to do three things: he wanted to start a small business, he wanted to start a family, and he wanted to save enough money to buy a house. My mother, who didn\'t have a very easy upbringing, she wanted to give her children she never had a chance to do and that was to go to college. So we lived the middle class values. We understood, as my parents taught me, that we had to work hard, be self-reliant, be resilient, but also to be compassionate and caring. To be part of the larger community in order to give every American, particularly every child, a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. Well my 88-year old mother, God bless her, still lives with me. I brought her out on the campaign trail as some of you may have seen from the media and she had such a great time that she decided she might do a little more of that if she had enough rest in between stops. But as we traveled around, it was a great reminder to me of the commitment I feel to making sure that those who are in the twilight of their years and those who are at the very dawn of their lives, all have a chance to pursue that American dream that has meant so much to all of us. And so I run for president because I know that there are a lot of families in America today, certainly here in Iowa, whom I\'ve met. They\'ve been kind enough to share their stories and concerns with me, and their worries they feel anxious and insecure. They don\'t know whether life will be better for their children and their grandchildren. They ask themselves everyday: ""why is it no one seems to notice that I\'m working as hard as I can and I\'m not getting ahead? That I don\'t have health care for myself or my children; that my job has been outsourced and I don\'t know where I\'m supposed to go to get another one."" These are the real life concerns that Iowans have shared with me over the past eleven months. I want to tell you that there will not be any invisible Americans when I am President. Everyone will be seen, respected, heard. And just as I\'m saying that every county counts in my campaign, I want you to know that you\'ll be able to count on me when I am your president. I will get up every single day thinking about what I could do that day to make life a little easier, to make our country fairer, to restore shared prosperity and economic opportunity, to restore our moral authority around the world and to give Americans back our pride in our country that we love so very much. After seven years of George Bush, America is ready for change. We are ready for a new beginning. Now it all comes down to one question. Who is ready and able to make the changes we need starting on day one in the White House? Audience: You are. Well, some people believe you make change by demanding it. Some people believe you make change by hoping for it. I believe you make change by working hard for it. That\'s what I\'ve done all my life and that is what I will do for you. I know that\'s how you make real change in the lives of the real people that I know and care about, that I have fought for for 35 years. Now that hard work demands that you know when to stand your ground and when to find common ground. If you\'re too unyielding, you won\'t get anything done. Not in America; we\'re not a dictatorship. You have to work with other people. But if you don\'t stand up and refuse to compromise on what\'s important, then you could lose out the opportunity to make change. So you have to know how to balance it; how to stand your ground and how to find common ground. For 35 years I have been a change-maker and that is exactly what I hope to do for all of you and for every American. Now for me that means that I started when I got out of law school, not going to work for a big corporate law firm but going to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. And I did that because I watched and learned about my mother\'s life. The fact that she had to go to work as a mother\'s helper when she was 13 and it was hard. And I believe that kids should be given a better shot than that, and that a lot of kids draw the short straw in life. One of the first things I worked on was going door to door, trying to find out where missing children were. Missing not because somebody had kidnapped them but missing because they weren\'t in school. Back in the early 1970\'s you could look at census figures about the number of children who lived in a particular area. Then you could look at school enrollment figures and there were children who were in the area who weren\'t in school and nobody could figure out why. And I found out why. I found children who were blind, children who were deaf, children in wheelchairs, children with other kinds of disabilities. There was no place for them in a beautiful school like this. So I worked with many others to change the law, to make it possible for children with disabilities to get a public education and I was proud to be part of making change that helped millions and millions of Americans. In Arkansas I worked to expand rural health care into some of the poorest places in the state. I worked to reform schools so if you were a poor child living in a really poor area of Arkansas you often would go to a school that didn\'t have physics, it didn\'t have advanced mathematics, or chemistry, it didn\'t have foreign languages. So no matter how talented you were, no matter how hard working you were willing to be, you would never be able to compete for a first class education. So we changed that. We changed the standards. We improved education and independent observers said it was one of the best reforms in the country. Because, you see, I knew that to make change you had to work with people, to raise teacher\'s salaries and to expand the curriculum, so thousands of Arkansas students now have an education that was denied to previous generations and I am proud that I was part of making those changes as well. And as I continued to work, I chaired the Legal Services Corporation to make sure that equal justice under law wasn\'t some cruel hoax in America. That if you were poor and you had a legitimate legal problem, you would have somebody who would give you your day in court. And I was very pleased that I could, in 1993, work with a lot of very knowledgeable people to try to bring universal health care to our country. Now we were not successful but I am very proud we tried because it was the right thing to do and now we are going to get it done when I become president again. I traveled to Beijing as First Lady on behalf of all of you, to stand up for a very simple proposition - that women\'s rights are human rights and human rights are women\'s rights. It\'s not only what we believe, here in our country, it\'s what we know is important for our national security. Countries that deny women their rights are often countries that we have problems with, aren\'t they? So we\'ve got to continue to stand up for American values and make sure those values are heard around the world, and when I am president I will continue to make the changes on behalf of women that are good and right for women and smart for American security. I wrote a book called ""It Takes a Village,"" because that\'s what I believe, about how we can build a better country for our children. I was pleased to turn all of the proceeds from that book - over a million dollars - to children\'s charities. Because it\'s not only what we do in our government that counts, it\'s what we do in our daily lives. How we support charitable enterprises that are there with a helping hand for people that need it. And I want, as president, to inspire more philanthropy, to get more Americans involved in helping their neighbors. There\'s more than enough work to do, and we want to harness what is really the genius of our country - the willingness of our citizens to give of themselves. When we weren\'t successful with health care for everyone, I did not give up. I sometimes think you can tell more about a person when you see what they do after they don\'t succeed than if they have already succeeded. Because we want people who pull themselves up, don\'t we? Who get up after being knocked down and keep going. And that is what I did when I helped to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program and we have seen that program over the last 10 years expand health care to millions of kids and now George Bush has vetoed our efforts to expand it. Well, I\'ll tell you, when I become president, we\'re going to expand health care for every single American child. In the Senate, I have worked across the aisle to make change. When I was elected, the people of New York took a chance on me and it was a great honor that they did. But I knew that I had to go and get things done. I couldn\'t just say, \'we\'ll I\'ve been elected, thank you very much.\' That\'s not who I am that\'s not what I do. So I immediately went to work, expanding economic opportunities in our rural areas for our farmers in our small towns. Working across the aisle with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members who didn\'t have it. Working to make sure we had a national emergency system so that when you hit 911 on your cell phone, somebody would know where you were. Working to make sure that despite the differences we have in philosophy or ideology, that we cannot let partisanship stand in the way of improving the lives of the people in our country. I look forward to working with Republicans, as well as Democrats and Independents, to create a new beginning for America. That new beginning will once and for all give us universal health care. Everyday people come up to me with their problems. They tell me horror stories about insurance companies that reject their claims, about premiums going up so fast and high they can\'t possibly keep insurance for themselves and their families, about being without insurance, not able to afford the prescription drugs and the treatment that their doctors say are needed. I listen to so many of these stories and it just strengthens my resolve that we will put together a great coalition of business and labor, of doctors and nurses and health care professionals and together we will take on the health insurance companies and the drug companies. And we\'re going to be successful this time. The stories that I hear, the personal acquaintances and friends that I have convince me that nothing other than health care for everyone should be the standard. When I was working on my health care plan there were those who said ""but that\'s controversial, that\'s politically risky, why don\'t you just cut yourself a little slack here. It\'s not going to hurt to leave people out - that\'s a better political case to make."" I said ""who should I leave out? Who gets to choose who is left out?"" Should I leave out people like Dawn Carstens and her husband Greg from Webster City? They run their own auto body shop. They work really long hours every single day but they can\'t afford insurance. Should I tell them just to roll the dice? Should I leave out Ellen Duffy? A nurse I met in Waterloo diagnosed with breast cancer. Her treatments made her so sick she couldn\'t possibly continue to work and when she finally recovered and tried to go back to work the hospital told her she no longer had a job, she lost her health insurance. Who should I leave out? I don\'t want to leave anybody out. I am not running for president to put band-aids on this problem. I am running for president to solve it. And I need your help to make that case. We\'ll make a new beginning for our seniors. We\'re going to provide retirement security for working Americans. We\'re going to provide long-term care. I will go after those insurance companies that swindle seniors out of their money, sometimes out of their life savings. I will go after those nursing homes that abuse our seniors. We\'re going to have more home health aid, we\'re going to have more dignified and respectable alternatives. I want to provide a $3,000 tax credit for caregivers who do the hard work of caring for not only aging family members but children with disabilities. This is a labor of love. It\'s one of the most important jobs any of us will ever do and I don\'t think people should be penalized for it. I was in Winterset two weeks or so ago and there was a man there and a woman in a wheelchair and the man was standing behind her with his hands on the back of the wheelchair. Occasionally he would reach over and give her a drink, occasionally wipe her mouth. And I called on him when question time came. He told me that he and his wife had been married for 50 years, that she\'s had Parkinson\'s for 29 years and it got increasingly more difficult to care for her, he tried to get long-term care insurance, nobody would help him with his wife. All he\'s looking for is a little bit of help. He wants to take care of her, they\'ve been together a really long time. But it\'s going to be hard if he doesn\'t get help at all. When I\'m president we\'re going to provide help to loving family members like him and so many others who are doing the right thing. We\'re also going to get a new beginning on energy independence and combating global warming. This is a security issue. We cannot continue to be dependent on foreign oil. This is the most important environmental issue. Aren\'t you proud of Al Gore getting the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming? Well, we need to translate that incredible commitment that he and many others have made to action. So I have a plan to do that, to move toward homegrown energy just like we\'re doing here in Iowa with biofuels and wind, promote more energy efficiency. I want to applaud the Democratic Congress. We\'ve raised gas mileage standards for the first time in decades. So there\'s enough work for us to do to protect our planet, to protect our economy and to protect our security. And you know what the good news is? If we do this we\'ll create millions of new good jobs right here in Iowa and across our country. We\'ll make a new beginning for our economy. We\'re going to rebuild our great American middle class. We\'re going to support our unions. We\'re going to give people the right to organize and bargain collectively. We\'re going to give tax cuts to the people who need them, not the people who don\'t. And we\'re going to change our tax codes so we don\'t give incentives to those who outsource jobs and we\'re finally going to move toward trade agreements that do have labor and environmental standards so it\'s not a race to the bottom but a real move of lift to the top. We\'re going to move back to fiscal responsibility, something that Bob Kerrey when he was Senator had an instrumental role in making possible. And look at what has happened. Under this president, all of that hard work has been squandered. Well we\'re going to get back to reclaiming our future by stopping the mortgaging of our country and having us borrow billions and billions of dollars from countries like China and Mexico and every place in between. And we\'ll make a new beginning on education. We\'re going to provide early childhood education, something that Connie has worked on her entire professional life. We need to build stronger families. We need to have more early intervention. We need to help parents know what they need to do in order to help their own children. This is something I have worked on for decades. I brought a program to Arkansas, the Home Instruction for Preschool Youngsters program, that gave parents the tools they needed to help their own children. Because that\'s the best way for us to really make a difference in a child\'s life. And then we\'ll have a universal pre-kindergarten program that reaches those kids particularly who are disadvantaged to give them even more help and support. And we\'re going to end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind. And I have pledged to make college affordable again for every young person who goes and is motivated. We\'re not going to forget those young people who don\'t go to college. How about more job training? More apprenticeship programs? Let\'s give them the kind of help that they deserve to have for a good job and a good future. We\'ll make a new beginning in reforming our government. I\'m going to end the cronyism and the no-bid contracts for Halliburton. We\'re going to end the kind of war on science that the Bush Administration has waged. It\'s time we start actually investing in science again. So how about lifting the ban on stem cell research? And how about making America the innovation nation again? We can create so much if we have a partnership between levels of government and the public and the private system. And I have the idea I\'ve been promoting all across Iowa. How about appointing qualified people to the government again after the Bush Administration? Finally we will make a new beginning to restore America\'s leadership in the world. It will start with ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we can. And when I am president, there will be a very simple message that goes out across the world - the era of cowboy diplomacy is over. We\'re going to start working with people again. But I can\'t do any of this without you. I\'m going to work as hard as I can to earn your support and your trust. And I need every one who is ready for change to go to the caucuses on January 3rd. If you can\'t afford health care, you\'re tired of paying through the roof for your gas every time you try to fill up your car or your truck, you\'re tired of seeing the economy tilt more and more toward the already wealthy and privileged - if you think it is time to make sure we have no invisible Americans, then I need you to stand up and caucus for me. If you can\'t bear to see our young men and women, our sons and our daughters, continuing to fight another country\'s civil war, if you believe that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home - but you want to be sure it\'s done the right way - then I need you to stand and caucus for me. If you want to get our country back into the solutions business, if you believe our future can be better than our present or our past, if you want to feel that pride again in America, then I need you to go stand up and caucus for me. Because if you will go and do that on January 3rd, I promise you I will stand and wage a winning campaign for our values and our principles and then when I am elected, I will stand and fight for each and every one of you every single day. Let\'s make history together. Thank you all very, very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 17, 2007","b'Remarks at the The Hillary I Know Event in Johnston, Iowa'","b""Thank you so much. I think the best thing for me to do is just say thank you very much. I am very grateful to so many of you for coming out this morning and being part of this event here in Johnston. It is very exciting for me to have so many of my friends from my entire life who have come out here to talk with Iowans, to answer questions, to give you some insight and information about our relationships, about what I've been trying to do for my entire life and particularly as an adult. There are so many people who feel invisible right now. They feel like nobody is listening. They don't have health care for themselves and their families and they don't know what they are going to do. Or they have just been told their job is going to be moved overseas and they are not quite sure how they are going to keep going. Or they are counting pennies at the table trying to make sure that they can pay to fill the tank in their car or their truck. I think it's one of the most important jobs of a president, of anybody in public life because it is such a public trust, to really listen and to reach out and to learn and to work as hard as you can to make a difference. To try to help people who are doing the best they can, but sometimes life has a way of hitting you upside the head. I was listening to my friends talk and I was thinking about each one of them. Bonnie Campbell, who's been a leader here in Iowa and did just wonderful work for our country when she was in the Justice Department during my husband's presidency. I think about her with her husband Ed, and how devoted she is to him and how caring she is in making sure that he is always taken care of and included. That kind of sums up the way we all live. We are not all the same in every setting we find ourselves, are we? When you're with your family, you're going to be a little bit different than when you're at work. When you're at work, you're going to be a little bit different than when you're at the mall. That all adds up to the people we are. Every time I think of Bonnie Campbell, I think about the work she's done for those who will never know her name and all she's done for people who are very close and personal to her. I'm very proud that she's my friend. Jeff Volk is someone who came into my life because of what happened to his family down in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. I was grateful that we were able to give him some help, some advice, some information when he was, as any person would be, worried about his family. When I met him he started out by saying 'I'm a conservative Republican.' I said 'well, that's ok, my dad was a conservative Republican. But he evolved.' I have gotten to know Jeff and his family and I am so grateful for his support. It means a lot to me to have someone who knows we've got to cross party lines. That what's most important is that instead of acting like Democrats or Republicans, we start acting like Americans again and roll up our sleeves and solve our problems together. [Applause] I so appreciate Shannon coming all this way because she has a very demanding life and her wonderful daughter is getting such love and attention from a mom who adores her, who does everything she can for her. I've met a lot of moms like Shannon over many years, who don't know where to turn. I've met a lot of dads who can't figure out how they are supposed to take care of the person they love the most, a child who's been stricken with an illness maybe they've never heard of, or had an accident, and now needs so much care. These are people that I think every one of us can relate to, whether anything tragic and bad has happened to us personally, we know people who have faced the same dilemma that Shannon and her family faced. I believe I have a great honor and a privilege to be in public office. What I try to do everyday is figure out how to help somebody. You can't always pass the laws you want to pass right away. You can't snap your fingers and get people to cooperate. You have to work on that every minute of every day. But you can try to help somebody every single day. I have tried to do that as a public servant, as an activist, and now as a Senator and that's what I will do as president. Because I want to help those people like Shannon and so many others who deserve our help. My friend Besty, whom I met in 6th grade - in Mrs. King's class - has been with me through thick and thin, that's not just a reflection on how we look today. About the good times and the not so good times, we both have to do better on the other part. In junior high and high school, I wore really thick glasses, which I really hated. There was always some boy or another that I was hoping would notice me, so I used to take them off and that meant I did not know where I was going. Betsy would arrange to meet me so that we could walk down the hallway together so I would not bump into a locker, but also so she could say, 'Don is on the right.' I could say, 'Hi, Don,' like I actually did see him. She's been guiding me around ever since. I'm so pleased she could be here. She and her family are very important to mine. Each one of us could tell stories like this, about the people who you know and the people who know you. Here in Iowa, I want you to have some flavor of who I am outside of the television cameras - when all of the cameras and the lights disappear, what I do when nobody's listening or taking notes, and recording it. Because it is hard when you're in public life to have that kind of sharing experience with thousands and millions of people.On our 99-county blitz, which we started yesterday, I'm going to get to as many places as I can, but so are my friends. And people whom I've worked with, and for, over a lifetime. I think this election is one of the most important that we've ever had. There's a big responsibility facing Iowans because you get to make the first choice. Not just the country, but the world will be watching. We all know that we need new leadership. But it's not just changing who lives in the White House, it's having a president who is ready to lead to make the changes that all of us know are necessary. I've been making change my entire life. For 35 years as an adult, I've worked to try to help kids with disabilities get into public schools back in the early 70s when I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. I worked in Arkansas to expand health care and education, and I have friends from Arkansas who are here today who have been dear friends to me. I know what a difference it makes when people are really committed to trying to expand opportunity beyond where it is to what it can be. I was privileged to spend those eight years in the White House as part of the team around my husband, and to work on expanding health care to every American - quality, affordable health care. That's a hard job. Lots of people have tried - Harry Truman, even Richard Nixon - because it's the right thing to do and it's the smart decision for us to make as a nation. But we weren't successful that first time. But I think you actually learn more about people when they may not be successful than if they just slope through life. I had a choice: I could have said 'ok, we didn't do it, I'm not trying anymore.' Or, what I decided to do was to say 'ok, we didn't do it, let's regroup and see what we can get done.' That's why I worked to make sure that all our children were immunized, and that drug companies were required to test drugs before they gave them to children. Then I went to work to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program and now 6 million children have health care who wouldn't have had it otherwise.We're trying to overcome the President's vetoes of giving health care to even more children. In the Senate I have worked across party lines and I have done that in order to get work done that would help people. Betsy was kidding about the way I immerse myself in all of the issues affecting New Yorkers including dairy farmers, our fruit and vegetable farmers, and so many else. For me it is about getting up every day and working as hard as you can so that when we found out the National Guard and Reserves didn't have health care, I teamed up with a Republican Senator, Lindsay Graham of South Carolina. Over the opposition of the Pentagon and the opposition of the White House, we passed health care for Guard and Reserve members, like so many who have left here from Iowa. When we saw that our young men and women were coming back from Iraq with something that was being called Traumatic Brain Injury and realized that nobody was paying attention, I went to work. I wrote and helped to pass the first legislation that addressed the Traumatic Brain Injury problem. When we started hearing about how families - when they had an injured son or daughter coming back from war, they couldn't take enough time off from work without losing their job to be there by the side of their son or daughter - I teamed up with Chris Dodd and Republicans and we passed an extension of the Family Leave Act so if you're son or your daughter is injured, you don't have to worry about losing your job. You are protected. You can be there during that most important period. These are real problems that real Americans face. There's nothing abstract about it. It's what I hear about every single day. Everybody talks about change in this election. People have different ideas about how to bring about change. Some people believe you can get change by demanding it. Some people believe you can get change by hoping for it. I believe the way you get change is by working hard for it. Persistence, perseverance, even some perspiration - that is how you change lives, you change institutions. That is what I have done my whole life. That is what I will do as your president. Because I intend to give America a new beginning. The whole world will breathe a sigh of relief when George Bush leaves the White House. [Applause] And then we do have to get to work, don't we? We need a new beginning in health care. I have proposed a plan, the American Health Choices Plan that will provide quality affordable health care for everyone. And here's how it will work. If you have health insurance and you're happy with it, nothing changes. But if you don't have health insurance or if the health insurance you have doesn't cover what's called a preexisting condition; you're a diabetic and it won't cover your diabetes. You have a heart condition and it won't cover your heart condition. So it's really not insuring you for what you need most. It's too expensive. You will be able to have new choices. I want to open up the Congressional plan to every American. It's a good plan. Over 250 choices, private insurance company choices that you can decide how best suits you at an average cost below what you can get through an employer or in the private marketplace. Every federal employee has access to this plan and you pay for it because you pay the bulk of it, because it is paid for out of tax dollars  about 75% of it. I figure if it's good enough for members of Congress, it's good enough for every American to have those same choices at the same affordable cost. We're going to help people who have a little trouble affording it with health care tax credits. We're going to emphasize prevention because we're now not paying for prevention and therefore we pay more when somebody gets really sick. We're going to emphasize chronic care management, we're going to take better care of people who are chronically ill. We're going to have electronic medical records, something I worked on with Newt Gingrich and Bill Frist which raised some eyebrows in Washington. I believe we can move toward a health care system that covers everyone, that decreases costs for everyone, and improves quality for everyone. When I was finalizing my health care plan, there were a lot of people who said to me, 'you know trying to cover everybody is controversial. It's going to engender all of the usual talking points from the other side. So you really shouldn't start being so ambitious. I asked people, 'in other words, you want me to leave out millions of people from my health care plan?' Well ok, who do we leave out? Do we leave out Shannon's daughter, Isabella? People say that she has a deteriorating condition  maybe we just leave her out of health care. Do we leave out the young couple I met in Webster City who own an auto body shop? They can't afford insurance for themselves and their kid. They're working as hard as they can. Maybe we should just leave them out and hope they stay healthy. Or maybe I should leave the nurse out from Waterloo I met, who was diagnosed with breast cancer. The treatment made her really sick. She couldn't go to work. By the time she got back to work, she found out she didn't have a job anymore. When she lost her job, she lost her health care. Maybe we should leave her out. I don't want to leave anybody out. I am not running for president to put band-aids on our problems. I want to solve our problems, once and for all and I want to start by setting forth a plan that will do that. [Applause] Maybe we can get a new beginning in energy and global warming. This is an area that we have to act on. We cannot continue to be held hostage to those who produce oil. They've got us over a barrel, the oil barrel. That barrel is now about $100 a barrel. It was $20 when George Bush became President. Now we are spending more and more money sending it to countries that often turn around and use that money against us. I think we can do a lot better. I have proposed a comprehensive energy plan that will be good for our security, that will be good for our environment because we do have to deal with the greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere, and that will be good for our economy. I believe if you just follow the example of Iowa, and what has been done here with bio-fuels and wind, we will create millions of new good jobs across America. These are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that will be done right here in Iowa and right here in our nation. That's the kind of energy future that I'm convinced we have. We should treat this like the Apollo moon shot. When I was a little girl, that lifted our sights and it also created a lot of jobs and a lot of spinoff. The Internet actually came out of research that was done on the space program. Who knows what we will invent if we get serious about energy and global warming. Let's unleash the innovative genius of America again. There isn't anything we can't do if we put our minds to it. [Applause] I want a new beginning in education. Education begins in the family and we've got to do more to help families get the tools and resources they need to take care of their own children. That's also work that I've done a very long time. Going back to my earliest years when through my church, I was involved in all kinds of activities affecting small children that had some difficulties, that had some disadvantages to overcome. I want to do more to help families. I want to have a universal pre-kindergarten program, again - like what you are doing here in Iowa to help every child, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds get better prepared. And I want to end the unfunded mandate of No Child Left Behind which has interfered with learning and teaching. [Applause] We have to start reimagining education. It's the 21st century. I go into classrooms across America. I was in a school in Iowa here about two weeks ago and there was a lot going on that was different and new and there were computers, but the classrooms looked pretty much the same as they looked when I was there with Betsy back in 6th grade. Let's start thinking about how we are going to tailor instruction more to meet individual children's needs because every child learns differently. I think we've got to do more to help give each child a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I want to be a president who will actually work with teachers, and work with others who care about improving education the right way. And then we've got to make college affordable for middle class and working families. Let's make it easier for those kids who want to go to school  I meet them all over Iowa  who say they don't know how they're going to afford it. They have to go into such deep debt. I want every young person who is willing to work hard to go to college to be able to afford to do that. I also don't want to forget that the majority of our kids will not go to college. Let's start taking care of the young men and women who do the hard work that keeps the economy going, who fight our wars, who take care of us, who protect us. [Applause] Education is still the passport to opportunity and we need to stamp that passport, 21st century, and start making it work again. We need a new beginning when it comes to reforming our government. No more no-bid contracts, and cronyism, and corruption, and incompetence, and insensitivity. Every one of us is a customer of the federal government. I sure don't think we've been getting very good customer service the last seven years. We can do so much better. What I want to do is make sure the government works for everybody, not just for the privileged and the connected. There is a lot of work to be done here, but we're going to start with a very simple proposition  how about electing qualified people for the jobs we ask them to hold in the United States government again; people who know what they're supposed to do, are committed to doing it, and can deliver results? We're going to have a new beginning to America's leadership in the world. We're going to start with ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we possibly can. We're going to do some other things as well. We're going to thank those young men and women who have served their country because they have done everything they were asked to do. [Applause] But there is no military solution. We should not permit them to continue to serve as referees of the Iraqi Civil War. It is up to the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country and when I am president, they will have to do just that. [Applause] When our troops come home, we have to take care of them. A lot will be needing health care. They have been injured and wounded. Some of it visible. They've lost arms and legs. They've been blinded. Some of it is not so visible. It's the traumatic brain injury. It's the post-traumatic stress disorder. A few months ago I was at Walter Reade visiting with soldiers who had come back from Iraq and Afghanistan and I met a very handsome young Army Captain, who had lost his right arm in Baghdad and lost the ring finger on his left hand when his wedding ring melted into his finger. I said, 'Captain, how are you doing? How's it coming for you?' He says, 'You know, I'm learning how to use the prosthetic. I'm figuring it out. They're really helpful. They're teaching me what to do.' And then he said, 'But where do I go to get my brain back?' Because those explosive devices, that kill and maim so many of our young men and women, also produce a concussive effect. A physical shaking of the brain. He said, 'I went to West Point. I never had anybody take care of me. Now my wife has to give me a list every morning of what I have to do, of what I do next, of what I do then.' So I worked to get legislation passed to begin to deal with these issues. I will pledge to you that I will be a president who takes care of our veterans. I think it is disgraceful that we have people waiting months for appointments. They can't get their disability claims processed. The president doesn't seem to either know or evidence any concern. When I'm president, veterans are going to get the highest priority treatment  and not just those who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, but all our veterans, particularly from my own generation who served in Vietnam, who never got the welcome and the help that they deserved to have. [Applause] We can have a new beginning in America. But I can't do any of this, and all of the other issues and concerns that I've talked about in my campaign, without your help. On January 3rd you have a big decision. I was thrilled and honored to get the endorsement of the Des Moines Register. They put us through our [inaudible]. [Applause] I have never seen a more grueling process. They not only interviewed 18 of us once, they interviewed 8 of us twice, plus they did research, plus they asked probing questions in other settings where they really were taking our measure. I was in Dunlap yesterday at a sale barn, a livestock salebarn. I've been in sale barns often, particularly in Arkansas. I was standing up where they show the cattle and I said 'I've never been in this position', but that's the way I felt. I thought ok, you want to look inside my mouth. Alright, have at it.' But at the end of that process they made the case for my candidacy. We have good people running. Everybody brings different experiences, qualifications, different ideas about what they want to do. But the Register said what I believe - that we don't have a minute to waste. We don't have a margin for error. We'll always make mistakes, we're human beings. But we've got to go for proven leadership, that's been tested, that is ready on Day One. I offer that to the people of Iowa for these caucuses. I hope you will decide to go and stand up for me in your caucus. I'm so excited by the growing energy and enthusiasm and people coming on board from across the state. One day I met a 17 year old who was just about to turn 18, who is going to caucus for me and I heard about a 102-year old man who is determined to go to the caucuses and has made his 81-year old son promise to take him. I'm asking you to stand up for me for one night and I will stand up for you throughout this campaign. Standing up for our values, our principles, for the kind of change we need to bring the country together just as I did in New York. Then I will stand up every single day in the White House. I will be thinking about you, and about your family, about your job, and your health care. I will be thinking about how to restore our leadership and our moral authority around the world. And together we will not only make history, but we will once again feel pride and progress in the country we love. Thank you all very much."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 3, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Iowa Caucuses',"b'Thank you so much. We\'re going to take this enthusiasm and go right to New Hampshire tonight. This is a great night for Democrats. We have seen an unprecedented turnout here in Iowa and that is good news because today we\'re sending a clear message - that we are going to have change and that change will be a Democratic president in the White House in 2009. I am so proud to have run with such exceptional candidates. I congratulate Senator Obama and Senator Edwards. I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Biden and Governor Richardson and Congressman Kucinich. Together we have presented the case for change and have made it absolutely clear that America needs a new beginning. I am as ready as I can be after having had this incredible experience here in Iowa, starting out a long time ago and making this journey with so many people who have become my friends and who I am so grateful for their hard work and support - those from Iowa, those who have come from around the country. And the people who were there exceeding anybody\'s expectations about what it would mean to have the caucuses this year, I thank you. I thank each and every one of you for coming out and standing up for a Democrat. What is most important now is that as we go on with this contest that we keep focused on the two big issues, that we answer correctly the questions that each of us has posed: How will we win in November 2008 by nominating a candidate who will be able to go the distance and who will be the best president on day one? I am ready for that contest. We have always planned to run a national campaign all the way through the early contests because I want the people of America, and particularly Democrats and like-minded Independents and Republicans who have seen the light to understand - number one - that the stakes are huge, that the job is enormous, but that I believe we\'re going to make the right decision. There will be a lot of people who will get involved as they have here in Iowa - of all ages. That is what we want because we\'re not just trying to elect a president, we\'re trying to change our country. That is what I am committed to doing. I have set big goals for our country. I want to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class and to me, that is the most important job the next president will have here at home, because if we don\'t begin to pay attention to the people who do the work and raise the families and make this country great, we will not recognize America in a few years. I want to make it absolutely clear I intend to restore America\'s leadership and our moral authority in the world and we\'re going to tackle all of the problems that are going to be inherited because of the current administration, including ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home and then giving them the support that they need. We\'re going to reform our government. We\'re going to make sure that it is not the government of the few, by the few, and for the few, but it actually works for every American again. And we\'re going to reclaim the future for our children. I have done this work for 35 years. It is the work of my lifetime. I have been involved in making it possible for young people to have a better education and for people of all ages to have health care and that transforming work is what we desperately need in our country again. I am so ready for the rest of this campaign and I am so ready to lead. If you\'re concerned about whether or not we can have quality affordable health care for every American, then I\'m your candidate. And if you\'re concerned about whether we can have an energy policy that will break the shackles of our dependence on foreign oil and set forth a new set of goals for us to meet together, then I\'m your candidate. And if you are worried about, once and for all, taking on global warming; making it clear that we will end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind; that we will make college affordable again; that we will be, once again, the country of values and ideals that we cherish so much, then please join me in this campaign. We have a long way to go but I am confident and optimistic, both about the campaign but maybe more importantly about our country. This country deserves everything we can give to it. There were a lot of people who couldn\'t caucus tonight despite the very large turnout. There are a lot of Iowans who are in the military. They were in Iraq or Afghanistan or somewhere else serving our country and they need a Commander in Chief who respects them and who understands that force should be only used as a last resort, not a first resort. There are a lot of people who work at night, people who are on their feet, people who are taking care of patients in a hospital or waiting on a table in a restaurant or maybe in a patrol car keeping our streets safe and they need a president who is going to care about them and their families. I wrote a book some years ago called ""It Takes a Village to Raise a Child"" and in it I have a chapter that I titled ""Every Child Needs a Champion."" I think that the American people need a president who is their champion and that is what I intend to be. I want to thank all the people who have been part of this campaign so far. I especially want to thank all of my friends here in Iowa who have worked so hard. I want to thank those who have come from across America. I want to thank all of the unions, the more than six million union members who support my candidacy. I know that we are going to get up tomorrow and keep pushing as hard as we can to get the message out about what is at stake in this election because we know that it is literally the future of our country. Thank you all so very much for caring enough to be involved in politics, for giving of your time and your resources, for understanding that this great democracy of ours deserves to have all of our best efforts and I promise you, this campaign that I am running will certainly have mine and I ask for yours as well. Thank you all very, very much. God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 4, 2008",b'Remarks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party 100 Club Dinner in Milford',"b'Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you so very much. New Hampshire, how are you tonight? Are you ready to pick a president? Are you ready for universal health care for every single man, woman and child? Are you ready for an economy that works again for every American, not just the few and the wealthy and the well-connected? Are you ready to stop the war in Iraq and bring our troops home and to take care of them when they come home? Well, if you are ready, then we have to pick a president starting this Tuesday who is committed to making the changes that America deserves. It is time for us, as Democrats, to make our voices heard across our country that we know our country can do better and we want to be part of the change that is waiting to happen. I am so happy to be here in New Hampshire, a place that I have come now for over 16 years. I have learned a lot in New Hampshire. I have learned the importance that you place on elections because you understand that it is not about those of us who are running. It is about you. It is about all of those who need a champion. Years ago I wrote a book called, ""It Takes a Village."" There are a lot of beautiful villages in New Hampshire. In it I had a chapter titled, ""Every Child Needs a Champion."" It is time for the American people to have a champion for a president again who looks after us, takes care of business here at home. I know that everybody wants change. Some people think you make change by demanding it. Some people think you make change by hoping for it. I think you make change by working really, really hard and bringing people together to create the change that we need. That is what I have been doing for more than 35 years. I intend to take all of that experience making positive change and put it to work for you. America needs a new beginning. We need to once again believe in ourselves, have pride in our country, make progress together. I know that we are up to the job. There are many reasons why history will judge George Bush harshly. Among the two are the way that he has used fear to divide us. He has governed by it and he has undermined that sense of accomplishment and progress that has been at the heart of the American dream. And the other reason is because we have been infected by a sense of fatalism. We can\'t solve our problems like fixing the economy and health care. Instead, we\'re told that we should not even try. Since when did America become the can\'t do nation? I do not believe that is who we are. I know that is not who New Hampshire is. Together, we are going to take back our birthright. We are going to have the confidence and optimism to start rolling up our sleeves and solving our problems again. That will begin with once again restoring and rebuilding the American middle class. It deserves a president who will finally deliver on health care, something I have committed myself to for many years now. Why? Because I cannot bear that there 47 million uninsured Americans and millions more who are denied health coverage even though they have insurance. I have proposed a plan I think is not only going to get the job done to cover every American, but is politically doable. It will bring together business, labor, doctors, nurses, hospitals. We will open up the congressional health plan. Congress has a good plan for itself. It is time that everybody had the same health care that Congress provides for itself and federal employees. We need to be sure this is comprehensive health care. We will cover mental health and end the stigma that is too often still associated with mental health treatment. There are some who say we can\'t cover everyone. It\'s too politically ambitious. It\'s controversial. They offer instead virtual health care. I believe we have to cover everyone and I am not going to leave anyone out. I would not know who to leave out. Would I leave out the woman whose son has had four heart surgeries already, and facing so many more years of poor health and challenge? Would I leave out the young couple from Manchester who have their own business who I met door knocking and are wondering if they will be able to afford health care for themselves and their children. I am not running for president to put band-aids on our problems. I am running for president to solve our problems, starting with health care. We need a new beginning when it comes to the economy. We are in troubled waters in the American economy. Today, it was announced that we\'ve had the worst three days to start any year since 1932. We had an unemployment figure which confirmed our fears that unemployment is rising. We need a president who will exercise the kind of economic stewardship that Americans deserves. We need an economy that is creating prosperity for everyone. We need jobs for those were willing to work hard and take responsibility. I will be a president who once again pays attention to the American middle class, not to the wealthy and the well-connected who have done extremely well for themselves under George W. Bush. We are going to create millions of new, good jobs starting with making energy our highest priority. Making it clear that we will no longer be dependent on foreign oil. We will enhance our security. We will deal with global warming and we will create millions of new good jobs that cannot be outsourced. If we do this, it will be the equivalent of the Apollo moon shot. This is up to this generation but you need a president who will lead and will clear away the special interest from the oil-companies to the oil-producing countries. And once again provide the kind of enthusiastic embrace of a problem America is equipped to solve. We need a new beginning when it comes to education starting with universal pre- kindergarten, ending the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind that has interfered with teaching and learning in our schools. Making college affordable and yes, paying more attention to the young people who don\'t go to college. Giving them the opportunities to pursue the American dream. We need to reform our government. It is time that we ended the cronyism and the no-bid contracts, that we said once and for all how about appointing qualified people for the positions we ask them to hold in the federal government again. We need a new beginning to restore our international leadership and our moral authority. It starts with ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home. I have said that as soon as I\'m inaugurated, I will have the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense, and my security advisers draw up the plans necessary to begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days. Because I know that the Bush Administration has not planned because they do not intend to withdraw. It is dangerous to withdraw troops. It is dangerous to take out our convoys with our men and women and our equipment down those same corridors that have been the subject of so many attacks, so many deaths, so many injuries. It\'s also important that we think about the civilians, American citizens, who are working for the embassy, working for companies, working for not-for-profit agencies. They have to come out, too. It would be dishonorable for us to turn our backs on those Iraqis who helped us -who were the translators and the drivers who put their own lives at risk in order to save the lives of Americans and Iraqis. I will make it clear to the Iraqi government that the blank check that George Bush gave them is no longer valid. They have to take responsibility for their own future. When we bring our troops home, let\'s take care of them. They have not been given the health care, the compensation, and the support that they so richly have earned. There is a lot of work to be done. It will start on January 20, 2009. When the next president walks into the Oval Office, all of these challenges will be waiting. But so will opportunities - opportunities to preserve our liberty and create new possibilities for Americans, particularly young Americans. And also to keep us moving towards a more perfect union. I know that the next president will embody the hopes and dreams of all of us. I also know that they cannot be false hopes. We have to pick a president who is ready on day one to do the job  the tough, difficult job that will await. There are two big questions for voters in New Hampshire. One is who will be the best president on day one? The second is who can we nominate who will go the distance against the Republicans? The Republicans are not going to give up the White House without a fight. Now they should. They should basically say ""we are ashamed of what we have done to our country for the last seven years."" But I don\'t think that is what we will hear from them. And I know, having been on the receiving end of all the incoming fire, that they train on Democrats  now for 16 years - that much to their dismay, I am still here. I am still standing. And I am still fighting for you. So here is what I will do for the next days. This election is about all of you here tonight and the thousands more who can\'t be here. When you go to vote on Tuesday, you are voting not only your own interests, your own needs, your own values. But the rest of America and the world will be watching as well. This election is not only about our country. It is about whether we can restore America\'s position, whether we can find common ground. I have been making change for 35 years. In the years in the Senate, I have found a lot of common ground with Republicans. Wherever we could, we have worked together to bring respite care to caregivers and health care to National Guard and Reserve members. But I also know how to stand my ground. I have stood against George Bush\'s Medicare prescription drug benefit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. I have stood against his proposal to privatize social security, something that will never happen as long as I have anything to say about it. I know that we\'ve got to bring people together to the divide that too often separates Americans. We also have to stand for Democratic principles. I am proud to be a Democrat. I am proud to be a member of the longest lasting political party in the world. I am proud of those who have been our standard bearers -- I am proud of the progress that we made during the 1990s under the last Democrat elected twice in the United States. I know that we can do this again. I am running for president because I love this country. Because it has given me so much and I believe it is my responsibility to give back. I know every single day, the people who are hoping and praying, that they once again have a president who worries about their lives, their children, their futures. I will be that president. I will be a president who gets up every day thinking about the people I have met in New Hampshire, rolling up my sleeves working to solve the problems that you, your friends, your families, your neighbors face. If you give me that chance to be your president, I know that together we will not only restore pride in America, restore our position around the world and rebuild the middle class, reform our government and reclaim the future for our children. And yes, together, we will make history. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 8, 2008",b'Remarks Following the New Hampshire Primary',"b""Thank you. Thank you so much. I come tonight with a very, very full heart. And I want especially to thank New Hampshire. Over the last week, I listened to you and in the process, I found my own voice. I felt like we all spoke from our hearts, and I am so gratified that you responded. Now, together, let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me. For all the ups and downs of this campaign, you helped remind everyone that politics isn't a game. This campaign is about people. It's about making a difference in your lives. It's about making sure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to live up to his or her God-given potential. That has been the work of my life. We are facing a moment of so many big challenges. We know we face challenges here at home, around the world, so many challenges for the people whose lives I've been privileged to be part of. I've met families in this state and all over our country who have lost their homes to foreclosures. Men and women who work day and night but can't pay the bills and hope they don't get sick because they can't afford health insurance. Young people who can't afford to go to college to pursue their dreams. Too many have been invisible for too long. Well, you are not invisible to me. The oil companies, the drug companies, the health insurance companies, the predatory student loan companies have had seven years of a president who stands up for them. It's time we had a president who stands up for all of you. I intend to be that president, to be a president who puts you first - your lives, your families, your children, your future. I believe deeply in America, in our can-do spirit, in our ability to meet any challenge and solve any problem. I believe in what we can do together. In the future, we will build together. There will be no more invisible Americans. So we're going to take what we've learned here in New Hampshire, and we're going to rally on and make our case. We are in it for the long run. And that is because we are in it for the American people. This victory will serve notice that people across our country know what's really at stake, that we will all be called upon to deliver on the promise of America. We'll be called upon to deliver on the promise that the middle class will grow and prosper again, to deliver on the promise the government will be of the people, by the people and for the people, not just the privileged few, to deliver on the promise that every generation will have their shot at the American dream, to deliver on the promise that we'll have the will and the wisdom to end the war in Iraq the right way, to deliver on the promise to take care of our brave veterans and restore America's standing, respect, and credibility around the world. We know that for the promise of America to be real, we are called upon to deliver on that promise. And if you join in this call to greatness, we will, together, answer. So tomorrow, we're going to get up, roll up our sleeves and keep going. I invite you to come join us at Hillaryclinton.com. We're going to tap into all of the spirit, the talent and just the plain grit of this great nation again. We are determined to tackle our toughest problems and stand up to those who most need a champion because we are determined to make America work again for all of our people. We came back tonight because you spoke loudly and clearly. You want this campaign to be about you because there is so much at stake for our country. I have so many people to thank. I want to thank the two most important people in my life, Bill and Chelsea. I want to thank them for their incredible commitment, their passion and their heart. I want to thank my entire family, particularly my mother, who is watching tonight. I want to thank the extraordinary team here in New Hampshire that never faltered one minute. That team had a great staff. It had volunteers and supporters from across the state and this country. I want to thank the young people across New Hampshire who came out. They asked the hard questions and they voted their hearts and their minds and I really appreciate it. Finally, I want to say how much I respect our Democratic candidates. Senators Dodd and Biden who were in the race earlier have given great service to our country. Governor Richardson, Congressman Kucinich, Senator Edwards and Senator Obama. They all have put themselves on the line day and night on behalf of this country we love so much. This campaign will transform America because we will take on the challenges. We will seize the opportunities. Every single day, I am not going out there on my own. I am going out there accompanied by millions and millions of people who believe, as I do, that this country is worth fighting for. Thank you, and God bless you!"""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 11, 2008",b'Remarks on an Economic Stimulus Plan',"b'Thank you, thank you so much. I am absolutely thrilled to be here. I say all the time that this election is about the future so thought I would come to where the future is actually happening - right here. I want to thank Marvin Krobke for not only welcoming us here but for getting me a few minutes with the people who are doing the training to create these new jobs of the future. I am so excited that what is happening here can be a model for what we must do around America. Thank you so much, Marvin. I want to thank my friends who are here with me. I appreciate very much the strong statement of endorsement from John Garamendi. He has been a friend, he and his wife Patti served not only California but America and I\'m grateful to him. I want also to thank the speaker - I\'m amazed at all the work that is being done in a bipartisan way here in California to set the future in motion on the environment and health care. Fabian Nuez, thank you so much. I appreciate so much my friend and sister, your congresswoman who has been a stalwart champion of all those who she represents and she understands that it\'s imperative that we have an economy that works for everyone; that we take care of people who get up everyday and do the very best they can. So Lucille, thank you. Thank you for your leadership, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard. And I was so grateful to have the mayor\'s help during times in the cold and the snow. Every time I saw him he was on fire, which he needed to be because he was shivering half the time. But he got out there and made the case for my candidacy, which is really a case for all of us. As the Mayor of Los Angeles, he needs a president who understands that we are going to work together and make sure that L.A. remains a great, great city. So I came here today - HRC: Thank you, thank you thank you! I came here today to continue to talk about what I want to do as your president. To me, running for office is not about the people who are running. Now, that\'s what you see, don\'t you? You see that on TV, you see it on the papers, you see it on the internet, you hear it on the radio. But always remember that every election is about you. It\'s about your families, your futures. It\'s about your jobs, your health care, your children\'s education. It is about your sons and daughters who serve our country far away from home. It is about the American people and I am going to give this election back to you here in California and across our country. I have always, in thirty-five years of working on behalf of children, women, families, workers, I\'ve always listened because I think you can actually learn a few things if you do. To hear the voices that I have heard during this campaign makes me both humble and more determined and optimistic about what we can do together. I was in Las Vegas yesterday going door to door and I met wonderful, hard-working families. I also met construction workers who had been laid off. I met workers who have lost their health care. I met families who asked me how they were ever going to afford to pay their children\'s college tuition. I hear all of the voices of America. One particular question that I hear a lot about today is what is happening with the economy? Where are we? This economy may be working for some people, but it sure isn\'t working for everybody. Part of what we\'ve got to decide is whether we are just going to allow this economy to flip into recession. The economists can argue about it - you can see them on TV. Some say, ""Yes, it\'s going there."" Some say, ""Not yet."" Some say, ""Oh no."" The statistics are one thing. The stories are something altogether different. If you\'ve lost your job because construction has slowed down, you don\'t care what the economists are talking about, do you? What you care about is who is going to help me? I get up everyday and I try to work and there is not work there. If you\'ve lost your health care because the insurance company refuses to pay for the problem you and your family have, or they won\'t even give it to you in the first place or your employer no longer provides it, it doesn\'t matter what somebody in Washington is talking about. What matters is what you are going to do to take care of yourself and your family. If you are looking for a job and everywhere you go, you are told that those jobs are no longer plentiful in California or America because they\'ve all been shipped over seas, it doesn\'t matter what you are told, it\'s what you feel. It\'s how you feel deep down that maybe the American dream is not going to be there for you and your family. Every one of us who was just on that stage is a product of that American Dream. Every one of us worked our way into the positions we are, nobody handed us the silver platter. Some of us broke some barriers to get there. We know something about working hard and we know something about what it means to reward that hard work. The way America has always worked is that if you\'re wiling to work hard and take responsibility, you will get ahead. You will make progress. Your children will have more and better opportunities than you have had. You can look back at your parents and your grandparents and know what pride they must feel because of the progress that you and America have made together. That is why I am running for president, because I want to make sure the purpose of America, which is that progress and that pride continues for that little girl there and every other single child in America. Long before you heard folks talking about maybe we\'re sliding into a recession, I saw it and I felt it. I represent a lot of hardworking people across the country in New York. And they began to say, ""wait a minute, it\'s like nobody even sees us any more."" We have a president, we have a government that just doesn\'t seem to understand what\'s going on in the lives of people of this country. ""It\'s almost like we\'re invisible,"" people told me. That is not the America that I grew up in, that is not the America that I want to be there for our future. So there will be no invisible Americans when I am president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For me, politics isn\'t a game, it is serious business about our future. It is about helping everyone get the tools they need to make the most of their own god give potential. It\'s about your voices, your dreams, your future. And so when I see a problem, I know that America\'s up to meeting it. If we have leaders who understand we have to pull together. We\'ve got to be united, we\'ve got to try to bring people together in order to address the big challenges we face in America. There\'s nothing America can\'t do if we make up our minds to do it together. That is the common purpose of America and that will be the purpose of my presidency: to listen to you, to be your voice in the White House, and to deliver results for you and your families, every single day. So here\'s what we have to decide. We have an economy that despite the happy talk from the White House and the Republicans is not working for most Americans. You know that. The average American family lost a thousand dollars in income over the last 7 years. Health care premiums have doubled. Energy costs have gone up $2000 since George Bush became president. I know sometimes people try to act like facts don\'t matter. You know, facts kind of get in the way of filling rhetoric or political combat. Facts are stubborn and facts actually reflect the reality of what is going on in people\'s lives. And you think about all the talk from president bush about tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts. I\'ll tell you what, if you\'re wealthy and well-connected, that talk turns into action. But if you are a middle class, working family, whatever tax cut you got from George Bush, your energy cost went up three times more. So we\'re not going to make progress on a lot of these tough issues until we realize that we\'ve got to get the two oil men out of the White House and begin to change direction. Now I have laid out a long term strategy about how we\'re going to stabilize and grow the economy. I want to get back to where we see millions of new, good jobs created in America. I know we can do that. But I don\'t think we can wait until January 20th of next year. Too many people will be hurt. Too many jobs will be lost. Too many homes will be foreclosed on. Too many more people will go without health care. We cannot wait. That is why I am calling on the president and the congress to work together to come up with some quick action to be able to present the slide toward recession. Unlike President Bush\'s 2001 plan which focused on tax cuts in the wealthiest of Americans, my plan focus on middle class and hardworking families who deserve the relief and need the help right now. Now here\'s what I would do tomorrow if I could. First, I\'m proposing a thirty billion dollar fund to help hard-hit communities and distressed home owners whether the foreclosure crisis. Right here, right here in California, you have 95,000 homes in foreclosure right now. Yesterday, Nevada, Nevada has the highest rate of home foreclosures in America. I sat down at a restaurant in Vegas talking to people who have already lost their homes. What happens in Vegas when it comes to foreclosure, can\'t stay in Vegas. We\'ve got to talk about it across our country. This fund would give states and communities, it would give the mayor, it would give the speaker, it would give the lieutenant governor, it would give you resources to provide at risk families with desperately need services like financial counseling and legal assistance and help refinancing these unworkable, unaffordable loans and states and communities could also use these funds to offset the costs associated with rising foreclosures. Everything from maintaining vacant properties to service like community policing. Because sometimes people have talked about his mortgage crisis in a very narrow way. Certain people are at risk of losing their homes or already have without seeing the broad implication of this. If you have home foreclosures in a neighborhood, you are likely in this housing market, to have vacant properties. When you have vacant properties you attract people that you don\'t want to be near your kids. You begin to have lower properties tax revenues so services get cut back which makes the problem even worse. I want us to start understanding that on every problem we face in America, we\'re in it together. It\'s not us versus them, it is all of us together, we have to come up with solutions and I believe we can start by focusing on them. Second, I\'m calling for comprehensive action to end the housing crisis and keep it from dragging down the entire economy. Here\'s what I would do: Number one, I\'m calling for a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures. No foreclosures for three months. So if the bank is about to foreclose on your home, you\'ll have some breathing room to try to figure out how to restructure your mortgage. Because here\'s what\'s happening, starting last March I said, we\'ve had predatory lending practices, we\'ve had people who put homeowners into mortgages they couldn\'t afford because they got more money for having a higher interest rate mortgage, we have a lot of people who could pay a good interest rate on a mortgage who were pushed into the ajudstable rate mortgages and once they go up, they\'re beyond somebody\'s\' ability to pay for it. We have a lot of families who right now could stay in their homes and pay the mortgage they\'re paying but a lot of pressure is coming from the investors who bought all of these mortgages. Because you understand it\'s not your local bank, its not the fellow who sold it to you who\'s now holding the mortgage, it\'s somebody sitting in Shanghai or in Dubai or Berlin or in London or somewhere else in the world and what they\'re saying is ""ok I\'m supposed to get an interest rate return up here and if you stop me from getting that then I\'m not getting the return on my investment."" That\'s why last month I went to Wall Street, I represent Wall Street and I\'m proud to do that because there are a lot of things that come out of there that raise wealth and give people opportunity but on this issue Wall Street is complicitous with the banks and the mortgage brokers and the lenders and everybody who took advantage of Americans in this mortgage crisis. So if we can get a moratorium then we can get people to come in and say look why would you take somebody\'s home away because then you\'ve got a vacant property you\'re probably not going to be able to sell - they\'re paying $700 now you want to jump it up to $1,500 you know they can\'t pay that. Do you want some kind of return on your investment or you want a foreclosure with nothing ahead? Then I want to say, look, we have to freeze interest rates for five years. Let\'s just say we\'re not going to raise the interest rates on our mortgages. We want to convert these unaffordable mortgages into loans that families can afford. So if you have an adjustable rate mortgage that is about to skyrocket, you\'ll have the chance to stay in your home and pay affordable payments. Now we\'re going to have to end the abusive practices that got us to where we are. And let me just mention one because it is the one that I get the most upset about and I heard about it yesterday talking to homeowners in Nevada. A lot of people who were first time homeowners or who moved from a very small home with a growing family to a larger one, signed these mortgage papers - I got to tell you, I skimmed my mortgage papers, I didn\'t read them. I didn\'t know what was all that fine print and those pages and pages of legalese and most people who signed on the dotted line relied on what they were told. A lot of people who were these first time homeowners, they wanted to do the right thing. They talked to their friends and their families, people said, ""You\'ve got a house now, if you can pay it off you\'ll own it free and clear sooner."" In addition to the interest payment people started putting a little bit more in the check, because they thought they were doing the right thing. What they did not know is that there is a provision in a lot of these mortgages for prepayment penalties. In other words, you tried to do the right thing in your mind and you got hammered with an automatic increase in interest rates because the investors didn\'t want you to pay it off any sooner, they wanted to penalize you from trying. There are a lot of people out there who are being punished for doing what we would have thought was the right thing. Now, next, we\'ve got to invest in emergency energy assistance for families with skyrocketing heating bills this winter. Today, nearly 40 million families across America are eligible for this assistance - but only about 16% receive it. A lot of parents and the mayor and I met a lot of people in New Hampshire and in Iowa in the snow, in the below zero chill factor, who were saying us ""how am I going to afford to pay my utility bills, I can\'t go without the heat how am I going to afford to pay it? Well maybe I won\'t take my prescription drugs. Maybe I\'ll postpone the mortgage payment and hope that I can catch up with it later."" So we\'ve got to do more to get that assistance directly to people. And that\'s why I would provide an additional $25 billion in emergency assistance - enough to cover every single person who needs it so we can do the right thing. Fourth, I would extend and expand unemployment insurance, including doubling the number of weeks people are eligible for assistance. Because if you\'re out of work and you\'re struggling to find a job, you deserve a little extra help because if the economy is sliding into recession, there might not be a job there for you so what are you and your family supposed to live on and besides if you get that money in your pocket you\'ll spend it and that will give the economy an immediate boost which will help us from going deeper into economic troubles Finally, I told you what I would do to try to solve the problems. Here\'s what I would do to seize the opportunity. It has everything to do with what the IBEW is doing along with NECA because this is exactly where I would put money. I would take immediate steps to jump-start ""green collar"" job growth all across America. Sometimes when I talk about this I get blank stares to be honest. I really do because people can\'t know it if they haven\'t seen it. They know about white collar jobs they know about blue collar jobs but the idea of green collar jobs is something that folks are just beginning to appreciate. I teamed up with one of my fellow Senators a few months ago and we passed legislation to put federal dollars into training people for green collar jobs what I want to do is accelerate that money to come to places like here to train more people. These renewable energy jobs are high wage jobs that cannot be outsourced. This is what we ought to be investing in with federal dollars right now. Number one, I would immediately implement a Green Building Fund to rebuild and renovate public buildings like schools, like municipal buildings, like law enforcement buildings, to make them more energy efficient. We know how to do this and I would do it immediately. I would issue an executive order saying there will not be any new federal buildings built or any one of the 500,000 that we have now renovated unless they become energy efficient and move toward carbon neutrality. This would create tens of thousands, eventually hundreds of thousands and millions of new good jobs. People would be put to work installing those solar panels on display here and other countries are head of us. But that doesn\'t mean anything because we can catch up in a hurry if we put our minds to it. But you\'ve got to know. Take Germany; Germany decided to invest dollars in new energy particularly solar. Last time I looked, I don\'t think the climate in Germany is as good as it is here in California but they have put nearly 300,000 people to work in a much smaller economy installing solar panels, making the displays, doing what is necessary to actually move practically and quickly toward renewable energy. I would also pursue a crash weatherization plan to help people insulate their homes you can save up to 20% on your energy bills if you start today. And that is obviously heating in the cold and cooling in the hot. You can save 20% but a lot of people don\'t know how to do that, they don\'t understand it. Again here are jobs going into insulate homes, making sure that you have thicker glass, looking for ways to deliver on that 20% savings. I would begin to ask the utilities to in vest in conservation. It is in their long-term interest but more importantly it is in America\'s long-term interest that we start saving on energy. Here I have to applaud California because back in the 1970\'s, which some of us can remember, a lot of us waited in line for gas for a long time. Right, Marvin, right? I remember getting my little, crummy car in line at 5 a.m., spending an hour or two having somebody from the gas station walk down the cars and say, ""We\'ve run out of gas, why don\'t you try the station down the road?"" When that happened it should have been the biggest wake-up call in American history. We saw some changes; I give credit to President Jimmy Carter. He said, ""We\'ve got to do better. We\'ve got to conserve more; we\'ve got to be more energy efficient."" You know what happened. The price of oil fell and so everybody said, ""Thank goodness we don\'t have to do any of that stuff."" And we got lulled into a false sense of security. But not California; California took a hard look at gas mileage and began to make some changes, took a hard look at electricity usage and today, on average, a Californian uses 50% less electricity than anybody anywhere else in America. California has led the way, made a difference. And I am strongly supportive of what the state is trying to do to begin to regulate tailpipe emissions. It\'s been a big fight with the EPA and the Bush administration but California can be the leader again. I would also do more to offer tax credits sooner rather than later for consumers who make energy efficient purchases - from upgrading your appliances, to buying hybrid vehicles, to installing new windows in your home. We all know that this is not only the right thing to do, this is smart. It\'ll save you money. I just recently was briefed about a new plug-in electric car that runs on a new battery by an American car maker - because that\'s my goal; to have these cars made right here in America. And after test driving it for six months, they got 15,000 miles on ten gallons of gas. Because think about this: If Henry Ford were to come back today and go out in the parking lot here and ask a couple of the IBEW members to let him look at your car, he\'d be amazed at the size and the power, he\'d be amazed at the GPS - the fact that somebody would talk to you and tell you where to go, that would be astonishing, that\'s science fiction - and then he would lift up the hood, and what would he see? The internal combustion engine. It really hasn\'t changed that much since the Model T. We need to have a Strategic Energy Fund that is looking at how we have new technology like what you are doing right here, with everything from our vehicles to our homes to our businesses to our utilities and make it a comprehensive plan. If the economy continues to worsen, if all of what I just proposed were put into place as an immediate jumpstart to get economic action going, to get consumers spending again, then I think we should look at providing an additional $40 billion in tax rebates to working and middle class families - not to the wealthy, they have more than gotten their share of our tax dollars. This relief would follow the same principles as the other initiatives I\'ve outlined today. It would provide immediate, short-term help, targeted to those in most in need and it would be fiscally responsible. Now, will this be easy? No, it isn\'t easy, but I think if it were easy some other country would do it. We\'re the people who are supposed to do what is hard. We\'re the innovation nation. We\'re the folks who roll up our sleeves and get to work together. Years from now I hope that our children and grandchildren will look back at this election and say, ""Wow, thank goodness. This is when America came back and we came back strong."" Right now we\'re in a big hole; we\'ve got to dig ourselves out. I want to pass out shovels to everybody, because I don\'t think it\'s in America\'s interest to borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. I am going to do everything I can to make sure that we solve our problems. Elections are not just about speeches, they\'re not just about all the cameras showing up. They are about what happens when a leader has to finally make some tough decisions. We\'ve got challenges around the world - ending the war and dealing with all of the problems we are going to inherit from President Bush. We have economic challenges, health care challenges here at home. I am listening. I have always listened. I want to be your voice in the White House. That is America\'s common purpose. Let\'s make history together. Thank you all very, very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 13, 2008","b'Interview with Tim Russert on NBC News\' ""Meet the Press""'","b'RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.CLINTON: Thanks, Tim. Good to be with you.RUSSERT: When we arrived in South Carolina yesterday this was The State newspaper, and the headlines agree to this. And let me share it with you and our viewers: ""Clinton Camp Hits Obama, Attacks \'painful\' for black voters. Many in state offended by criticism of Obama,"" and ""remarks about"" Martin Luther ""King."" Bob Herbert, in The New York Times, columnist, weighed in this way: ""I could also sense how hard the Clinton camp was working to undermine Senator Obama\'s main theme, that a campaign based on hope and healing could unify rather than further polarize the country. So there was the former president chastising the press for the way it was covering the Obama campaign and saying of Mr. Obama\'s effort, \'The whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\'ve ever seen.\' And there was Mrs. Clinton telling the country we don\'t need \'false hopes,\' and taking cheap shots at, of all people, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We\'ve already seen Clinton surrogates trying to implant the false idea that Mr. Obama might be a Muslim, and perhaps a drug dealer to boot.""What is this all about?CLINTON: Well, beats me, because there\'s not one shred of truth in what you\'ve just read. And I regret that, because obviously a lot of people have been, you know, given information or an impression that is absolutely false.First, with respect to Dr. King, you know, Tim, I was 14 years old when I heard Dr. King speak in person. He is one of the people that I admire most in the world, and the point that I was responding to from Senator Obama himself in a number of speeches he was making is his comparison of himself to President Kennedy and Dr. King. And there is no doubt that the inspiration offered by all three of them is essential. It is critical to who we are as a nation, what we believe in, the dreams and aspirations that we all have. But I also said that, you know, Dr. King didn\'t just give speeches. He marched, he organized, he protested, he was gassed, he was beaten, he was jailed. He understood that he had to move the political process and bring in those who were in political power, and he campaigned for political leaders, including Lyndon Johnson, because he wanted somebody in the White House who would act on what he had devoted his life to achieving.So I think it\'s important to set the record straight. Clearly, we know from media reports that the Obama campaign is deliberately distorting this. And, you know, I think we should just take a step out here for a minute. This is the most exciting election we\'ve had in such a long time because you have an African American, an extraordinary man, a person of tremendous talents and abilities, running to become our president. You have a woman running to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. I don\'t think either of us want to inject race or gender in this campaign. We are running as individuals, we are making our cases to the American people, and it\'s imperative that we get the record and the facts straight because people are entitled to have that information. But I have no intention of either, you know, doing something that would move this race in a wrong way, or, frankly, sit standing by when I think tactics are being employed that are not in the best interests of our country.And let me address the point that Bill was making. Because, again, I think it\'s been unfairly and inaccurately characterized. What he was talking about was very directly about the story of Senator Obama\'s campaign, being premised on a speech he gave in 2002. And that was to his credit. He gave a speech opposing the war in Iraq. He gave a very impassioned speech against it and consistently said that he was against the war, he would vote against the funding for the war. By 2003, that speech was off his Web site. By 2004, he was saying that he didn\'t really disagree with the way George Bush was conducting the war. And by 2005, \'6 and \'7, he was voting for $300 billion in funding for the war. The story of his campaign is really the story of that speech and his opposition to Iraq. I think it is fair to ask questions about, ""Well, what did you do after the speech was over?"" And when he became a senator, he didn\'t go to the floor of the Senate to condemn the war in Iraq for 18 months. He didn\'t introduce legislation against the war in Iraq. He voted against timelines and deadlines initially.So I think it\'s important that we get the contrasts and the comparisons out. I think that\'s fair game. You know, I think that we don\'t want anyone, any of our supporters, anyone--and that\'s why in my campaign, any time anybody has said anything that I thought was out of bounds, they\'re gone, you know? I have gotten rid of them, I have said that is not appropriate in this campaign. You know, when Senator Obama\'s chief strategist accuses me of playing a role in Benazir Bhutto\'s assassination, there\'s silence. So let\'s have one standard. This is an exciting and historic campaign. One of us is going to make history, which is thrilling to me. I\'ve worked all my life on behalf of civil rights and women\'s rights and human rights, and so I want a good, vigorous campaign about the differences between us and our various qualifications and experiences to be the president that America needs.RUSSERT: It just isn\'t at Senator Obama who is taking offense. This is exactly what President Clinton said in Dartmouth. Here\'s the tape.(Videotape, Hanover, New Hampshire, Monday):PRES. BILL CLINTON: Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\'ve ever seen.(End videotape)RUSSERT: Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina, who\'s neutral...CLINTON: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: ...said this, ""To call that dream a fairy tale, which Bill Clinton seemed to be doing, could very well be insulting to some of us.""CLINTON: Tim, let me--let me just stop you right there.RUSSERT: But, no...CLINTON: No, wait a minute.RUSSERT: No, I didn\'t stop you. Let me just go through...CLINTON: No, but you did not give the entire quote and so...RUSSERT: No, but you...CLINTON: The entire quote was clearly about the position on Iraq.RUSSERT: But I\'m...CLINTON: It was not about the entire candidacy. It was not about the extraordinary, you know, abilities.RUSSERT: But Congressman--but Congressman Clyburn has been covering this race. Donna Brazile, herself a longtime activist in the Democratic Party, this is what she said. Here\'s Donna Brazile.(Videotape, Tuesday):MS. DONNA BRAZILE: As an African American, I find his words and his tone to be very depressing.(End videotape)RUSSERT: So these are people who are not supporters of Obama, who are listening. Let me just go to the Martin Luther King thing because you had your opportunity to talk about this at the beginning of the show and I want to lay this out for our viewers. This is how The New York Times categorized it. ""In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Mrs. Clinton ... tried to make a point about presidential leadership. \'Dr. King\'s dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of \'64.\' Mrs. Clinton said in trying to make the case that her experience should mean to voters than the uplifting words of Mr. Obama. \'It took a president to get it done.\'"" Again, Congressman Clyburn, ""We have to be very, very careful about how we speak about that era in American politics. ... That bothered me a great deal.""A writer in the Washington Post today, a black woman said it\'s as if you are minimizing ""I Have a Dream."" That you\'re saying it\'s a nice sentiment, but it took a white president to get blacks to the mountaintop.CLINTON: Well, you know, I...RUSSERT: That\'s her take.CLINTON: I understand the taking out of context and the mischaracterization. I\'ve spoken with Congressman Clyburn. I have spoken with a number of my very strong and adamant supporters, but Tim, I can\'t let you get away with that mischaracterization and those snippets. I was responding to a speech that Senator Obama gave in New Hampshire where he did compare himself to President Kennedy and to Dr. King. You know, President Kennedy served in the Congress for 14 years, he was a war hero. He\'d been engaged in many of the battles that led to his election in the 1960 election. Dr. King had been on the front lines. He had been leading a movement. But Dr. King understood, which is why he made it very clear, that there has to be a coming to terms of our country politically in order to make the changes that would last for generations beyond the iconic, extraordinary speeches that he gave. That\'s why he campaigned for Lyndon Johnson in 1964. That\'s why he was there when those great pieces of legislation were passed. Does he deserve the lion\'s share of the credit for moving our country and moving our political process? Yes, he does. But he also had partners who were in the political system.And I think it is such an unfair and unwarranted attempt to, you know, misinterpret and mischaracterize what I\'ve said. Look at what I\'ve done my entire life. I have been working on behalf of civil rights, women\'s rights, human rights for years and I know how challenging it is to change our political system and I have the highest regard for those who have put themselves on the line. You know, Congressman Clyburn was part of that movement. So many of the people whom I admire in my country who have given of themselves to make these changes went into politics in order to realize the changes, worked to elect people in order to make the changes.You know, this is, you know, an unfortunate story line that the Obama campaign has pushed very successfully. They\'ve been putting out talking points, they\'ve been making this, they\'ve been telling people in a very selective way what the facts are. And I\'m glad to have the opportunity to set the facts straight.RUSSERT: In Newsweek, you gave an interview to Jon Meacham, and you talked about the personal narrative that candidates develop. You seem to compare Barack Obama to, you say, demagogues like Huey Long.CLINTON: Oh, that is so untrue and unfair. Look, if you are running for president based primarily on a speech you gave in 2002 and speeches you have given since, most notably at the Democratic Convention, then I think it is fair to say we need to know more beyond the words. You know, if you are part of American political history, you know that the speeches are essential to frame an issue, to inspire and lift up people. But when the cameras are gone and when the lights are out, what happens next? How do you translate your words into deeds?And I think, you know, starting in New Hampshire it became clear that one of the significant contrasts in this campaign is between talking and doing, between rhetoric and reality. And I have the greatest regard for rhetoric and particularly the ability that Senator Obama has to, you know, lift our sights and our hearts with his oratory. But I think it is fair to point out that he has not had a record of actually producing positive change. Translating those words into action is something that is the, you know, the slow, hard, boring of hard boards in politics, and I think that people, you know, deserve to ask themselves questions about that contrast.RUSSERT: You use the terms in Newsweek you\'d be a work horse, and suggested he\'s a show horse. Isn\'t that a bit patronizing?CLINTON: No. There\'s a wonderful phrase in Senate lexicon whether senators are show horses or work horses. And what I was saying is that when I arrived in the Senate in 2001, a lot of people thought I\'d be a show horse, you know, somebody who frankly was on your show all the time, Tim, somebody who was doing the press conferences all the time. But I said to my colleagues the very first day that we went into session, I intend to be a work horse, because I think it\'s important the results you deliver for people. That...RUSSERT: Is Senator Obama a work horse or a show horse?CLINTON: I was talking about myself. I believe I am a work horse. I believe that that is what our country needs right now. We need a president who will, you know, roll up our sleeves collectively as a nation and tackle the problems that we confront. And that\'s what I\'ve been doing. You know, here in South Carolina, 68,000 children have healthcare because of the Children\'s Health Insurance Plan that I helped to create 10 years ago.RUSSERT: In New Hampshire, now, the famous scene in Portsmouth where you showed some emotion, was that exhaustion, frustration? What was it?CLINTON: No. It was actually, Tim, a moment of real emotional connection. Those of us who are running for office and holding office, I know it may be hard to believe, we\'re also human beings. And when I spend my time out on the campaign trail, it\'s usually about what I can do for somebody else. You know, I\'m very other directed. I don\'t like talking about myself, I don\'t like, you know, sort of the, the whole atmosphere of how people, you know, are judged in American politics too often as to, you know, what you say instead of what you do. And so for me it\'s always about what can I do for you? How can I help you? And I was very touched when that woman said, ""Well, how are you doing? How do you get up in the morning?"" Because really, the question is for so many of the people that I meet, how does anybody get up in the morning?I just went door-to-door in Las Vegas. I met construction workers who\'ve lost their jobs, I met a man who\'s been laid off from the casinos because the economy is beginning to go down. I meet people who can\'t get healthcare for their families, people who are just distressed over, you know, what is happening in our country. So when somebody asks me, ""How do you get up?"" it really triggered in me, you know, the feeling that, you know, that\'s what I, I want us all to think about each other. How do we get up? How do we, you know, pull on our shoes, go out and deal with the problems America faces. That\'s what I intend to do as president.RUSSERT: The woman who asked the question said the next day that she wound up voting for Barack Obama.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: Because after your emotional moment, she said that, ""You stiffened up and took on a political posture again,"" and said that some, ""Some of us are right, some of us are wrong, some of us are ready and some of us are not."" Do you believe that Barack Obama is ready to be president?CLINTON: Look, this is up to the voters of our country to determine. But I want them to have accurate information about our respective records, what we\'ve accomplished, the working that each of us have done when given a chance to serve. And I think it is relevant. I mean, we face huge problems at home and around the world. Nobody can diminish those. And the next president is going to walk into that Oval Office on day one having to end the war in Iraq, having to deal with what\'s happening in Afghanistan, the Middle East and across the world, dealing with our tough problems from the economy going south to 47 million people uninsured. And I think we\'re going to need a president who has really prepared and thought about what to do on that very first day. That is...RUSSERT: But is...CLINTON: You know, that is my case to...RUSSERT: But is Barack Obama ready to be president?CLINTON: That is up for voters to decide, Tim. You know, you can ask that question of him, voters can ask that question, but that\'s what I want. I thought the campaign really started at the debate in New Hampshire. For the first time we really had a debate that compared and contrasted our records. When Senator Obama was asked, what is your major accomplishment in the Senate, he said it was passing ethics reform and getting legislators to be prohibited from having lunch with lobbyists. And then, you know, Charlie Gibson said, ""Well, wait a minute. You can have lunch if you\'re standing up, not if you\'re sitting down."" So if that\'s his main claim for legislative accomplishment, people deserve to know that. And finally, in New Hampshire, we had an atmosphere where tough questions were asked and answered. I answered hundreds and hundreds of questions, saw thousands and thousands of people, and I think that the results really speak to what people are hungry for. They want to get beyond, you know, just the coverage of the campaign, to really understand what motivates us, what we bring to this campaign, and what we will do as president.RUSSERT: If you don\'t think Senator Obama is ready to be president, then he wouldn\'t be ready for vice president.CLINTON: Well, you know, I\'m not--you\'re once again taking words I didn\'t say. I\'m asking people to compare and contrast our records. I believe that we need a president ready on day one. I\'m putting forth my qualifications, my experience, my 35 years of proven, tested leadership, sometimes, as you well know, you know, walking through the fires, being prepared to take on whatever the Republicans send our way. I want people to make an informed decision. Look, I trust voters. Voters decide on whatever basis they think is important to them. I just want them to have a full range of information to make that decision.RUSSERT: We had the event in New Hampshire, the so-called emotional event. When I did the debate with Rick Lazio, with you in Buffalo in 2000, Mr. Lazio walked over to your podium and asked you to sign a document that banned soft money, and people said that he had violated your space. One of your campaign advisers said he was menacing. After the Philadelphia debate, your campaign said that the men were piling on, which led some women, commentators, writers, to say this. Maureen Dowd:""If the gender game worked when Rick Lazio muscled into her space, why shouldn\'t it work when Obama and Edwards muster some mettle? If she could become a senator by playing the victim ... surely she can become president by playing the victim now.""Ruth Marcus, Washington Post: ""Hillary Clinton doesn\'t need to play the woman-as-victim card ... using gender this way is a setback.""CLINTON: Well, you know, I don\'t think that either of us should use gender. I don\'t think this campaign is about gender, and I sure hope it\'s not about race. It needs to be about the individuals. Each of us is running for the highest position, the most difficult job in the world. And, you know, I am, I think, very clearly someone who\'s gone through a tremendous amount of criticism, you know. That\'s fine. I\'m more than willing to shoulder that. I think voters and viewers can draw their own conclusions when they watch whatever it is that we are doing.And I believe that, you know, for me, this is about who is ready on day one. And much of what I\'ve gone through in my entire life is, I believe, preparation for being able to go into that Oval Office. Clearly, I bring the experiences of women. As a daughter, as a mother, as a wife, as a sister. That is who I am. Those experiences are part of me. And it is part of our American journey that we have moved through so much of what used to hold people back because of gender, because of race. Are we there yet? Is the journey over? I don\'t think so, and I don\'t think any fair person would say that.So we still have to overcome barriers and obstacles. And the very fact that Barack and I are in this campaign, each of us having won one of the first two contests, being prepared to take our case to the country, I think will do more to put to rest so many of these old shibboleths, and all of the, you know, kind of commentary and punditry. Just look at us as individuals. Take us as to who we are, analyze our records, compare and contrast us, and then let the American people make their own decision.RUSSERT: Let me turn to Iraq. You brought it up. President Bush had talked to General Petraeus the other day. General Petraeus is to report back to Congress in March. If General Petraeus says the surge is working, that reconciliation started in a big way yesterday when the Iraqi parliament said that former members of the Saddam government can participate in new government, don\'t pull 35,000 troops out now, keep them there for at least the remainder of the year, would you be open to that?CLINTON: No, and here\'s why, Tim. The surge was certainly explained and rationalized as giving the Iraqi government space and time to make the hard decisions that they needed to make. 2007 was the deadliest year for American troops, and, you know, from my perspective, part of the reason that the Iraqis are doing anything is because they see this election happening and they know they don\'t have much time, that the blank check that George Bush gave them is about to be torn up. I have said that as soon as I become president, I will ask the Joint Chiefs, secretary of defense, my security advisers to give me a plan to begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.The reason I have to do that is because last spring, I asked for a briefing on what the planning was. Secretary of defense and the Department of Defense basically said ""We\'re not going to tell you."" And I said, ""Well, yes you are."" We had such a briefing. It was classified. I can\'t talk about it, but the bottom line is it was cursory. I don\'t think that the Bush White House wants there to be much planning. So starting on day one of my presidency, we will begin that planning. We will begin to withdraw our troops within 60 days. I think we can take out one to two brigades a month. At the same time, I will put increasing pressure on the Iraqi government. I will engage in a full diplomatic effort to work with the countries in the region and others who have an interest in the stability of Iraq.But Tim, I think that the large part of the reason that we\'re seeing the Iraqi government do anything is because time is running out. And yes, I believe President Bush will give them the rest of this year no matter what we try to do, and we don\'t have the votes to reverse course. But as of January 20, 2009, we will begin to bring our troops out of Iraq. Therefore, I certainly believe it\'s in the interests of the Iraqi government and the people of Iraq that a lot of this reconciliation that I\'ve been calling for going back four or five years start and actually get implemented now.RUSSERT: If General Petraeus says, ""Senator, in September you called the surge the suspension of belief. It has worked, and you know it\'s worked""--let me finish--""you can see on the ground. I\'m saying to you, Senator, or president-elect Clinton, don\'t destroy Iraq. It\'s working, the surge is working. Keep troops there just a few more months to get this reconciliation complete.""CLINTON: Tim, I\'m going to go back to what the whole point of the surge was, and the testimony that we heard last fall. The point of the surge was to push the Iraqi government to make these tough choices. Now, if we put in 30,000 of our finest young men and women, who are going to go after the bad guys and quell violence in certain parts of Iraq, there\'s no doubt that can be done. The partnerships that have been created by the tribal sheiks in Anbar province and elsewhere gave us an extra advantage. But that doesn\'t in any way undermine the basic reality. The point of the surge was to quickly move the Iraqi government and Iraqi people. That is only now beginning to happen, and I believe in large measure because the Iraqi government, they watch us, they listen to us. I know very well that they follow everything that I say. And my commitment to begin withdrawing our troops in January of 2009 is a big factor, as it is with Senator Obama, Senator Edwards, those of us on the Democratic side. It is a big factor in pushing the Iraqi government to finally do what they should have been doing all along.RUSSERT: Let me bring you back to October 10 of 2002, when the Senate had to vote on the authorization to go to war. This was Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate.(Videotape, October 10, 2002):CLINTON: So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein, this is your last chance. Disarm or be disarmed.(End videotape)RUSSERT: Casting your vote for conviction for the authorization for use of military force against Iraq resolution. That same week Senator Obama gave a speech, and this is what he said: ""I know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors. ... I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. I know that"" ""invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale"" ""without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than the best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda. I am not opposed to all wars. I\'m opposed to dumb wars.""Who had the better judgment at that time?CLINTON: Well, Tim, let\'s put this in context. You didn\'t show my entire speech--of course, you don\'t have time to do that--because I made it very clear that my vote was not a vote for preemptive war. I said that on the floor, I said it consistently after that. It was a vote to put inspectors back in to determine what threat Saddam Hussein did in fact pose. And in Senator Obama\'s recent book, he clearly says he thought that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, and that he still coveted nuclear weapons. His judgment was that, at the time in 2002, we didn\'t need to make any efforts. My belief was we did need to pin Saddam down, put inspectors in. But I said I was against preemptive war, I spoke out against it.But let\'s look at the--let\'s look at the...RUSSERT: But...CLINTON: Wait a minute, let me finish.RUSSERT: It\'s, it\'s import...CLINTON: Let\'s look at the entire context.RUSSERT: Well, let\'s just...CLINTON: Because by 2004, Tim, by the summer of 2004, Senator Obama said he wasn\'t sure how he would have voted. And when you asked him about that, he said, well, he didn\'t want to say something that could have hurt our nominees, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards. Well, the fact is he\'s always said he doesn\'t take positions for political reasons. That is a political explanation. If he was against the war in 2002, he should\'ve strongly spoke out in 2004. He should\'ve followed what he said in his speech, which was that he would not vote for funding in \'05, \'06 and \'07. That is inconsistent with what he is now running his campaign on. The story of his campaign is premised on that speech.RUSSERT: Viewers can read the transcript from November 11 when I did talk to Senator Obama about this. He also added that from his vantage point, the administration had not made the case, but let people read it and make up their own minds.I want to stay with your vote because that same day, Senator Levin offered an amendment, the Levin amendment, and this is how the New York Times reported it. ""The [Levin] amendment called ... for the U.N. to pass a new resolution explicitly approving the use of force against Iraq. It also required the president to return to Congress if his U.N. efforts failed."" ... Senator Levin said, ""Allow Congress to vote only after exhausting all options with the United States."" You did not participate in that vote. You voted against Carl Levin, who was saying give diplomacy a chance and yet you said no. You voted to authorize war. The resolution you voted for, Robert Byrd said was a blank check for George Bush. Ted Kennedy says it was a vote for war. James Carville and Paul Begala said anyone who says that vote wasn\'t a vote for war is bunk.CLINTON: Well, Tim, if I had a lot of paper in front of me, I could quote people who say something very differently, so I know you\'re very good at this and I respect it, but let\'s look at the context here. Number one, the Levin amendment, in my view, gave the Security Council of the United Nations a veto over American presidential power. I don\'t believe that is an appropriate policy for the United States, no matter who is our president.Number two, I have the greatest respect for Senator Levin. He is my chairman on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I--immediately after we did have the vote on the authorization, went to work with him to try to make sure that every piece of intelligence we had was given to the U.N. inspectors. And Senator Levin and I sent a letter to Secretary Powell, we pushed that position very hard because we both had the same view that we were going to put inspectors back in and we needed to let the inspectors do the job that they were asked to do.Number three, I actually joined with Senator Byrd on an amendment that would limit the president\'s authorization to one year. I was very strongly in favor of limiting what President Bush could do. Unfortunately, that amendment did not pass.Fourth, it is absolutely unfair to say that the vote as Chuck Hagel, who was one of the architects of the resolution, has said, was a vote for war. It was a vote to use the threat of force against Saddam Hussein, who never did anything without being made to do so.RUSSERT: The title of the act was The Authorization For Use of Military Force Against Iraq resolution.CLINTON: But, you know, Tim, that was exactly what would happen if we weren\'t successful with the diplomacy and if we weren\'t successful in persuading Hussein to do something. And let me just add here that when we were moving toward the preemptive war that George Bush decided to wage, the inspectors were in Iraq, we were getting information, finally, that would give us a basis for knowing. I believe if the inspectors had been allowed to do their work, we would\'ve learned that what Saddam Hussein had constructed was a charade. It could\'ve very well brought him down by his own people.Now, we can sit here and argue about 2002 or we can say what has happened since and what needs to happen going forward in the future. And I think that you have two different story lines here. You have Senator Obama\'s story line, the speech he gave in \'02, to his credit, which then was not followed up on. By \'03, it was off his Web site. By \'04, he was saying he didn\'t know he would vote and that he basically agreed with George Bush on the conduct of the war. There were others, Tim, who voted against it, spoke out against it and never wavered over that period of time.RUSSERT: But you voted for all the funding for the war.CLINTON: I did. I never--I\'m not premising my campaign on something different.RUSSERT: And then until \'06 was against the timetable.CLINTON: But I did what I--my principle concern has always been doing what I thought was best for our country and what I thought was best for our troops. I\'m not here saying anything different than that. I\'m not giving you a story line that does not hold up...RUSSERT: But did he have better...CLINTON: ...under the facts and the times we were in.RUSSERT: Did he have better judgment in October of 2002?CLINTON: You know, look, judgment is not a single snapshot. Judgment is what you do across the course of your life and your career.RUSSERT: A vote for war is a very important vote.CLINTON: Well, you know, Tim, we can have this Jesuitical argument about what exactly was meant. You know, when Chuck Hagel, who helped to draft the resolution, said it was not a vote for war, when I was told directly by the White House in response to my question, ""if you are given this authority, will you put the inspectors in and permit them to finish their job,"" I was told that\'s exactly what we intended to do. Now, I think it\'s important to take a look at the entire context here. If Senator Obama\'s going to get credit for his speech and his position against the war, then he deserves to be asked what happened in \'03, \'04, \'05, \'06 and \'07. I voted for the authorization...RUSSERT: I asked him those very questions...CLINTON: And his answer was very political.RUSSERT: ...in November.CLINTON: I mean, his whole point is that he doesn\'t make political decisions.RUSSERT: Let me, let me ask you this way. Doris Kearns Goodwin, presidential historian, I talked to her and she\'s been on MEET THE PRESS, talked about the qualities in a president. And she said one of the most important is that you learn from mistakes. Looking back on your vote in October of 2002, what can you learn from that mistake, the way you\'ll make decisions in the future?CLINTON: Well, I have said that obviously, I would never do again what George Bush did with that vote. He misused and abused the authority that was given to him, in my opinion. And we can\'t turn the clock back. I\'ve taken responsibility for it. It was a sincere vote at the time, based on my assessment of, number one, what the potential, you know, risks might be if left unchecked, given the problems that we were facing in the world with global terrorism, and the hope that we would get inspectors back in to figure out what had been going on since \'98. We hadn\'t had inspectors since \'98. I, I would not have given President Bush the authority if I knew he would deliberately misuse and abuse it. And as I said, I was told by the White House personally that the point of the authority was to send a very clear message to Saddam Hussein that he was going to have to be held accountable finally, that we would know once and for all what he had there that could be used as he had used it in the past.But you know, Tim, I think that it\'s only fair to look at the entire context, because, you know, I was against a preemptive war. I said at the time that would be a mistake. Obviously, President Bush doesn\'t listen to me or a lot of other people, and unfortunately, we\'re in the situation we are now, and we\'re going to have to have very careful and steady leadership to get us out with the least amount of damage.RUSSERT: Again, learning from mistake, do you wish you had read the National Intelligence Estimate, which had a lot of caveats from the State Department and the Energy Department as to whether or not Saddam Hussein really had a biological and chemical and active nuclear program?CLINTON: I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that. I was briefed by the people from, you know, the State Department, the CIA, the Department of Defense; all of the various players in that. And many people who read it--well, actually, not very many people read the whole thing because we were getting constant briefings. And people--some people read it and voted for the resolution, some people read it and voted against the resolution. I felt very well briefed. And it wasn\'t just what the Bush administration was telling us in the NIE, I went way outside of any kind of Bush administration sources; independent people, people from the Clinton administration, people in the British government. I looked as broadly as I could at how to assess this.And if, of course, you see the vote as I saw it as opposed as how it\'s been characterized, I thought it was a vote to put inspectors back in, to make it very clear that Saddam Hussein wouldn\'t be able to go off unchecked. If those inspectors had been permitted to do the job that they were set up to do, we would have avoided war. It became clear in retrospect, Tim, once people started writing books and information came out of the administration, the president had no intention of letting the inspectors do their job. That\'s not what I was told by the Bush White House. That\'s not what we were told in constant briefings from high-level Bush administration officials. That\'s not what the president told the country in his speech in Cincinnati shortly before the vote. If you remember, he said this vote was the best chance to avoid some kind of confrontation.RUSSERT: We\'re going to take a quick break. We\'ll be back in South Carolina with more of our conversation with Senator Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for president, right after this.(Announcements)RUSSERT: And we\'re back talking to Senator Hillary Clinton. In a few moments, the presidential primary: Iowa and New Hampshire are down. Next up, Nevada, South Carolina. We\'ll be right back.(Announcements)RUSSERT: And we are back in South Carolina. The Democratic primary here a week from Saturday. Our guest is Senator Hillary Clinton, the Democrat from New York, candidate for president.Experience is a big issue in this campaign...CLINTON: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: ...that your campaign has talked about extensively. I want to go back to a debate back in October of 1992, when a young governor from Arkansas was talking about experience. Let\'s listen.(Videotape, October 11, 1992):Pres. CLINTON: I believe experience counts, but it\'s not everything.We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant.And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.(End videotape)RUSSERT: That could\'ve been written by Barack Obama.CLINTON: Well, you know, by the time Bill ran in 1992, he was the senior most serving governor in our country. He had done a lot of work on the economic and trade issues that affected the state of Arkansas. And I do think that there\'s not a contradiction between experience and change. I think that they have been somehow put in these opposing categories, and I don\'t think that\'s the way that we make decisions in our life. What the question is is who has the experience we need to make the changes we want. And I believe that my experience over the course of 35 years of my life equips me very well to do exactly what Bill said in that clip.I am rooted in the real lives of real people. That is what I\'ve cared about, that\'s what motivates me. That\'s what I want to do as president. And so when I go out, it is to talk with people about what I can do to help them, and it is a reflection then of everything that I have done over the course of my life, you know, as a public servant, as a public office holder. I just think it\'s imperative that we quit this false distinction. It is who has the experience we need to make the changes we want. And we need and want to have it happen in America, and I believe that I am tested and ready and prepared to do it.You know, we just spent the most--the first part of the program talking about a speech and vote from 2002. What people are talking to me about is the economy. They\'re losing their jobs. You know, economic activity is slowing down. We need to focus very clearly on what we\'re going to do to make this economy as, you know, ready to be able to navigate through the potential of a recession. We\'re slipping toward recession. Some people think we\'re in recession right now. And I\'ve proposed a very vigorous package of economic action that I think would, you know, forestall and maybe, hopefully mitigate against what is going on in the economy.RUSSERT: You don\'t pay for it.CLINTON: Well, you know, Tim, I am probably the strongest on fiscal responsibility in this campaign. Senator Edwards, I respect, he said that\'s not a priority for him. Senator Obama puts out a lot of his policies without paying for them, about 50 billion, as we have calculated. I have paid for everything. I tell you how I will pay for my healthcare plan, how I will pay for the American retirement accounts.RUSSERT: But not for this stimulus.CLINTON: But this--stimulus shouldn\'t be paid for. The whole point of stimulus--now, as we end the war in Iraq, we\'re going to be bringing that money home. But the stimulus, by the very nature of the economic problems we\'re facing, is going to require an injection of federal funding. And I would start with the mortgage crisis. You know, I\'ve been doing events in Nevada and California, which have very high rates of mortgage foreclosure. I want to have a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work them out. I want to freeze interest rates for five years, and I want to have a $30 billion package that will go in and try to stabilize the housing market and stabilize communities that are going to be affected by that.RUSSERT: But, Senator, many people opted for those cheaper mortgages. They could\'ve had a fixed mortgage at a higher rate, but they opted for a cheaper one. Should they not bear some responsibility?CLINTON: Well, Tim, I think all of us should. But I\'d say three things about that. The bankers, the mortgage lenders, the brokers, all bear a lot of the responsibility, because many of the practices that were followed were just downright predatory and fraudulent. There is no doubt about that. I started talking about this last March. A lot of people got into subprime loans who frankly could\'ve been in a conventional fixed-rate loan. They were basically told that this was a better opportunity for them. Should they take responsibility? Yes, but look at what will happen if we continue this cascade of foreclosures. Housing values are down. They\'re down 6 percent. That\'s over $1.3 trillion in housing values in the last year. So everybody bears some responsibility. I went to Wall Street last month to tell Wall Street they had to be part of the solution because they sure had been part of the problem.What I have proposed would begin to stabilize the situation as it is today. You know, even Alan Greenspan said give money to homeowners so that they can be able to withstand the pressures of this mortgage crisis. I would do it a little differently, but I think the--we\'re seeing the same problem. If we allow these foreclosures to continue, we are going to be facing even a deeper and longer set of economic problems. So I think we\'ve got to take action now.RUSSERT: You say you\'ve been deeply involved in the eight years of the Clinton administration. One of the powers given to a president is the power of pardon. At the end of the president\'s second term, he granted 140 pardons, including one to Marc Rich, someone who had been convicted of tax evasion, fraud and making illegal oil deals with Iran. Were you involved in that pardon?CLINTON: No. I didn\'t know anything about that.RUSSERT: No one talked to you whatsoever?CLINTON: No. No. Unh-unh.RUSSERT: His ex-wife gave $109,000 to your campaign.CLINTON: Well, no one talked to me about it, Tim.RUSSERT: Nobody?CLINTON: Nobody.RUSSERT: Your two brothers proposed people for pardons and you were paid money. One brother, you asked to give the money back.CLINTON: That\'s right. That\'s right.RUSSERT: Were you aware your brothers were involved?CLINTON: No, I was not.RUSSERT: If you\'re president, will you make a pledge that your family will not recommend people...CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely.RUSSERT: And you\'ll file--follow Justice Department guidelines?CLINTON: Yes. Yes. Well, number one, I want to have a much more transparent government, and I think we now have the tools to make that happen. You know, I said the other night at an event in New Hampshire, I want to have as much information about the way our government operates on the Internet so the people who pay for it, the taxpayers of America, can see that. I want to be sure that, you know, we actually have like agency blogs. I want people in all the government agencies to be communicating with people, you know, because for me, we\'re now in an era--which didn\'t exist before--where you can have instant access to information, and I want to see my government be more transparent. I want to make sure that we limit, if we can\'t eliminate all the no-bid contracts, the cronyism, I want to cut 500,000 government contractors.RUSSERT: But follow Justice Department guidelines on pardons?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely.RUSSERT: Back in 1998, a very painful period for you, beginning of the Lewinsky scandal, you said, ""This may be the result of a vast right-wing conspiracy."" Do you believe that the vast right-wing conspiracy still exists?CLINTON: Oh, I don\'t know. I haven\'t paid much attention to it for about 10 years. I really don\'t have any idea. I know that I\'ve been involved in, you know, championing causes I care deeply about for a very long time. And that does sometimes draw a little bit of controversy and criticism. Some of it\'s organized, but you know, I\'m just too busy to worry about that.RUSSERT: The voters who voted for you in New Hampshire were asked also who would be the most likely to unite the country. And it was quite interesting. This is what they said: Obama 51, Clinton 28. That\'s a state that you carried, yet they say that Barack Obama would unite the country. Why?CLINTON: Well, I believe that my record of uniting New York, of going to the Senate, when people said I wouldn\'t work with Republicans and Republicans wouldn\'t work with me, is evidence. You know, I am willing to find common ground wherever I can, Tim, but I also know you have to stand your ground. I don\'t believe that the political system in Washington will immediately just lie down and give up. You know it better than anybody. The interests are deeply entrenched. You know, they\'ve gone after me consistently for 16 years and I bear some scars from that because I have stood up against them on universal healthcare, for example. I\'m proud of those scars because yes, I will find common ground and create solutions to our problems, but I am against a lot of what those on the other side want to do to our country.RUSSERT: A lot of Democrats have--are concerned about that, as to whether you can win a general election. Again, this is New Hampshire. Who\'s most likely to win the general election? Again, they say Obama by a margin of 44 to 35. The Wall Street Journal and NBC News had a poll where we matched Clinton-Huckabee to Obama-Huckabee. Let me take you through that. Clinton is 46; Huckabee 44. Obama is 48; Huckabee\'s 32. And when you look at the independent voters, it\'s Clinton 35, Huckabee 46; Obama wins independents 40 to 35. Obama gets 20 percent of the Republican vote. Why is that? Why is there--independents and Republican resistance to you?CLINTON: You know, Tim, one think I think everybody should\'ve learned after New Hampshire is let\'s not pay so much attention to polls, you know. We need to let voters actually make up their minds, and voters who will see and judge each of us in the Democratic primary and then in the general election. You know, there are other polls we could put up done by other networks and other kinds of outlets that have different results. I don\'t pay much attention to any of that. I think that the fact is that we\'re taking our case to the American people. We\'re taking it on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis. And I\'m very--you know, I\'m very gratified by the positive response. But I didn\'t pay attention to polls before New Hampshire and I\'m not going to start paying attention to it after New Hampshire.Whoever is nominated, and it\'s likely to be Senator Obama or myself, will get a fresh look by the people of America, will get an increased amount of, you know, questions about who we are and where we\'re from. Because all of a sudden it becomes real. You\'ve covered this for a long time. You know, when my husband ran in \'92, he finally clinched the nomination in June in California. He was running third behind President Bush and behind Ross Perot. Others of our candidates on both sides of the aisle start out behind and wage a winning campaign.So I think what people who are concerned about electability should be looking at is number one, who can be the best president, the best president from day one, who is prepared, who has taken tough positions, because you\'re going to have to take them. You know, Senator Obama voted present 130 times in the state Senate. When you\'re president, you can\'t vote present. You have to make a decision. Sometimes it\'s a split second decision. You don\'t have time to, you know, think about it. You\'ve got to actually decide. So I\'m going to take the case to the country as the nominee that I\'ve been tested, I\'ve been proven. I have the experience we need to make the changes we want and I think that\'s a winning case, and, you know, whomever the Republicans nominate.RUSSERT: In Iowa, you expressed concern that the time of the caucus prevented a lot of shift workers from voting, they were disenfranchised.CLINTON: Right.RUSSERT: You may confront the same thing in Nevada. They have now scheduled, the state party there, to have caucuses at the place of work so that shift workers can show up. Many people, minorities particularly, supporters of yours, have filed a suit to try to stop having those caucus locations at the workplace. Do you support that suit?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I don\'t think it\'s supporters of mine. There seems to be some misunderstanding about that. I was asked yesterday in Reno. The teachers union who brought the suit has not endorsed me, and so I think their concern is to have as many people participate as possible, which is certainly what it should be. This is now in the courts. The courts and the state party will have to work it out. But I don\'t want to disenfranchise anybody. I want...RUSSERT: So why not drop the lawsuit and let people vote?CLINTON: Well, that\'s up to the people who brought it.RUSSERT: Well, what\'s your view?CLINTON: But Tim, as I understand it, there are a lot of people working at many places who won\'t be able to work. The places for doing the caucus are not at their workplace across the state. I mean, that\'s--the caucus idea is for neighbors to get together to argue and talk about their choices. The problem is that if you have a limited period of time, as I\'ve pointed out long before anything happened in Nevada, you\'re going to essentially leave people out who can\'t be there during those one to two hour periods of time. And so, you know, I haven\'t read the lawsuit. The coverage of it seems to suggest that some people are saying, ""Well, wait a minute, what about us? Those are not our workplaces. We have to be at work. How are we going to participate?"" It\'s up to the courts to work that out.RUSSERT: Doris Kearns Goodwin said, ""What\'s the biggest public adversity a person has ever faced?"" What\'s yours?CLINTON: Well, I think we all know that, we lived through it, didn\'t we, and it\'s something that was very painful and very hurtful.RUSSERT: What did you learn from it?CLINTON: Well, you know, first of all, it is who I am as a person. I believe that you have to withstand whatever problems come your way. You have to make the decisions that are best for you. You\'re going to get a lot of advice coming from many different quarters to do things that don\'t feel right to you, that don\'t reflect who you are and what your values are. So you have to be grounded in who you are and what you believe. And you\'re not always going to make the right decisions, but you have to be guided by what you think is important, and that\'s what I\'ve done.RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, we thank you very much for joining us here in South Carolina and sharing your views, and we\'ll see you Tuesday night in Nevada.CLINTON: Thank you. Good to see you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 14, 2008","b'Remarks at SEIU 32BJ Event Honoring the Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. in New York City'","b'It is a dangerous mission to follow Reverend Youngblood. There isn\'t anyone who has not only preached for justice but stood for justice as he has over so many years and we are so grateful for his leadership and his witness. I am honored to be with you and with all of these leaders here before you. It a pleasure to be celebrating Dr. King\'s life and to carry forth his vision, to do so on behalf of those who deserve economic justice. I want to start with a thank you. For eight years I have been in and out of many of the buildings that you secure. I have shook many of your hands; I have thanked you for your work. I have breathed a sigh of relief that you were there and on the job and I know how important the work is that you do. Let me, on behalf of so many who appreciate you and understand that you deserve a living wage with health care benefits, because you do work that benefits all of us. Thank you and God bless you for all that you do for all of us every single day. I want to thank the leadership of 32 BJ, Mike Fishman and the great leadership team that he has. I want to thank all the clergy who are here. I want to thank BCT for being behind this important cause. You\'ve heard from our wonderful elected officials, Greg Meeks who just left, Bill Thompson, Anthony Weiner. We know how much Hazel Dukes has meant to all of us for so many years. She\'s my friend, she\'s my mentor. I am here today because of you and because the work that Dr. King started and the work he was doing when his life was cut short is directly related to your cause. You\'re organizing, mobilizing, your refusing to back down when the going gets hard. Everyday that you stand up and speak for justice, you are the living embodiment of Dr. King\'s legacy. He may not be here, as Reverend Youngblood said, in person but he is here in spirit because we are bringing together those who labor hard everyday and the faith community that understands the cause for which you labor; the cause of justice and righteousness. The legacy that you embody may be different from the jobs of the sanitation workers in Memphis, but the cause, the cause, is the same. You may be new to this country. You may not have ever celebrated Dr. King\'s holiday before, but his cause and his sacrifice, no matter where you came from, is yours. You may be a security guard working to keep body and soul together, worried how you are going to put food on the table and health care for your children and maybe save a little along the way. You may have been born after Dr. King left us, but your cause is his. When I think about how much stronger we are when we join forces, it is for me the progress that America has made; people of faith coming together with people of labor. Back in 1968, Dr. King sent a telegram to the labor leader Cesar Chavez. He was waging a hunger strike on behalf of farm workers. Dr. King wrote, ""Our separate struggles are really one; a struggle for freedom, for dignity, and for humanity."" That is why, that very same year, Dr. King traveled to Memphis, Tennessee and offered his support to striking sanitation workers. He told them, ""either we go up together, or we go down together."" The cause for justice has always come from people of faith and people of labor. Here in this great hall today, you understand, as Dr. King did, that your cause was his cause. His movement was a broad and deep one. It was a movement to redeem the soul of America; to fulfill the common purpose of our nation. A movement inspired by the idea, as he put it, that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,"" and that included economic justice. The injustice of poverty; the injustice of people who work hard all day and then on the night shift, and it is still not enough. The injustice of being invisible in a country of so much wealth and opportunity; having people walk by you in the halls and foyers and staircases of buildings you work and not even see you. Not stopping to say thank you. Thank you for being on duty tonight. Thank you for telling us about the problem that happened yesterday. Thank you for helping me to feel secure. That invisibility eats away at the heart and soul of America. There should not be any invisible Americans and if it\'s up to the faith community and the labor community and political leaders like those of us here today, there will not be invisible workers anywhere, ever again. We see so much injustice in an economy that simply isn\'t working for so many of our families. Typical American family\'s income is down nearly $1,000 in the last six years. Wages are flat but health care costs are up. Gas and energy are up, education costs are up. People are running as hard they can but they are going backwards, they are not getting ahead. So many families feel like they are standing on a trap door; one pink slip, one medical diagnosis away from losing everything. The cause of your family is the cause of every American family and should be the cause of all of us. When security workers here in New York - the people who keep our city safe - don\'t have the health care or the training they need and desire; when they\'re not paid enough or valued enough - their cause is our cause. When African American and Latino workers still face discrimination in the workplace - when their children still attend schools that are separate and unequal. When they cannot feel that they are part of the American dream today, then your cause is our cause. When a pregnant woman is told, ""I\'m sorry, but your employment is no longer needed."" When women are still paid just 77 cents on every dollar a man makes - and women of color even less, your cause is our cause. We need to be recommitted to Dr. King\'s dream. It was a dream that demanded action and he gave that action everyday of his life until he was taken from us. We must demand that every American share in this nation\'s prosperity. Every American, no matter where you start out, should have the opportunity to fulfill your God given potential. When the measure of our progress is taken as a nation, it is not how many people became the richest in the world, it is how many could share in the American dream and feel secure in their own lives and in the lives of their children. Reverend Youngblood was saying that Mike Fishman would have invited Dr. King to speak today and he would have come, too. I remember hearing him speak when I went with my Church into downtown Chicago to see and hear for myself someone who had burst through the stereotypes and the caricatures, who could not be held back by being beat or gassed or jailed, whose cause was so powerful that he was finally speaking not just to the whole country but to the entire world. I sat there as a young girl transfixed and transformed because the sermon he gave that day was will we stay awake through the revolution. The revolution comes and change is made, and those of us who benefit, we move on. But this is a never-ending revolution for justice and equality and we at our peril think that the work is over because we have benefitted. Wherever there is injustice it is an affront to us. I believe you have to listen in order to lead, I believe that as the Scripture says, we cannot just be ""hearers of the word;"" we must be ""doers"" of the word. I believe as I was taught that ""faith without works is dead and work without faith is just too hard."" We are called upon today in New York City to fulfill the unfinished dream and to live the legacy that we have inherited. Each of us, no matter who we are or where we started from, is a beneficiary of Dr. King. We are also a beneficiary of labor leaders like Mike Fishman and 32BJ, who never give up on the dream of equality and justice. It\'s now up to us to answer the urgent question, whether we will continue the work, whether we have it in ourselves to go the distance, whether we will stand up to the forces that do not believe - do not believe - in the fundamental value that each of us was endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights and that as Americans we are entitled to the justice we were promised. Will we deliver on jobs with living wages? Will we deliver on the promise of health care for 47 million Americans without it and the many more who don\'t have enough to meet the needs they have? Will we deliver on the promise of the right to organize and bargain collectively which is a fundamental human right? Will we deliver on the American dream that cannot be realized if we turn our backs on labor and the struggles to give hardworking people the rights they deserve to have? It won\'t be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is. You are now part the great forward movement of progress in America. You heard Reverend Youngblood talk about how we have tried to realize a more perfect union. We can point to progress even though the journey is not over. How many of you ever dreamed you\'d see the day when a woman and an African American were running for Presidency of the United States of America? That should cause our hearts to leap with joy and celebration. I know that we have to bring our Party together and country together. Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist who did some of his best work here in New York, spoke out not only for the abolition of slavery but for women\'s rights. He said back in 1848, summed up on the masthead of his newspaper called North Star, that right is of no sex and truth is of no color. God is the father of us all and we are brethren. We have a great journey ahead of us as Americans. We need to bring together of the Democratic Party, which has been on the front lines of the Civil Rights movement, women\'s rights movement, and the human rights movement. We need to bring together the labor movement, which has been there every step of the way to get us to where we are today and to keep moving forward for justice. We may differ on minor matters but when it comes to what is really important, we are family. We are all bound together to ensure that the least, the last and the lost among us be given every opportunity to break the chains that still hold them back and down. The security workers are the workers we focus on today. The organizing that is happening will, I hope, result soon in justice and economic opportunity. But the struggle never ends and we all have to remain on the front lines of that struggle. Both Senator Obama and I know that we are where we are today because of leaders like Dr. King and generations of men and women like all of you - people who looked into the eyes of their children and saw the promise of a better future, who protested and picketed, who faced dogs and tear gas and nightsticks against their skulls. Some, like Dr. King, even gave their lives. But they also voted and they brought people to the polls and they held leaders accountable for delivering on the promise. In his speech to the sanitation workers in Memphis forty years ago, Dr. King urged them to ""move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be."" It was his very last speech - he was killed the next day. But less than a week later, his brave widow, Coretta Scott King, returned to Memphis. She had not yet buried her husband, but was determined to finish his work and with three of her children at her side, she led a march through the streets of Memphis; tens of thousands of people in solidarity with those striking sanitation workers. Eight days later, they got their contract. Today, it is up to us to continue that march; that march for freedom, justice, equality, opportunity. It is up to us to make America what it ought to be. It is up to us to stand up for workers here in New York and across this land. I know that working together, relying on the faith and labor communities, we will find our way, we will meet our challenges, we will finally fulfill the promise of this country we love and when we do, it will be because of so many brave people like all of you. Thank you so much and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 19, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Nevada Caucuses',"b""I had a great campaign here. I had a lot of wonderful help from friends around the country, like Mayor Villaraigosa from Los Angeles, who has been with me, and I am particularly gratified that the people of Nevada have given us such a positive send-off.This is one step on a long journey throughout the country as we put our cases forward and take that case to the people and this was an especially wonderful day for me.So I'd be glad to answer your questions.Q: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: Well, you know, I don't have any response to that. I think that we had a very effective campaign. We have a lot of reports ourselves and, obviously, we're not focused on that right now, because the fact is that people turned out and I got a significant share of the popular vote and I think that _ you know, my view always is you just keep going, and that's what we intend to do.Q: (OFF-MIKE) of the popular vote, but you may not have won in the delegates. Your response to that?CLINTON: Well, nobody really knows and we are looking very good. Obviously, this is about delegates, but it's also about what people are voting for and who they think the best president will be.And I find it somewhat strange, actually, that there is such a reaction when this was a very effective campaign to reach as many people as possible and we did and I'm very proud of that.QUESTION: What do you think made the difference here in Nevada?CLINTON: I think it was the message of real results, that we want to solve problems. The people of Nevada spent a lot of time talking to me about their worries concerning the economy and health care and education, home foreclosures, which I spend a lot of time talking about, because it's such a problem here in Nevada.And I think that the people of Nevada, they want somebody who's going to give them solutions, not just rhetoric. They want to hear what it is you're going to do, and I have been very specific about my plans, because I want to be held accountable.I want people to know what I plan to do, because I want to bring accountability back into our government. I want people to understand that we can meet these challenges. We shouldn't be overwhelmed by them. We shouldn't get discouraged about them. We can do that.And I think the best way for me to do that is to be very specific about how I think together we can solve our problems.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: I don't know. We'll have plenty of time to analyze that, but I am very proud of a lot of people who came out to support me against some pretty tough odds, and I know that it wasn't easy for them. I know their stories."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 22, 2008",b'Remarks to Reporters on the Global Economic Crisis',"b'""I want to start with a comment or two about the economy. As we saw over night, this is a global economic crisis. It has pushed the Fed for an emergency meeting and by phone with a rate cut this morning in an effort to try to take whatever action can be taken on the monetary side to begin to try to stabilize this situation which is obviously deteriorating. ""I think it\'s imperative that the following step be taken. The President should have already and should do so very quickly, convene the President\'s Working Group on Financial Markets. That\'s something that he can ask the Secretary of the Treasury to do. We don\'t have any information that he has done so as of last night, but I would urge him to do that. This has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world. ""Secondly, the meeting that I understand is going to take place today, with respect to a stimulus package, must produce an agreement that can be quickly passed. I have been advocating for some time a package of actions. The one area that I still hear nothing about from the White House of any significance is what will be done to deal with the mortgage crisis. Those of you who have covered me know that I have spoken about this consistently because I believe it is a critical part of what we must do. We need a combination of spending, regulatory action with respect to the housing market, and rebates through the tax system. ""Secondly, it would be incredibly short-sighted not to include those people who do not currently pay income taxes. We have fifty to seventy million people who are seniors on fixed incomes, who are working people who don\'t make enough money to actually pay income tax, that they have to get some help. Everything I\'ve heard from the White House would leave these people out. ""I think that is a mistake fiscally and it is certainly a tremendous oversight with respect to what these families and individuals are going through. I would reiterate my call for a moratorium on foreclosures for ninety days and a rate freeze for five years to try to stabilize this housing market. There may be other ways to do it such as opening up the bankruptcy code, which I would certainly be open to, but we\'ve got to address this big piece of business. ""Finally, I think that as we look at what is happening in the economy, it\'s very important to recognize how the policies of the last seven years have contributed to the situation we find ourselves in. There is no doubting my mind that the American consumer has largely sustained the global economy. What\'s happening in a lot of these markets around the world is that the fear that the American consumer will stop spending has moved like a contagion through the global markets because, clearly, we have not only spent at extraordinary levels in the federal government, with all of the spending that we haven\'t paid for and that, I think, is coming home to roost, as well. ""The American consumer, because of he increasing costs of everything that makes up a middle class life or just making it day by day  health care, education, energy costs  have all gone up because of the failures of this administration. We need action across the board and it\'s imperative that the President and his economic team instill confidence in the competence of our government to take on what is clearly now a global crisis that could very well thrust us into a deep, long recession. We\'ve got to do everything we can to avoid that.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 24, 2008",b'Remarks on Solutions for the American Economy',"b'Thank you! Thank you all so much! Thank you. You know, I am so happy to be back here at Furman. I was at Furman with Dick and Chucky Riley back in 2003 for a speech and a question and answer program there, and I had such a wonderful time. It\'s great to be here again; I\'ve been at one of the extension buildings of the university in this campaign, but to be back and talking about the economic challenges facing our country is a great honor. I am so sorry to be late. I apologize for that. Some of it was us off to a late start, but there were other things we had to deal with, and some of it was delays in air travel, but I appreciate your patience and your willingness to be here. I apologize for everybody stuck outside; we have a long, long line of people who can\'t get in. I\'m not sure that everybody thought a speech about the economy would draw such a big crowd. So, I apologize to all of you as well. And of course, I want to thank Dick Riley for his years of service to the state of South Carolina and to our country. He is such a unique public servant and a wonderful, great man. And I want to thank Frank Holleman who was out speaking here with you before, and Lottie Gibson. State Representative Fletcher Smith, who I\'m proud to have supporting me. I want to thank the conference center here and Kay Cornelison, who is the director and all of you who have come. I particularly want to thank a group of veterans who are traveling throughout the state on my behalf. We have them all over the state. We have several of them here today, led by Hershel Gober, the former Secretary of Veteran Affairs; Hank Naughton, an Iraq veteran and a state representative from Massachusetts; Pat Lewis, another veteran; Reverend Tim Brown, another supporter. I\'m very honored to have the support of so many of our veterans. We have a lot of work to do on that front, and if you want to know the details talk to Hershel and the veterans who are here, because they can give you chapter and verse about what we need to do to keep faith with our veterans. But I want to turn to the economy. You know, in just a few days, on Monday night, President Bush will give his final State of the Union Address. It\'s enough to make you want to burst out in song. Don\'t worry, I\'ll spare you. You don\'t have to listen to me sing. After seven years of inattention, neglect and denial, this Monday night, President Bush may well actually discuss the serious economic problems we face. And it\'s about time. You know, we didn\'t hear from him when the typical family incomes dropped $1,000 over the past seven years -- $2,600 for African American families. As health care premiums nearly doubled, gas prices more than doubled, and college costs here in South Carolina rose 124% since 2000, the fastest increase in America. We didn\'t hear from him as more than two million foreclosure notices went out  11,000 properties right here in South Carolina are in some stage of foreclosure. That\'s 11,000 families that are facing the potential loss of the American dream. We didn\'t hear from him as unemployment reached a two year high last month, with South Carolina having the third highest unemployment rate in America, or as nearly five million Americans fell back into poverty  33,000 in South Carolina alone. But now, finally, the President may acknowledge what the American people have known for years: that the economy is not working for middle class and working families. And I welcome the president to this conversation. Because it\'s a conversation that Americans have been having and that I\'ve been having with so many people every day for years. I\'ve listened to the voices of so many Americans as I\'ve traveled the country. The voices of people who work hard all day  then sometimes additionally on the night shift  but it\'s still not enough. People who whisper to me about the mortgages they can\'t afford and the homes they\'re losing, about medical bills that wiped them and their savings out. About tuition costs that have cut short the hopes they had about sending a child to college. Many people are simply overwhelmed by the economic conditions they confront every day. I\'ve heard from plenty of people who also tell me, ""I\'m OK right now, but what about next year  or even next month? The way things are going with people losing jobs and homes, what if my family is next?"" This is a time of uncertainty and growing anxiety. We didn\'t wind up here by accident. As President Kennedy once observed, ""Economic policy can result from government inaction as well as governmental action."" We\'re here in part because the President failed to listen to the voices of people who are hurting, failed to get involved in the actual work of running the government, and failed to act. Instead, he has stayed at a comfortable cruising altitude, well above the realities of people\'s lives, delegating responsibilities to his advisers, hoping the buck would stop somewhere elseanywhere else. In just seven years, this Administration has taken us from record surpluses into a large and growing deficit, from a projected $5.6 trillion surplus to a $9 trillion debt. We have seen our growing, thriving economy that created 22.7 million jobs in the 1990s pushed to the brink of recession. And we\'re seeing the ripple effects around the world. This week, many countries saw their largest one-day stock market declines since September 11, 2001. In this new century, the stakes have never been higher. The challenges have never been bigger or more urgent. But the opportunities are also there, if we get about the business of seizing them. Now, our economic problems are admittedly complex. But there is one thing we know for sure: the problem with our economy is not the American people. Instead, the problem is, in part, the bankrupt ideas that have governed us for the last seven years. They have rewarded the very few at the expense of the many. The American people are actually the solution to our economic problems. Americans are the hardest working people in the world  our productivity goes up every year. That means we work harder and harder and produce more. People are innovators, they are entrepreneurs, they take risks, they start small businesses. They are constantly thinking about the future. The factory worker and the CEO, the farmer or the small business owner, the scientist in the lab, or the teacher in the classroom, everybody who gets up every day and gets their job done, supports their families  that is the strength of the American economy. And it\'s time we finally had a president who worked as hard for you as you work for America every single day. Because, in the end, it is all about people. It is all about the woman in Columbia who grabbed my hand and said that her child was sick and the insurance company wouldn\'t pay for the treatment that was necessary. It\'s all about the man in Florence some months ago who came up to me some months ago and said, ""I just keep working harder and harder and I feel like I\'m falling further and further backwards. But I have a small business; I depend on transporting my goods, and the cost of energy just keeps going up."" It\'s about the real lives of real people right here in South Carolina. The presidency matters more now than ever. We need a president who will run the government and manage the economy. American people don\'t hire a President to talk about our problems but to solve them, to set a vision for the future, and then to roll up our sleeves and get about fulfilling it. It\'s time for a President who believes that leading an economic comeback is a fulltime, hands-on job. Who renews our commitment to a strong and prosperous middle class and brings business, labor and government together to restore America\'s competitiveness in a fast changing world. A president who has a vision for a twenty-first century economy based on shared prosperity. Where we measure our success not by the wealth at the very top but by how broadly wealth is shared. You know, with all due respect to a lot of my friends on the other side of the aisle, I do not believe it is rich people who made America great. I believe it is the hard working people of America who made our country great. We want to get back to rewarding hard work. We want the American Dream to be within everyone\'s reach. We want to make investments in one another that allow us, particularly our children, to live up to our God-given potential. These are not just economic issues, these are moral issues about our common purpose as a nation. Whether people can provide for their families, whether they can share in the blessings of this great country  that speaks to who we are as a people and what we value. The way we bring our country together is by acting on our values. True unity can only be achieved by finding real solutions for the American people, and then delivering them. Without real solutions, division and disappointment, not unity, will be the result. We\'ve been there before. President Bush promised to be a uniter, not a divider. And we know how well that turned out. Because unity comes from taking on the tough challenges, asking us to be bigger than ourselves, summoning up to greatness, again. And that is what I intend to do as President, on day one. I will bring the voices of the American people back to the White House. I will ask all of us to be involved in solving our problems. Otherwise, here is what I fear. Most of us, as I look around this room, with the exception of the students who are crowded into the foyer and spilling out the door, we have been the beneficiaries of the sacrifices that came from previous generations- from parents and grandparents, from people who fought the wars, and built big businesses, and did the labor, who created the extraordinary success of that America is. We have to keep faith with all that came before us. I don\'t think any of us want to be part of the first generation of Americans to leave our country worse off than when we found it. That would be such a breach with what American history has meant to all of us. So the time for waiting is over and the time for talk is over. Too many families are paying the price of inaction, right here and right now  so I think we need to begin acting, and we can\'t wait until January 20, 2009. We need both an immediate, short-term plan to jumpstart the economy  and a long-term economic vision with strategies to keep the economy going well into the future. So let\'s start with the short-term. If I were President right now, I would work with the Congress to jumpstart the economy by immediately addressing the housing crisis, creating new jobs, and getting money back into the pockets of the American people. We know that the loss of a home is devastating and so many families across our country are facing that. But it\'s not only those who are actually losing their homes I worry about. Because of this mortgage crisis, every home owner is losing value in our homes. The American people have lost more than $1.3 trillion worth of value in our homes in the last year  that\'s nearly half the size of the entire United States government budget. And African American families are especially hard hit  subprime loans are five times more common in predominantly African American neighborhoods than predominantly white ones. But this is not just an economic crisis, it is truly an American dream crisis. Your home isn\'t just your only greatest source of wealth  it\'s your greatest source of security. It\'s what anchors us to our neighborhoods and communities. It\'s where we raise our kids, celebrate birthdays and holidays, and make memories together. I have visited with so many people in their homes and I know what our homes mean to us. I know the feel of refuge and security I feel when I walk into my own home. I know what it\'s like to sit in homes where families haven\'t had the money to buy all the furniture they need but they\'re so proud to show off their new home. And nearly a year ago, I called for immediate action to address this mounting mortgage crisis. Less than two weeks after that, the Bush administration told Congress that what I was calling for wasn\'t necessary- that the problem was contained. Several months later, the President assured us that there would be a soft landing for the housing market. But now we know better. So all of last year, I proposed policies to help families keep their homes. I wrote to the regulators urging them to take their heads out of the sand and do something for the millions of families at risk of foreclosure. I introduced legislation to crack down on abusive lending practices and give states the resources to help at-risk families avoid losing their homes. The result? A plan from President Bush that lets banks off the hook and leaves homeowners to fend for themselves. In the words of one expert, the President\'s plan was ""the bank lobby\'s dream."" This Administration has delivered a foreclosure notice on the American Dream. The President\'s plans to fix our economy would do next to nothing about the foreclosure crisis. And they said that my insistence on stopping foreclosures just doesn\'t make sense. Well I\'m sorry to disagree. The housing crisis is contributing to rising unemployment. Construction jobs are disappearing and I see a few hard-hats here in the audience. South Carolina alone lost 2,800 construction jobs in 2007. It\'s erasing families\' wealth, jeopardizing consumer spending, which constitutes two-thirds of our economy. It\'s caused $100 billion in losses to banks, making them less likely to offer credit to businesses and families that need it. That\'s why my plan to fix the economy starts by doing everything possible to ensure that we don\'t lose any more homes and that we stabilize the economy when it comes to the mortgage crisis. I want to start with a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures. If the bank is about to foreclose on your home, you should have some breathing room to restructure your mortgage. I\'m calling for freezing the monthly rate on adjustable rate mortgages for at least five years or until the mortgages have been converted into loans that families can afford. If you have an adjustable mortgage that\'s about to skyrocket, you\'ll have the chance to pay it off with affordable payments. People say well isn\'t this rewarding people who maybe got in over their heads? Well to some extent it is trying to stop what is happening that will affect all of us. If we don\'t help these families work out their mortgages now we will have more empty homes because the housing market is so low right now, nobody is buying. Then we\'ll have deteriorating neighborhoods, then we\'ll have decreasing tax revenues for cities and towns- it becomes a vicious cycle. That\'s why I also would also create a $30 billion fund to help hard-hit communities and distressed homeowners weather the foreclosure crisis. We need to be sure to shore up our communities so that they don\'t begin to also deteriorate in the face of a loss in the home market. I also would include direct tax rebates to working and middle class families. We need to target it to those who are most in need. The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate along with the White House appear to be nearing a deal and I am heartened to hear that they are planning to extend assistance to the tens of millions of working Americans who need it the most. That\'s what I have been calling for and that\'s what I think we have to do. But I also want to target the needs of working families that are really facing tough choices. We need relief from skyrocketing energy bills. We need expanded unemployment insurance for those who are struggling to find a job. But I want to think about the future, that\'s why I would take immediate steps to spur ""green collar"" job growth: High-wage, renewable energy jobs that are good for our environment and cannot be outsourced. I would do this immediately through a crash weatherization program that would put people to work, helping to insulate homes, and give green collar job training initiatives to help prepare people. I would also implement my Green Building Fund to rebuild and renovate schools and other public buildings to help make them more energy efficient. We can create millions of new jobs in America through clean, renewable energy. I know we can do it because I\'ve seen what other countries have done. Germany decided a few years ago to make a big bet on solar power. They creating tax incentives, they created training programs to take construction workers and others to know how to install solar panels. They have created several hundred thousand new jobs in three short years. They have a smaller economy than ours. If we got serious about this, I know we could do the same. I really hope that as part of this recovery package, we start getting serious about the future. We have to stop the crisis but then we have to plan for an economy that will keep generating good new jobs, and clean energy is our best bet. But jumpstarting the economy in the short-term is just the beginning. We need a long-term vision to build a strong, prosperous economy for the next generation. I think it was Winston Churchill who said that, the difference between a politician and a statesman is that the politician thinks about the next election, while the statesman thinks about the next generation. We\'ve got to start thinking about the next generation. We can\'t do this piecemeal; we\'ve got to start helping people more. Maybe you want to start saving for retirement, but you can\'t do it because your taxes are too high and your wages aren\'t high enough. Maybe you want to go back to school, but your health care premiums are too high so you can\'t afford tuition. We live in a complex, interconnected, global economy. All of our challenges are all together now. We can\'t just put band-aids on one and expect to solve our problems. What we have to do is have a plan to create good jobs and restore fairness to the economy. We need to renew the promise of America that if you work hard, you can get ahead. We need to return to fiscal responsibility, so that Washington once again lives within a budget, just like you and your family has to do. I believe solving the jobs crisis over the long run starts with solving the energy crisis. That\'s why I will create a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund to jumpstart investments in clean energy technologies. We will create a green revolution with investments in biofuels, wind, solar, geothermal, all of the clean energy and energy efficiency changes we need to make. And as we create these new job possibilities for the next generation we will pay for it by eliminating the tax subsidies for the big oil companies and require them to pay into the Strategic Energy Fund, or invest in alternative energy themselves. They have made record profits in recent years. Now it\'s time they did their fair share. I also know that we won\'t get any of this done until the two oil men leave the White House but as soon as they do, we will start to work on this long-term vision. We also help create jobs by modernizing and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. The tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota this past summer, a recent levee break in Nevada, and what happened with the levees in New Orleans are painful reminders that our infrastructure is in dangerous disrepair. Every billion dollars that we spend fixing crumbling infrastructure creates 48,000 new jobs. I have a Rebuild America Plan to invest $10 billion over ten years in an ""Emergency Repair Fund."" We need to modernize our ports, our rail systems, our airports, our public transit systems, our bridges, our tunnels, our roads. We need to expand access to broadband across America, particularly to rural areas. We need to end this Administration\'s war on science and restore America to its rightful place. As the innovation nation, I will increase investments in basic and applied research at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and our other government agencies and universities. We became so successful after World War II because business and science worked hand in hand with government. Our great universities like Furman were on the cutting edge of discoveries that we translated into better outcomes for people. But creating jobs is just the beginning. We need to empower our workers and ensure that our tax system is fair. That\'s the second piece of a long-term plan. For the past seven years, the oil companies, the predatory student loan companies, the insurance companies, the drug companies have had a president who stands up for them. I intend to be a president who stands up for you every single day about how we make America work better for you. During the 1950s and 60s which many of us look back at with great appreciation because the economy worked so well, for so long, for so many, we had a much higher percentage of our workforce unionized. Now it is much lower. We need to make sure people can organize and bargain for good wages and safe working conditions. We need to be sure that we restore fairness to the economy by restoring fairness to the tax code. Right now, some of the people I represent in New York City, Wall Street investment managers, making $50 million a year pay just 15% on their earnings  while a teacher making $50,000 pays 25%. I don\'t think that\'s right and I\'ve been calling to raise the taxes on those people at the top. As corporate profits have skyrocketed, the percentage of taxes paid by corporations has fallen. We have richly rewarded people and I am all in favor of incentivizing people to do well. That is part of what America stands for. But it isn\'t right that the wealthy and the well-connected have gotten so many more benefits than the middle class and working people have. We need to extend middle class tax cuts, including the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief. We need to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax to ensure it doesn\'t hit middle class families with higher tax rates. It was never supposed to do that. We need to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and raise the minimum wage to ensure that work pays for all Americans. No one who works full time should live in poverty. If you\'re working full time you shouldn\'t be in poverty. We need to give people the tools and support they need to succeed in today\'s complex economy. That starts with recommitting ourselves to making college affordable for our young people. That\'s especially important here in South Carolina, the average student debt upon graduation is $20,000. So you start in a big hole before you ever go to work on the first day. And you know what\'s happened which is really troubling to meAmerica\'s higher education system which was the envy of the world, we had an open system, the highest percentage of young people who went to get degrees, but now from Japan to South Korea to Canada and Ireland, other countries are educating their young people at a higher rate than here in America. The reason for that is the cost has exploded. It is more expensive today than it was thirty years ago to send a child to college. That\'s why I\'ve outlined a comprehensive plan to open the doors of college to young people. It includes a new $3,500 college tax credit that will cover more than 50% of the typical cost of public colleges and universities or the full cost of tuition and fees for community colleges. I also want to increase the size of Pell Grants, something that former Secretary Riley mentioned. I want to strengthen community colleges, invest $500 million to support innovative, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs for those who don\'t go to college. We also have to ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care. Here in South Carolina alone, 672,000 people are uninsured. I want to ask you how many of you know someone here in South Carolina who is uninsured? How many of you know somebody who may have insurance but it just doesn\'t pay for what the doctor or the hospital says you need? We have two problemswe have the problem of the uninsured and the problem of the underinsured. My American Health Choices Plan would insure every single person for what they need. It\'s simple: If you have insurance you like, you keep it. There is no disruption. If you have a good policy through your business or through a union or through a municipality, nothing changes. But if you don\'t have insurance  or you don\'t like the insurance you have  you can choose from the same menu of private plans available to members of Congress. And we will provide tax credits to help you afford it. My plan also bans insurance company discrimination, so you will never be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or risk factors that you might have. And we don\'t require small business to do anything but it does provide tax credits to help small businesses if they choose to afford to buy health care for their employees. Finally, we have to help more Americans save for a secure retirement. Right now, fewer than half of all Americans have any retirement savings account at all. When I\'m President, I want to provide every single American with an easy, automatic opportunity to save for the future through ""American Retirement Accounts."" These accounts will take the best of the 401k plans and make them available to every working family. And we\'ll give families up to $1,000 in tax cuts to help them save. And finally we\'ve got to return to fiscal responsibility. Year after year, the President has increased spending at more than double the rate of the previous administration and handed tax cut after tax cut to multi-millionaires, oil companies and other interest groups. And how has he paid for all of this spending? By borrowing money from foreign countries like China. When people ask me, why is it hard to get tough on China and enforce our trade agreements, I tell them: because they\'re our bankers. We owe them. How can we truly enforce the trade laws against a country like China, when our economy depends on China\'s massive loans to us? Think about it this way, we borrow money from China to buy oil from the Saudis. That is a dead-end strategy for America. And I\'m going to end that strategy if I have the good fortune of becoming your president. Because I want America to regain control of its destiny by moving back toward a balanced budget and a surplus. That\'s why I\'ve worked throughout this campaign to show exactly how I would pay for every initiative that I have just mentioned. Not just how I\'ll run my campaign, but run our country as well. You know, today, some people around the world and even some here at home are basically saying, ""Well, we can\'t go back to the kind of economy we had before."" They act as though the 1990s was ancient Rome. It worked well in the 1990s. The average American family had a $7,000 gain in income in the 1990s. Well, every election is about the future but I do think there are lessons we need to learn from the past. Because right now, we are on the wrong track. We are undermining our security at home and around the world. We are undermining the American dream here at home. You know, great presidents have always understood the greatness of the American people. Think about President Franklin Roosevelt. Faced with a Depression, grave threats to America\'s freedom, he responded with bold solutions. Yes, they were sometimes controversial, but we rose from economic chaos and despair and at the time he died we were months away from winning a World War. He didn\'t paint a rosy scenario. He didn\'t ignore the tough challenges. He urged us to confront them. ""We have a great many problems ahead of us,"" he said. ""And we must approach them with realism and courage."" He believed we could tackle our greatest challenges, and I believe exactly the same. We have to overcome the fear and fatalism that President Bush has used to divide us and set us against one another. When I sometimes here the President or the Vice President, I don\'t hear America talking. You know, ""we can\'t solve the energy crisis without wrecking our economy; we can\'t provide affordable quality healthcare without wrecking our healthcare system; we can\'t have an economy anymore that creates a rising standard of living for everybody willing to work hard."" Since when did America become the can\'t-do country? That is not the America we know and love. We are going to face the future with our optimism, with our faith, our belief that we can overcome any challenge. I am optimistic. I know we are facing some tough, tough issues. I think about it every day. I\'m asking the people of South Carolina to take a chance on me, just like I asked the people of New York to take a chance on me back in 2000. I came and said, ""If you will give me a chance, I will work my heart out for you. You will have someone who gets up every day, thinking about you. I am not a show horse, I\'m a work horse; and I will go to work for you."" But I\'m not going to do it alone. I can\'t do it alone. We all have to be in this together. You know, when I talk about a clean, green renewable energy future, I\'m going to ask all for you to be more energy efficient, to think about what it means when you keep the lights on, when you drive more than maybe you need to, making three trips to the mall instead of one sensible one. I want you to think about every time you fill up the gas tank, or leave those lights on, you\'re sending money to oil companies and oil producing countries that don\'t always have our best interests at heart. When I say we need a new approach to healthcare that provides quality, affordable healthcare for every American, I\'m going to ask you to take better care of your health and the health of your children. Because we can have the best health care system in the world but we\'ve got to be healthier. We\'ve need a system of wellness, not one that just intervenes with sickness. We\'ve got to be once again the American people that are on the front lines of change and progress together. We are the oldest democracy in the world for a reason. Because whenever times are tough, whenever the challenges are big and the stakes are huge. We always respond. Now, Winston Churchill also said that the American people finally get around to doing the right thing after trying nearly everything else. Well, we\'ve tried nearly everything else over the last seven years, and I think we\'ve learned our lesson. So now what we need to do is face the future realistically, courageously, confidently, and optimistically. I know we can do this together. I need your help in the primary on Saturday. I need you to vote not just for me but for yourselves, your family, and your future. I am ready to lead on day one, and if you give me that opportunity, we will restore pride and progress in our country together. Thank you all very, very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 26, 2008",b'Remarks Following the South Carolina Primary',"b""Well, I have to thank my friend, State Senator Thelma Harper. Isn't she amazing? And I am so grateful that she is one of the leaders of my campaign here in Tennessee, along with Jane Eskin (ph), who is here with me, and I thank Jane and her husband, Dick, and former Governor Ned Ray McWherter. It's wonderful to have such a broad cross-section of people across this state who are fighting with us for a new future for America. I want to thank Dr. Johnson, thank you so much, please, Doctor, thank you so much for inviting us and being here with us, you and Mrs. Johnson. Thank you very much. I want to thank the band. Were they great? And I want to thank all of you for coming out here tonight. This is an amazing crowd. I am thrilled to be here in Tennessee with all of you and I'm so happy my daughter, Chelsea, can be with me tonight. I want to congratulate Senator Obama tonight and I want to also thank the people of South Carolina for welcoming us into their homes and their communities. And I want to tell you how excited I am that now the eyes of the country turn to Tennessee and the other states that'll be voting on February 5th and, of course, to the state of Florida that will be voting on Tuesday. So millions and millions of Americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and I can't imagine anyplace I'd rather be than right here in Nashville as we kick off the next 10 days. (APPLAUSE) Now, of course, when anybody says the word Nashville, it's always connected with singing, and, I promise you, you will not hear a word out of me. I do not want to in any way sully the reputation of the music capital by contributing my less than meager talents. But it is a great treat to be here with all of you and to have a chance to talk with you and, really, that's what I want to do tonight. I know the crowd is a little bigger than we anticipated, but I intended to come... (APPLAUSE) ... I intended to come here tonight to continue the conversation I started a year ago, to talk with the people of our country about what it is we can do together to make sure that we keep faith with this country we love so much. I know that it's often said the difference between a politician and a statesman is that the politician looks to the next election and the statesman looks to the next generation, and I want this election to be about the next generation, the students here at TSU and all the young people who are here tonight and across Tennessee. (APPLAUSE) And what I have heard traveling around our country is, of course, the optimism and the resilience that is the character of the American people. But I've also heard a lot of concerns and worries. People are worrying about their jobs, worrying about what's happening to the economy in general, worrying about their health care, worrying about college affordability and how they're going to be able to complete their education, worried about our country's standing in the world and how we can restore our reputation, our leadership and our moral authority. So there's a lot we can talk about tonight. And I want us to just to imagine, even in the size of this crowd, that we're just talking. We're just people having a conversation about what we believe and what we want, what we hope, and that we're looking for solutions to our problems, because I think there isn't anything America can't do if we put our mind to it. We are the nation that solves problems and creates new opportunities and we can do that again together, and it's so important we do that for our young people. Many of us, as I look around this crowd, know that we were given blessings and opportunities that we inherited, didn't we? And those were the results of the hard work of our parents, our grandparents, and people we never met, people who defend our freedoms, people who created the businesses that employed us, who pushed down the barriers that prevented any of us from fulfilling our God-given potential. So now it's time for us to do the same for the next generation, to make sure that we leave America... (END OF COVERAGE)"""

Senator Clinton, thank you for joining us. They often say we... CLINTON: My pleasure. SCHIEFFER: ...learn more from our losses than we do from our victories. You took a real drubbing last night in South Carolina. What did you learn? CLINTON: Well, Bob, I congratulated Senator Obama and thanked the people of South Carolina, who really welcomed us all into their homes and their communities. And it is an ongoing process. We've got a long way to go. We each now have won a primary and a caucus. I also was very honored to win in Michigan. And we're going on. We've got the State of the Union on Monday night. We have Florida on Tuesday, and I'll be in Florida on Tuesday night. And then we've got the 22 states spread from Massachusetts to California. But, as I have said so many times, you know, this election really isn't about us as candidates. It is about what we're going to do as a country and the lives of the people watching us and everyone else who is touched by whether or not the economy works and health care's there and, you know, all of the big challenges and opportunities we face. And I am particularly focused on doing what I can to try to get President Bush to be much more vigorous in responding to our economic challenges. From what I've heard and watched now, it doesn't seem as though he really gets it. And the State of the Union is really about the state of Americans' lives. It's about whether or not we're going to be able to avoid a deep and long recession and get ourselves back on track, and that's why I've been pushing for, you know, solutions like putting a mortgage moratorium on so that people don't lose their homes for 90 days while we try to work it out to let them stay in their homes, and freezing these interest rates before they really go even higher and put so many more people at risk. And I obviously agree with doing some tax rebates, but I think in addition to that we've got to take care of the people who are losing their jobs, with more unemployment. We may have to look at food stamps for people who are falling out of the middle class. And I think we could do a great deal to get our economy on the right track with green collared jobs and I'd like to see us invest in that. SCHIEFFER: Right. CLINTON: So, you know Bob, I wake up every morning and I think about what I'm going to do today, what kind of a difference I'm going to make in people's lives, and that's what I am here in Memphis doing. SCHIEFFER: All right. You hardly mentioned last night when you--when you got to Nashville, what had happened in South Carolina. Senator Obama--and perhaps that's understandable, because he won--he made quite a big deal of it. And one of the things he said, Senator Clinton, was he suggested that you and your husband are examples of the kind of partisanship that has to stop. I want you to listen to what he said. Senator BARACK OBAMA: It's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that a Republican had an idea, even if it's one you never agreed with. That's the kind of politics that is bad for our party, it is bad for our country, and this is our chance to end it once and for all. SCHIEFFER: What's your reaction to that? CLINTON: Well, of course I believe very strongly in finding common ground. That's what I've done in the Senate. But I also believe in standing our ground against some of the very poorly thought out and ill-conceived policies and ideas that we've had to fight against for the last 15 years. I don't see a contradiction there. You know, the fights of the 1990s over trying to get universal health care and eventually getting a bipartisan children's health insurance program that I was proud to work on, you know, that's part of what you have to do in order to both find common ground and stand our ground. I want, more than anyone, to bring our country together and to unify us. But to me, it is about working on meeting the big challenges that we face. You know, when I look at universal health care, that's a core value for me. I'm not going to leave people out, I'm going to go and do everything I can to try to make the case that it is time for America to cover every single one of us with quality affordable health care. SCHIEFFER: Senator... CLINTON: When I take on the oil companies, I'm going to take on the oil companies over a new energy future. So yes, we do need to be bipartisan, but we also need to get things done for our country. SCHIEFFER: I think he was not talking about arguing with Republicans, he was talking about the attacks that you had launched on him during the campaign. He suggested that you had taken his words out of context, and that that was the kind of partisan in-fighting that is really stopping the kinds of progress that are going on. And he was talking about the tactics of the--of the Clinton campaign team in South Carolina, it seemed to me. CLINTON: Well, that's not how I heard it, Bob. But if that were the case, you know, we all have to compare and contrast our records. That's legitimate. You know, the idea that somehow someone's record, someone's words are off-limits, I've never--I've never seen that in American politics, to be, you know, reflective of my experience. And I think it's important that we draw these contrasts. You'll have to look at exactly what was said, but that's up to the commentators. SCHIEFFER: Mm-hmm. CLINTON: What I'm focused on is, you know, now we're moving forward. We have these 22 states ahead of us. I've always said that that's where we would be at the end of these early states. I'm very proud and humbled to be in this position, competing for our party's nomination. But, you see, I do think that it is part of a voter's rights to know how we respond to what one another has done and said, and I think that's part of a, you know, vigorous election. But at the end of the day, we will come together as Democrats. We will be a united and committed party to take back the White House in November. SCHIEFFER: Let me just tell you what Congressman Clyburn--who, as you know, is a very influential African-American congressman in South Carolina--he said last night that--and he is neutral, as you know--he said that he hoped the results in South Carolina could change the tenor of the rest of this campaign. Do you agree with him, or do you think he has a point there? CLINTON: Oh, absolutely, Bob. And, you know, I have been calling for that for quite some time. From where I sit, this is an absolutely, you know, necessary effort on all of our parts. And may I also add, including the press', because I think that, you know, we stand for so much bigger than, you know, what divides us. And we've got to make that case. And my husband and I have spent our entire adults lives, even really before we were adults, you know, looking for ways to heal divides, bring people together, repair the breech, as the scripture says. You know, I have spent my time trying to give voice to the voiceless, and... SCHIEFFER: All right. CLINTON: ...empower the disempowered. And that's what I'm going to continue to do in this campaign, and... SCHIEFFER: All right. CLINTON: ...my public service. SCHIEFFER: That's a good point, and we'll come back and talk about it. I want to ask you about Bill Clinton when we come back in just a minute, Senator. (Announcements) SCHIEFFER: Back again with Senator Hillary Clinton, who's in Memphis this morning. Senator, let's talk about your husband, the former president. He stirred up a lot of controversy down there. Some people said he was out of control, some people said he was doing exactly what you wanted him to do, and that is be the attack dog. He talked at one point about how in South Carolina Jesse Jackson had won the primary there twice, suggesting that, of course, Senator Obama was going to win because he was black. What about your husband's role? Will he continue in the same aggressive way, or is this going to change? CLINTON: Oh, Bob, you know, my husband has such a great commitment to me and to my campaign. You know, he loves me, just like, you know, husbands and wives get out there and work on each other's behalf. I certainly did that for him for many years. And, you know, I'm very grateful for all of the help he's given, both supporting me, along with our daughter, and making the case for my candidacy. Anyone who knows him, who has followed his long and productive career, knows that he is committed to bringing our country together, that he has worked across all the lines that divide us. You know, I think that, you know, what he is doing for me is obviously out of a sense of deep commitment to me personally, but also based on his experience as president, as to who he thinks would best lead our country. And I know that in my own support of him, going back some years, I sometimes got a little bit carried away. I confess to that. But he is going to continue to be with me and support me and speak out for me, and I'm very grateful for that. SCHIEFFER: Has he gotten a little carried away from time to time? CLINTON: Well, I think it's human nature, Bob. I think that, you know, the spouses of all three of us have, you know, been passionate and vigorous defenders of each of us and, you know, maybe got a little carried away. But you know, that comes with a hard-fought election. It also comes with sleep deprivation, which, you know, I think is marking all of us, our families, our supporters. But, you know, I am very, very proud of my husband's record as a leader in our country going back so many years, and what he's done. And people know his heart. They know, you know, what he has stood for. So I'm really glad that he's there with me. And I think everybody just needs to take a deep breath. We need to be focusing on what's important in the lives of Americans. That's what I have spent my life trying to do, that's what my campaign is about. That's what I'll be doing for the next 10 days as we travel across the country. SCHIEFFER: Senator, there was quite an unusual endorsement of Senator Obama this morning. In The New York Times Caroline Kennedy, the daughter, of course, of John Kennedy, said Barack Obama was the first politician that she has encountered that energized people the way her father did. That must have sort of hurt, didn't it? CLINTON: No. I have the greatest regard for her, and I really appreciate the difficult choices people are making. There have been a lot of difficult choices on both sides, you know. When Congressman John Lewis endorsed me, I know that that was considered, you know, difficult for people in Senator Obama's camp. You know, these are hard choices, Bob. And I respect that. I think part of the reason that, you know, there's so much intensity in this campaign is that we have a lot of mutual supporters. We have people who would be 100 percent for either of us were the other not in the race. And I am very sensitive to that, and I think that, you know, we have to do everything we can--Senator Obama and I--to make sure we set the right tone, that we, you know, tell our supporters and our surrogates and everybody just to, you know, be focused on what is important to the American people. When I go out, as I did last night in Nashville with 4,000 people, and answer questions... SCHIEFFER: Senator... CLINTON: ...for an hour, what people ask me about was their lives. And that's what the election should be about. SCHIEFFER: Thank you so much, Senator. I'm sorry; we're out of time. We'll be back with a final word. CLINTON: Let's do it again, Bob. SCHIEFFER: Thank you very much. CLINTON: Thank you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 28, 2008","b'Remarks Before the State of the Union in Hartford, Connecticut'","b'Thank you. It is so good to be here in Hartford, back in Connecticut. I am thrilled to see all of you. I want to thank Nancy for her really kind words, but the part of it that touched me the most was when she said that she wanted me to be the president for her grandchildren. That is something that I so deeply treasure. Thank you, Nancy. It is wonderful to be back with your Attorney General. Dick and I went to law school together in New Haven at Yale. I have followed his distinguished public career here in Connecticut with such admiration. He is generally believed to be best attorney general in the entire United States of America. I appreciate greatly what he has been doing and particularly his point about how you have to be willing to fight for what you believe in. Dick and I have joined together against the Broadwater Plan in the South, which we don\'t think is in the best interest of New York and Connecticut, of our environment, or of our future. It is an honor to be standing side by side with him and a lot of these important fights for Connecticut and New York and America. I want to thank my co-chairs, Susan Cocco and Representative Jason Bartlett. I want to thank the members of the steering committee for my campaign here in Connecticut, and the state legislature who are here-- if they could all raise their hands so I can express my appreciation. The Hartford Mayor, Eddie Perez; State Representative, Kelvin Roldan; Bruce Douglas and the faculty and the staff here; the Bridgeport Mayor, Bill Finch; all of the elected officials and I see my good friend from Massachusetts Congressman, Jim McGovern. I\'m so pleased that you all are here with me. It is exciting to be in this learning corridor, I am thrilled with what I see here. I have been to Hartford many times. I\'ve been here visiting friends, been here doing business, been here supporting people running for office here in Connecticut. I first started coming to Hartford on Sunday afternoons, back when I was in law school. Bill had this old, beat up car. It was called an Opel. I don\'t even know if they make them anymore. It was the kind of car that was held together by duct tape, to be real honest. But sometimes after a long week of studying and all that we did in law school, we\'d get in that old car and we\'d just travel all over Connecticut. We went from one end of the state to the other. It is such a beautiful state. I had so many happy hours here traveling across Connecticut. Of course, I am thrilled to be your neighbor now from New York, living close by in Chappaqua and being able to work on so many of the concerns that affect our two states. Boy, we have a lot of concerns we have to deal with, don\'t we? I assume that all of you know tonight is a red letter night in American history. It is the last time George Bush will give a State of the Union. If we all do our part, next year it\'ll be a Democratic President giving the State of the Union. Let\'s be clear, one thing that President Bush has never understood is that the State of the Union is not about a speech in Washington. It is about the state of the lives of the American people. What is happening in our schools, in our hospitals, in our jobs? It is whether or not we have people who feel that they are moving toward the American dream or whether it looks like it\'s getting further and further away no matter how hard they work. It is about whether or not people will be able to stay in their homes or if they will lose their homes to foreclosures, thereby really undermining the American dream. It is about whether we as a nation will restore our leadership and our moral authority, bring our Constitution out of cold storage, begin to act like Americans again, solving our problems, working toward a better future, making it possible for us to be proud of our country. This campaign that we are waging is one of the most important in our nation\'s history because we are at a turning point. We know that we have so much work to do, and it will take all of us. It\'s not just about those of us who are running. It\'s about all of you and everyone else here in Connecticut and across America who knows that we can do better. I believe with all my heart that America is ready for an election that sets a new agenda, new priorities, that gives us back that confidence and optimism that should be our birthright. I believe that America can solve any problem that we put our minds to. I believe that we can once again be a nation that sets the pace, that creates the innovation and the future awaits. But I believe that we\'ve got to do that by making it very clear what we stand for and what we won\'t stand for. I think it\'s imperative that this election be about the real concerns of the American people. As Nancy said, some people think politics is a game. It\'s exciting; you can have rallies like this. We have so many people outside and we are moving them into an overflow room and that\'s really a great way of demonstrating involvement and participation. But at the end, it\'s about are people better off when we stopped than when we started. Does some child who didn\'t have health care before have it now? Does some hard working man, who has given his all to his job and has seen it moved offshore, feel like he has any hope left? Some working woman who gets up at the crack of dawn and works as hard as she can, ever get equal pay for equal work? These are the kinds of concerns and issues that I care about. I have been in and out of the homes and workplaces and community centers of Americans across our country. And what they want to talk to me about is the insecurity they feel; the fears that they are confronting. I am sure that the President tonight will, as he has for the previous seven years, say that the state of our union is strong. But with all due respect Mr. President, you\'re not on the road with me. Come and meet the people that I meet. Listen to the stories I listen to. Sit at tables in diners and hear what\'s on America\'s mind. I have very different beliefs than the current administration. I believe that everybody in America who\'s willing to work hard for a living should bring home an income above the poverty line. I think that should be part of what we hold out for people and make sure that they have. I believe health care is a moral right, not a privilege for the few and the wealthy. I believe people have the right to organize and bargain collectively and have better wages and working conditions. I believe that our education system is not just about our children taking tests but unlocking their imaginations and their potential. I believe our tax code should be fair to the middle class. It\'s the middle class that built America. It\'s the middle class that creates most of the wealth and the jobs in America, and its time that we have a tax code that reflects that again. I believe that an investment manager on Wall Street making fifty million dollars a year should not pay a lower percentage in taxes than a teacher in Hartford making fifty-thousand dollars a year. ---  I believe that anyone who wants to move a job from Connecticut overseas should not get one penny of tax payer help to do it. There should not be any giveaways in our tax code to create jobs somewhere else than America. I believe every child deserves a chance to make it in life. That\'s why we need a universal pre-kindergarten program, that\'s why we need more help for families, so that they can get their own children off to a good start. I believe we have to start over from scratch with No Child Left Behind and get back to having a partnership between our teachers and our students and the rest of us. I believe that college should be affordable for middle class and working families again. I believe we\'ve got to do more to help those who don\'t go to college- the young men and women who build the buildings we work in. They deserve more job training and apprenticeship programs for a better future. I believe that we\'ve got to restore the Constitution of the United States, we\'ve got to respect our civil rights and our civil liberties, we have to respect the right to privacy and we have to say no loudly and clearly to those like President Bush and Vice President Cheney who don\'t understand American history or American values. I believe we can do better than what we\'ve seen the last seven years with the cronyism and the corruption and the no-bid contracts and the indifference and the incompetence. I believe we can actually start appointing qualified people to the positions we ask them to hold in the government again. I believe we can restore American leadership and moral authority in the world, beginning with ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home within sixty days of when I become President. I believe that when a young man or woman signs up to serve our country in the United States military, we sign up to serve that young man or woman. We owe them the health care, the compensation, and the support and services that they have earned. I believe that we are strongest when we lead with our values. We have the greatest military in the world, there\'s no doubt about that, but military force should be used only as a last resort, not a first resort. That is something we have to make clear to the rest of the world again I believe we can work with other countries to find common ground. I believe that the rest of the world is holding its breath, waiting for a new day. I believe that we can have a new energy policy that is focused on clean renewable energy; that puts millions of people in Connecticut and across America to work in making and delivering that new energy. I believe we can take on global warming and we can do it in a smart way and the United States can be a leader again in coming up with a framework that includes China and India and other countries in helping to save our planet and at the same time see the result in new jobs and new technologies and new exports. I believe we can have trade agreements that honor labor and environmental standards and that are enforceable against countries that violate them. I believe we can get back to fiscal responsibility where, once again, the United States is strong. We\'re not going into debt for the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans but instead we are taking care of the needs of our people at home. If we move back toward fiscal responsibility we will regain our fiscal sovereignty. Right now we borrow money from Chinese to buy oil from Saudis. That is not a good deal for America, I believe we can do better than that. I believe that the next election is not just about who gets elected. I believe the next election is about the next generation. It\'s about all of these young people who are here today. It\'s about your future, your potential, the country and world you will inherit. So how do we translate our beliefs into action? How do we go from a campaign where we make speeches, where people stand up and cheer and clap loudly, into making what we believe real? I think it starts by having an election about what matters, about what we can do together. I have spent a year talking very specifically about my plans - what I will do to create more jobs and return to fiscal responsibility and growth, and lifting people out of poverty and giving them a chance to fulfill their God-given potential. About how we will have health care by opening up the Congressional plan that is there for members of Congress and their staff and federal employees to every single America who wants it and give tax credits for those who can\'t afford it on their own. I know that we have to change our education program from the federal level and I know that we\'ve got to create a better partnership between Washington and Connecticut and Hartford and all of the other communities here. We can do this. There is so much yearning in our country to be part of something bigger than ourselves again. We can provide a really positive view of our future together and we can ask everybody to be a part of it. It\'s not just about electing a president and passing legislation through the Congress. It\'s about what each and every one of us will do. If we have a new energy and global warming strategy in America then we\'re all going to have to conserve more, we\'re going to have to be more energy efficient and look for ways in our schools and our businesses, and our communities to really take on this challenge. I think we\'re up to it. There\'s never been a challenge America hasn\'t met once we made up our minds to do it. I\'m going to work very hard to get us to universal health care. It is long overdue in America and we are going to make it possible for people to get health care coverage for mental health, which should no longer be left out and stigmatized, for prevention that will keep us healthy and well. But then I\'m going to ask all of us to do more to stay healthy and to help each other and young people will lead the way to give us that encouragement, so that we can be as strong as possible. When it comes to education, I want families to invest more in their own children. I\'ve done this work, as Dick was saying, for 35 years. A family is a child\'s first school. Parents are child\'s first teacher. Most parents really want to know what to do, but there\'s not a lot of help out there, is there? We need to give more support to families so that they can be the best possible teachers and parents. We need to have work to be friendlier again. I am so proud of Chris Dodd and what he did to make sure the Family and Medical Leave Act was passed after trying for seven years with two presidential vetoes. We need to work to expand it so that more people don\'t have to make these really tough choices between being a good employee and being a good family member. We\'ve got to relieve a lot of the pressures that so many families feel today because we have care-givers taking care of chronically ill spouses or parents or children. They do it for love. They do it because it\'s the right thing to do. If they stop taking care of each other tomorrow, we\'d have to find $300 billion a year to replace the care that is given out of love. Let\'s start helping families be the best they can be to take care one another. If we are serious about family values, let\'s start valuing families and giving everybody the tools they should have to make the most out of their family lives. Then I\'m going to ask all of us to do more to stay healthy. I will do everything I can to make college affordable with new tax credits for families, with more Pell Grants, with higher levels so that more people can take advantage of them. I want to give two more years of national service to those who need to earn money to go to college, up to $10,000 a year so that you can pay your way if you graduate with debt. If you are willing to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or firefighting or law enforcement, we will forgive your debt because of what you are giving back to our society. But the doors of college are not just open by saying, ""Just open."" They are open because people work hard for it. We are in a competition in America. We are not only competing between states, we are competing with other countries. Each of our young people have to be poised and ready to play a part in this global competition. Nobody can out compete Americans once we, again, make up our mind that we are going to be in this, to make it clear that we are leading, we are the innovators, we are the entrepreneurs. Around the world, we need to have a bipartisan foreign policy again; a lot of the problems we face are not Republican or Democratic problems. We have to repair all the relationships that have been damaged by President Bush, on very continent across the globe. That\'s why it is so important to start withdrawing our troops from Iraq. I have said, as soon as I could, upon taking office if I am so fortunate to do that, I would ask the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the security advisors to give me a plan to begin. I think we can bring out one to two brigades a month. I believe we will tell very clearly by our actions, not just our words, the Iraqi government that they now have to take responsibility for themselves, something they have been avoiding and denying for five years. Then when we bring our sons and daughters home, we will take care of them. It has been heartbreaking to see the neglect and the warehousing that has gone on. We have thirty thousand young Americans who have been injured or wounded in some way, visible and invisible alike. It\'s time that we, as a country led by our president, say we will do whatever it takes. We will fully fund the VA, we will provide outpatient services, we will clear up the backlog of disability claims, we will help our veterans get jobs, we will have a new 21st century G.I. Bill so that these young men and women will get money to go to college and start up a business and buy a home. I\'m excited by what we can do. We will bring the country together not just by hoping and wishing and talking about it but by making it happen because we set goals we will achieve together. There will be a role for everybody to play. Yes, the State of the Union speech will be delivered tonight, but when that is finally over it will be time for all of us to turn our attention to picking the next president. On January 20th, 2009, the next president will be sworn in on the steps of the Capitol. I am so honored and humbled to be in this race because I believe with all my heart that our country can do better. It will have to start on day one facing all of the challenges that will be waiting in the Oval Office, but it will also be able seizing opportunities to chart a new course. If you will stand with me, if you here in Connecticut will support me on February 5th, I promise you that I will get up every single day and wage a winning campaign against whomever the Republicans nominate. I\'ve been up against Republicans for a very long time now. I was thinking the other day, wouldn\'t it be nice if they just announced that they were embarrassed about what happened to the country and they weren\'t going to run for the White House again? Somehow I don\'t think that is going to happen. I think we will have to wage a vigorous and winning campaign. Since I have been on the receiving end of their incoming fire for all of these years and much to their dismay, I am still standing here, I think I know how to take us to victory in November. Let me ask you - are you ready for change in America? Are you ready for an economy that works for everybody? Are you ready for universal health care? Are you ready for an education system that keeps faith with our students and our teachers? Are you ready to reform our government so it works for all Americans again? Are you ready to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home? If you are ready for change I am ready to lead and with your help that is exactly what we will do. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 29, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Florida Primary',"b""Thank you so much. Oh, my goodness. Thank you. Thank you, Florida. Thank you, Florida Democrats. You know, I could not come here to ask in person for your votes, but I am here to thank you for your votes today. (APPLAUSE) This has been a record turnout, because Floridians wanted their voices to be heard on the great issues that affect our country and the world. I am thrilled to have had this vote of confidence that you have given me today. And I promise you I will do everything I can to make sure not only are Florida's Democratic delegates seated, but Florida is in the winning column for the Democrats in 2008. I want to thank my friends, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Congressman Alcee Hastings, Mayor Manny Diaz, and my great friend of so many years, Senator Bill Nelson. You know, this has been an intense election because people really care about what is happening to our country. So many of the people who talk to me every single day are worried about the economy. They're worried about their health care. They're worried about their college education for their children. They're worried about whether we can restore our leadership and standing in the world. Well, I am convinced that, with this resounding vote, with the millions of Americans who will vote next Tuesday, we will send a clear message that America is back and we're going to take charge of our destiny again. (APPLAUSE) I am so grateful to the countless Floridians who, on their own, organized, worked hard, talked to your friends and your neighbors. You made a very big difference. And we know that, as we move forward in this campaign, all of your voices will go with me, because I am not only going to take my 35 years of experience to the White House. I'm going to take your voices, your concerns, your hopes, your dreams. We have a lot of tough decisions to make, but we're Americans. We can make these decisions. We can meet our challenges and seize our opportunities if we start acting like Americans again, we roll up our sleeves, we set about solving our problems. And I want to ask you: Do you agree with me? Because here is what I believe. I believe everyone who works full-time in America should bring home an income that lifts that person out of poverty and gives them and their children a better chance. (APPLAUSE) I believe that every (inaudible) child has a right to quality, affordable health care. I believe that every child has a God-given potential that we could help to develop if we have universal pre- kindergarten and we have a school system that is not so worried about giving tests as about making sure our kids can learn. (APPLAUSE) I believe that our tax system should be fair for everyone. It is wrong that people making $50 million a year on Wall Street pay a lower percentage of their taxes (inaudible) time for us to begin to bring our troops home from Iraq as carefully and responsibly as we can. (APPLAUSE) I believe it is important we do everything to promote better relations in our hemisphere with all of our neighbors and that we continue to support democracy in Cuba. (APPLAUSE) And I believe that we can, working together, feel pride and progress in our country again. You are giving me a tremendous gift, not only with your votes, but with your trust, because I believe that public office is a trust, and I will get up every single day worrying about you, your families, your future. I think it's time we again had a president who put the American people first, and that is what I will try to do. So thank you. Thank you for this tremendous victory tonight. Thank you for all you did to make it possible. Stay with us, because, starting tomorrow, we're going to sweep through the states across our country to February 5th. And we will together not only take back the White House, but take back our country. Thank you all, and God bless you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 31, 2008",b'Remarks at Baptist Convention in Atlanta',"b'Good afternoon. This is, as every day is, the day that the lord hath made so let us rejoice and be glad in it. It is a great honor for me to be here with all of you today. I want to thank Dr. Shaw for his leadership; I want to thank Reverend Thurston for his, as well. Dr. T. DeWitt Smith Jr. for his stewardship and leadership and Dr. P.T Robertson. These four leaders, bringing people together today, deserve our appreciation and our prayers. It is a challenging but necessary endeavor. I should begin by acknowledging that my husband is a Baptist and I have learned during our marriage from sitting around the kitchen table that Baptists have quite the tradition of disagreement. Bill and I have been talking and debating since we first met over thirty-five years ago. Sometimes the decibel level can rise, depending on the passion of the moment, but as you know, that is how we learn - by exploring our differences. By coming to understand that what we share is so much bigger than what separates us. That is how we come to a place of unity and that is what you are doing here, this week. I understand that this is only the second time that the four conventions have come together as one. You are here guided in the spirit of hope by the one who is faithful to us in all things. As we gather today I am reminded of the scripture from Hebrew, which tells us, ""Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who comes is faithful and let us consider how we may serve one another on towards love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together - as some are in the habit of doing - but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching."" I grew up in a different faith tradition, as a Methodist. I know there is at least one bishop from my tradition here who came to show solidarity. I appreciate that. Much like all of you, I was taught from a very early age that my faith carried with it certain obligations. It was my youth minister who took us to see Dr. King preach about our responsibility to our fellow citizens. It was that famous sermon, staying awake though the revolution. It transformed my life as it did so many others who had the great honor to hear directly from Dr. King the calling to be more than on our own, any of us could be. I have been a praying person, luckily, my entire life. I\'m often asked whether or not I am. I am quick to tell people that I was raised by parents who were prayerful and by a church that guided me but had I not been a praying person, one week in the White House would\'ve turned me into a praying person. Everyday I try to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place. Yet, so often, like all of us, I fall short. But each new day, I keep striving and praying to work harder, to correct my imperfections, to improve on the day before and on the day before that. That\'s what I\'ve tried to do in my personal life but also in every aspect of my public life. That\'s how I try to go about the work of breaking barriers and expanding opportunities. Work that I, myself have benefited from throughout my life. That is how I practice my faith. I\'m living by the scripture that says we are all members of God\'s household. That we are called, not asked, not urged, not requested, nor ordered, but called to love one another as Jesus has loved us. Now, I\'m not talking about love that comes easy. I\'m not talking about the greeting card kind of love. I\'m talking about the kind of love that is hard. The deeper, more powerful love in Corinthians that bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. I\'m talking about the kind of love that we have seen in action. The love that fills the heart of my friend, Congressman John Lewis, a man that lead the march in Selma that ended with tear gas, hoses and the crack of the nightstick against his skull as he knelt down to pray. As he knelt down the pray, that nightstick came up and down on a praying man\'s head. That was just one of the many times John was attacked on his journey for justice. But those of us know John Lewis know that he doesn\'t harbor hate in any fiber of his being. That\'s the kind of love I\'m talking about. I\'m talking about the love that fills the heart of President Nelson Mandela. I\'ve had the honor of getting to know him over the years and I attended his inauguration. I will never forget how he stood up on that stage and said how proud he was to welcome all of the dignitaries in attendance, but there were three people he especially wanted to welcome. Then he asked three of his jailers from Robin Island to stand. After twenty-seven years in prison at hard labor, he invited them to share that day. He later told me that, ""I knew if I didn\'t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I\'d still be in prison."" That\'s the kind of love I\'m talking about. Our faith calls us to do what is hard, to give voice to the voiceless, to lift up the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick. But for the past seven years, our leaders have gotten wrong. They\'ve gotten it upside down and backwards. They have given corporate tax breaks to Wall Street and then cut Head Start, child care and drop out prevention. They have lifted up the drug and insurance companies, but vetoed health care for millions of children in need. They have given tax breaks to the oil companies but cut off home heating assistance for our seniors this winter. They have waged a war in Iraq that has taken more than 3,900 of our sons and daughters. But they also regret the poverty, the disease and violence that afflict our brothers and sisters here at home and around the world. Every day you perform good work rooted in the values of our faith. Isn\'t it a shame when we have leaders that talk a lot about values, but then go and do exactly the opposite in betrayal of those same values. It reminds me of what the writer, Elie Wiesel, once observed: The opposite of love is not hate; it is indifference. And for the past seven years, that\'s what we have seen in Washington, an epidemic of indifference. A collective turning of our government\'s back on the least among us. It is in every way possible the opposite of love. When our children attend schools that are separate and unequal in the 21st century, when anyone votes on a broken machine and their vote isn\'t counted, that is the opposite of love. When we see nooses hung in a school yard, when the screams of Selma and Montgomery are clouded by the nightmare of Katrina and Rita, that is the opposite of love. When some members of God\'s household have every advantage while others are shut out of the circle of opportunity, that is the opposite of love. While we may have an income gap and a health gap, and an achievement gap, there is one thing we don\'t have - a potential gap. It is time we gave every single child in this country the chance to live up to his or her God-given ability and potential. That is what I have strived to do for 35 years. With your help we will continue to make that real. It is time to reach out and embrace those of the margin and in the shadows. To usher them back to speech at the table in God\'s household. To ensure that their voices are once again heard in this country. Too many of our fellow citizens feel invisible. They come to up to me, as a woman did today in Little Rock, and said, Senator, what am I to do? I can\'t get the cancer treatment for my chemotherapy anymore-- I can\'t afford it and they won\'t pay for it. It\'s keeping me alive and now I don\'t know where to turn. Or the man who stopped me the other day in New York and said, I\'m about to lose my job. I\'ve got two children to send to college. Where will I get the help? People feel like their deepest concerns, their love of their families, can no longer any matter to those in the highest positions of power. Scripture tells us we cannot just be ""hearers"" of the word we must be ""doers"". We are told that faith without works is dead. I have lived long enough by now to know that works without faith is just too hard. If you cannot dip into that righteous stream and replenish your soul, it is overwhelming, isn\'t it. As I look at the work yet to be finished, I believe we are all called upon to be both hearers and doers. We are called to face the inaction, to deliver real solutions to the real problems that our people are facing. That is the affirmation of our love. I often taught a Sunday School class when I was in Arkansas, and we talked and talked a lot about loving ones neighbor as oneself. I was struck by how absolutely brilliant Jesus was. We really can\'t love someone if we don\'t love ourselves, can we. If we don\'t believe in and have respect for this great gift we have been given, it\'s hard to reach out and love someone, a neighbor, a friend. Then of course to be called upon to love ones enemy seems totally unrealistic in the world we live in. It\'s hard enough getting through the day. But it is what we are called to do. We have to put that calling into action, not only in our individual lives but throughout our society. Let us think about the solutions we can bring about, to give our people hope, but more than hope, results. The tangible evidence that they are no longer invisible, but that their needs, their hurts, their wants, are being tended to. When I say solutions, I mean expanding the earned income tax credit and tying the minimum wage to the congressional wage so that Congress cannot get a raise until the American people do-- especially those who do the hardest work, every day. I mean investing in clean renewable energy and creating create green collar jobs right here in Atlanta and across America. Jobs that cannot be outsourced, jobs that we can train our young people to do, jobs that will move our dependence on foreign oil and give us a chance to give our economy, our environment, our security once again under America\'s control. I believe we need to make it abundantly clear that no one that works full time in America should bring home a wage that keeps that person and his family below the poverty line. Anybody willing to work a fulltime job should have accommodation of income and benefits that lifts them up. That\'s how we build a strong middle class. When I say solutions I mean tuition tax credits, to open the doors of higher education, more grants, more opportunities for national service so that students can earn money to go to college. When I say solutions, I mean tax credits to open the doors of higher education. More Pell grants, more opportunities for national service so that students can earn money to go to college. I mean doubling the funding for historically black colleges and universities like Morehouse and Spelman and Clark Atlanta right here. These have been a bridge to the middle class for generations of young people. That bridge has a sign on it: ""You can not enter if you don\'t have the money."" That isn\'t the way it used to be. Some of us are old enough to remember as I am. I got a loan from the federal government when I went to law school. It was about 2% interest so when I graduated I wanted to go work for the Children\'s Defense Fund and work for Marian Wright Edelman. I didn\'t want to go to work for a big law firm. I wanted to defend the abused and neglected kids, the kids in the foster care system, the kids without health care and education. But if I had been graduating with tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt, I\'m not sure I could have done that. We need also to offer to young people who graduate with debt the opportunity to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or law enforcement and let them pay off their loans over time so they don\'t become an indentured servant to these student loan companies that hold them in the thrall of predatory interest rates. Opening the doors of college is not only good for the young people who walk across that bridge, it is essential for the future of our country. When I say solutions I mean health care for everyone - no exceptions, no excuses - every man, woman, and child to have quality affordable health care because that\'s the only way we can close the infant mortality gap, close the life expectancy cap, ensure that people get the primary care from a doctor not from an emergency room. When I say solutions I mean fixing this housing crisis because a house is more than just your greatest source of wealth. It\'s the center of your family, it\'s where you make memories and develop relationships. No one should take that away from you because of the subprime abusive practices that so many mortgage lenders engage in without any supervision or oversight from the federal government. We\'ve got to have a moratorium on home foreclosures for ninety days so we can help people stay in their homes. And let\'s freeze those interest rates for five years so they don\'t keep going up and forcing more and more people into debt, into foreclosure. And let\'s put a cap on the interest rates that credit card companies can charge and tell them they\'ve got to start explaining to people in big print, not little print, what the terms and conditions are. No one should force you into an ocean of debt because your health care costs are going up, your education and energy costs are going up, but your wages aren\'t. The average American family has lost $1,000 in income in the last seven years. African American families have lost $2,600. Contrast that with what happened during the nineties when the typical family, including African American families, saw a rise of $7,000 in their income and more people lifted out of poverty than in any time in our countries recent history. We know how to turn this around but we have to come together to seek common ground wherever possible and to stand our ground whenever necessary. And if we truly love our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, then we will end this war in Iraq that has claimed so many of their lives and injured tens of thousands of them. And we will care for them when they came home, because I believe if you serve our country, our country should serve you. And you should get the health care, the compensation, the jobs that you deserve. Every day in America hundreds of thousands of our veterans are homeless, are jobless, are being turned away from treatment and health care because there\'s no space for them. I think we\'ve got to do everything we can to make it clear that we will tend to our veterans starting with our youngest veterans with a 21st century G.I. Bill of Rights for money for college, and home ownership, and a business, all the way back to our oldest veterans. Let\'s pay particular attention to the Vietnam veterans who fought and served during that conflict who did not get the help and the services that they had earned. And we will restore our moral leadership in the world to ensure that we never fight a war like this again. Will all of this be easy? Of course not. Will we get it done all at once? No, but we will make our greatest efforts, just as all of you have done. That is at the heart of what brings you together - your work every day on the front lines of our communities addressing some of our most difficult challenges: poverty and hunger, HIV/AIDS and disease, disaster relief and so much more. It is a role that your churches have played throughout our nation\'s history. Our churches have served as a bedrock of our community, a refuge in times of need, the heart of our great movement for justice. You cannot have the right kind of change without justice. Change happens whether we want it or not - that is a part of life. What we must be committed to is change with justice, change that makes a difference in the lives of every single American. We know that we have a lot of work to do but I come before you with the hope that this great nation that we love, that has given all of us so much, whose struggles, trials and tribulations over the centuries have both broken hearts and inspired us, that we will once again begin acting like Americans. There isn\'t anything our nation can\'t do to heal up the wounds that have been inflicted, make it possible for each and every person to again feel he or she counts. We can do this. We can lift up the spirits of those most in need. And our country deserves a president who rolls up his or her sleeves and joins you as a partner in that work. That is what I wish to do, to work with you to spur not just each other but all Americans towards love and good deeds and to renew the promise of this great nation. Thank you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 3, 2008","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b'STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning, everyone. Only two days until Super Tuesday, and our brand-new ABC News poll shows voters following -- intensely following the race on both sides. For the Republicans, John McCain has opened up a two-to-one lead over Mitt Romney, 48-24, with Mike Huckabee third at 16 and Ron Paul fourth with 7 percent of the vote. The Democratic race is approaching a dead heat. Hillary Clinton\'s at 47, Barack Obama at 43, just outside the polls\' margin of error. The general election matchups are also basically tied. Clinton gets 46 to McCain\'s 49, but Obama gets 49 to McCain\'s 46. With that, let\'s go to our first guest, Senator Hillary Clinton, who joins us this morning from one of the Super Tuesday battlegrounds, St. Louis, Missouri. Good morning, Senator. CLINTON: Good morning, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: That poll shows that Senator Obama may have an edge against Senator McCain in November, and he\'s been making the argument this weekend that he can get voters, independents and Republicans, that are just closed off to you. How do you respond? CLINTON: Well, I think that my record and the elections that I\'ve been through demonstrate that I\'m more likely, at the end of the day, to be able to attract voters who know how serious the issues are that we face, with a war to end in Iraq and a war to resolve in Afghanistan, an economy that is slipping into a recession and not working for most people. And I think it\'s also clear that on issue after issue, I can draw a very stark contrast with Senator McCain, if he happens to be the nominee. Take health care. I intend to go into the general election standing for a core Democratic value and, frankly, a moral principle to me, and that is universal health care, everyone covered, no exceptions, no excuses. And, finally, as you know, George, I\'ve been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for about 16 years now, and I\'m still here, because I have been vetted, I have been tested. There\'s unlikely to be any new surprises. People understand who I am, where I\'m from, what I do, what I believe in. And I think that I can go up against Senator McCain or any of the Republicans and be able to defend our positions, put them forward to the American people and make an affirmative case as to why I should be the president. STEPHANOPOULOS: The implication there, of course, is there could surprises with Senator Obama. And your chief strategist, Mark Penn, put out a memo yesterday where he made that point. He said voters have very little information about Senator Obama, and once the Republican regime begins to methodically attack him, he will lose independent support. What don\'t those voters know about Barack Obama right now? CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s fair to say, George, that it\'s not so much about him as it is about me, that, you know, I have been through these Republican attacks over and over and over again, and I believe that I\'ve demonstrated that, much to the dismay of the Republicans, I not only can survive, but thrive. I think that\'s a very important difference to take into this election, because you know well, as I do, that the Republicans are not going to go quietly away. They want to win, obviously. They want to keep the White House. They\'ll run a very vigorous campaign. They will end up being united, as we will. And then it will be two people on the stage talking about who can protect and defend our country, who can restore our leadership and moral authority around the world, and who can actually produce results for the American people. That\'s what I will be talking about. And I think I have a very good chance of being able to make that case and withstand whatever comes my way. STEPHANOPOULOS: But your campaign is saying that Senator Obama will wither under this Republican attack machine. What argument will they make? Why will he be -- why will he wither under that attack? Well, we\'ve had, by most standards, a very cordial and civil campaign. CLINTON: I know people look at this campaign and say, ""Well, you know, somebody said this and somebody said that,"" but by all accounts, there haven\'t been the kind of attack ads that you\'re going to see in the general election. There haven\'t been the tens of millions of dollars spent against either of us that will definitely come our way. I do have some Republicans who are already working against me. There\'s some gentleman in Texas, who seems quite determined to run robo-calls and the like, but people brush that off. So we\'ve had a campaign that has been an incredible experience personally for me and I think for all of the candidates. And, truly, whoever is our nominee will be making history by the very fact of becoming the nominee. But I think that\'s when the hard work starts. You know, general elections are much more contested. The other side has no compunction about raising any issue against whomever they\'re running against, and we haven\'t seen that tested and vetted experience in this primary. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator... CLINTON: And, frankly, you know, in his prior election in Illinois, Senator Obama didn\'t face anyone who ran attack ads against him. He ran against a very weak opponent, without resources or credibility. So I believe that this will be a very tough fought general election. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama agrees with you that the Democrat has to provide a clear contrast with Senator McCain on national security. Here\'s how he put it the other day. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) OBAMA: The way to win a debate with John McCain or any Republican who\'s nominated is not by having the Democrats nominate someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq, who agreed with him in voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran, who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don\'t like. (END AUDIO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: He says he provides the contrast you can\'t. CLINTON: Well, I think elections are about the future, and what voters are going to be thinking about is who can best get us out of Iraq, who can do it in the most responsible and careful way, who will have the credibility, the strength and the experience to convey to the rest of the world that we are undoing this disastrous policy, but you better not in any way doubt America\'s resolve to protect and defend ourselves here at home and around the world. And I think the contrast between me and Senator McCain could not be stronger. He wants to be there for 100 years. It would be fine with him, he said. You know, if I don\'t start getting our troops outwithin 60 days, you\'ll be surprised, because that\'s what I intend to do. So get them out within 60 days, begin that process, OK to stay 100 years. I think voters will see a very stark contrast. And I want to say something else. You know, Senator Obama consistently misstates what I had said and really tries to gloss over his answer to a question in an early debate. The question was very specific -- would you, without preconditions, meet with five of the worst dictators, including Ahmadinejad from Iran and others, without preconditions, personally, as president? He said yes. I said no. That has nothing to do with whether or not we would havediplomatic efforts with all of the countries. I\'ve been a longtime advocate of having diplomatic processes with Iran and Syria. STEPHANOPOULOS: So you\'re open to direct contact with all those countries? CLINTON: I think it\'s imperative. STEPHANOPOULOS: You\'re open to direct contact with... CLINTON: Absolutely. STEPHANOPOULOS: ... all those countries? CLINTON: Well, with Iran and Syria, most certainly. I have said that. But it would be at low level diplomatic efforts, between our ambassadors and between our diplomats, because I don\'t think a president should put the prestige of the United States on the line to meet with these people unless you have some idea of what is going to happen. And I\'m always a little amused when Senator Obama goes around quoting President Kennedy, when he was running for the presidency, about how you should never be afraid to negotiate. But then if you look at the actual transcript of what President Kennedy said in the debates with Vice President Nixon, he said he would not meet with Khrushchev unless there had been a lot of groundwork laid. That is the appropriate position for the president of the UnitedStates to take. And so, I really hope that Senator Obama will quit deliberately misstating what I said in order to avoid scrutiny for what he says. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let\'s look at health care, another contrastbetween you and Senator Obama. He\'s been pressing that case this weekend. The key difference, as you point out, is you would require everyone to have health insurance. You believe that will get to universal coverage. He would not. Here\'s what Senator Obama said about that in the debate. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) OBAMA: You can mandate it, but there\'s still going to be people who can\'t afford it. And if they cannot afford it, then the question is what are you going to do about it? Are you going to fine them? Are you going to garnish their wages? (END AUDIO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: You didn\'t get the chance to answer that question in the debate. What is the answer to those two questions? Will you have fines for people who don\'t buy health care, don\'t apply -- don\'t go by the mandate? Will you garnish their wages? CLINTON: George, let\'s put this in context, because this is a big difference between us. I think universal health care is a core Democratic value and a moral principle, and I\'m absolutely going to doeverything I can to achieve that. You know, if you look at my plan, it\'s a misstatement to say that people won\'t be able to afford it, because I have a very detailed approach about giving people health care tax credits,limiting -- I\'m the only person who does -- limiting the percentage of what you would have to pay for a premium to a low percent of yourincome. This plan has been examined by independent experts, and they agree with me, just as they agreed with Senator Edwards, as well, that if you do not start with a plan that attempts to achieve universal health care, you will not get there. The insurance companies will continue to cherry-pick. The emergency rooms will be crowded. And once again, we will slide into the morass we\'re in now, where more and more people are uninsured and we don\'t get the quality outcomes that we should. With respect to how do you get people to do it, I find this somewhat bewildering. Senator Obama has a mandate. He has a mandate on children. He has talked a lot about requiring people, if they show up to get some kind of health care, like in the emergency room, and they don\'t have health insurance, hitting them right then to make sure that they get some kind of health insurance. Well, I don\'t think you should wait until someone\'s in distress or sick. I think you should look to sign people up when they come into contact with the health-care system or government agencies. About 20 percent of the people who don\'t have health insurance in America today could well afford it, even at the cost that it is, which is exorbitant. So what we\'ve got to do is have shared responsibility. Everybody has to pay something, but, obviously, on a sliding scale. That\'s why my health care tax credit... STEPHANOPOULOS: But let me interrupt you there. CLINTON: ... and the premium cap will work. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me interrupt you there, because the other night at the debate, you said that you and Senator Edwards bit the bullet on this question... CLINTON: That\'s right. STEPHANOPOULOS: ... of mandates, and Senator Edwards was quite clear in his plan. He said if people still didn\'t buy the insurance, their wages would be garnished. And I still haven\'t heard, if people can afford it and they don\'t buy the insurance, will their wages be garnished under your plan? Will they have to pay fines? CLINTON: Well, they don\'t have to pay fines, George. We want them to have insurance. We want it to be affordable. And what I have said is that there are a number of ways of doingthat. Now, there\'s not just one way of getting to that. I think you can automatically enroll people, and you will then say you\'ve got to be part of this. It\'s what Senator Obama does for children. Clearly, he has a mandate, and he has a means of enforcing it or at least it appears he does. And what I have learned over the last many years is that I\'m sure the Congress has some ideas about this. But if you don\'t start with universal health care, if you don\'t say everybody\'s going to be in the system, we\'ll never get there. And if you look at some of the misleading mailings that Senator Obama is sending out around the country, honest to goodness, it looks like it was written by the health-insurance companies. It\'s so reminiscent of old ""Harry and Louise"" talking about how, oh, the sky will fall if we try to have universal health care. He\'s playing right in to all of the arguments against this core value of the Democratic Party. I will stand on the stage with John McCain and engage in that debate. Why would we want a nominee who leaves people out? And Senator McCain will say, well, I\'ve got a plan and, yes, it leaves people out. So we\'re even. That is not the kind of contrast we should be drawing going into this general election. STEPHANOPOULOS: But, yet, Senator Clinton, we actually have that mailing and let me show our viewers quickly what you were talking about, because you referred to it. It says that Hillary\'s plan will -- excuse me, let me read this again -- ""forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can\'t afford it. You pay a penalty if you don\'t."" And I want to bear down on this question one more time, because they\'re claiming this issue of the penalty. And a lot of independent health care experts, many who worked with you in 1994, say that without these enforcement mechanisms, you simply can\'t get to universal coverage, you can\'t claim to have universal coverage, so there\'s no difference between your plan and Senator Obama\'s. And, I mean, you talked about automatic enrollment. Will you garnish wages of people who don\'t comply, don\'t buy the insurance? CLINTON: George, we will have an enforcement mechanism. Whether it\'s that or it\'s some other mechanism through the tax system or automatic enrollments. But you\'re missing, I believe, the key point. If you don\'t start with universal health care, and I have very aggressive cost controls and quality improvements, and my health care tax credits plus the premium cap that I am the only person to put in to a health care plan to say, your income will be adjusted so that a small percentage will be always the limit of what you have to pay for premiums. If you don\'t do what I am saying we do, we will never even attempt to get to universal health care. And the reason why I think there are a number of mechanisms, going after people\'s wages, automatic enrollment, when you are at the place of employment, you will be automatically enrolled, whatever the mechanism is is not as important as, number one, the fundamental commitment to universal health care, the appreciation that, with health care tax credits and with a premium cap, it will be affordable for everyone. And the misleading information that Senator Obama\'s campaign is putting out, that I will force people to do it even if they can\'t afford it, is absolutely untrue. CLINTON: There will be mechanisms to enable everyone to afford it. We have costed this out, and we will be able to achieve it. So isn\'t it better that we start with a system that gets everybody in than starting with a plan that leaves 15 million people out to start, which will only get bigger and bigger as time goes on? STEPHANOPOULOS: Another issue in the debate, the other night, was this issue of a driver\'s license for illegal immigrants. You now say that you are not for it. Senator Obama is for it. And, yesterday, the largest Spanish language paper in the United States, in Los Angeles, ""La Opinion,"" cited it when they endorsed Barack Obama. They said, ""We were disappointed with Senator Clinton\'s calculated opposition to driver\'s licenses for the undocumented, which contrasts markedly from the forceful argument in support made by Obama. We understand that this is an extremely controversial issue, but we believe there is only one right position and it is that of the Senator from Illinois."" Are you worried that this is going to hurt you in the Latino community? CLINTON: No, because I think I have the right position. I think this is a diversion from what has to be comprehensive immigration reform. And I think, again, it is not a fair statement. You know, I attempted to support my governor as he tried to do something that is, admittedly, controversial, but I said at the time it was not something that I supported. When that didn\'t work, it was very clear that, you know, my position has been consistent. I don\'t think we should be giving driver\'s licenses to people who are not documented. You put so many difficult obstacles in the way here. You\'re going to ask people in motor vehicle departments to basically overlook the immigration laws of America. You\'re going to ask people to turn a blind eye and accept this form of identification. I think that is not the right way to go. I believe we should be putting as much pressure on comprehensive immigration reform as possible. And my supporters in California and in New York and across the country, Latino and others, understand exactly why this is the position we should be taking. And I intend to push for comprehensive immigration reform upon taking office as president. STEPHANOPOULOS: We\'re just about out of time. What do you make of the fact that Ann Coulter says she\'s going to support you if John McCain gets the Republican nomination? CLINTON: Well, that this will be an interesting election, all the way through, George. You never know -- strange bedfellows and all of that. But I honestly believe that it would be a tremendous contest between Senator McCain and myself. I think I can draw the contrasts and stand on that stage with him. You know as well as I do that, at the end of every election, independent voters are often drawn back to a fundamental question: Who can protect and defend the United States of America? And although security is not foremost on the agenda, there is no predicting what the agenda will look like come next fall. And I believe that I am much better positioned, by record and experience, by the values and the opinions that I\'ve expressed in this campaign, to go one-on-one with John McCain. And, you know, at some point, I\'m happy to have any voters, although this one took me somewhat by surprise. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Clinton, thanks very much for your time this morning. CLINTON: Good to talk to you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 5, 2008","b'Remarks Following the ""Super Tuesday"" Primaries and Caucuses'","b'Thank you so much. Tonight, we are hearing the voices of people across America. People of all ages and of all colors, all faiths and all walks of life. People on the day shift, the night shift, the late shift with the crying baby. Moms and dads who want a better world for our children. Young people who deserve a world of opportunity. All those who aren\'t in the headlines, but have always written America\'s story. After seven years of a President who listens only to the special interests, you\'re ready for a President who brings your voice, your values, and your dreams to your White House. Tonight, in record numbers, you voted not just to make history - but to remake America. People in American Samoa, Arkansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee... and the great state of New York. On just one really serious note, we want to keep the people of Arkansas and Tennessee in our prayers. They suffered horrible tornados tonight. We just talked to some of our folks there and people have died in both states, and our thoughts and prayers go out to them in this moment of their need. Tonight thought is your - tonight is America\'s night. It\'s not over yet, because polls are still open in California for a few more minutes. I hope all of you will join our campaign at www.hillaryclinton.com because you know - you know that politics isn\'t a game. It\'s not about who\'s up or who\'s down. It\'s about your lives, your families, your futures. It\'s about the people who have shared their problems with me, looking for solutions. The mother whose insurance company wouldn\'t pay for her child\'s treatment. The couple so determined to send their daughter to college, they\'re willing to mortgage their home with a sub-prime second mortgage. The man who asked me what to do after training the person who will take his job in another country, the veterans who come home only to find they don\'t have the healthcare, the compensation, and the services they need. It\'s also about the people who want to seize America\'s opportunity. It\'s about the unions and businesses who are training people for green collar jobs. It\'s about the auto companies and auto workers who want higher gas mileage cars so we can compete with the rest of the world. It\'s about our scientist and researchers who want to be able to do stem cell research right here in the United States of America. It\'s about our contractors and construction workers who want to get to work to rebuild America from the bridges in Minnesota to the levies in New Orleans. For seven years, we have seen President Bush\'s answer. They don\'t know what\'s at stake in this election, but we do. We know what we need is someone ready on day one to solve our problems and restore our opportunities. Because when the bright lights are off and the cameras are gone, who can you count on to listen to you, to stand up for you, to deliver solutions for you? Well, the Republicans want eight more years of the same. They see tax cuts for the wealthy - and they say, why not some more? They see nine trillion dollars in debt - and say, why not trillions more? They see five years in Iraq - and they say, why not a hundred more? Well, they\'ve got until January 20, 2009 - and not one day more. Now we know the Republicans won\'t give up the White House without a fight, well let me be clear, I won\'t let anyone swift boat this country\'s future. Together we\'re going to take back America because I see an America where our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top, where prosperity is shared and we create good jobs that stay right here in America. I see an America where we stand up to the oil companies and the oil producing countries, where we launch a clean energy revolution and finally confront the climate crisis. I see an America where we don\'t just provide health care for some people, or most people, but for every single man, woman and child in this country - no one left out. I see an America where when a young man or woman signs up to serve our country, we sign up to serve them too. An America with a 21st century GI bill of rights to help veterans go to college, buy a home or start their own businesses. I see an America respected around the world again, that reaches out to our allies and confronts our shared challenges - from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics. That\'s the America I see - that\'s the America we will build together. I am so lucky to have the most extraordinary staff, volunteers, and supporters... And I am so grateful for all those long hours and late nights that you\'ve been putting in. And I want to thank the most important people in my life, first Bill and Chelsea, for their incredible love. They have done so much day in and day out and I want to thank all my friends and family, particularly my mother, who was born before women could vote, and is watching her daughter on this stage tonight. I also want to congratulate Senator Obama for his victories tonight. And I look forward to continuing our campaign and our debate about how to lead this country better off in the next generation, because that is the work of my life - that is why I started my career fighting for abused and neglected children, children who have drawn the short straw in life, because this nation gave me every opportunity and we can do the same for every child. We must continue to be a nation that strives always to give each of our children a better future, a nation of optimists who believe our best days are yet to come, a nation of idealists holding fast to our deepest values, that we are all created equal, that we all deserve to fulfill our God-given potential, that we are destined for progress together. It is the ideal inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty in this great city, that has overlooked our harbors through wars and depressions and the dark days of September 11, the words we all know that give voice to America\'s embrace: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free"" - a constant reminder that here in America, we face our challenges and we embrace all of our people. So today we say with one voice, ""Give us the child who wants to learn, give us the people in need of work, give us the veterans who need our care. We say give us the economy to rebuild and this war to end, give us this nation to heal, this world to lead, this moment to seize."" I know we\'re ready. Thank you all and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 9, 2008",b'Remarks at the Virginia Jefferson-Jackson Dinner',"b""Hello Virginia Democrats - that sounds so good. Let me ask you something. Are you ready to take back the White House and take back our country? Well, so am I and I am so ready to see Virginia in the winning Democratic column in November. I am delighted and honored to be here with you this evening. I want to thank delegate Jennifer McClellan for not only that introduction, but her commitment to public service and leadership. And it is a special treat to be here with Governor Tim Kaine and former Governor Mark Warner, current Richmond Mayor and former Governor Doug Wilder. I want to thank you so much for sending Jim Webb to the Senate. And I hope he will soon be joined by the next Senator Warner from the state of Virginia. I want to acknowledge your congressional delegation, Congressman Moran, and Scott, and Voucher, and the Executive Director of the party Amy Reger who has done a wonderful job with this huge Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner. Now let me ask you for a moment to imagine that it is finally January 20, 2009 - somebody standing on the steps of the Capitol will place his or her hand on the Bible and be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States. Our task tonight is to make sure that president is a Democrat because after 7 long years of George W. Bush, 7 years of incompetence, corruption and cronyism, 7 years of government of the few, by the few, and for the few, the next president will face tremendous challenges. As the president walks into the Oval Office, waiting there will be 2 wars, an economy in trouble, the health care crisis, the energy crisis, all of the problems that I hear about every day from people across America. People who whisper to me about the mortgages they can't afford, the medical bills that wiped out their life savings, the tuition bills that cut short their children's dreams. People who work the day shift and the night shift because they want the world for their children, people whose names don't make the headlines but who have all re-written America's story. It's about the woman who grabbed my hand and told me her insurance company wouldn't pay for the treatment her child needed. It's about the man who asked me what to do after his job was shipped overseas and he was told to train his replacement. It's about the couple so determined to send their daughter to college that they mortgaged their home with a subprime mortgage and now may lose that as well. It's about the dedicated government employees who stop me and tell me that they are working hard despite the all out assault on government workers by this administration. For me, politics isn't' a game. It's not about who is up, or who is down. It's about your livers, your families, and your future. And isn't it about time you had a president who brought your voice and your values to your White House. This election is also about all those Americans who want to seize this moment. To build the kind of future that we know awaits. It's about teachers determined to see their students succeed in this new century and young people, hungry for opportunities their parents never dreamed of. It's about the businesses and unions training people for green collar jobs, the high wage, high-skilled, high-energy jobs of the future. It's about the scientists and researchers who want to do stem cell research and find treatments and cures for devastating diseases. It's about our contractors and construction workers who want to rebuild America from the bridges in Minnesota to the levees in New Orleans. It's about the men and women who wear the uniform of our country who deserve a Commander in Chief who knows they are magnificent but that force should be used as a last resort and not a first resort. For 7 long years we have neither addressed our problems, nor seized our opportunities. We have tried it President Bush's way - concentrate wealth, hoard power, disregard science, shred the Constitution, smear dissenters, impugn patriots, go it alone in the world wherever you can and cooperate only when you have to. And now with Senator McCain as the likely nominee, the Republicans have chosen more of the same. President Bush has already put his stamp of approval on Senator McCain's conservative credentials and I am sure that will help. Now I understand there are some people who say they can't tell the difference between me and George Bush. I don't think anyone here believes that the Republicans are confusing me and George Bush. And certainly, having fought George Bush every day for the last 7 years, I will be among those most happy to see the moving van leave the white house. Voters certainly won't have any problems seeing the differences. Senator McCain wants to keep troops in Iraq for 50-100 years. I will start bringing them home within 60 days of becoming president of our country. Senator McCain has admitted he doesn't understand the economy. I have a strategy to end the housing crisis, create 5 million new clean energy jobs and rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class again. And one thing we know for sure is that Senator McCain won't deliver universal health care. In fact I am the only candidate left in this race - Democrat or Republican - with a health care plan to cover every single man, woman and child. Because you see I believe health care is a fundamental human right and a moral obligation of the United States of America finally to achieve for our people. If I'm your nominee, you'll never have to be worried that I will be knocked out of the ring because I do have the strength and experience to lead this country and I am ready to go toe to toe with Senator McCain whenever and wherever he desires. I am ready to make the case for the Democratic Party from universal health care to making it clear that once again America is open for business to the rest of the world, and the era of cowboy diplomacy is over. I am ready to make your case because your voices are the change we seek and together we will take back the White House and take back America because I see an America where our economy works for everyone not just those at the top, where our prosperity is shared and we create good jobs that stay right here in the Untied States. I see an America where we stand up to the oil companies and the oil-producing countries, where we do launch a clean energy revolution and finally confront our climate crisis. I am well aware that we cannot be serious about our energy policy and our security, our environment, and our economy until the two oil men leave the White House. But when they do, we will be ready. I see an America where we say that 47 million people uninsured - more than 950,000 right here in Virginia alone - is a disgrace. And we don't just provide health care for some people or most people, but for everyone with no one left out. I see an America where we have schools worthy of our children starting with pre-kindergarten. I know how passionate Governor Kaine has been advocating for pre-kindergarten programs right here in the Commonwealth. I see an America where college is affordable again for hard working families. I see an America where when young men and women sign up to serve our country, we sign up to serve them too. An America with a 21st century GI Bill Of Rights to help our veterans go to college, buy a home, and start their own businesses. I see an America respected around the world again where we reach out to our allies to confront our shared challenges from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics. That is the America we will build together. An America where the next generation is always better off than the last. That has been the work of my life. It's why I started my career fighting for abused and neglected children. Children who had drawn the short straw in life because I believe all of our children deserve the chance to fulfill their own God-given potential. This nation gave me every opportunity and I believe we can do the same for every child. It's a matter of living up to the ideals that our founders, many of them Virginians, set forth more than 200 years ago, that we are all created equal, all entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now neither Senator Obama nor I - nor many of you in this room - were fully included in that original vision. But it was the beginning of an extraordinary journey. A journey rooted in our ideals when our laws were not. A movement of men and women in each generation, who led us through unchartered territory, to higher ground. The abolitionists like Harriet Tubman, who told the people she led to freedom,' if you are tired, keep going. If you are scared, keep going. If you are hungry, keep going. If you want to taste freedom, keep going.' The audacious women and a few brave men who gathered at Seneca Falls, New York, back in 1848, demanding their rights including the right to vote. It took more than 70 years of struggle and ridicule, and grinding hard work, and only one of them lived long enough to see women pass their first ballot. The progressives who met the inequities of a new age with a new sprit of reform - back in the progressive era, even the Republicans understood that we were all in this together. And then we had so much progress during the 21st century. And as men and women marched and picketed, as they faced dogs and tear gas as they risked their lives, they did so because they looked into the eyes of their children and they saw the promise of a better future and they decided to just keep going. Because of them, my generation grew up taking for granted that women could vote. Because of them my daughter's generation took for granted that children of all colors would attend school together. Because of them, Virginia made history becoming the first state in America to elect an African American governor, Governor Wilder. Because of them, Senator Obama and I share this stage today and because of them and because of you, less than a year from now, one of us will take the oath of office. And children of today and of future generations will take it for granted that a woman or an African American can be President of the United States. That is the genius of our constitution. It was crafted to expand as our hearts do, allowing each generation to lead us closer to that more perfect union. That is America's purpose. That is our purpose as Democrats and our mission in this election - to build a nation that is more inclusive, more equal, more fair, more free, and more just. That work is never finished but we get better as we go. Always striving to heed the words inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty, the words that give voice to America's embrace: give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Lady liberty has overlooked the New York harbor through wars and depression, and through the dark day of September 11, a constant reminder that here in America we face our challenges and embrace all of our people. So today we say with one voice - give us the child who wants to learn, give us the people in need of work, give us the veterans who need of care, give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end, give us this nation to lift this world, to lead this moment to seize. I know we're ready and I need your help. I need your involvement and your participation starting tonight. Together we can make history. Come join me, come to my website hillaryclinton.com, be part of this campaign, work until Tuesday when Virginia holds its primary because it is not me you're working for, it is you. It is your future, your family, and your beloved country. We have an opportunity together to make history, but not just to change who lives in the White House but to change our hearts. To change our attitudes. To once again know that there isn't anything America can't do if we start acting like Americans. Please join this campaign, be part of making history and giving us back the country we love to be proud of again, and to make progress towards that more perfect union. Thank you and God bless you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 12, 2008","b'Remarks Following the Maryland, Virginia, and District of Columbia Primaries'","b'Oh, it is so wonderful to be here. (APPLAUSE) I want to thank the congressman so much. He does an extraordinary job representing you, and I know how proud you are to have him as the chairman of one of the most important committees in the United States Congress. Thank you so much. He and his wife, Carolina, have been friends and colleagues for a long time, and so it is especially a privilege to be introduced by him tonight and to be part of this extended family, because it is family, and I am proud to be part of the El Paso, Texas, family starting right now. (APPLAUSE) There are so many people who have come tonight and who have helped make this extraordinary event possible. I want to thank Rick and Louis Bolanos. They are part of Texas Veterans for Hillary. And the Bolanos family is so well-known because of their service to our country, and I am honored to have them supporting me. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) I want to thank my old friend, Alicia Chacon, the former county judge, the UTEP Young Democrats for hosting me tonight... (APPLAUSE) ... Norma Flores Fisher, Danny Achando (ph), Aaron Rosas (ph), Senator Eliot Shapleigh. I want to thank the students and the staff of the university, and I want to thank my huge, Texas-sized steering committee. (APPLAUSE) Well, I can\'t think of any better place to start our campaign for Texas than right here in El Paso. And I am honored to be an honorary miner. (APPLAUSE) And we\'re going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks, bringing our message about what we need in America, the kind of president that will be required on day one to be commander-in-chief to turn the economy around. I\'m tested. I\'m ready. Let\'s make it happen. (APPLAUSE) You know, there\'s a great saying in Texas -- you\'ve all heard it -- ""all hat and no cattle."" Well, after seven years of George Bush, we need a lot less hat and a lot more cattle. Texas needs a president who actually understands what it\'s going to take to turn the economy around, to get us universal health care, to save hardworking Americans homes from foreclosure at the abusive practices of the mortgage companies. We have a lot of work to do. And I know that El Paso understands that picking a president is one of the most important jobs we\'re going to do in this country in the next couple of weeks. When I think about Texas, I think about, as the congressman said, coming here 35 years ago. I was working for the Democratic National Committee. And I was going along the border registering voters. And we had the greatest time. I met some of the best friends that I\'ve ever had in my life. We had a chance to go into people\'s homes. We ate a lot of great food. (APPLAUSE) We listened to some wonderful music. And we registered a few voters, too. Well, here I am back in Texas, and I\'m asking the children of those voters to vote for me for their future. (APPLAUSE) You know, some people, when they run for a political office, they only think about the next election. But I like to think about the next generation, because that\'s what I think this election is about. It is about what kind of country and world we\'re going to pass onto the young people who are students here, to that beautiful young boy who came up and gave me the flowers, for each of our children and grandchildren. Are we going to give them the same shot at the American dream that many of us were given? Well, if we make the right decision in this election, we sure are. We\'re going to give our young people not only confidence and optimism, but real results, 21st-century solutions for what we need to do to fix our problems, meet our challenges, and seize our opportunities. As I travel around the country, I know from what people tell me that a lot of really hard-working folks are concerned. You know, they\'re working as hard as they can, but they don\'t feel like they\'re getting ahead. They\'re not getting the kind of health care and educational opportunities that they want for themselves and their children. I hear the mothers who tell me they don\'t know what they\'re going to do because they can\'t afford health care, and they have sick children, and the only place they have to turn to is the emergency room. I\'ve been in the homes of families that are on the brink of losing the American dream because they got sucked into one of these subprime mortgages and they can\'t afford to stay in their home. They\'re looking for somebody to say this was wrong and we will help you. I meet the people who work hard every single day but can\'t pay their energy bills; they can\'t fill up their gas tank. They\'re looking for answers. And then I meet all of the people who want to solve the problems, the young people who are focused on a better future and want to make it happen. (APPLAUSE) There isn\'t anything America can\'t do if we make up our minds to do it. Every once of us, every single one of us knows that tomorrow can be better than today, but it doesn\'t happen just by wishing it or hoping for it. It happens by working really, really hard to make it a reality to give everybody a better chance. (APPLAUSE) I see an America where everyone willing to work hard has a job with a rising income. And if you\'re willing to work full-time, you have wages that lift you out of poverty. I want to make sure every American who works full-time has a minimum wage of at least $9.50. (APPLAUSE) In fact, I would require that Congress cannot raise its own salaries unless it raises the minimum wage. (APPLAUSE) I see an America where health care is a moral right, not a privilege, where every man, woman and child has access to quality, affordable health care. We can do this. We can have a uniquely America solution. We already have a plan that we can make available to everyone. It\'s the plan that provides health care to members of Congress. And it works well for members of Congress and our staffs and federal employees. It has lots of choices. I want to make sure you have the same choices as your member of Congress does. (APPLAUSE) And we will help people pay for it because I want everybody, everybody, to have quality, affordable health insurance. And I also see an America where we end our dependence on foreign oil and we start growing and making our own energy right here in Texas and America. (APPLAUSE) Aren\'t you tired of paying those exorbitant costs at the gas pump? Aren\'t you tired of sending billions of our dollars to countries that turn around and use it against us? (APPLAUSE) Well, why don\'t we get smart and start creating our own energy? We have the sun; we have the wind; we can grow the products; we can turn what we have here in Texas into the energy of the future. (APPLAUSE) I think that if we do this we will create millions of new, good jobs, jobs with rising incomes, jobs that will be right here in El Paso, right here in Texas, jobs that will give a family a good potential opportunity to raise their kids, and send them to school, and feel like they\'re part of the American dream. Energy can be the key that unlocks our economic future, makes us more secure in the world. And, if we do it right, we will begin to deal with the problem of global warming, which is a real problem that has to be attacked. (APPLAUSE) You know, I see an America where children are better prepared before they ever go to school, where we help families prepare their own children, where we have a universal pre-kindergarten program, so that 4-year-olds can get off to a good start. I see an America where the federal government doesn\'t tell the teachers, and the principals, and the superintendents in El Paso what they\'re supposed to teach and what they\'re supposed to test. (APPLAUSE) I will the end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind. (APPLAUSE) And, together, we will come up with a 21st-century educational system for our children, where we look at each individual child and try to decide what we need to do to lift that little boy or girl to his or her God-given potential. That is the purpose of education, not test after test after test after test after test. (APPLAUSE) I see an America where every young person who is willing to work hard will be able to go to college. They will not have the door slammed in their face because of the costs of higher education. In my America, we\'re going to make sure that the federal government gets back into loaning people money at a low interest like they did when I went to school instead of the student loan companies. (APPLAUSE) We\'re going to give young people the opportunity for national service so that you can earn money to go to college. One year of national service, you can earn up to $10,000. That would give you the resources to be able to go to school. It is wrong in America when families have to mortgage or sell their homes to send their sons or daughters to college. It should be an investment we all make in you. I see an America where we finally have comprehensive immigration reform with a path to earned legalization. (APPLAUSE) Of course, we\'re going to have secure borders. We\'re going to work very hard on that. And, yes, we\'re going to make sure employers don\'t exploit undocumented workers. (APPLAUSE) And we will do more to help communities like El Paso that need resources for health and education and law enforcement. And I want to work more with our neighbors and friends to the south to help those countries create more jobs for their own people, so that everyone would have a chance at a better life. (APPLAUSE) But we\'re going to bring people out of the shadows. We\'re going to tell them that, if they meet certain conditions, like paying a fine for coming here illegally, like paying back taxes, like learning English, we\'re going to give people a path to citizenship, because so many of the people who are here work hard, send their children to school, and deserve a chance at the American dream. (APPLAUSE) You know, I see an America where we, once again, are builders and architects of our future, where we\'re investing in all of the different kinds of transportation and physical buildings that are required. We need more roads; we need more bridges; we need more tunnels. We should be putting millions of Americans to work building the 21st- century America, investing in that richer and brighter future. (APPLAUSE) And I see an America where we know that we have to be respected around the world again, where we have to repair our reputation, where we have to work with other countries to solve our problems. (APPLAUSE) I have said that, when I become president, I will begin to put a plan into place to bring our troops home starting within 60 days. (APPLAUSE) Many of you are veterans. You know that planning to withdraw our troops has to be done carefully and responsibly, but we must start. Our young men and women who serve our country have done everything they were asked to do. (APPLAUSE) They have performed bravely and heroically, but there is no military solution. It is up to the Iraqis themselves to make the tough decisions about their country\'s future. (APPLAUSE) So as we bring our sons and daughters home, let\'s take care of our veterans. Let\'s give our veterans the services, the health care, the other programs that they so richly have earned, because when someone signs up to serve America, America signs up to serve that veteran. (APPLAUSE) I want to be sure that all of our veterans, from our youngest to our oldest, get taken care of. I\'d like to see our youngest veterans get a 21st-century GI Bill of Rights, with money for college, and money to buy a home, and money to start a business. (APPLAUSE) And as a president, President Bush has not done what needed to be done for our veterans. We haven\'t funded the VA. We have so many coming home who are injured and not being taken care of. I think it is the highest obligation of the president, who is also our commander- in-chief, to take care of those who have served our nation, and I pledge to you I will take care of our veterans. I will make sure our youngest veterans get what they need. We will honor our oldest veterans from World War II. And I want to pay special attention to the veterans of my generation who served and fought in Vietnam, to give them what they deserve to have. (APPLAUSE) You know, every problem we face can be solved because we\'re Americans. We are problem-solvers. We are the people who are constantly creating the future. We believe that tomorrow not only can be, but will be better than today. And we have to keep faith with these young men and women to make sure that they have the opportunity to pursue their own dreams. So this election could not be more important. And there are some real differences that have to be sorted out by the voters of Texas. One of the biggest differences between me and my opponent is that I believe with all my heart that we must have universal health care, that we must do everything possible, finally, to realize the dream of Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Now is the time when we will achieve this goal. We cannot give up on it; we cannot back down from it. Senator Obama won\'t come forward with a universal health care plan, but I have, I will, and with your help we will achieve universal health care in America. (APPLAUSE) Another difference is that I want to stop the foreclosures of peoples\' homes. I want to give people a chance to work out a way to stay in their homes. The home is the most important refuge that any of us have, isn\'t it? And too many people are being forced out of their homes across Texas because of abusive mortgage practices, predatory lending. And it\'s not just affecting the people who lose their homes; it\'s affecting the people who live next door or down the street, because a vacant home lowers property values for everyone. So I have been saying let\'s have a moratorium. Let\'s freeze interest rates. This is a very big deal, because we can\'t fix the economy if our home market doesn\'t start working again. (APPLAUSE) And so I was somewhat amused today when President Bush and his secretary of the treasury said they were actually going to do some of what I\'ve been urging them to do for several months. Let\'s try to save people\'s homes. I am a problem-solver. I believe that we need a president, starting on day one, who\'s going to roll up his or her sleeves and get to work. (APPLAUSE) Because I want you to imagine for a minute what is waiting for our next president in the Oval Office in the White House. You know, on January 20, 2009, our next president will be sworn in. And waiting on that desk in the Oval Office are two wars -- two wars -- an economy in trouble, a health care system that is not taking care of people, an energy reliance on unstable regimes, and all of the problems that comes from that. So many of these challenges are going to be just sitting there, waiting for the next president. And some people say, ""Well, there\'s going to be a lot of work to do."" Well, there is going to be a lot of work to do, but are we up to doing that work and taking our country back? (APPLAUSE) Now, I am so excited to be making this campaign, but I can\'t do it without all of you. I need you here in El Paso and across Texas to stand up for me, because... (APPLAUSE) ... because if we stand up together, if we work together, if we fight together, we will take back America, and we will make history together. Thank you all, and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 13, 2008","b'Remarks at a Town Hall with General Motors Employees in Warren, Ohio'","b'Remarks as prepared for delivery below: I am so pleased to be with all of you. As some of you may know, I grew up in the Midwest, so being here today sure feels good. This state has always held a special place at the heart of our nation. Ohio was one of our first frontiers  and has always led us to new ones. You gave us the airplane that first graced the skies and the astronauts who explored the heavens  including my friend and hero, Senator John Glenn. The steel from these mills armed America through two World Wars, put cars in our garages, and built our cities rushing skyward. For so many years, this state has defined our values, expanded our horizons, and kept the American Dream alive. But at the beginning of this new century  here in Youngstown and across this state  the American Dream is being tested. Some jobs have left, others pay less, so you just work harder. Health care, energy and college costs are up  so you stretch your budget further. Maybe you\'re a working mom or dad raising your kids  and also a working son or daughter caring for your parents  and you feel overwhelmed. Maybe your kids grew up, had to leave the state to find work, and took the grandkids with them. Some days, it probably feels like the perfect storm. You fill up your tank, and that\'s two twenties from your wallet. You pick up a gallon of milk and a few other things  and there goes another. You try to fill your child\'s prescription, and they tell you, ""Sorry, that\'s no longer covered."" After a while, you feel like a human ATM  with all the money going the wrong way. That\'s why I\'m here in Youngstown  because that\'s what this election is about: It\'s about you. It\'s about your lives, your dreams, your future. I know that here at GM, you\'ve had serious losses. But we can\'t ever give up on our manufacturers and manufacturing jobs. No one should ever have to leave their family to earn a living. In the end, it comes down to just one question: When the bright lights are off and the speeches are over, who can you count on to listen to you, to stand up for you, to deliver solutions for you? For the past seven years, we\'ve seen this President\'s answer. He delivers perks for the special interests on a silver platter  one that was probably made in China. With President Bush, every day is Valentine\'s Day for the special interests. They\'ve grabbed tax breaks at every turn, exploited every loophole, and turned federal departments into their revolving doors. And while you pinched pennies to stay within your budget, the President has blown the bank on tax breaks for his friends and no-bid contracts for his cronies  borrowing hundreds of billions from China to pay for it. He\'s essentially signed a subprime mortgage on America\'s economy. So when people ask me, ""Why can\'t we get tough on China,"" I ask them, ""When was the last time you got tough on your banker?"" China\'s steel comes here  our jobs go there. We play by the rules  they manipulate their currency. And we get tainted fish, lead-laced toys, and poisoned pet food in return. For seven long years, we\'ve had a government of, by, and for the special interests  and we\'ve had enough. It\'s time to get real about our future. It\'s time to level the playing field against the special interests and deliver 21st century solutions to rebuild the middle class. It\'s time we made the solutions business America\'s business. Today, I\'m announcing an agenda to reign in the special interests and save the American people at least $55 billion a year. Money that can go back into your pockets. Money we can use to create new jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, make college affordable and so much more. We\'ll take on the oil companies and harness their record profits to create millions of clean energy jobs  high-wage jobs you can raise a family on. I\'ll end their special tax breaks and give them a choice: invest some of your profits in alternative energy, or we\'ll do it for you. People have been paying through the roof at the pump, and it\'s time the companies paid their fair share. We\'ll take on the credit card companies so that you and your families aren\'t drowning in debt. Here in Ohio, payday lenders are actually taking Social Security checks from our elderly. That\'s outrageous. I\'ve proposed real consumer protections against abusive interest rates  capping them at no more than 30% and working to get them far lower. And I\'ll ban those hidden fees and sudden rate hikes, because credit card companies shouldn\'t be able to bait and switch you and your family. We\'ll take on the insurance companies and tell them they can no longer discriminate against the sickest people who need care the most. They spend more than $50 billion a year trying to figure out how not to cover people. Well, I\'m going to save them a fortune and a whole lot of time, because here\'s the new policy: No more discrimination period. So even if you have a pre-existing condition, you can get the health insurance you need  no questions asked. And I\'ll go after drug companies and insurance companies that are overcharging consumers and the government  it\'s time to end their profiteering at our expense. We\'ll take on Wall Street and tell them: you\'re going to finally pay your fair share in taxes. Because it\'s outrageous that a teacher making $50,000 pays a higher tax rate than some Wall Street investment managers making $50 million. And I\'ll create a bi-partisan Corporate Waste Commission to review all those corporate subsidies  and propose a comprehensive way to end them. We can save billions of dollars a year and put it to work for you. We\'ll take on the student loan companies and tell them no more ripping off our sons and daughters. I\'m proposing a Student Borrower Bill of Rights - no more deceptive advertising and outrageous fees. And we\'ll end the inefficient subsidies for private student loan companies. Because we should be making it easier for our kids to go to college  not harder. We\'ll send a loud, clear message to all those companies shipping our jobs overseas. If you\'re trying to take jobs away from Ohio, no more loopholes and no more tax rewards. I think we\'ve had enough of this Administration using our tax dollars to encourage companies to outsource our jobs. And let\'s support the people who work those jobs. Let\'s raise the minimum wage. Let\'s support our unions by standing up for the right to organize and appointing people to the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board who are actually pro-labor. I\'m proud of what our unions do to serve this country every day. I commend the Building Trade Unions for their ""Helmets to Hardhats"" program that places our veterans in all kinds of jobs  here in Ohio and across the country. That is truly patriotism in action. I am proud to have the support of more than a dozen unions representing six million working families nationwide: sheet metal workers, sanitation workers, stage hands, machinists, bus drivers, farm workers, letter carriers, painters, teachers, nurses, childcare workers, law enforcement officers, bricklayers and so many more. I\'m proud to be labor\'s candidate. When my opponent puts out a mail piece with all sorts of false claims about my position on NAFTA, working men and women know the truth. You know I\'ve been working to help create good jobs in New York and across America. That I have plans to create five million new, green collar jobs. And that my opponent doesn\'t have much experience creating jobs at all. And you know that I\'ll crack down on unfair trade with countries like China. I\'ve already proposed legislation to assess trade agreements every five years to see if they\'re meeting their goals or if they need adjustments. And when I\'m President, we will take a timeout from new agreements in order to create a new approach: One that is genuinely pro-American, pro-worker, pro-environment -- and vigorously enforced. I think it\'s time for a President who works as hard for you as you work for America. A President who knows what manufacturing means to America. Let\'s be honest about something. When President Bush and Vice President Cheney say the economy is booming even though 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost; when they propose to cut the Manufacturing Extension Partnership; when they cut assistance to small manufacturers; when Senator McCain tells you business as usual on trade is just fine and tells neighboring Michigan workers that we can\'t bring new manufacturing jobs back to the United States  they are sending you a clear message: They do not believe America needs a strong manufacturing base. They think America doesn\'t need to make anything anymore. They think those of us who remember how our manufacturers helped defend our freedoms in the great wars are just quaint and nostalgic. They think it would be just fine if every plane, every piece of machinery, every computer, every car were made somewhere else. Well let me be clear: I believe manufacturing matters. I believe we should be restoring the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  not cutting it. I believe a strong America needs a strong American manufacturing base  and I intend to fight for one as President. Some may call this the ""rust belt,"" but that\'s not what I see. I see some of the hardest workers in the world. I see great universities and strong communities. I see a 21st century manufacturing belt. An innovation belt. An opportunity belt. I see a middle class comeback that starts right here, right now  in places like this. Now, over the years, you\'ve heard plenty of promises from plenty of people in plenty of speeches. And some of those speeches were probably pretty good. But speeches don\'t put food on the table. Speeches don\'t fill up your tank, or fill your prescription, or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night. That\'s the difference between me and my Democratic opponent. My opponent gives speeches, I offer solutions. It\'s one thing to get people excited, I want to empower you to live your dreams so we can all go forward together. There\'s a lot of talk in this campaign about what kind of change we\'ll bring. Well, change is going to happen whether we want it or not. The question is who will make progress. My opponent says that he\'ll take on the special interests. Well, he told people he stood up to the nuclear industry and passed a bill against them. But he actually let the nuclear industry water down his bill  the bill never actually passed. On top of that, the same company that watered down that bill lobbied for Dick Cheney\'s energy bill. And my opponent voted for the energy bill, with its billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry. I voted against it. My opponent says he\'ll stand up for workers. He often talks about the plight of Maytag workers in his home state. But the union at that plant supports me because when 1,600 jobs were being lost, they say he didn\'t do a thing to help. My opponent says to cut health care costs more aggressively than I do. But as an independent analysis from The Commonwealth Fund shows, the most effective way to lower costs is to truly cover everyone. His health care plan does\'\'t. Mine does. I was, however, glad to see that yesterday, my opponent adopted the goal of five million green collar jobs  months after I announced I would create five million green collar jobs. I was also glad to see that he modeled his $60 billion infrastructure bank on a bill I co-sponsored last summer to create a $60 billion infrastructure bank. Now, if only he would just copy my health care plan and provide coverage for every single American! So there\'s the difference between us  speeches versus solutions. Talk versus action. In all seriousness, while some may think that words are change  I know that it takes work. You can\'t just talk about the special interests  you have to take them on. I always have, and I always will. If you want universal health care, you have to take on the insurance companies  that\'s exactly what I did as First Lady. And when we weren\'t successful, I kept on fighting until we got health care for six million children. I took on the drug companies to get vaccines for children  and today, childhood immunizations are at an all time high. So I\'ve stood my ground against the special interests. But I also know how to find common ground in the Senate, bringing together Democrats and Republicans to solve our toughest problems. I\'m the co-founder and co-chair of the bipartisan Senate Manufacturing Caucus, where we\'ve worked to revitalize America\'s manufacturing base. I created new partnerships to breathe economic life into struggling cities and towns in Upstate New York. We brought new investors, new capital, and funds for infrastructure and economic development. That\'s how I measure my life  not by applause or headlines  but by whether I\'m helping people. I\'m in this race because this nation gave me every opportunity, and I believe we can do the same for every family. That\'s been the purpose of my life  standing up for people who weren\'t getting a fair shake, people aspiring for a better future, people who need government on their side. And it will be the purpose of my presidency. So yes, today the American Dream is being tested. But it\'s been tested before. Tested by war and Depression. Communism and terrorism. Discrimination, division, and fear. And that dream has always triumphed. It has grown stronger as each generation has made it their own and made it more real for more people. It takes leadership and hard work. But we\'ve never been short on either. So I hope you will join me in delivering the solutions we need for our nation\'s economy and making sure our best days are yet to come. When the people of Ohio and America work hard and work together, there is nothing we can\'t accomplish. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 16, 2008",b'Remarks at the Wisconsin Founders Day Gala in Milwaukee',"b'Thank you all so much. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much, it may be a little cold outside but it sure is warm with all these Democrats making a lot of noise about what we believe in and what we care about. I am thrilled to be with you. I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton for her leadership and for that really extraordinary introduction. I am so grateful to her. I want to recognize and thank Governor Jim Doyle, who is here as well, Chairman Joe Wineke and the entire Wisconsin Democratic Party. I want to thank also my colleagues in the Senate. But I really should thank all of you for sending Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold to Washington.I don\'t have to tell you what extraordinary leaders they are, how much influence they exercise. We all listen when either one of them speak. And it is a great personal privilege for me to serve with them and consider them friends. I also want to recognize your Congressional Democratic Delegation, Gwen Moore and Steve Kagen. They have been extraordinary in a short period of time, and of course my dear friend and one of my co-chairs Tammy Baldwin- thank you all very much. I know former Congressman and now Mayor Tom Barrett is here, and to all of you who are supporting this event, raising money for this party, committed to not only doing everything possible to have a great election on Tuesday with as big a turnout as we can muster, but then to make sure we go on to victory in November and that Wisconsin is in the column of the Democratic president who we will be electing. I know we are ready. We are long past ready, we are anxious to take back the White House. And on January 20, 2009, the next president of the United States will raise his or her hand and take the oath of office, and then will immediately inherit the problems that will be left to us to solve by President Bush. Now we\'re here tonight to make sure that our next president is a Democrat, because after seven long years of George W. Bush, seven years of incompetence, corruption, cronyism, seven years of this government of the few, by the few, and for the few, we have to bring change to America and put our country back on the right track. I think about that day because obviously I\'ve been deeply honored and privileged to have lived it in the past with my husband. I know that after the swearing in ceremony and all of the activities at the Capitol, after the walk down Pennsylvania avenue and the parade, after the Inaugural Balls, the president will walk into the Oval Office and waiting there will be two wars, an economy in trouble, millions and millions of our fellow citizens, including 547,000 right here in Wisconsin without health care, problems that we think we can predict now, and all of those that we can\'t even imagine: an energy crisis to solve, alliances to rebuild, a homeland to protect. Instead of solving our problems we\'ve had a president who has stood in our way. He\'s used fear to divide us and fatalism to discourage us. He wants us to believe we can\'t solve our problems. He wants us to think we shouldn\'t even try. Well, like so much of George Bush\'s Presidency, this has done a grave disservice to America. America\'s character is strong, our resilience is ever-present. We will survive the eight years of George Bush and Dick Cheney and enter the future with confidence and optimism again. Unlike our Republican friends, we Democrats still believe America is the ""can do"" nation. We still believe that tomorrow will be better than today, and we know it is time we started acting like Americans again. It has been disheartening, to say the least, to see the narrowing of horizons, the loss of opportunity, the sense that the American dream is receding and eroding. I have been given opportunities because of this country that my parents never had and my grandparents never dreamt of, opportunities that came because of people who, generation after generation, believed with all their heart there wasn\'t a problem we couldn\'t solve, a challenge we couldn\'t meet, an opportunity we could not seize; people who built our country, who raised the families, who marched and protested and risked their lives because they looked into their children\'s eyes and they saw reflected back at them the promise of a better future. Senator Obama and I stand here tonight because of all those who came before; who sacrificed so much to bring us to this moment in our history and it is a moment to celebrate. Because this nation gave me every chance, because during my lifetime I have seen the barriers tumble down, the obstacles overcome, I am running for president because I believe we can do the same for every single child. We can, once again, have an America where we can say to every boy and every girl that we will give you the opportunity to live up to your God-given potential. That, for me, is what this election is about. It\'s not about those of us who are running; it\'s about your families, your futures, and your country. Tonight across Wisconsin and across America teachers are grading papers and nurses are caring for the sick, and they need a president who hears their voices and listens to them. Tonight, here in Milwaukee and in cities across America, janitors are cleaning up, waitresses are pouring coffee, police officers are standing guard, and they need a president who stands up for them. Tonight families are sitting down to talk after losing a job or losing a home. They need a president who will deliver solutions for them. Earlier today in Kenosha I was at a town hall event and I was reminded once again of why I do this work. You heard Barbara say that for 35 years starting when I was a young lawyer for the Children\'s Defense Fund, I have wanted to be a voice for those who are voiceless. I started representing abused and neglected children, children who were in the foster care system who didn\'t have educational or health care opportunities. I worked as the Chair of the Legal Services Corporation, appointed by President Carter to expand legal services for the poor across our nation because I had a passionate commitment to equal justice under the law. In Arkansas I reformed the education system so that children in the poorest community in the delta or in the inner city would have some shot at finding out what they could do if they were motivated and would work hard. And in the White House years we tackled a lot of tough problems, and one that I worked on and helped to make progress on was to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, to give six million kids across our country a chance to have health care. As I was shaking hands in the crowd after my event today in Kenosha, a woman held up a sign and said, ""Thank you for saving my daughter\'s life."" I said, ""what did I do?"" She said, ""The Children\'s Health Insurance Program."" Then I met a young boy named Jacob who has cerebral palsy but he is doing really well. He was standing between his two proud parents. They thanked me because they never could\'ve afforded the operations that he had. During the town hall, I called on a little girl. She said, ""What are you going to do for people who don\'t have homes?"" I thought like many children that I\'ve talked to across America that the plight of the homeless had really struck her heart. And I said, ""well, are you concerned about people who don\'t have homes?"" She said, ""Yes, my mommy and me."" So I asked them to come up and her mother talked about being a hairdresser. She said, ""My business is not as good as it was. People aren\'t coming in as often. They are not willing to pay what I need to make a living. I\'m about to be foreclosed on. I have one of those adjustable rate mortgages. I\'ve gone from paying $600 a month to $1,000 a month. I don\'t think we will be able to stay in our home."" I\'m reminded every single day why I do this. It\'s not about speeches for me, it\'s not about the bright lights and the cameras, it is about the changes we can make that actually deliver results in people\'s lives that give them a chance to live up and fulfill their own dreams. Far from here in this beautiful ballroom, across the world our men and women in uniform are serving our country bravely and honorably, some on their second or third or even fourth tour of duty. They deserve a Commander in Chief who will bring them home. All Americans again want, need and deserve a president who will bring your voices and your values back to the White House. I know we will all breathe a sigh of relief when that moving van pulls up in the back of the White House and George Bush and Dick Cheney turn over the keys. But this election is not just about the failures of the past seven years or the divisions of the present or the excitement of the moment. This election must be about the future we want and how we can make it a reality. We all have dreams. We have dreams for our families, for our future. Our country is founded on the idea of the American dream, that with optimism and confidence and without fear, we can make the future happen by working hard and taking responsibility. That\'s what has always made America great and different. This generation, like generations before us, is called to make its own commitment and sacrifice. We, too, can be a great generation to make the American dream real in the 21st century. But to do that we must get real about what it will take to have the future we dream of. I once wrote a book called ""It Takes a Village."" Well, I still believe that\'s true. I will be a president for all of you but for me to be your president and for us to reach America\'s promise in this century, we also have to agree that shared opportunities and shared prosperity require shared responsibility as parents, as neighbors, as workers, as business and political leaders, as a nation. This is about all of us coming together to stake our claim on what it means to be an American in this century. There are people saying that America\'s best days are behind us, that the competition we face from China and elsewhere will mean that we can\'t continue to have a strong middle class with rising incomes and the kind of quality of life and standard of living that we have taken for granted. Well, I reject that. I know this will not be easy. Those who claim that it can be done with relatively little effort don\'t understand what we\'re up against. We face real challenges, real threats, we have to be ready to summon the experience, the wisdom and the determination to solve our problems. It will take more than just speeches to fulfill our dreams. It will take a lot of hard work. So, if we get America back into the solutions business, if we get real about our future, I am confident that we\'ll be back here in five years and we will say ""weren\'t we on top of it, didn\'t we understand what we had to do to make a difference."" Because together there isn\'t anything that can stop us. So let\'s get real about the economy. We see an America where our economy works not just for the few, the wealthy and the well-connected, but works for all of us. How will we do that? Well, we\'re going to start by creating good jobs again and by keeping the jobs we have here and preventing them from being exported like they were some disposable commodity. We can do this, we have to change our trade policy, we have to change our tax policy, we have to change our vision and understanding about what it will take to create the jobs of the future. But that\'s what I\'ve been doing for years. Upstate New York has a lot in common with Wisconsin. We\'ve lost our manufacturing base but I didn\'t say ""well that\'s the end, we can\'t do it,"" because, you see, I don\'t believe we can have a strong economy and a strong country without a strong manufacturing base. So I\'m going to work to make sure we get it back. Let\'s get real about our energy policy. Let\'s see an America that stands up to the oil companies and the oil producing countries and says, ""you don\'t need our tax dollars any longer to make outrageous profits."" Let\'s begin to take the tax subsidies away from the oil companies. Let\'s impose a windfall profits tax on these outrageous profits and put it to work on clean renewable energy. Now, I know we can\'t do any of this until the two oil men leave the White House but as soon as they do, we\'re going to be ready for a new energy future with the millions and millions of jobs that we can create. I think we can create five million jobs in the next ten years if we do this right. And there\'s no reason we can\'t. Earlier today I said to the folks at the Brat Shop, I said look Germany\'s creating jobs with solar power, hundreds of thousands of them. We have a lot of people in Wisconsin of German descent, there are as many sunny days in Wisconsin as there are in Germany -- let\'s get busy and create these jobs right here in Milwaukee and in Oshkosh and in Green Bay and in Eau Claire and Madison. Let\'s get real about health care. Now we have a choice we have 47 million people uninsured and we can continue to think that\'s a terrible problem and do nothing about it or we can roll up our sleeves and come up with a uniquely American solution. That is what I have proposed. You see, I think it is morally wrong that you have 547, 000 people in Wisconsin who don\'t have health insurance. I think it is a national disgrace. Are we saying to ourselves we just can\'t figure this out? We can\'t take on the health insurance companies; we can\'t take on the Republicans to achieve universal health care? I don\'t accept that for a minute. Universal health care has been a fundamental Democratic party; it\'s been part of the progressive tradition here in Wisconsin for as long as anyone can remember. We cannot in anyway cede universal health care; it should be a defining issue in this general election. I believe we can win on universal health care. Let\'s get real about education. You know, we can\'t continue to have unfunded mandates coming from Washington, so let\'s figure out what we\'re going to do. I will do everything possible to fully fund special education something that has been promised but never fulfilled for more then 30 years. And I will end the unfunded mandate know as No Child Left Behind, it is not working for our kids and our teachers. And I believe we can make college affordable again if we take on the student loan industry and get them out of the way, get back to direct lending from the federal government - the way it used to work Let\'s get real about restoring America\'s role in the world. You know as well as I do that our relationships have been destroyed. We have to rebuild our alliances. We have to be willing to find common ground with the rest of the world again. And this is not about getting everybody to like us, that\'s not what it\'s about. This is about having allies to deal with the big problems we face -- global terrorism global warming global epidemics. We can\'t tackle those on our own. And you know you can\'t be a leader if no one is following. We\'ve got to get into the leadership business again in the world. We also have to do everything we can to make it clear that restoring our leadership and our moral authority in the world starts with ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home responsibly and quickly. I have said that I will start bringing them home within the first 60 days. From my position on the Senate Armed Services Committee I\'ve been working to make sure that we are prepared to do that. You know, this administration has not planned for withdrawing our troops because they don\'t want to do it. They are going to leave it completely to us. So we have to be prepared to think this through, to make sure that we protect our young men and women as they depart. And then we have to ask ourselves, what do we do with the 100,000 plus civilians who are there. See, I think about this because I imagine what the responsibility will be like sitting alone in the Oval Office. You know, the advisors have given you their advice but ultimately it\'s up to you to decide. And what do we do about the Iraqis who helped us, the translators who made the difference between life and death for our soldiers and our marines. We are an honorable country and we have to withdraw in a way that keeps faith with the sacrifice of those who have been lost, with those who have been injured. And we must make it clear there is no military solution, bring our people home and tell the Iraqis they have to take responsibility for their own future. And as we bring them home, we have to take care of them. You know in Kenosha again, a young man reached out his hand; he had a t-shirt on which said US Marine Corps. He said, ""Take care of my buddies, a lot of them are still over there."" He said, ""And then will you please help take care of me."" He said, ""I can\'t get an appointment for months to get my problems taken care of at the V.A."" You know, I think when young men and women sign up to serve America, we sign up to serve them. They deserve the health care, the compensation, the services they have earned. Obviously to do all of this we have to take on the power structure in Washington. I\'m always a little amused when someone says, ""we\'re going to go after the special interests."" There isn\'t anything more important then reining them in. But we\'ve got to do it in a way that brings the American people along with us. It\'s not enough just to impose rules on them, which Senator Feingold has been such a leader on, we\'ve got to figure out how we prevent them from taking advantage of the American people with higher prescription drug costs, with higher energy costs, with lost jobs that go overseas. This is a job for all of us, not just for our next president. We have to have a coalition that takes on all of these interests. I have an aggressive agenda that will save the American people at least 55 billion dollars a year. If we impose that windfall profits tax, if we get aggressive in going after the oil companies who always seem to be raising the price no matter what else is going on. If we rein in health insurance, rein in drug costs, we can begin to end these subsidies that have unfortunately shifted so much wealth away from the middle class. That\'s the kind of America that we have to build again. It\'s not going to be easy but it\'s doable. It\'s going to take strength and experience, something that goes along with the job. Change is going to happen. The question is, are we going to get the right kind of change. Because what I\'m interested in is not just change for the sake of change, but progress. The kind of progress that will make a difference in the lives of the people of this country. And we know pretty well what the Republicans will do because they\'re likely nominee will be Senator McCain. He\'s a man whom I consider a friend and whom I deeply respect for his lifetime of service to our country. He\'s a good man with the wrong ideas. And I believe we need a nominee who can go toe-to-toe with John McCain to make the differences absolutely clear to the American people. He wants to keep troops in Iraq for 50 to 100 years. I\'ll start bringing them home within 60 days. He\'s admitted he doesn\'t understand the economy. Well, I have a strategy to end the housing crisis. When that young girl and her mother came up, I told them I\'d been pushing on a moratorium on home foreclosures. End the home foreclosures for 90 days. Let people work out a chance to stay in their homes, have the lenders understand that somebody paying $600 is better than an empty house because they couldn\'t pay $1000. Senator McCain won\'t deliver universal health care. I\'m the only candidate left in either party with a plan to cover every single American. And these are big differences. So Wisconsin Democrats have a choice on Tuesday. It\'s not an easy choice. I recognize that. It\'s kind of a good problem to have in a way because either Senator Obama or I will make history and we\'ll make history because of all that we are able to exemplify, everything that was done to bring both of us to this point. But the question is not who will make history, but who will change America. Who will bring about the positive differences, the 21st century solutions that we so desperately need? I think that the choice is really whether we\'re going to have a fighter, a doer and a champion again in the White House, somebody who gets up every single day with determination, backbone and, yes, toughness. I know some people have said that I am tough. You know what? We need a tough president because we have tough problems waiting for us. When I say I\'ll stand with you, I will stand with you. When I say I will fight for you, I will fight for you. That\'s what I\'ve done my whole life. When I started my career fighting for abused and neglected children and children with disabilities, I was standing with the children who had drawn the short straw in life. Well I\'m still standing with them today. When I went to Beijing as first lady, I stood up for the core American value that women\'s rights are human rights and human rights are women\'s rights. I took that message to more than 80 countries, to women who couldn\'t vote or own property or earn a salary or send their daughters to school. And I\'m still standing for women\'s rights and human rights. When I took on the special interests to try to bring health care to every American back in 1993, the insurance companies and the lobbyists came at me with everything they had. But I\'m still here and I\'m still standing up to the special interests and I am still standing and fighting for health care for every man, woman and child. When the Republicans come after our nominee, and you know they will -- now I personally believe they should be so embarrassed by the failed record of President Bush that they should say they won\'t field a candidate, but I\'m afraid they will -- and so once again we know exactly what they will do. They\'ll throw everything they\'ve got at whichever one of us is nominated. Well, I\'ve been through it, I\'ve beaten it, I\'m still standing and I will beat them again if I am your nominee. If you stand with me on Tuesday, then come January 20th, 2009 I will be standing on the steps of the Capitol and I will be expressing for all of us our passionate commitment to this country and what it stands for. Our belief that we may have been on a detour from our destiny but we are back on the right track and that with all of us together we can turn this country around. We are a nation of idealists, holding fast to our deepest values, that we are all created equal, that this generation of Americans is destined for greatness, that every child deserves to fulfill his or her God-given potential. It\'s the ideal that is inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty, the words that give voice to America\'s embrace, ""give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masse yearning to breath free."" Lady Liberty has overlooked the New York harbor through wars and depression and the dark, dark day of September 11th -- a constant reminder that here in America we face our challenges and we embrace all of our people. So tonight, let us say with one voice, ""give us the child who wants to learn, give us the people in need of work, give us the veterans who need our care, give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end, give us this nation to heal, this world to lead, this moment to seize."" I know that the people of Wisconsin and America are ready to meet that challenge. Thank you all very, very much and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 19, 2008","b'Remarks Following the Wisconsin Primary at the Solutions for America Event in Youngstown, Ohio'","b'Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. It is wonderful to be with you. I want to thank Gerry Mcentee and Tom Buffenbarger. I want to thank your Congressman Tim Ryan. Also, I want to recognize Representative Ron Gerberry, Representative Linda Bolon, Representative Lorraine Fende, Representative Sandy Harwood. I also want to thank Shelley Murray, the School Board President, and Amy Litkey the Student Rep to the School Board. And I particularly want to thank the Cheney high school and East high school marching bands. Well, hello, Youngstown, how are you tonight? I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And, it is great to see this enthusiasm and this energy. Tonight, I want to talk to you about the choice you have in this election and why that choice matters. It is about picking a president who relies not just on words, but on work, on hard work to get America back to work. That\'s our goal. You know, when I think about what we\'re really comparing in this election, you know, we can\'t just have speeches, we\'ve got to have solutions and we need those solutions for America. We have got to get America back in the solutions business. Because, while words matter, the best words in the world aren\'t enough unless you match them with action. But, this election is not about me or my opponent, it is about you. It\'s about your lives and your dreams and your future. I can\'t do this without all of you here in Youngstown and across Ohio. It is going to take an effort from all of us. You may have heard that I actually loaned my campaign some money and I was honored and humbled by the support that I have received since from people like the young mom who sent me $10 and wrote that ""my two daughters are two and four and I want them to know anything is possible."" Or the gentleman who described himself as an independent voter, a veteran and a generally cranky conservative who decided to support me. If we put pull together, I know we can do this. I hope you will go to and support this campaign because it is your campaign. I hope you will go to my website. Because if you do, you\'ll find at Hillaryclinton.com all of my positions, everything that I have been working on. Because I know what\'s happening in America. People are struggling. They are working the day shift, the night shift; they are trying to get by without health care. They are just one paycheck away from losing their homes. They cannot afford four more years of a president who just doesn\'t see or hear them at all. They need a president ready on day one, to be commander and chief, ready to manage our economy and ready to beat the Republicans in November. With your help, I will be that president. This is the choice we face-- one of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world. Every day, around the world, situations arise that present new threats and new opportunities. Situations like the change of leadership in Cuba today. I have served on the Armed Services Committee. I have been to more than 80 countries, worked with world leaders, stood up to the Chinese government to declare women\'s rights are human rights. And I am ready to end this war in Iraq, end this era of cowboy diplomacy. I will restore our leadership and moral authority in the world without delays, without on the job training from day one. One of us has a plan to provide health care for every single American, no one left out. I believe, I believe health care is a right, not a privilege and I will not rest until every American is covered. That is my solemn promise to you. The question is: who would we leave out? Do we leave out the mother I met who grabbed my arm and said the insurance company wouldn\'t pay for the treatment that her son needed? Will we leave that family out? Who will pay for those we leave out? I don\'t want to leave anyone out. I am not running to put band-aids on our problems; I am running to solve our problems. One of us has a plan to actually address the growing foreclosure crisis which is so terrible here in Ohio. I\'ve called for a freeze on subprime foreclosures and interest rates to ensure that millions of families across the country won\'t be receiving that grim letter from the bank. I\'ve proposed $30 billion in assistance to help families avoid foreclosures and to help communities rebound from this housing crisis because no one should foreclose on the American dream and we\'re going to stop it. One of us has a plan to revitalize our economy right now by creating millions of new clean energy jobs. And we can do that right here in Youngstown. We can put people to work. And I will also rein in the corporate special interests by eliminating more than $50 billion of George Bush\'s special breaks for the oil companies, the drug companies and Wall Street. We\'re going to give the middle class a break instead. We\'ll put that money right back in your pockets once we get it back. The corporate special interests have had seven years of a president who stands up for them. I think it\'s time we had a president who stands up for you and I will be that president. Finally, one of us has faced serious Republican opposition in the past and one of us is ready to do it again. The contrasts between me and our likely opponent on the republican side could not be starker. Senator McCain is willing to continue the war in Iraq for 100 years he said. I will start bringing troops home within 60 days. He admits he doesn\'t understand the economy. Well, I have a plan to turn our economy around and create five million new jobs and we can. We can do that working together. Senator McCain really wants eight ears more of the same. Well, I\'m going to deliver 21st century solutions that will move our country forward again. We\'ll focus on the problems right here in Ohio and begin to solve them. Both Senator Obama and I would make history but only one of us is ready on day one to be commander in chief, ready to manage our economy and ready to defeat the Republicans. You know, only one of us has spent 35 years being a doer, a fighter and a champion for those who need a voice. That is what I would bring to the White House again. That is the choice in this election. After the past seven years that choice couldn\'t be more important because for seven long years we\'ve had a government of, by and for the corporate special interests. They have been heard first, they have been heard loudest and they have drowned out everyone else. And while you pinch pennies to stay within your budget, the president blew the bank on tax breaks for his friend and no-bid contracts for his cronies, borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from China to pay for it all. He has signed a subprime mortgage on America\'s economic future and that\'s your future. And so when people ask me ""why can\'t we get tough on China?"" well, when was the last time you got tough on your banker. And so we have to get back to fiscal responsibility in order to get tough on China because we shouldn\'t be borrowing so much money from them. China\'s steel comes here and our jobs go there. We play by the rules, they manipulate their currency. And we get tainted fish, lead laced toys and poisoned pet food in return. I think that\'s a pretty raw deal, don\'t you? Let\'s be honest about something. When President Bush and Vice President Cheney say the economy is booming even though three million manufacturing jobs have been lost, when their administration says outsourcing is a plus for our economy, or when Senator McCain that business as usual on trade is just fine, when he thinks making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent is a top economic priority, they\'re sending you a clear message-the struggle of middle class and working families simply don\'t matter. Your voices just don\'t matter. They think the economy works as long as it works for their friends at the top. When good jobs leave, they think that\'s just the price of admission to the global marketplace. They think it would be fine if every plane, every piece of machinery, every computer and every car were made somewhere else. I could not disagree more and don\'t you also Youngstown? Some people may call this the rust belt but that\'s not what I see; I see some of the hardest working people in the world. I see great universities and strong neighborhoods and families. I see communities where young people should be able to find good jobs and no one should ever have to leave their family to earn their living. I see a 21st century manufacturing belt, an innovation belt, an opportunity belt that will once again put us on the forefront of the world\'s economy. I see a middle class comeback that starts right here and right now in places like this, places just like Youngstown. In Youngstown, you have start up companies thriving as a new business incubator. Places like Warren where the GM plant I visited is. You are leading the way and producing the fuel efficient cars of the next generation. Places like Akron where cutting edge manufacturing jobs and technological innovations are really attracting and keeping highly skilled young workers. Let\'s start working together to build the America that we believe in and let\'s level the playing field against the corporate special interests. We\'re going to deliver 21st century solutions to rebuild the middle class. Let\'s get real about our future starting right now. Let\'s get real about the future of trade in this country. Let\'s get real about NAFTA - it simply isn\'t working for all Americans. I\'m not just going to talk about what\'s wrong with NAFTA, I\'m going to fix it and I have a four-point plan to do exactly that. First we\'ll have the strongest possible labor and environmental standards in the core NAFTA agreement. Second, we wont let foreign countries undermine worker protection as they do right now. These companies can challenge American regulation intended to protect American workers and the environment. That is not acceptable and I will change that. I will strengthen NAFTA\'s enforcement mechanisms to remove trade barriers and better protect American jobs. And finally, we\'ll review this agreement and every other trade agreement regularly. If it\'s not raising living standards right here in America and protecting American workers, then we\'re not going to have it be a race to the bottom. We will never again let fourteen years go by without updating and modernizing our trade agreements. My opponent has taken to attacking me on NAFTA. The fact is neither of us were in the Senate at the time and I\'ve long been a critic of the shortcomings of NAFTA. In 2005, when we were both in the Senate, Senator Dorgan proposed amendment that I thought was just common sense. It said that our trade negotiators shouldn\'t enter into any agreement that undermines basic protections for American workers. It said we shouldn\'t allow foreign countries to unfairly dump their products into the American marketplace in a way that damages U.S competitiveness. So I stood with American workers and I voted for it. Senator Obama stood with the Bush administration and voted against it. That is a big difference between us. My opponent claims to stand up for workers - he often talks about the plight of the Maytag workers in his home state. But the union at that plant supports me because when 1,600 jobs were being lost, they say he didn\'t do a thing to help. We\'re also going to get tough with China. Otherwise we\'ll keep losing jobs. The currency manipulation has to stop, the trade barriers have to come down. China is going to have to be our trade partner, not our trade master. We\'re going to level the playing field. It\'s time that we make trade work for working families. That\'s why I opposed fast-track authority for George Bush, because we can\'t allow him to ram through deals on his way out the door. When I am president, we will take a time-out from new agreements until we have a trade policy that is genuinely pro-worker and pro-American. No one will get away with violating our trade agreements anymore because we\'ll start enforcing them vigorously and without fail. Let\'s get real about creating jobs right now; good jobs that pay the bills because our families can\'t wait another minute. Manufacturing because a strong economy and strong military require a strong manufacturing base. Green collar jobs - five million of them - Jobs we\'ll create by investing oil company\'s record profits in clean renewable energy. How about ending their special tax rates? You\'ve been emptying your wallets at the pump, isn\'t it time they paid their fair share? Let\'s get real about keeping jobs right here in Ohio and America where they belong. As president, I will send a loud and clear message to any company shipping jobs overseas. If you take jobs away from the families of Youngstown, you\'ll pay a price because when I am president, you will never again be able to use our tax dollars to help outsource our jobs. Finally, let\'s get real about supporting the working men and women of this country again. I\'m proud to be here with so many of my friends from labor. I\'m proud to have the support of more than a dozen unions representing six million working families nationwide. Sheet metal workers and sanitation workers...and machinists and bus drivers and farm workers and letter carriers and painters and teachers and nurses and child care workers and law enforcement workers and brick-layers and so much more. I am proud to be a pro-labor candidate because I always tell people if you want to know how America got its great middle class, how we got fair wages, how we got benefits and a shot at the American dream - because of unions. Because they stood up, they spoke out and they refused to back down. People sometimes ask me, when you are president will labor have a seat at the table? Here\'s my answer - labor built that table. You better believe labor will have a seat at the table. In the end, this election comes down to one simple question. When the speeches are over and the cameras are gone, who can you count on to listen to you? You know you can count on me to stand up for you and to deliver solutions for you. If you know one thing about me it is this - when I say I\'ll stand up for you I will and when I say I\'ll fight for you, I will. That is what I\'ve always done. It\'s what I\'ve done fighting for universal health care. We didn\'t succeed at first but I didn\'t give up and we\'re going to keep fighting. We got six million kids insured, we\'re going to get other kids insured and we\'re going to get universal health care when I am president of the United States. Right here, that\'s what you are doing in Youngstown. I know everyone in this room knows someone who has lost a job, maybe you\'re that person and I know how hard that is. But you\'re still here, you\'re still fighting, you\'re not going to give up on this community and neither am I. I\'m in this race because this nation gave me every opportunity. I believe we can do the same for every family and every child here in Ohio and across America. Ohio was one of our first frontiers. It has always led us to new ones - you gave us the airplane that first raced the skies, you gave us the astronauts who explored the heavens, including my friend and hero Senator John Glenn. You gave us steel from the mills that armed America through two world wars. You put cars in our garages, you built our cities, you created those sky scrapers rushing skyward. And here in Ohio, you always dreamed big about the future. Now it\'s time to fulfill those dreams. The question is not whether we can build the future we want, it\'s whether we will. It is whether we will. Here\'s my answer. We will create good jobs. We will provide health care for all. We will leave the next generation better off than the last. We will end this war. We will bring home our troops; we will take care of our veterans and serve them as honorably as they have served us. And yes, with your help, we will shatter the highest and hardest glass ceiling because that\'s what we do in America. We break barriers, we open doors. We make sure every voice is heard. It will take leadership and hard work but we\'ve never been short on either so I hope you will join with me. Together we will seize this moment, lift this nation and, once again, lead this world to peace and prosperity. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 20, 2008",b'Remarks at Hunter College in New York City',"b""HRC: It's great to be home![Schumer intro] HRC: Wow. Thank you so much. It is great to be here with all of you and it is wonderful to be here with my friend and colleague, our great Senator Chuck Schumer who knows a few things about wining elections. I want to thank all of the hosts who have made this event possible and so successful. I want to thank Maya Days. I want to thank Hunter College and particularly President Raab. And I want to thank my friends, all the elected officials who Senator Schumer has recognized; our labor leaders, our civic leaders, and mostly all of you for being here with me this morning. This is a great opportunity for me to say thank you. Thank you to the people of New York. Thank you so much for everything you have done. I want to congratulate Senator Obama on his victories yesterday. He's had a good couple of weeks and he's run a good race. We will be squaring off in primaries in two weeks. We're going to draw the contrasts and make the comparisons and give the people of Ohio and Texas and other states a real choice. Campaigns are not supposed to be easy. They're supposed to be hard. They're supposed to be challenging. There isn't any more important campaign than the campaign for the presidency of the United States because it is the toughest job in the world. I'm asking the people of America to hire me for a job that requires an enormous amount of effort and determination and resolve. It is about the future of our country so I am looking forward to traveling throughout the states that are upcoming to make my case because, obviously, I believe that this is the most important election in a very long time. We've got to be focused on what kind of choice we actually have before us. I don't need to tell this audience or anyone in New York for that matter that we've had seven years of drift and detour from America's destiny. We have had failed policies, wrongheaded approaches to every issue you can imagine here at home and around the world, and we are paying a terrible price from Iraq to Afghanistan, from New York City to L.A. The people of this country deserve so much better than George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Our economy is waning, not gaining. Hardworking Americans are losing their jobs, they're losing their health care, they're losing their homes. So much of the pain and insecurity is directly related to the failure of leadership directly from the White House. We have seen, time and time again, how President Bush and the Republicans have undermined the greatness of America, have disregarded our values, put our Constitution in cold storage, come back and ruled with fear and fatalism  that is not America at our best. We're going to once again demonstrate who we are, what we stand for and take back our future. But it is time to get real  to get real about how we actually win this election and get real about the challenges facing America. It's time that we moved from good words to good work, from sound bites to sound solutions. Americans have a choice to make in this election and that choice matters. It's about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work, on hard work, to get America back to work, to get America working again for all of our people. We need to make a choice between speeches and solutions, because while words matter greatly, the best words aren't enough unless you match them with action. This is becoming more apparent every day. My good friend Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones from Ohio represented me on one of the TV programs in the last day or two  some of you may have seen her. And she was on against someone representing my opponent and for the first time, actually, the host, asked the representative of my opponent to name one accomplishment. That is all we're asking. We're asking to compare our records. We're asking to compare our years of service. We're asking to compare our ideas, our solutions. Because it's not just about my opponent and myself, this election is about you. It's about what you can expect, what your dreams will be, what your futures hold. Right now too many people are struggling, working the day shift and the night shift, trying to get by without health insurance, just one paycheck away from actually losing their homes. They cannot afford four more years of a president who just doesn't see or hear them. They need a president ready on Day One to be the Commander in Chief of the United States military. I will be that candidate and I will be that president. This is the choice we make. One of us is ready to be Commander in Chief in a dangerous world. Everyday around the world, situations arise that present new threats and new opportunities situations like the change of leadership in Cuba and the elections in Pakistan. I've served on Senate Armed Services Committee; I've represented you and our country in more than 80 countries around the world. I've worked with leaders. I've stood up to the Chinese government on women's rights and human rights. I am ready to end this war, end the era of cowboy diplomacy and restore our leadership and moral authority in the world without delays and without on the job training. One of us has a plan to provide health care for every single American with no one left out, no excuses, no exceptions. I believe health care is a moral right, not a privilege and I will not rest until every American has access to quality, affordable health care, and I cannot wait until I can work with the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, our own Charlie Rangel. My opponent leaves out at least 15 million Americans. The question is who would you leave out? Would you leave out he man who called me from Northern New York who had an insurance policy that wouldn't pay for the operation his son needs. Or the woman who called me from Long Island who couldn't get bone marrow transplant for her daughter? Or the mom who said, what am I going to do with my son who has congenital heart problems and we don't have insurance? I don't want to leave anyone out. I am not running for president to put band-aids on our problems, I'm looking to solve them once and for all. [Crowd Chants: Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!] On issue after issue there are real differences. One of us has a plan to address the growing foreclosure crisis, the other doesn't. One has a plan to revive our economy right now with millions of new clean energy jobs. And one of us has actually taken on the special interests for years and years, standing against hem, fighting against them, making progress against them. Finally, one of us has faced serious Republican opposition in the past and one of us is really to do it again. Of course, the contrast with our likely Republican opponent couldn't be more stark. Senator McCain is willing to, as Chuck said; continue the war in Iraq for a hundred years. I will start bringing our troops home within sixty days. Senator McCain admits he doesn't understand much about the economy. I have a plan to turn our economy around and create five million new jobs. Senator McCain wants more of the same. I will deliver 21st century solutions so that we can get off this track towards nowhere that George Bush and the Republicans have placed us on. Both Senator Obama and I would make history and I am thrilled by that. I have spent my entire adult life working on behalf of civil rights and women's rights and here we are at this moment in American history. But maybe because I understand how difficult this job will be and how lonely it is in the Oval Office because when all the cameras are gone and the lights are out, when the advisors have all had their say, the president has to decide. We need a president who is ready to do that. Only one of us is ready on Day One. This campaign is not about a campaign, this campaign is not about a personality, this campaign is about hundreds of millions of Americans who are yearning for leadership again. People who across this country do the hard work that makes America work. I've spent most of my life helping people who are trying to make it. I know who you are. You pour coffee in the corner restaurant, you fix people's hair, you ring up the cash register, you deliver the mail, you put out fires and patrol our streets grade papers after your kids have gone to sleep. You stand on the wall late at night defending our nation so the rest of us can sleep, you're the nurses who tend to the sick, the caregivers who care and give. You're the parents on the front lines of daily life, determined to achieve the American dream for your family. You're the foundation, the families, the communities and the country we love. You truly are the miracle that makes America what it is. Others might be joining a movement. I'm joining you on the night shift, on the day shift and I'm asking you to join me to shift America into high gear again. To ensure that we build a strong and prosperous middle class, that we do all in our poor into prosperity and opportunity, that we recognize that the divisions among us are nothing compared to the unity that America can have. The results that I've been part of producing for the last 35 years are rooted in my dreams for a better future. We all carry dreams in our hearts and we need to keep dreaming. Dreaming keeps us hopeful, it lifts our spirits, it sets our sights high. Without dreams you can't aspire to be great but without action, we cannot turn those dreams into reality. I want you to fulfill your dreams and I want America to fulfill ours. It will take hard work and resolve and determination but there isn't anything we can't do once we set our minds to it. I intend, as your president, to make sure that America does fulfill all of our dreams. I judge the results of my public service on whether people are better off when I stop than when I started; whether our children will be able to live up to their God-given potential, whether America is making progress in moving toward that more perfect union that our founders promised. I'm ready to do this work and I'm ready to bring our country together. I know that if we once again start acting like Americans, we will see results. We will believe in ourselves. We will feel that pride that comes at the end of hard work that produces positive change. There are big differences in this election between me and Senator Obama and between me and Senator McCain; whether we favor speeches or solutions to move our country forward, or more of the same old Republican policies. This is a debate that the voters deserve to have. We cannot achieve unity that lasts, unity that is real, unless we accept that sometimes people disagree, not just to be disagreeable or to play political games but because they have honest and principled differences. People are entitled to defend those strong opinions, but then we've got to come together to reach consensus, to honor our differences and to work through them. We won't achieve unity or fulfill our dreams by running away from honest discussion and debate. We cannot achieve the kind of changes we want by voting present on controversial issues or by meeting behind closed doors with corporate interests to water down legislation or by caving in when the pressure mounts. The American people deserve better than that. So yes, let's get real. Let's get real about this election. Let's get real about our future. Let's get real about what it is we can do together. Let's get real about whether or not our young people learn because teachers can teach and not just test. Let's get real about whether our brave veterans are given the care and the respect they deserve. Let's get real about not just talking family values but valuing families by strengthening the middle class, creating good jobs, proving universal health care, making college affordable, taking care of our senior citizens. My campaign is about an America of shared opportunity, shared prosperity and shared responsibility. I do believe we are all in this together and we are going to demonstrate loudly and clearly that our country is worth fighting for; our country is worth standing up for. And this campaign goes on and this campaign moves forward. And this campaign, with your help, will take our country back. Thank you all and God bless you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 25, 2008","b'Remarks on Foreign Policy at George Washington University in Washington, DC'","b'Thank you. It\'s a great personal honor for me to be here with extraordinary leaders of our nation\'s military forces and to thank them for their long and dedicated service to our country. I am grateful for their confidence in my ability to lead our nation in difficult times. I want to thank my long time friend General Clark who served with such distinction and success. I want to thank another long time friend Secretary Togo West, who not only served the Army but also served the Veterans Affairs Department and gave great devotion to our men and women in the military and then when they become our veterans. I want to thank Admiral Dave Stone, General John Watkins, General Joe Ballard, and I want to thank General Antonio Taguba who showed extraordinary courage in the face of very difficult challenges when he accepted an assignment to lead the investigation into what happened at Abu Ghraib. I also want to thank all the other veterans, former officers, noncommissioned officers who are here with me and I want to also express my appreciation to all who are supporting me in this campaign. We are here at such an extraordinary moment in American history. The stakes have rarely been higher. I\'ve had numerous historians tell me that America\'s point in our arch of destiny, today is perhaps most similar to the situation confronting President Truman when he became our president and commander in chief. Dramatic events during this past week have reminded us how volatile our world has become and how essential it is that we have sound strategy and strong leadership. From Kosovo to Cuba, from Iraq to Pakistan, to our embassy being burned in Belgrade, these are some of the most challenging spots on our global map. The world is being transformed with enormous risks and possibilities that we must meet with confidence, optimism, resolution and success. The next president will inherit all of these global challenges and more from a president who failed to handle them well. A war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq. America\'s reputation at an all-time low. Countries rushing to acquire nuclear weapons. Crushing poverty that stymies economic and political progress in too many regions of the world. Global warming and global health pandemics. Genocide in Darfur. A rise of borderless, stateless criminal cartels. And the continuing real threat of terrorism here at home and abroad. But while these stark realities carry dangers, they also bring unprecedented opportunities if we act wisely, if we have the right kind of leadership. There isn\'t any doubt in my mind that we will not only navigate through these uncharted difficult waters but emerge stronger than ever, reasserting both our leadership and our moral authority. The vision I have for America is one that is rooted in those values. Values that have served us well but have been temporarily sidelined because of this administration\'s approach to the world. Over the past seven years, we\'ve seen what happens when the president presents the American people with a series of false choices and then is indifferent about the consequences: force versus diplomacy, unilateralism versus multilateralism, hard power versus soft. We\'ve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We can\'t let that happen again. America has already taken that chance one time too many. The symbol of our presidency  the American Eagle  holds arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other. Both are symbolic tools of what we need to keep our democracy strong and our nation safe tools that a President must know how to use in the daily course of events, but also when that 3 a.m. phone call comes to the White House because an unforeseen crisis has erupted without warning. In that split second the president has to respond and make a decision that could affect the safety and lives of millions of people here in our country and around the world. Whoever sits at that desk in the Oval Office on January 20th, 2009 needs all the tools available, all the resources at our disposal, and the wisdom to know how to use them. I propose a new American strategy to restore our moral authority, end the war in Iraq, and defend and protect our nation. We need a president who understands there is a time for force, a time for diplomacy, and a time for both, who understands that we enhance our international reputation and strengthen our security if the world sees the human face of American democracy in the good works, the good deeds we do for people seeking freedom from poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, and oppression. With me, this is not theoretical. This is very much who I am, what I have done, and what I will do. The American people don\'t have to guess whether I understand the issues or whether I would need a foreign policy instruction manual to guide me through a crisis or whether I\'d have to rely on advisers to introduce me to global affairs. I\'m lucky to have had a pretty good inside view, over eight years in the White House and now over seven years in the Senate, of what the president goes through day in and day out dealing with all of these challenges. Obviously the work that I have done on human rights, democracy, international development gives me a deep appreciation of the importance of winning the hearts and minds of those in societies whether or not they are for us today. I believe that we can seed democracy and create new strong alliances overseas. And I also know from my years serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee that our military power is absolutely essential but it cannot be viewed as the solution to every international problem. Yes, we must use force when necessary but as a last resort, not a first resort. As one piece of a comprehensive strategy to defend our nation and promote our values. I\'ve been honored to travel to more than 80 countries representing the United States. In sessions with foreign leaders, with influential citizens from the world of business, academia, human rights and so much else. I have traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan three times. And I\'ve seen and have said repeatedly that we must revise our strategy in Afghanistan. When I first went to Afghanistan in 2003 I was met by a soldier who said ""welcome to the forgotten front lines in the war against terrorism."" I regret to say that those front lines are still largely forgotten. It will take a new policy toward Pakistan  one that builds on the democratic yearnings expressed by the Pakistani people in elections last week and recognizes that the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan are among the most important and dangerous in the world. Ignoring these realities of what is happening on the ground in both Afghanistan and Pakistan has been one of the most dangerous failures of the Bush foreign policy. I have been to Africa and have seen how disease HIV, AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria  undermine progress across an entire continent. I pushed our government to start battling the global AIDS epidemic because this affects our security too. I\'m very hopeful that we will make progress in Africa dealing with the multiplicity of challenges that the continent faces. It was my great honor to go to Africa in the mid 1990s as a precursor to my husband\'s trip and I applaud President Bush and Mrs. Bush for going back. We need a consistent coherent strategy in dealing with Africa and that is something that I will promote. I\'m also very proud that the United States Joint Forces Command invited me to be the only senator to serve on the Transformation Advisory Group, which studies and proposes ideas to modernize and strengthen our military, to meet new and emerging global threats. That experience reinforced my commitment to looking at every single challenge we face not through a narrow prism but a broad overview because it is all interconnected  what kind of military we need, what tools we provide our men and women who serve us is directly related to what it is we are trying to accomplish and how best to utilize those resources effectively. I know very well that in exercising foreign policy you have to know both how to find common ground and how to stand our ground. Dealing with the rising power of China provides an example. I went to Beijing in 1995 and spoke out for women\'s rights and human rights. The Chinese government wasn\'t happy; they pulled the plug on the broadcast of my speech. But I took that as a compliment. Because it was important for the United States both to be represented and to make absolutely clear that human rights is an integral part of our foreign policy and that women\'s rights is key to that. What we have learned is that where women are oppressed and denied their basic rights we are more likely to have regimes that are more adversarial to American interests and values. Today, China is most obviously the world\'s largest and one of its fastest growing economies. It\'s become a global superpower that needs to be convinced to play by the rules in the global marketplace. Here again, the Bush administration has failed. One third of our trade deficit is with China and over the course of the last seven years Bush policies have has allowed the Chinese government to become our banker. Today, China\'s steel comes here and our jobs go there. We play by the rules and they manipulate their currency. We get tainted fish and lead-laced toys and poisoned pet food in return. That will change when I am in the White House because I know we have got to take a consistent approach towards China. I\'ve co-sponsored legislation to compel the Administration to take aggressive steps to stop China from manipulating its currency, to make our goods look more expensive. I\'m the original co-sponsor of the Foreign Debt Ceiling Act which really means that we would require any administration to begin reversing our trade deficit and start breaking our reliance on China for not only what they provide to us in terms of the way they buy our dollars and buy our debt but also to be held to higher standards for what they import into our market. We have to make sure that American companies have a level playing field when it comes to trade. We\'re far from reaching that goal. And I think it\'s imperative that we move because what is happening is that our standard of living in America is deteriorating. That has direct and serious implications for our capacity to operate effectively on behalf of our strategic interests in the world. It\'s very difficult to persuade the American people that we must continue to lead, that yes, there will be occasions when we have to sacrifice in furtherance of our values and interests if the standard of living, the family income here at home is deteriorating. So this is something that has to be seen as a whole. Our fiscal irresponsibility over the last seven years has undermined our ability to be the leader we need to be in the world. You cannot talk about our military and our other objectives strategically and have mired ourselves in debt and dependent upon foreign countries to keep us afloat. That also goes hand in hand with our continuing refusal to have an energy policy that is in line with our strategic objectives. So when we talk about foreign policy, we have to talk about fiscal policy, energy policy and so much else besides just the narrow view that has been primarily driven by the Bush Administration over the last seven years. So, in order to address these new challenges we do have to set a new tone both here at home and around the world. That requires that we start with the most basic of duties. A commander in chief must protect and defend our nation. On my first day in office, I will announce, as I have repeatedly in this campaign, that the era of cowboy diplomacy is over. That includes the doctrine of pre-emptive war. I have been against that for many years. I believe it led us into a blind alley and I don\'t think I need to remind the retired flag officers here today how difficult the choices made by the president have been for American military. We need a new national military strategy that employs military power wisely instead of squandering it. That requires us to begin to bring out troops home from Iraq within 60 days of the new president taking office. I believe we can redeploy one to two brigades a month but I also believe it will be dangerous. There\'s been a lot of talk about withdrawal and redeployment and I think it needs to be put into an appropriate context. Withdrawing troops is not easy. One does not wake up in the morning and say let\'s bring them home. It requires planning that looks at every possible contingency. That\'s why last spring I began pushing the Bush administration to tell us what planning had gone on, whether they were ready to bring our young men and women home. They didn\'t want to talk to us about it, as is their usual response. We finally were able to secure a briefing which although classified, I can tell you was cursory. It did not inspire confidence in our readiness to do this important task of withdrawing our troops and equipment. I think it is also important that we look at what else needs to happen simultaneously. We have 100,000 or so American civilians in Iraq. They work at the embassy and other government agencies, for businesses and charities. We need a plan for them as well. And we also have Iraqis who sided with us. One of the young officers who spoke in the pre-program is someone I have known a long time, Someone I\'ve known quite a long time. Marine Captain Iscol who began talking to me about the need to take care of those who take care of our troops, translators and drivers. When Captain Iscol was leading his men in the battle that retook Fallujah, he has said, as I\'ve heard other young marine officers who were part of that battle tell me, they would not have survived had it not been for their translators. Honor is important. It\'s important to our country. We are an honorable nation therefore we must do more to take care of those who sided with, protected and saved the lives of young Americans in Iraq. If I am entrusted with the presidency, America will have the courage, once again, to meet with our adversaries. But I will not be penciling in the leaders of Iran or North Korea or Venezuela or Cuba on the presidential calendar without preconditions, until we have assessed through lower level diplomacy, the motivations and intentions of these dictators. Raul Castro, for example, has a stark choice. He can continue to stifle human rights and economic freedom in Cuba, or he can chart a new course toward democratic reform. We need to engage with our allies in Latin America and Europe to encourage Cuba on to the right path. But we simply cannot legitimize rogue regimes or weaken American prestige by impulsively agreeing to presidential level talks that have no preconditions. It may sound good but it doesn\'t meet the real world test of foreign policy. I have traveled to so many countries working on issues involving some of the most intractable challenges we face. And as we see people respond to their own conditions, we have to be ready to act. The clearest example of that is what just happened in Pakistan. The Pakistani people essentially repudiated the Bush administration\'s policies and created a new dynamic that could lead to greater freedoms and democracy or to a greater crisis with implications for the war in Afghanistan. One thing the American people can be sure of, I will not broadcast threats of unilateral military action against a country like Pakistan just to demonstrate that I am tough enough for the job. We have to change our tone and change our course. So let\'s begin by reviving old fashioned diplomacy. One of my criticisms of the Bush administration is that they have such a narrow circle of people advising the President. Apparently there is only one diplomat the President will send anywhere and that is Secretary Rice. So if Secretary Rice can\'t get to the Middle East or get to Pakistan or get to Africa or get anywhere, you don\'t get the feeling that the President is engaged. I think that is a terrible failure. The president needs to have a broad circle of advisers calling upon distinguished Americans both in and out of government to serve as presidential envoys, something that I urged when I came back from Pakistan and Afghanistan last January. I urged the White House to send a high-level presidential envoy. I said there is a lot of misunderstanding between President Musharraf and President Karzai and it is going to cause us problems. That was not accepted by the White House and instead, full support continued for President Musharraf as he moved further and further away from democracy, as his strategy for battling Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremists proved time and time again to be inadequate. We have a new opportunity now. We need to be supporting those in Pakistan from the middle class, from the professions who are our natural allies in order to give American approval to the changes that have taken place in the elections. The more we have people invested in their own futures, the more likely they are to work with us to protect our future. That is what I will attempt to do. It is also important that we revive our commitment at a very public level to human rights and individual freedom. Let\'s close Guantanamo. Let\'s make it clear that we will never sanction torture and we will stand for the rule of law. Let\'s build a real coalition of allies to defeat terrorists in Afghanistan and other countries that provide a safe haven for al Qaeda. Let\'s make it clear that any terrorists who attack the United States, who have safe haven in any country, are putting that country at risk. That is one way for us to demonstrate that we will not be the aggressor, we will not engage in pre-emptive attacks, but we will defend our nation. We need, also, to begin to be serious about Darfur. Everyday we fail to act, the betrayal of fundamental values. The peace keeping force has not been deployed for reasons many of you know objections by members of the security counsel among others. The United States has to be pushing much more aggressively to get that done. We also do need to lead the world toward a sound energy policy that treats global warming as the crisis it is and not science fiction. I have said that I would meet with the countries that are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions until we hammered out an agreement, hopefully within a year that would China and India who have to be part of the solution. We also need to be moving quickly toward a coming to terms with our oil companies and our oil producing country allies. We need to demonstrate our commitment to home-grown energy. We can\'t do that, I know, until the two oil men leave the White House but as soon as they do, we have to be ready aggressively. We will lead the world in combating AIDS. I was proud to sign a pledge to invest $50 billion by 2013 to combat AIDS across the globe. We will lead the world in standing up for women\'s rights and I know that this is an issue that goes to the heart of who we are as a nation. Because when women continue to comprise the majority of the world\'s unhealthy, unfed and unschooled, the global community cannot prosper or make progress. When women continue to be raped as a tactic of war, trafficked by criminal cartels, and subjected to violence both in and out of their homes, that compromises the dignity and humanity of the entire human family. We will also lead in providing opportunity to the world\'s children. When 100 million children in the developing world don\'t attend school and 150 million more drop out before finishing the first grade  that is a recipe for poverty, instability and extremism. That\'s why I have introduced the bipartisan Education for All Act; $10 billion over five years for the goal of basic education for every boy and every girl around the world. Now, that is the beginning of the security agenda that I would begin implementing within the first 100 days. We all know that we have a lot of work to do to repair the damage that we will inherit. In this campaign people are offered clear choices. Senator McCain is a friend of mine. He is to be commended for his courageous service to our nation during the Vietnam War. But in terms of foreign and security policy, in the calamitous wake of President Bush, Senator McCain can\'t seem to budge from Bush approach that insists on using military force when diplomacy is needed. He has said he wants to keep our troops in Iraq. It would be fine with him for 50 to 100 years. I will start bringing them home within 60 days. It\'s also important that we combine all of our tools, economic aid, humanitarian aid, focusing on issues like disease, children\'s schooling and women\'s place, something that I believe I will be much better able to do. Senator Obama, meanwhile, represents another choice. He wavers from seeming to believe that mediation and meetings without preconditions can solve the world\'s most intractable problems. To advocating rash unilateral military action without cooperation from our allies in the most sensitive region of the world. Electing a president should not be an either/or proposition when it comes to national security. We need a president who knows how to deploy both the olive branch and the arrows, who will be ready to act swiftly and decisively in a crisis, who will pursue strategic demands of hard diplomacy to re-establish moral authority and our leadership. In this moment of peril and promise, we need a president who is tested and ready, who can draw on years of real world experience working on many of the issues that we now confront, who knows when to stand ones ground and when to seek common ground, who has the strength and fortitude to meet the challenges head on without fear and without sowing fear. I believe I am the candidate most ready today to be that kind of president and commander in chief. I will never let America\'s good name be disgraced. I will always protect and defend our nation and I will always advance the traditions and values that have made our country, as President Lincoln said, the last best hope on earth. Thank you all very much. I also want to recognize Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, an Iraq War veteran, the lieutenant governor of Maryland. I\'m proud to have his support.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 27, 2008","b'Remarks at the Economic Summit in Zanesville, Ohio'","b'Senator John Glenn: Thank you all for being here today and it is great to be back home in southeast Ohio, Annie and I grew up just down the road in New Concord, as most of you are aware. A real pleasure to be here today, I don\'t think if anything is more appropriate than having an economic summit here, not just because of this part of Ohio, but for the whole country; all the things we talk about are going to happen or not happen as the economy of the country dictates on what we can do for the future. That\'s why it\'s so important, and I know there are lots of people to give their opinions on this today, we welcome them all here to Ohio. It\'s my pleasure to introduce to you another person from the southern and southeastern part of Ohio, our great Governor Ted Strickland who was a minister, a psychologist, and a great new governor. Ted Strickland. Governor Ted Strickland: Thank you very much. As the governor of this wonderful state, I am so proud to have so many of our special guests with us today. I\'m always happy to present Ohio and it\'s a greatness to people from outside of our state. As I have said many times, Ohio is a state that is a microcosm of America. We have incredible diversity in Ohio, and we celebrate that diversity. We have the wonderful foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and we have the great Lake Erie to the north; we have natural resources that are immense. We have racial and ethnic and cultural and religious, economic and geographic diversity like few other states. Ohio is a state with a proud history. Ohio and Ohioans, Senator, have not just built Ohio; Ohioans have built America, and we are proud of our history. But Ohio like many states is facing economic challenges. Too many of our families are facing the possibility of losing their homes through foreclosure. Too many of our workers have lost and are in danger of losing their jobs. Too many Ohioans, possibly as many as 1.3 million Ohioans are without health care insurance or coverage for health care needs. Too many of Ohioans are deployed in this conflict, more Ohio National Guard men and women, Senator, are deployed today then at any time since World War II. And we keep them in our hearts and in our prayers, and pray for a speedy recovery and a return to their home. Having said that, it is appropriate that the eyes of the nation are focused on Ohio; and that we are focused on the economy because I believe we have a candidate in Senator Clinton who understand Ohio and who understands the economic burdens facing our people and our state. I have traveled this state with her. I have sat with her as she has talked with real people facing real challenges. The reason that I am so excited about this event is because I believe Ohio wants to hear what is going to be done to create jobs, to expand opportunity and to make a decent life available to the people who live within the borders of our wonderful state. So thank you Senator for coming to this part of Ohio, and for traveling around all of Ohio. We look forward to your leadership today, in the weeks to come, and once you are in the White House. Welcome to Ohio. Senator Hillary Clinton: I am especially pleased to be here and especially to be with two of your native sons: Senator John Glenn who is so well known and honored across our country and the world, and your dynamic, effective governor Ted Strickland. This is a great opportunity for us to talk about not just the problems which people know pretty well for themselves, but what kind of solutions we can put together that will improve the economy, produce more jobs, enable us to keep the jobs that are here, increase the prosperity, make sure young people can stay home near their families in order to make a living, build a strong and prosperous middle class again. So I\'m very excited about being here with distinguished guests. You\'ll meet them in a minute; they come from across Ohio and America to be right here in Zanesville, ""The Y Bridge City."" The mayor told me about the Y bridge, and I don\'t know how many Y bridges there are, but just another in- that\'s pretty impressive. Senator Glenn: This is the only one that cars can drive on, the other one is in Germany, and it is a pedestrian bridge. This is the only one in the world. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well that\'s a great distinction, congratulations. So we came to a place that is already quite unique, here in the Y Bridge City, to talk about the future. We\'re joined by distinguished guests from across the state as well as the country; elected officials, leaders from labor and business and education, and some hard-working Ohioans who you\'ll hear from. Now we may have come from different backgrounds but we\'re all here with the same purpose. And that is- when it comes to our economy, we know we can do a lot better. I have been across Ohio and across America for more than a year, actually going back about 16 years when I was first privileged to travel extensively in our country. This has been a great opportunity for me to hear firsthand from the people who are worried about their jobs because they\'ve already seen those jobs be shipped over seas. They\'re worried about losing health care, because they\'ve already seen that health care lost. They\'re worried about affording college because they\'ve already seen too many young people from too many hard working families who are having a hard time affording the rising costs. They\'ve already seen energy prices go up so fast over the last 7 years that the average family is paying more then $2,000 in energy today then they were in 2000. So people are living with the realities, and they\'re meeting them with the grit and determination that we would expect from Ohioans and Americans. But it\'s time that we had a president who is going to be a fighter and a champion for the American people again, who would get up everyday- Who would get up everyday and would say what are we going to do together, to the White House staff and the Cabinet and the government and the business and labor leaders in our country; what are we going to today to improve the lives of young hard working Americans? What are we going to do to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class? That is my mission. That is what I would do as your president. I see a middle class comeback and I see it starting in places like Zanesville. It won\'t happen though just by hoping for it, it will only happen if we are determined and we have a plan and we implement it, and we see the results. And that\'s what I intend to do. I put forth my Economic Blueprint for the 21st century; it includes a lot of the specifics that I\'ve been traveling around Ohio talking about. We\'re going to rein in the corporate special interests; we can take back $55 billion in tax giveaways that the Republicans and George Bush have handed out to the oil companies, to the drug companies, to the health insurance companies. We\'re going to say ""wait a minute Wall Street; you\'ve had your president. Now we need a president for Main Street."" And we\'re going to make that happen. We\'re going to start investing in manufacturing again. I believe you can\'t have a strong economy unless you have a strong manufacturing sector. We can\'t rely on other countries to produce what the American military needs. So it\'s not only a question for our economy, it\'s a question for our national security. I believe we could create at least five million green collar jobs with clean renewable energy that would put Ohioans to work starting soon. I also know that if we invest in our infrastructure - more bridges, tunnels, roads, water systems, sanitation systems - we would put a lot of people to work and we would upgrade our infrastructure for the 21st century. In order to do that, we\'re going to close every tax loophole that still gives one penny of your tax dollars to any company that exports a job. Instead we\'re going to put that money to work here. We\'re going to address the home foreclosure and mortgage crisis, you\'ll hear a little bit about that today. Too many Ohioans are losing their homes; the numbers are staggering: 150,000 homes and foreclosures last year; 13,000 notices went out in January alone. These are a lot of hard working people who thought they were going to right thing. I\'ve said we should have a moratorium on home foreclosures. Let\'s figure out as way to work out keeping people in their homes, instead of having vacant houses in neighborhoods that will decrease property values for everybody. I believe we need universal health care, no exceptions, no excuses, and I know we can achieve that. We do need affordable college again, something that is one of my highest priorities. It is now more expensive for a young person to go to college in America than it was thirty and forty years ago, that\'s wrong. Through a combination of tax credit and aid, reining in the student loan companies that have been acting like predatory lenders, we\'re going to go back to direct lending to help students afford to go to college. And if they come out with debt, if they are willing to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or law enforcement, we will forgive their debt so that they can be debt free. We\'re going to start supporting our unions again, because when unions were strong we had a strong middle class. It\'s not an accident. It\'s time that working people had a president on their side again. Finally, we are going to have trade that lifts up our families: pro-worker, pro-environment, pro-American trade. That\'s going to be one of my highest priorities. I know that NAFTA has hurt a lot of Ohio\'s families. That\'s why I have taken action; I\'m the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to fix NAFTA. And I will also crack down on China\'s unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation which gives them big advantages over our companies and our country. We\'re not just here to talk about what I want to do; I want to hear what people have to say about what we can do together. We have an extraordinary group of people, and I want to hear about the challenges that they face. I\'m going to ask each person to introduce him or herself because I want your advice. I will be a president, just as I have been a senator, who listens. I think you learn more when you\'re listening than when you are talking. And what is necessary for Zanesville may not be the same as Toledo, may not be the same as San Antonio, may not be the same as Chicago or New York. So we need to look closely at what will work in communities across Ohio and America. I think that we\'ve got some great opportunities here. We hear a lot about the problems and they are serious but I believe for every problem, there is at least one solution. We just have to start acting like Americans again and roll up our sleeves and actually solve our problems. No more whining, no more finger pointing, let\'s get to work. I\'d like to start our discussion today by hearing from the Ohioans who have graciously taken their time out to join us. I want to start with Dave Cimperman. Dave and I met at Grace\'s Grill in Parma last week. David has worked at General Motors for more than forty years, and he sees the economy from the front lines of the work force. I want to ask Dave if you can share with us what you see as the key economic challenges facing you and your family. Dave Cimperman: Senator, one of the big things that I see is the universal health care. General Motors is paying each, is charging $1,600 per vehicle because of the health care that they\'re giving us. They\'re competing with automobile companies in Japan... It\'s time we got one. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well, obviously I agree with Dave and I\'m really happy he mentioned this because there are two very important reasons that we should have universal health care. The first is that it is the morally right thing to do. I do not believe people in our country should be denied access to quality, affordable health care. And the second reason is there is no doubt in my mind, as Dave just said, we have lost jobs over the last 20 years and increasingly over the last seven years where we\'ve lost, in Ohio alone, 200,000 jobs in manufacturing while George Bush has been president. And one of the main reasons is health care costs. Because as Dave said, General Motors has to put $1,600 of its money into ever car, imagine what a competitive disadvantage that is. Other countries don\'t impose that burden on their companies, and particularly on their manufacturers. So it\'s economically necessary for us to achieve universal health care. Dave, you\'ve been working for General Motors for quite some time; are there other issues in addition to universal health care that we have to address? Dave Cimperman: We would like to see a more even trade policies. There are a number of them that we are allowed limited number of vehicles to countries and we take up a lot more coming into this country. I must mention, Senator, that the same forty years I worked for General Motors, I was also a United Auto Workers, in the union, I\'m still in the union. I\'m giving you my opinions, not the union\'s opinions. But there are many, many members who feel the same way I do, and are backing you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you, well, I\'ve worked with the UAW for years, and I know that they share your commitment to universal health care and to leveling the playing field so that we have a chance to compete. American workers are the best in the world, we\'re most productive. We just need to be unshackled so we can compete fairly and that\'s what we are going to try to achieve, so thank you very much Dave. Now I\'d like to welcome Robert Landry and Beth Dlabay. I met them in Dayton, and they\'ve driven all the way from Dayton to be with us today. On Christmas Eve, Robert and Beth lost their home in a home foreclosure. I know what a shock that was to them because I heard them talk about it. But I want to really personalize these statistics. Millions of people have lost their homes in the last several years. The Bush administration has taken little to no action to try to prevent it. I have a plan to try to stop the home foreclosure crisis. But I want you to hear from Robert and Beth what it means when you\'re actually faced with that. Robert, why don\'t you start; can you tell us how this happened to you? And then you and Beth tell us how you\'re managing now. Robert Landry: well, you know, it just starts where you\'re just doing your thing. You\'re working, you got a decent job, you\'re paying your bills on time. All of the sudden you notice one of your payments isn\'t taken out. You call the mortgage company up and you ask them what\'s going on. Then you find out, they say ""it\'s lost, just wait."" Okay. Then the next thing you know, but what you don\'t know is you\'re being marked late, they\'re hitting your credit and you find out that you\'ve got a predatory loan that\'s going to reset in a couple months. The next time you try to pay it on time, they do the same thing, they mark you late. Then you cannot refinance with a good rate. And you start freaking out. This is your home; your grandkids depend on you; you\'ve got a good job. This can\'t happen to me. There\'s laws and you call, you do everything. You write the governor and- not this governor- Governor Ted Strickland: Thank you. Robert Landry: And he gives me a letter saying it\'s not within his jurisdiction. I didn\'t know the law, but I thought well maybe he could make a phone call or something. I don\'t know. Maybe because it\'s not just me, it\'s happening to a lot of people. You fill a loan, the bottom drops out of your whole life. You think your doing to right thing, and then it\'s all over. They give you a number to the Bar Association; you get a real estate lawyer. You go in there, they say, ""well I can research it for four hours and write a nasty letter for $800,"" and you\'ve already paid some late- they say you were late, they say you have late fees. Then you call again. You\'ve got records that your right, you\'ve got everything, you did, your bank gave you print outs for months. You present that to them and they say ""no, you\'re still late, no, you\'re still late, you still owe us another $1,000 from when you first started paying two years ago"" or something. You just don\'t know what to do. The bottom line is, you don\'t know what to do and you\'re lost. I finally got a hold of fair housing, Miami Valley Fair Housing, and they\'re non-profit and they helped us out. But they made us go through a rigorous interview to get involved in their process. At least after months of them making me go through classes to make sure I could pay my bills, when I already was, they finally agreed to take us on. But they sent out RESPA letters for me. You\'re required by law to answer these letters, you\'re required to stop hitting a person\'s credit and you have to tell them or every penny went. Well, they don\'t answer them because it\'s a small fine. It\'s insignificant compared to the value of your home. So, long story short, we just needed someone to be there for us and we felt lost. We voted, you know, that\'s the only thing you can do is vote for change and we voted for Governor Strickland. I almost feel like it worked, my one vote worked because I\'m sitting right next to him. Senator Hillary Clinton: Beth, do you want to add anything to what Robert said? Beth Dlabay: It was just really difficult because, in the meantime our granddaughter that was living with us had to undergo open heart surgery and the lender\'s attorney did not want to wait on us to sign the papers, they just wanted us to sign the papers and get out. Well, we had to travel from Dayton to Cincinnati and find somebody else to take care of our other two grandchildren because she had to have a pulmonary valve put in. They didn\'t care. If it hadn\'t been for the Miami Valley Fair Housing Center I really don\'t know what we would have done. And there\'s too many people, they can\'t even help them. There\'s a lot more people. We got out of it, we\'re fine, our granddaughter\'s fine, we\'re going to make it. We found another house to live in. we got the kids Christmas, we made sure we had a tree up Christmas Eve even though we had to be out. I got everything ready for them and when we went and got them, they had Christmas. That\'s the important thing, I just wish that Miami Valley Fair Housing Center could help more people like us but they need the funding; they don\'t get it. I don\'t want any other family to have to go what we went through, ever. Senator Hillary Clinton: When I first met Robert and Beth in Dayton they had one of their grandsons with them and it was so impressive to me the way Robert explained how he\'d always paid his bills; he was raised in a family where you\'re supposed to pay your bills. He sent in the check, and this is one of the many scams that these lenders get away with- where they claim you\'re late. You can show when you sent it, and they say well we didn\'t receive it. And you of course can\'t control when they claim they received it. Then they use those late payments to force a higher interest rate on you. Force you into refinancing. It\'s just a terrible abuse that does need to be cracked down on. And Robert is rightthe fine is so small it\'s worth a lot of these companies just gambling. So I think there needs to be criminal consequences and much tougher fines to rein in these lenders. As Beth said, we need more help to the organizations that are trying to save people\'s homes and I have a proposal where we would put money into doing just that, help communities that are facing a high foreclosure rate. As the governor knows so well, Ohio has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, I think it\'s like number nine in the whole country. This is a big issue that affects so many families here. We\'re so lucky to have Governor Strickland with us because he\'s been working hard to turn around Ohio, and he has lots of great ideas about how he\'s going to improve the economic lives of people across the state. So Governor, I\'d like to ask you to tell us what you think are the three most pressing economic challenges that you face as the governor of Ohio. Governor Ted Strickland: Senator, we have huge budget challenges. We passed a budget not many months ago unanimously. Every Republican and every Democrat in the Senate voted for it and all but one member of the House of Representatives voted for it; although both chambers are controlled by the Republican Party, we were able to work together to fashion a budget that identified priorities for Ohio. We wanted a budget that would provide health care coverage for all of our children, we wanted a budget that would freeze college tuition after ten straight years of annual increases in tuition of 9%, every year for ten years, making Ohio 47% more costly for our young people to go to an Ohio public college or university than was the national average. We did some really good things in a very bipartisan way. But the economy\'s had a downturn. The national economy is affecting what\'s happening here in Ohio. And so I\'ve been faced, just within the last few weeks, of having to make some very painful decisions because we\'ve had to cut over $730 million out of the budget. These decisions affect real people, real families and real children. So, if I were to give you the three things that I think could be most helpful to Ohio and, quite frankly, these are the reasons that I\'m supporting you. I\'ve known you for 15 years but I wouldn\'t support you if I didn\'t think you were the best candidate for Ohio. In Ohio, as is the case in many other states, 21 states are now having to go back and revisit their budgets. 21 states and that number is growing. So, we have huge rising Medicaid expenditures in Ohio. So if we had a heath care system that could provide health care coverage to everyone in a plan-fu, rational way, it would make such a huge difference. I say to people ""can you imagine what life would be like if all of us had access to affordable health care? Can we imagine the burden that would be taken off the shoulders of moms and dads knowing that their loved ones had access to health care coverage? What it would do to our businesses in terms of making them more competitive if they didn\'t have this burden?"" So Senator, I believe, and I\'m going to sound very political here but I\'m going to do it because I think it\'s absolutely true, I think you are the only candidate that can help us realize a Democratic dream, an American dream; since the days of Harry Truman we\'ve tried to get universal health care coverage for the American people and we\'ve been unable to. We are finally at a place where that can happen. The physicians, the health care providers now know it\'s necessary. The business leaders in our state now know it\'s necessary. I think things are coming together. What we need right now is a president that is committed to getting it done. I am convinced that the one thing that could be helpful to all Ohioans and to our overall economy is what you will do as presidentthat\'s bring universal health care coverage to our people. The second thing we need, and I\'ll be quick, we need jobs. We need jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. And I\'m proposing a $1.7 billion bond package that will create jobs in Ohio but I know that you\'re working on that at the federal level. You understand that we\'ve got to start investing in America. We\'ve got to start building the infrastructure that is necessary to repair our roads and bridges and sewer systems and water systems to help local communities build our country. That will create jobs and so that\'s the second thing. And the third thing is certainly education because education is the ultimate hope for our people and making sure we have a good, high-quality educational experience for our children from their youngest years through even graduate work and the adult worker up to the time of retirement. These are the three things that I think Ohio needs. I think they\'re the things that you as president will accomplish. If we can get that done, you become president and you do those three things for Ohio, we\'re going to say you were a pretty good president. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well, you will have a partner in the White House to really tackle all of these challenges because they\'re so important. And you\'ve given us a lot to think about. One of the issues that I\'d like to get into because it\'s related to what governor Strickland said is both an economic opportunity and a way of giving people a real shot at the American dreamthat\'s housing. What are we going to do to provide more housing that\'s affordable? And what are we going to do to deal with this home foreclosure crisis? Someone whom I admire so much is current governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, who\'s with us. He is also a former United States Senator with whom I served. And he was before that the Chief Executive Officer of one of the largest, most successful financial firms in the world, Goldman Sachs. So he\'s had a lot of experience in both the public and the private sector. So Governor Corzine, two questions  specifically with respect to the housing crisis, how would you have approached a financial challenge like this when you were in the private sector, and what steps do you think we should take both at the state and the federal level? And then in addition, same question to you that I asked Governor Strickland, the three big challenges that you\'re coping with as Governor, Governor Corzine. Governor Jon Corzine: Thank you Senator Clinton and it\'s great to be here in Ohio and be with the great Senator Glenn, Governor Strickland and all the citizens. I have to say, Senator Clinton, the stories that I\'ve heard already from the people here and the problems that\'s Governor Strickland outlined sound like I\'m back home in New Jersey. We have people that struggle every day to make ends meet on health care issues, on housing issues; they\'re worried about their jobs. We\'re actually just closing right now the last General Motors auto production plant in our state. We had five auto production plants 15, 20 years ago. We are going to have no auto production at all. So these are real issues. The housing crisis that we have in the countryforeclosures, predatory lending, facts that people got into, home ownership under false pretenses by people who sold them more than they could actually carry are things that you were talking about when I was a United States Senator. Predatory lending was one of the things that we worked on together. This is not something that Senator Clinton didn\'t recognize before that\'s why I know she\'s the most qualified individual to be the president. And I\'m an old washed up finance person but, I\'ll tell you, if you got in trouble in a corporate situation you\'d go to your bank and you\'d talk about having a moratorium on debt payments. You\'d negotiate a new loan agreement. Senator Clinton has talked about that for the American people that are having trouble with their mortgages. We need a freeze on the rates of subprime adjustable lending that Robert talked about. You can\'t- we\'re better to actually get Robert to be able pay something than nothing. Robert Landry: 14.9. Governor Jon Corzine: It\'s ridiculous, its ridiculous and it needs to be dealt with. The second thing is we need to have a moratorium on foreclosures altogether so that people can catch up and make a difference. Senator Clinton proposed these things six months ago, not now. This is something she recognized before the housing prices became a huge problem. I think that speaks to the kind of president she\'d be, not only about this issue, but a lot of issues, because she has the foresight to see how we ought to be addressing them. I have to tell you as a governor, she\'s also got another element of her plan where she wants to put $30 billion into funds that actually would get distributed to Governor Strickland or New Jersey or states across- so that we can actually work with families more closely. We\'re all struggling with our budgets but if the federal government doesn\'t offer a partnership it won\'t happen. Also I can tell you that both from my business background and from my life as New Jersey\'s governor, I can tell you that the plans that she\'s laid down are practical, they show real solutions, they\'re far more than words. They are the real deal. This is how you get out of this crisis. Senator Clinton is onto the right track. Senator Hillary Clinton: As Governor Corzine said, jobs are a problem everywhere. Some places are harder hit than other places but the issue really is how do we keep the jobs we have and how do we create more jobs? I\'ve been pleased the last several days to have a number of New Yorkers travelling across Ohio talking about the work we\'ve done together to try to keep and grow jobs. I am grateful that I\'ve been a partner with people like Gary Douglas who\'s the very active president of one of our Chambers of Commerce in New York who has been just focused on keeping jobs and bringing jobs to his part of the state. It\'s really important that we zero in on what works. How are we going to keep and grow jobs? I\'d like to turn now to your Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher. He is the Director of the Department of Development here in Ohio and Lieutenant Governor Fisher is on the cutting edge of trying to bring advanced clean energy jobs to Ohio. This is an issue that I am both passionate about and very excited so I would love to hear from Lieutenant Governor Fisher about the steps you are taking to try to create clean energy jobs in Ohio. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher: Senator Clinton, Governor Strickland has given me the double honor not just to serve as his Lieutenant Governor but also to serve as his Director of Economic Development and so I wake up every single morning focused on one thing and one thing onlyand that is jobs and economic growth so that every Ohioan, no matter where they live, no matter who they are, has the economic opportunity that many of us have had. I, like Governor Strickland, have had the opportunity to know you for many years; in my case 17 years. And I know the governor and I want more than anything else a partner in the White House who not only will come up with the solutions but understands the problems because she has actually dealt with them in her capacity not just as an elected official but as a private individual. Cities like Zanesville and Cleveland and Toledo are not new to you because you\'ve been travelling to our cities for 16 years and I can tell you that I believe that our greatest strength in our state is the fact that we, under Governor Strickland\'s leadership, are marrying our proud past with an even more dynamic future. Let me explain what I mean. Ohio is known for many things but I would say more than anything it is known for three things. First, that we are the seed-bed of invention, entrepreneurship, innovation, and exploration. The best example of exploration being none other than U.S. Senator John Glenn. And I think you know that these days that we measure the strength of our economy not just by the height of our smoke stacks or the strength of our backs but also by the depth of our innovation and the strength of our ideas, which is why what we are doing is taking advantage of our strong manufacturing base. We are the third largest manufacturing state in our country. And why we are taking advantage of our agricultural base, as the largest economic force in our state, and actually converting that into the future. Examples? We\'re going from bicycles, to bio fuels. We\'re going from gliders to turbine engines and lunar rockets. We\'re going from cellulose and cord and soy beans to ethanol and other biofuels. We\'re going from a manufacturing base to wind turbines. Just this afternoon I spoke to a CEO of a company called Minster Machine where Governor Strickland recently visited. This is a company that began as a blacksmith\'s shop 111 years ago. They are known as a strong but small manufacturing company. The CEO, a year ago, after Governor Strickland was elected, and I think primarily because Governor Strickland was elected, decided to look into doing something new. They have started a division of Minster Machine called Minster Wind. And they are right now, with our help and with the help of other partners, creating a wind division and taking advantage of the fact that Ohio has got this supply chain of manufacturers that can make the gearboxes and all the bearings and all the components of windmills. But they want to do more. They actually want to make the windmill itself. They don\'t just want to be the component parts. Today we have over 60 manufacturing companies that are helping supply wind power around the world. And I believe that under Governor Strickland\'s leadership and the $1.7 billion jobs plan that he recently announced, we will end up setting aside, I believe, more funds in our state, Senator, than any other state in the country perhaps even more than New Jersey and New York. For alternative advanced energy, we\'ve already set aside $1 billion in low interest loans to private companies wanting to get into the wind business. And if the Governor\'s plan passes this November, and I hope with all of your support we\'ll have not only a new president of the United States by the name of Hillary Clinton, but that we\'ll also have a new jobs plan that will set aside  but that we\'ll also have a jobs plan in November that will set aside $250 million above and beyond what we\'ve already set aside for bringing Ohio into the 21st century and moving Ohio to the head of the class. Senator Hillary Clinton: That\'s exciting. Very exciting, Lee. You know, other countries have a head start on us. Denmark gets a lot of its energy, now, from wind. As a result it\'s been manufacturing a lot of the windmills and obviously exporting them. Germany is getting a great deal of economic benefit from investing in solar power and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. And they\'ve done exactly what you\'re describing. The government said ""look, we\'ve got to help start the market for this. We\'ve got to have the low interest loans. We have to make the investments. We have to train the work force."" That\'s why I\'ve been a strong proponent of green collar jobs and passed the first training program to start getting people equipped to do this work. But I believe that we can create at least five million new jobs in America over the next ten years. And that\'s the kind of visionary work that you\'re doing. Continuing our focus on jobs, which is the key here, I\'d like to turn to Gary Dwyer who is the Secretary Treasurer for the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council. Gary Dwyer is a 33 year member of the Iron Workers. He currently represents 90,000 union construction workers in Ohio. Gary, we would love to hear your views about the best ways to create good jobs here in the state. Secretary Treasurer Gary Dwyer: Thank you very much Senator. And when you say the title, I\'m from the Ohio State Building Trade. And that\'s what we like to do: build. We like to build buildings, bridges, everything. I want to tell you four brief stories if you let me about what happened to me in my personal career. When I joined the Ironworkers Local 17 in Cleveland, Ohio. At local we had 400 ironworkers in the steel mills every single day. 400. Today I don\'t even think sometimes you can even find 4 ironworkers in those mills. Where did those jobs go? They\'re not up in Cleveland anymore. I recently went up to Cleveland I\'ve been away for over three years- and one of the biggest jobs that was going when I left was the job of dismantling the steel mill and sending that steel mill to China. It really saddens me when I go by that old vacant spot where the steel mill used to be and now it\'s a retail store. I think we have enough of these strip shopping malls in different places and we need to get back to our real manufacturing jobs, and our base. One of the highlights of my career as an ironworker was I was in charge of the children\'s Christmas party every year and I did it for over 12 years. It was my job to go out and find union made toys for my 2,000 members\' children. I would come out and worked very hard and my kids thought I was the greatest thing in the world when I would go and buy hundreds of different toys. After a couple years the list of union made toys started getting smaller. So finally I had to go to the second alternative and that was ""Made in America."" And I did that for about three or four years and the catalogue that used to be that big started getting down and down and down. Some of the names that you know like Tonka, Etch-a-Sketch, all these things that I had bought for many, many years were no longer made in the United States. They were gone. Once again, I told you, we like to build things. Other effects when the jobs go out of town, we don\'t build new buildings and put those companies in, those manufacturing, my people, we just don\'t work anymore. One of the saddest stories I have. We built a building, a brand new state of the art building up in Cleveland, Senator, and I\'m sure you\'ve heard the name Mr. Coffee. No longer than we even built that building and the next thing, it was gone. They moved to Mexico. After they were in Mexico I think they moved to a couple other countries and then a couple other countries. The price kept going down, what they were willing to pay for that wage. But you know what? When you go in the store to buy that coffee maker, I\'ve never seen the price go down. It\'s pretty sad. I\'m not sure what happened to all those buildings that are sitting vacant. I used to live on the east side of Cleveland and I can tell you all these horror stories. The stories that add Addressograph, Multi-craft, Fisher Price, Coit, all the different jobs are sitting up there vacant so when you build things and you have all these vacant buildings it\'s not a good thing. We have a lot of good hopes with you coming on. We look forward to building our manufacturing base. And I can tell you that things are changing around and it\'s changing in Ohio because I had the opportunity - and this is quite unique here - I had the privilege and honor to go with Lieutenant Governor Fisher to Japan for a trade mission. When was the last time that a labor official got to go? Myself and two other labor officials got an opportunity to go. And the thing that I came out with, when we were competing for jobs and the Lieutenant Governor was up there talking, everyone was saying ""you\'ve got to come here I\'m from this business, I\'m from this business."" He always said the same thing ""I\'m here with the largest delegate of business and labor and we want your business here in Ohio."" I want to thank you very much for that. We\'re all in this together. And if we don\'t think like that, if we don\'t continue to have these discussions, we\'re all going to be going down the wayside by ourselves. We have started labor managements; we\'ve been talking about them from day one now. How do we stay competitive and how do we start talking? Senator, thank you for listening. I cannot tell you how excited I was to be invited to this panel and then can actually- and please do me a favor, when you\'re president, keep these conversations going. Senator Hillary Clinton: Yes, yes. Great idea. DWYER: In closing I want to tell a couple of stories. I hate to say it. I was not only a builder but I was a Marine. So I come from two very highly whatever you want to call it. But every year my Ironworker International would have a training out in San Diego, California and I was privileged enough to go out for training. Just a little gut check, I would go out to a little place over there called Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and I would see what these young men and women protecting our country, and I would go there and I would just suck in the gut, get a little taller and I felt so good. Then one day, probably about four years ago, I went there for my regular, to go buy my Marine Corps memorabilia and everything. I went into the store, I bought four shirts, I brought a couple back. I looked at the label. And, I\'ll tell you, it saddened me because that shirt was not only made in America at one time by a company called Fruit of the Loom, but now was being made in Vietnam and was being sold in that Marine Corps recruit depot. And I have not ever worn another shirt with a Marine Corps emblem on ever since then. If we can not buy American, fix America first, there\'s something wrong. Thank you very much for having me here. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you so much Gary both for your leadership and your passion about what you do because you\'re absolutely right. We have to create a new ethic of patriotism. We\'ve got to start being focused on making sure that our country, which has given so many blessings to many of us, continues to be able to do so for years and years and years to come. Unfortunately we have a lot of CEOs of major corporations today in America who seem to have forgotten how fortunate they are that they have been given the gift of American citizenship and support for them and their families. So we\'re going to call on them too to be part of the solution and to work, as you pointed out, hand in hand to try to get back those jobs and do it in a way that we can be very excited about what it\'s going to mean for our kids and grandkids going forward. So thank you so much. Now we\'re going to turn to Lieutenant Governor David Patterson from New York. David is a great friend of mine. He is an extraordinary public servant and leader. He has been working very hard on a lot of the same issues that affect Ohio in upstate New York. I often say that upstate New York has a lot of similarity to Ohio; our cities, our small towns, our countryside, our farmland. And I\'ve been working very hard to create more jobs in upstate New York and David has as well, working with Governor Spitzer. David I\'d like you to perhaps describe what you\'re doing and maybe some of he positive changes and successes that you\'re seeing. Lieutenant Governor David Patterson: Senator, I was thinking of exactly what you\'re saying when I was reading in the Columbus Dispatch this morning about a company that\'s going to pay workers $16 an hour and create 100 jobs in Lancaster, Ohio in Fairfield County. And they are going to begin that immediately. And we find in New York this same issue as in Ohio. Ohio lost over one quarter of its manufacturing jobs, over 200,000 workers out of work since the year 2000. New York has lost 189,000 manufacturing jobs going back to the same time period. What Governor Spitzer is doing is the same thing getting companies to come into the state, going around. You get well the same way you got sick, a little at a time, trying to build back the workforce in upstate New York which is a region struggling for survival. Its economy is such that almost 30% of our college graduates move out of New York to greater opportunities. But I think, Senator, what you have talked about can I call you Madame President?  Senator Hillary Clinton: No, not yet, David. Not yet. Lieutenant Governor David Patterson: I\'m sorry, I\'m just practicing. I just think that your ideas, just like what Governor Strickland is doing here in Ohio with the research and technology corridor on Route 115 in Columbus, trying to take our educational institutions like Ohio State and then use that to create new jobs. We do it in New York as well. We do it with medical and scientific research. The federal government has shut the door on medical and scientific research but also with green collar jobs. What you were talking about, that Germany is the world leader in solar power, they have no more sunlight than the United States. The greatest amount of wind power jobs in this country were created last year. They actually created as many jobs in the succeeding four years. I think Senator, President, whatever we can do to help you when you get to the White House is just the fact that the states are almost fighting among themselves and the jobs overseas. We need you to bring American jobs back to our shores and we need America to prosper in the way that can from the new technologies, what would be the new discoveries that can help us. In our state, in 1820 we had 3% of the country\'s population and we did about 3% of the country\'s economic development. We built the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and we built the Erie Canal. In those 20 years, New York State went to doing almost half of the economic development in the country and 12% of the people lived there. The people moved where the jobs were. Now they are moving away and we are struggling more than other states. States like Ohio and New Jersey with Governor Corzine and all the other states have great ideas, we just need that extra help from Washington and we will succeed. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you so much, David. I think the two examples David gave of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and the Erie Canal are really important because you heard Governor Strickland talk about the bond that he is going to bring to you as voters. When the governor of New York, back in the beginning of the 19th century said that he wanted to build a canal from New York City to Buffalo, people thought he was crazy. In fact, his name was Clinton and they called it \'Clinton\'s Ditch\' and \'Clinton\'s Folly\' and all kinds of derogatory terms. But he was a visionary and he said we can\'t just keep doing what we are doing, it\'s not working. We have to make big investments to make big changes. That\'s what Abraham Lincoln did with the intercontinental railroad in the middle of the Civil War. It\'s what he did when he said we\'re going to have Land Grant colleges. We didn\'t even know we were going to keep the union together but he was looking at the future. It is what Franklin Roosevelt did with his work program and what Dwight Eisenhower did with the interstate highway system and President Kennedy with the space program. You could look and see how at critical moments in our history, our leaders made bets on the future and it\'s time for us to do that again and there are always naysayers and people who said, ""Oh, we don\'t want to do that."" Ask yourself, what\'s the alternative? We can\'t keep doing what we are doing; we\'ve got to get really focused on how we\'re going to have a competitive economy, creating new jobs. I know we can do that. I turn now to someone representing one of our oldest continually operating companies in America located in upstate New York, Corning, Inc., a company that started our making glass and now makes a wide variety of products. It has always exported but has continually had to reinvent itself. If it had just stayed in the glass business, it wouldn\'t be in business. So we have to do the same for our country. Christine Pambianchi is the Vice President of Human Resources at Corning. I\'ve been working very closely with them over the last several years because they are the largest employer in a part of New York and obviously we want to make sure those jobs stay and grow more jobs. Christine is here today to offer some insight into how one American company is adjusting in the face of new economic challenges. Christine? Christine Pambianchi: Thank you so much, Senator Clinton. I\'m very happy to be here today to tell you about the great work that Senator Clinton has done in partnership with my company Corning Incorporated to create jobs in upstate New York and not just jobs, but green jobs. I think when you hear my story you will see that this is an example that supports the plans that she is laying out that could be done on a national scale were she to be elected president which obviously I am very hopeful for. We are a glass and ceramic research company, as Senator Clinton mentioned. We\'ve been around for 150 years and we invent materials. One of the materials that we invented is a type of ceramic that can be made into a filter that will actually clean the emissions from diesel vehicles. In the United States today we have approximately 11 million heavy duty diesel trucks and school buses that are on the road and the government has passed requirements for cleaner emissions of those. However, if we don\'t retrofit the 11 million vehicles in the existing fleet, we will not have a clean fleet until the year 2030. As Senator Clinton got to know our country and some of our technologies, she also became aware of and championed causes around clean air and in particular, school buses. Our children ride around in school buses and are very exposed to these harmful carcinogens and Senator Clinton championed legislation in Washington with the EPA and put a program in place called the Clean School Bus USA Program. This program set aside monies that school districts could apply for to retrofit their school buses. This directly supported us being able to create 400 jobs in our diesel manufacturing facility in upstate New York. We have $800 million invested in inventing this business and building a manufacturing plant to manufacture it. These are really good manufacturing jobs in upstate New York and that business has continued to grow. In addition to the initial program with the EPA for school buses, Senator Clinton has supported retrofit programs for the heavy duty diesel manufacturers and two other bills in Congress and that has led to the continued growth of the retrofit business and the continued vibrancy of our business to provide these environmentally friendly products. That\'s one, I think, very concrete example. Another story I wanted to share with you today is we do invent things. Another thing that we invented that you may not all know is that we actually invented optical fiber and optical fiber is actually glass. We invented that product and we sell that product around the world. We have a large manufacturing operation in Wilmington, North Carolina. With recent growth we\'ve been able to re-open our facility in Concord, North Carolina. But in the last few years we came under attack in the world market and in particular in China and local companies in China manufacturing fiber sought to have our product either barred from entry to the Chinese market or levied with significant tariffs, upwards in the neighborhood of 46%. That would\'ve made it impossible for us to enter that market and sell our product there. We obviously were defending ourselves against those potential harmful acts and we called on Senator Clinton who came to our aid. She didn\'t just follow with words, she actually gave written correspondence with the Chinese government, met with them in person on our behalf and we actually prevailed and the Chinese government sided with us and found that our products should be allowed to enter those markets free from those very harmful tariffs. That again sustained our investment in our research center and our business that we have in optical fiber. We have a large research center in upstate New York. We have 1,500 employees that work in both technician, as well as PhD scientist positions inventing products. If you look at the details of Senator Clinton\'s stimulus package, she calls for continuing to invest in research and innovation and then translate that into manufacturing jobs that we can keep in the United States. Hopefully these stories are good examples of what she\'s done for her current constituency base and I think she would be able to do for us on a national scale. Finally, there is a lot of job about health care. You\'ll hear from other people as well as the Senator on that subject, but it\'s a topic that is very important to employers, as well. As we look to keep jobs in America and have America be competitive in the manufacturing environment, it\'s very challenging as an employer to figure out how to combat double digit growth in your health care costs every year and then try to keep your manufacturing costs balanced so you can be the leader in your markets on a global scale. I think that Senator Clinton understands these issues from a citizen and an employer and the perspective of what I think is best for the country and I think that she is best equip to work with us on that issue. Finally, I would just like to offer that I am actually a life-long New York resident. I was born in the Bronx, educated in upstate New York and now I work in New York and I would just like to say that as a citizen of New York I am so proud of what Senator Clinton has done for us as our senator and would just offer personal testimonial of what I think she could do for the country, so thank you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you Christine. It\'s been really a great experience working with Corning because they are committed to their community and they are committed to our country. I haven\'t had that experience with every company. I\'ve had to have some pretty strong words with some CEOs who were going to move jobs out of New York even though the plan where those jobs were being performed was profitable. And the people working in the plant, some union, some non-union, they\'d all gone the extra mile. They\'d cut back on all of the ways they could to be more efficient. They changed work rules. Everybody felt like they were on the team together and productivity went up and profit went up. The company said we could make more money elsewhere. That, to me, is just so unfair. What we\'ve got to do as we level the playing field is eliminate every single tax break that people still get for exporting jobs. Then we\'ve got to start putting some tax breaks into supporting new jobs and give people the incentives to keep those jobs right here. As you heard from Christine and from others, we keep coming back to health care costs and we do it for a reason. We cannot continue to pay what we pay for health care and remain a competitive economy with a strong and prosperous middle class. We just can\'t. The average American family pays $12,000 a year for a family policy. Some pay out of their pocket, some it\'s shared with the employer, some get more of a share than others. $12,000 a year. I feel very strongly about this issue, as you know, but I\'d like to bring some additional perspectives to bear here. One of the people that came today you will recognize her company because she is the CEO of Weight Watchers. Florine Mark is in the business of helping people lead healthier lives. But she\'s also struggling to help companies provide health care to their employees. So Florine, would you give us your perspective as a CEO and as a health advocate, what do you think are the most important things we should do to fix our health care system? Florine Mark: First of all let me say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you and everyone around this table and when I listen to the governors\' talk about their states, Michigan has been in a recession for a while. We\'re the home of GM and Chrysler and Ford and when I hear that there are no more GM plants in your state Governor, it really pains all of us. And we are working very hard. We have a fabulous governor, Governor Jennifer Granholm who is working so hard and trying to bring in jobs and trying to work with the Big Three and if I could just do a little commercial, please buy American. Please buy American. Health care. I want to take a different slant at it because I\'m really coming from preventative medicine and what makes me so excited about Senator Clinton is that she really believes in preventative medicine and that\'s the key to it all. That\'s going to lower our health care costs. She has a plan which is so very, very, very important. Do you know how many kids are failing school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are not getting to school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are dying, not just grownups but kids who are dying. I met a 14 year old the other day who was 100 lbs overweight with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, all of these terrible things and nobody seems to be doing anything about it because the kids are sitting in front of the computers. They are not really being motivated to get up. And the first ting that we cut out when we have to cut out our school systems is physical education. So education is extremely, extremely important. I want to tell you that I\'m the mother of five, the stepmother of two  that makes me a mother of seven and the grandmother of 24 gorgeous grandchildren. Several of them are in college, I have one that is a third year medical student and one that is just starting veterinary school and I am so privileged to be able to help these kids and help pay for their schooling. You have no idea how high it is. I think my medical student is $65,000 per year to go to medical school. Just think of how many potential Einstein\'s and Clintons and Jonas Salk\'s and Edison\'s that are out there that will never have an opportunity to go to school, to go to college. Therefore your plan on education excites me, makes me feel safe because when I think of President, excuse me, Senator Clinton, I think of the word safe because I know she is kind, good, smart, tough  she is brilliant, she is nurturing, she has a sympathetic part about her, an empathetic part about her  who will do for the country what she is going to do for my children and my grandchildren, hopefully my great grandchildren and my great-great grandchildren. So education, preventative medicine, getting people to understand how to eat, how to be healthier; that\'s very important. Education is very important and I\'ll tell you one other thing. I will only feel safe if this woman becomes president of the United States of America. I feel that if God forbid, that phone, that red phone in the White House rings, I want her there to answer it. Senator Hillary Clinton: We\'re going to put a moratorium on compliments. I\'m very grateful for those very kind remarks, but I really feel that what you\'ve done in emphasizing prevention is key. We can save money if we actually prevent disease, there is a lot of evidence, increasing evidence that if people in health insurance plans are encouraged to quit smoking, to get more exercise, to eat right, to take their vitamins, have their exams, to do what is necessary to make sure they are healthy. We will actually save money as well as lives. That\'s what Florine tries to do every single day but we have to do it on a broader scale and we need everybody involved. Business, labor, government, everybody has got to be focused on this. So that we will be part of the bully pulpit because I remember when I was in grade school and junior high, we used to have these President\'s Physical Fitness Awards. I don\'t know if anybody remembers those? Remember that? Once a year we\'d be taken to the gym and we\'d have to run and jump and do all sorts of things. I was never very good at it, but I was there. And even though I wasn\'t very good at it I would get this certificate and it was signed by the president and I really thought President Kennedy was sitting in the White House signing each and every one of our certificates. I thought that was just the greatest thing and I still have them in some scrapbook somewhere. We need to be doing that again and one of the real examples of physical fitness, of course, is John Glenn. John Glenn has been extraordinary all of his life. Senator John Glenn: You\'ll note that I sent here next to Florine hoping that a little of this impact would rub off on me. Senator Hillary Clinton: I\'m just thrilled that we are talking about prevention because it is so important. I want to turn now to Marilou Martinez Stevens. She is from Texas. She is Chairman of the New America Alliance which is an organization of Latino business leaders who are devoted to the economic advancement of the Latino community and she does a lot of work developing small businesses and supporting small businesses. Small business is really under pressure when it comes to health care. So Marilou, can you tell us how health care issues are affected the small businesses that you work with in Texas? Marilou Martinez Stevens: First, thank you very much for bringing small business to the table because I think a lot of people are leaving small business out of the discussion. As you know, small businesses employ more people than larger corporations and yet we are not often at the table of discussion. Small business are, as you also know, overburdened in a lot of areas and what we are looking for, what I was so excited to hear about, is that you are looking for ways to partner with small business on how to help them become less burdened and help them hire more people and grow. Because as most of us know that the economy functions really on the back of small business. If small business is growing healthy, the economy of the United States is healthy and growing. One of the challenges, and I see a lot with small businesses as we are planning; health care is a huge, huge burden. Small businesses want to help and to create health services for their employees. We do. The issue is, and the reason is, because most of us work with the same people over and over either related or over many years so they are like family to us. It is heartbreaking when we see that certain people like our employees cannot get that care. I\'ll tell you a terrible story about one of my clients that had a young lady that was having trouble at work and my client came and said this employee is wonderful, she\'s always been the backbone of my company. She\'s being kind of back, pulling back. And I knew her very well and I asked her and she had a very sick child and she was telling me that her medication was going to cost $1,800, two treatments a week so that she could breath. She had some kind of pulmonary problem and I said oh my goodness, how can it get that expensive? And she said, ""We missed one appointment, because it would\'ve cost $600 but now I don\'t know what I am going to do."" Every time I think about it I get choked up because I\'m a mom and I know most of you are parents and how do you deal with that? I mean, you can\'t concentrate on work, you can\'t do what you want to do because you\'ve got this responsibility to your family and I\'ve started now several years back working with small business to find different solutions on how to provide the needed health care for their area. Now, there are a lot of things in the tax code that does allow for some type of reimbursement with small businesses but nothing covers catastrophic problems. For instance, a major accident  just driving, you run that risk. Long term disease, something that you didn\'t know was coming and those kinds of things you can\'t afford to even help out. In my case, the employer was able to figure out, I can help you with that and she thought, I didn\'t know you could do that. But when you\'re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, even the most caring employer can\'t help. We are so excited that you are looking for ways to partner up and look outside of the realm of how  especially the idea you talked about with colleges. Graduates are coming out and they have large debts and how can we create incentives for them to start a type of business. Most of you have heard of pre-paid legal. I\'m thinking we need to look at pre-paid medical so that we can start with the less expensive. So if I have a cough, if my child has a cough I can do and I know that it\'s not going to be hundreds of dollars and I can get his medication and I don\'t have to wait until later on when it is pneumonia and you need more expensive equipment and more expensive medication that can\'t be afforded. So we\'re looking for ways to have real health care and not disease management, which is extremely expensive and small business can\'t afford it. So I am really, really excited that you are inviting us to the table and looking for solutions like that so that the small business can continue to be the backbone of the United States. Senator Hillary Clinton: You are absolutely right. Small business is the backbone and it has created the most jobs in America in the last twenty years and under my health care plan, small business would not be required to provide health care to employees but would be given benefits if they chose to help. The problem is if you are in a small business, insurance companies can really discriminate against you. I think it\'s unconstitutional for insurance companies to discriminate. I think they should not be permitted to do that. The best way to get the cost down is to get everybody in the system because if you are in a small business with ten, twenty people, it\'s impossible if somebody gets sick. There is no way you can continue to afford that group insurance. If you are in a system with millions of people then you are going to be able to afford it, so that\'s why we need for small business, also to be part of the universal health care system and we can make that happen with the right kind of tax credits and limits on payment and ending insurance company discrimination, which is one of the parts of my health care system because until we get control over insurance companies, we are not going to be able to get the costs down so they have to be part of the solution. Whether they are enthusiastic about that or not, it\'s time that we had doctors and nurses and health care professionals and business and labor and leaders at all levels of government working together to make these changes that the insurance companies will have to go along with. That\'s what we\'re going to do if we have a chance to implement it. Final topic is education and work force development. And Zanesville Mayor Butch Zwelling, the mayor of the Y-Bridge City, I know you are working hard to improve the skills and the training of workers here in your city and that you have had some success in bringing some new business even though you have lost some, it\'s been something you\'ve worked really hard on. Could you talk about some of what you\'ve learned about education workforce development? Mayor Butch Zwelling: Thank you so much and thank you for being in Zanesville, Ohio and bringing the outstanding people that you have brought, we appreciate and welcome all of you to Zanesville. We have felt the brunt of much of everything we have talked about here today. Incidentally, my friend Florine here set me straight. I said was the Senator saving the best for last? And she said, ""No, alphabetical order."" Anyway, we have lost some industry. As part of the housing crisis, we\'ve lost all-American homes, 100 jobs in manufacturing. We have lost jobs from the Lear Corporation who relocated in Mexico. We have lost some jobs at the Longaberger Company. But we are not whining around about, we are doing something about it. We have an outstanding Port Authority and the County Commissioners and the City Hall work together although we\'re not all the same politics, we are on the same page, though. We have an outstanding director of the Port Authority and we have brought in in the past year the Bilco Company from Connecticut, the Aamco Company from Belgium and Avon is presently building a $120 million distribution center right here in Zanesville. I know we have a moratorium on compliments and I have a million I could give to you but I want to tell these people in Zanesville and our distinguished visitors that much of the credit for the businesses, the manufacturing that has come to Zanesville, Bilco, Aamco and Avon, was with the cooperation and help of Governor Ted Strickland and Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher. One of the things that I think that you are going to be very sensitive about is community development and block grant finding. We have been cut, cut, cut under the Bush administration. We\'ve lost 27% of that funding since 2002 and I spoke before a Congressional sub committee a couple of years ago when President Bush was threatening to cut the whole program out as a way to balance his budget. President Bush doesn\'t understand that this is the tip of Appalachia, that there are people in this area that do not have water and sewers and he doesn\'t have a clue about that. I know that you do and we are so excited about your coming to the White House to do something about that because that involves infrastructure; waterlines, sewer lines. That involves jobs. We have to have that kind of money in order to operate as a community. We have a $52.6 million budget. Half of it goes to health care and payroll. There is no fat in our budget whatsoever. We are constantly doing something about it. We appreciate the help that we have in Columbus. We also have a great Congressman, Zack Space who helps us and is by our side fighting every battle with us. We have a great friend in Sherrod Brown and George Voinovich in the United States Senate and we\'ve just got friends in the right places except one. We look forward to having that friend, you, in the White House. Thank you for coming today. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. You will have a friend and a partner. That\'s something that I look forward to and I also appreciate your mentioning the community development block grants. The way that the federal government under President Bush and the Republican Congress has cut a lot of the aid that came to communities has put extra burdens on your tax payers and that is something that we will definitely address because it\'s very hard for you to manage a lot of the needs you have if you are just relying upon your own resources. Finally, Laura Meeks who is the President of Jefferson Community College. She is also the Chair of the Ohio Appalachian Center for Higher Education. Some of you may not know that Appalachia goes up into New York, so I have worked with the Appalachian Regional Council, I\'ve worked with my colleagues, the senators from the states that are considered in Appalachia. There is a tier of counties in southern New York that have very similar problems to what we are talking about here in Ohio. Laura, you see people every single day in Ohio who are eager to get jobs, who are entrepreneurial, they are inventive, they have great ideas, they are going to work really hard. So what\'s the best way to make sure that these hardworking Ohioans have a chance? How do we best make them ready and train them so that we can have a real match between the jobs we can create and recruit and the workers right here in this area? Laura Meeks: Thank you Senator Clinton. Speaking on behalf of 1,200 community colleges in the nation, you are a friend of community colleges. We know that. As a matter of fact, you get it. You opened your comments by saying about higher education; we need to make sure it is accessible and affordable for all. The other day we had a snow day. It was one of those great things sometimes you get to have. I don\'t know if you have snow days in Zanesville but we had one at Jefferson in Steubenville the other day. I was by myself working and I heard someone and I looked up and there was a young woman, a young girl and her grandfather was with her. I thought it was her father. He explained to me that this young woman lost her father about a month ago and he said, ""This is my granddaughter, here is her application."" This girl came in the snow to make sure that we had this application and her grandfather said, ""I\'m a retired steelworker, had a good living but my granddaughter needs to make sure she goes to college."" I took her application and I found her a CD catalogue and gave her a catalogue because that\'s what she wanted and I promised her I would get it in the next day when everyone was there. When I looked at her, she touched that catalog and it really became real to her. I look back on my life when I was twelve years old my father lost his business. He had a feed store, grinding feed for cattle and it burned. He became a truck driver and my mom washed dishes in a nursing home for twenty years. They made a good living but they taught me something important, and it\'s a lesson that all of us in higher education in Ohio understand. It\'s that you have to get an education to get a better job and everyday we know that. What makes it difficult for us is the high cost of tuition and in Ohio we do have a high cost. I am so honored to say that we have a governor, Governor Strickland, who froze tuition for the state of Ohio for two years and he did that at a great price. When we talk about keeping the cost of tuition low, we need to make sure that we keep that low. You\'re right on, you get it. The other thing I\'d like to say is that, we have a lot of work ethic, we have people with strong work ethic; we have a will to work. We have a fiber of higher education that can train people to work, what we need are the jobs, and you know what? We have them. We have the opportunity where we live we have smoke stacks, steel industries. We also have energy companies. We have first energy and also cardinal. AEP and they\'re cleaning; they\'re using resource to put in clears. Those are some very good jobs. Youngstown State University and Jefferson Community College have a partnership, we\'ve has 2 classes with 20 graduates; graduates in power technology who will go out and make at least $21 starting wages. We have really good jobs in the energy industry in Ohio. Engineering jobs and we have some hope of getting as coal liquefaction company that might come near us. I just want to say keep doing it, keep appreciating your higher education system in the United States. Thank you for understanding the power of a community college. We have the will and we want to go to bed every night waking up in the morning knowing that someone in the White House shares our vision and our dream. That everyday in higher education we\'re trying to make the lives of people better for families in America by giving them a better chance for a better job. Thank you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Oh great. That\'s so great. I just have to emphasize what you said about community colleges; they are so important for our economy. I was at Columbus State Community College a few days ago talking about the programs they have in order to train people for these new clean energy jobs and we can do this. We absolutely can do this. And I know, Gary, you\'ve been working in some of the apprenticeship programs, Helmets to Hard Hats, a program that I\'ve supported. So this needs to be joint effort; business, labor, government, education. All of us have to be on the same team, the American team. If we start once again playing on the American team, nobody can beat us. That\'s what I believe. I really appreciate everyone coming out today, because we want this to be an ongoing conversation. There are lots of good ideas that people have and we\'ve been working to come up with what will make a difference. What might work in Ohio might not work in Texas, and so we\'ve got to have a variety of approaches. The federal government needs to be a partner. Of course, that means we\'ve got to listen and we\'ve got to be available. It\'s what I believe we do best if we actually roll up our sleeves and get to work together. I\'ve put out this ""Solutions for America"" economic blueprint; you can pick up copies on the way out. It\'s an abbreviated version, but it puts out some of the ideas that I believe could make a difference. At the end of the day we have to decide what kinds of future we want. It doesn\'t happen by accident. What Laura was saying, you just don\'t stay at home and say I think I\'ll dream my way to a higher education, you\'ve got to put on your boots, you\'ve got to walk through the snow, you\'ve got to deliver the application, you\'ve got to attend the classes, you\'ve got to be qualified. That\'s true in life, and it\'s true in a country. So it\'s our chance now to seize the 21st century. I am absolutely convinced that our best days can be ahead for America. That all of the concerns we have, we can handle them. But we\'re going to have to be serious about how we do it. There\'s no doubt in my mind as I travel across Ohio that people in Ohio are ready. You have governor, a lieutenant governor, who I know are making a difference. We just need to stay with you. We can\'t get discouraged, we can\'t get into fads; try this and don\'t do it. Building the Erie Canal took, David, how many years? About eight, twelve years? Change does take consistent, concerted effort. But the real question for us is not whether change will happen; change is going to happen whether we want it or not. Change is a part of life. It\'s whether progress will happen. Whether we\'ll see the kind of progress here in Ohio and Texas and America that the people of our country deserve. So I\'m very confident and optimistic about what we\'re going to do together. And I\'m very grateful that we would have this opportunity with so many distinguished Ohioans and visitors from around our country to talk about what we\'re going to do to make Ohio as important and prosperous and successful to America\'s future as it was, Governor, to America\'s past. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 1, 2008","b'Excerpts of Remarks at a Rally in Fort Worth, Texas'","b'Below are excerpts of Hillary Clinton\'s prepared remarks for this afternoon\'s ""Solutions for America"" rally in Fort Worth, Texas:  ...My opponent and I are in an important debate about national security - and which one of us is best prepared to take charge as Commander-in-Chief. He calls that fear-mongering. Well, I don\'t think Texans scare that easy. We know we have a job to do - to end the war in Iraq and win the war in Afghanistan. When my opponent says it\'s fear-mongering to talk about who is ready to protect America, I say: If you can\'t have that debate with me, how can you have it with John McCain? We are running for the most important job in the world, and you can\'t run away from a debate on national security. - - - ""My opponent talks about a speech he gave on Iraq in 2002. Well, there\'s a big difference between giving a speech at an anti-war rally and giving orders as commander-in-chief. When a crisis comes and that phone rings at 3 a.m. in the White House, you don\'t have time for speeches. You don\'t have time for on-the-job training. He talks about these issues, but then he goes missing in action. He gave his speech about Iraq when he was running for the Senate, but two years later he said he agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war. He\'s running an ad that touts his position on Afghanistan. He chairs a subcommittee on NATO, which is a major ally in the war in Afghanistan. But he failed to hold a single substantive hearing on Afghanistan or anything else. He even went missing on an important vote on Iran.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 4, 2008","b'Remarks Following the Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont Primaries'","b'Thank you Ohio. For everyone here in Ohio and across America who\'s ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out, and for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard and never gives up, this one is for you. You know what they say, as Ohio goes, so goes the nation. Well, this nation\'s coming back, and so is this campaign. The people of Ohio have said it loudly and clearly: we\'re going on, we\'re going strong, and we\'re going all the way. You know, they call Ohio a bellwether state. It\'s a battleground state. It\'s a state that knows how to pick a president. And no candidate in recent history, Democrat or Republican, has won the White House without winning the Ohio primary. [Audience: Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will!] You all know that if we want a Democratic president, we need a Democratic nominee who can win the battleground states just like Ohio. And that is what we\'ve done. We\'ve won Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, Arkansas, California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. And today, we won Rhode Island, and thanks to all my friends and supporters there. This is a great night, but we all know that these are challenging times. We have two wars abroad. We have a recession looming here at home. Voters faced a critical question - who is tested and ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one? And who knows how to turn our economy around, because we sure do need it. Ohio has written a new chapter in the history of this campaign, and we\'re just getting started. More and more people have joined this campaign and millions of Americans haven\'t spoken yet. In states like Pennsylvania and so many others people are watching this historic campaign, and they want their turn to help make history. They want their voices to count. And they should. They should be heard. So please, join us in this campaign. Go to www.hillaryclinton.com. This is your campaign and your moment and I need your support. For more than a year, I\'ve been listening to the voices of people across our country. The single mom who told me she works two jobs; neither provides health care for her kids. She just can\'t work any harder. The little girl who asked how I helped people without homes - turns out her family was about to lose their own. The young man in a Marine Corps shirt who said he waited months for medical care. He said to me, ""take care of my buddies, a lot of them are still over there. And then, will you please help take care of me?"" Americans don\'t need more promises. They\'ve heard plenty of speeches. They deserve solutions and they deserve them now. America needs a president who\'s ready to lead, ready to stand up for what\'s right even when it\'s hard. And after seven long years of George W. Bush, we sure are ready for a president who will be a fighter, a doer and a champion for the American people again. Oh, I think we\'re ready for health care, not for just some people or most people, but for every American. I think we\'re ready for an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, but every single hard-working American who deserves a shot at the American dream. I think we\'re ready to declare energy independence and create millions of green collar jobs. We\'re ready to reach out to our allies and confront our shared challenges. We\'re ready to end the war in Iraq and win the war in Afghanistan. And we\'re past ready to serve our veterans with the same devotion that they served us. Protecting America is the first and most urgent duty of the president. When there\'s a crisis and that phone rings at 3:00 a.m. in the White House, there\'s no time for speeches or on-the-job training. You have to be ready to make a decision. I congratulate Senator McCain on winning his party\'s nomination and I look forward to a spirited and substantive debate with him. [Audience: Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will!] I want to thank the wonderful people of Ohio for your support and your confidence in me. I especially want to thank Governor Ted Strickland and his wonderful wife Frances. Governor and Mrs. Strickland are working so hard on behalf of Ohio and they deserve a president who will work hard with them to give Ohio the future that you deserve. I want to thank Senator John Glenn and his wonderful wife Annie. I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher and his wife Peggy. And I especially want to thank Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She does an extraordinary job for her constituents, and she has been a champion on behalf of the people of Ohio and America. I look forward to working with her to bring more opportunity to the people that she loves and represents so well. I want to thank my extraordinary staff, volunteers and supporters here in Ohio and across America. And I especially want to thank the two most important people in my life, Bill and Chelsea. And, of course, to my mother who I know is watching, thanks very much, mom, for everything. And finally, to Senator Obama, who has brought so much to this race. I look forward to continuing our dialogue in the weeks ahead on the issues that matter most to our country. I want to end by sharing with you a message that I got late last month from someone who didn\'t have much money to spare, but sent me $10 for my campaign and sent an e-mail in which she wrote: ""My two daughters are two and four, and we chant and cheer for you at every speech we see. I want them to know anything is possible."" Tonight I say to them, keep on watching. Together, we\'re going to make history. To those little girls, I say this is America, and we do believe you can be anything you want to be, and we want our sons and our daughters to dream big. I have big dreams for America\'s future. The question is not whether we can fulfill those dreams, it\'s whether we will. And here\'s our answer: yes, we will. We will do what it takes, and we will once again make the kind of progress that America deserves. We\'re going to protect our country and preserve our constitution. We\'re going to lead with our values. We will reach out to those on the margins and in the shadows because that\'s what we do in America. We break barriers, we open doors, we make sure every voice is heard. Together, we will turn promises into action, words into solutions, and hope into reality. It will take leadership and hard work, but we\'ve never been short on either. So I hope all of you will join, join with the Ohioans who voices and votes have been heard today. Together, we will seize this moment, lift this nation, and heal and lead this world. Thank you all and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 11, 2008","b'Excerpts of Remarks in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania'","b'Below are excerpts of Hillary Clinton\'s prepared remarks for this afternoon\'s ""Solutions for America"" rally in Harrisburg, PA: After seven years of an energy policy written by and for the oil companies - with help from Dick Cheney - oil has now reached $107 a barrel - and gas prices in some areas are approaching $4 a gallon. I understand Senator Obama is talking about energy today, right here in Pennsylvania. And that\'s great. But talking about problems is easy. Solving problems is hard. And speeches are no substitute for solutions. Speeches won\'t lower gas prices, stop climate change, or lessen our dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia. The true test comes when it\'s time to match rhetoric with results. And unfortunately, we\'ve seen that Senator Obama\'s promises and speeches are often just words. On the campaign trail, Senator Obama talks about clean energy. But in the Senate, he voted for Dick Cheney\'s energy bill loaded with new tax breaks for oil companies. When he faced a tough choice, his support for a clean energy future turned out to be just words. It\'s like how he talks about fixing NAFTA. But his top economic adviser assured the Canadian government that he wouldn\'t really follow through. His position? Just words. Senator Obama promises to withdraw from Iraq within 16 months. But his top foreign policy adviser said he\'s not really going to rely on that plan. I guess that plan is just words, too. We need a president who will solve problems. Who will fight for our families long after the speeches are over and the cameras are gone. That\'s the choice in this campaign: Solutions you can rely on - versus words you can\'t.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 17, 2008","b'Remarks at The George Washingon University in Washington, DC'","b'Good morning. I want to thank Secretary West for his years of service, not only as Secretary of the Army, but also to the Veteran\'s Administration, to our men and women in uniform, to our country. I certainly do remember that trip to Bosnia, and as Togo said, there was a saying around the White House that if a place was too small, too poor, or too dangerous, the president couldn\'t go, so send the First Lady. That\'s where we went. I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base. But it was a moment of great pride for me to visit our troops, not only in our main base as Tuzla, but also at two outposts where they were serving in so many capacities to deactivate and remove landmines, to hunt and seek out those who had not complied with the Dayton Accords and put down their arms, and to build relationships with the people that might lead to a peace for them and their children. So it\'s a great honor being introduced by Secretary West. I also want to thank rear Admiral David Stone who commanded the fleet off of Kosovo and was an instrumental part of our successful efforts there. And Brigadier General Pat Foote and Major General George Buskirk who are representing the more than 30 generals and admirals who have endorsed me and who provide great assistance and counsel to me and to my staff. I want to thank President Steven Knapp for once again being the host. I\'m getting credit for coming to GW, I come so often, and I\'m thrilled to have that added to my academic career. And I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and the students at this great university. I started my morning meeting with the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to talk about the peace process in Northern Ireland, and it was a stark reminder of how long the road is toward peace, but how necessary it must be that we travel it. And we travel it with like-minded friends and allies and those willing to take risks for peace around the world. It has been five years this week since our president took us to war in Iraq. In that time, our brave men and women in uniform have done everything we ask of them and more. They were asked to remove Saddam Hussein from power and bring him to justice and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqi people the opportunity for free and fair elections and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time for political reconciliation, and they did. So for every American soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice for this mission, we should imagine carved in stone ""they gave their life for the greatest gift one can give to a fellow human being, the gift of freedom."" And to our veterans and all those serving in Iraq today, I want to send a strong and clear message - your extraordinary devotion to our country and to your service makes us proud and profoundly grateful every single day. The mistakes in Iraq are not the responsibility of our men and women in uniform but of their Commander-in-Chief. From the decision to rush to war without allowing the weapons inspectors to finish their work or waiting for diplomacy to run its course. To the failure to send enough troops and provide proper equipment for them. To the denial of the existence of a rising insurgency and the failure to adjust the military strategy. To the continued support for a government unwilling to make the necessary political compromises. The command decisions were rooted in politics and ideology, heedless of sound strategy and common sense. Fortunately, ten months from now we will have a new president, and a new opportunity to change course in Iraq. Therefore, the critical question is how can we end this war responsibly and restore America\'s leadership in the world? It won\'t be easy. There is no magic wand to wave. Bringing our troops home safely will take a president who is ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one, a president who knows our military and has earned their respect. Bringing lasting stability to the region will take a president with the strength and determination, the knowledge and confidence to bring our troops home; to rebuild our military readiness, to care for our veterans, and to redouble our efforts against al-Qaeda. If you give me the chance, I will be that president. I will start by facing the conditions on the ground in Iraq as they are, not as we hope or wish them to be. President Bush points to the reduction in violence in Iraq last year and claims the surge is working. Now, I applaud any decrease in violence. That is always good news. But the point of the surge was to give the Iraqis the time and space for political reconciliation. Yet today, the Iraqi government has failed to provide basic services for its citizens. They have yet to pass legislation ensuring the equitable distribution of oil revenues, yet even to pass a law setting the date of provincial elections. Corruption and dysfunction is rampant, and last week General Petraeus himself conceded that no one, in either the U.S. government or the Iraqi government, feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation. So by the middle of this summer when the additional surge forces have been sent home, we\'ll be right back at square one with 130,000 or more troops on the ground in Iraq. That President Bush seems to want to keep as many troops there after the surge as before and says that doing otherwise would endanger our progress is a clear admission that the surge has not accomplished its goals. Meanwhile, as we continue to police Iraq\'s civil war, the threats to our national security, our economy, and our standing in the world continue to mount. The lives of our brave men and women are at stake. Nearly 4,000 of them have, by now, made that ultimate sacrifice. Tens of thousands more have suffered wounds both visible and invisible to their bodies, their minds, and their hearts. Their families have sacrificed, too, in empty places at the dinner table, in the struggle to raise children alone, in the wrenching reversal of parents burying children. The strength of our military is at stake. Only one of our army brigades is certified by the army to be ready. Our armed forces are stretched to near the breaking point with many of our troops on their second, third, or fourth tours of duty. Our economic security is at stake. Taking into consideration the long-term costs of replacing equipment and providing medical care for troops and survivors\' benefits for their families, the war in Iraq could ultimately cost well over $1 trillion. That is enough to provide health care for all 47 million uninsured Americans and quality pre-kindergarten for every American child, solve the housing crisis once and for all, make college affordable for every American student, and provide tax relief to tens of millions of middle class families. Our ability to win the war in Afghanistan is at stake. When I first visited Afghanistan in 2003, I was greeted by a soldier who said, ""Welcome to the forgotten front line in the war on terror."" Since then, the Taliban and al Qaeda have continued to gain new footholds throughout the country, and as a result, the overall terrorist threat, as our own intelligence community has noted, is growing. Finally, our leadership in the world and our ability to front global challenges, present and future, is at stake. From extremism in Pakistan, to nuclear ambitions in Iran and North Korea, to troubling antidemocratic trends in Russia and Latin America, to the threat of global epidemics and global warming and to the rise of China. The more the world regards us with suspicion rather than admiration, the more difficult it is to confront these challenges. Despite the evidence, President Bush is determined to continue his failed policy in Iraq until he leaves office. And Senator McCain will gladly accept the torch and stay the course, keeping troops in Iraq for up to 100 years if necessary. They both want to keep us tied to another country\'s civil war, a war we cannot win. That in a nutshell is the Bush/McCain Iraq policy. Don\'t learn from your mistakes, repeat them. Well, here is the inescapable reality. We can have hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground for 100 years, but that will not change the fact that there is no military solution to the situation in Iraq. And don\'t just take it from me. At his confirmation hearing, Admiral Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that without national political reconciliation, no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference. We simply cannot give the Iraqi government an endless blank check. Each passing month we stay in Iraq gives the Iraqi government more time to avoid the hard decisions on how to split the oil money and how to share political power. Senator McCain and president bush claim withdrawal is defeat. Well, let\'s be clear, withdrawal is not defeat. Defeat is keeping troops in Iraq for 100 years. We simply cannot give the Iraqi government an endless blank check. Each passing month we stay in Iraq gives the Iraqi government more time to avoid the hard decisions on how to split the oil money and how to share political power. Senator McCain and President Bush claim withdrawal is defeat. Well, let\'s be clear, withdrawal is not defeat. Defeat is keeping troops in Iraq for 100 years. Defeat is straining our alliances and losing our standing in the world. Defeat is draining our resources and diverting attention from our key interests. Now, withdrawal is not risk-free, but the risks of staying in Iraq are certain. And a well-planned withdrawal is the one and only path to a political solution. The only way to spur the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and to ensure that we don\'t bear that responsibility indefinitely. The only way to spur other countries to do their part to help secure stability in the region. The commitment to staying in Iraq has driven President Bush\'s foreign policy. It looks like it would drive Senator McCain\'s foreign policy as well, but it will not drive mine. My foreign policy will be driven by what is in America\'s national security interests. So it is time to end this war as quickly and responsibly as possible. That has been my mission in the Senate, and it will be my mission starting on day one as president of the United States. For the past five years, I have served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan three times. I have met with our soldiers and military leaders. I have met with Iraqi, local, regional, and national elected and other influential officials. Here at home I\'ve attended countless meetings and committee hearings where I have challenged high-ranking Pentagon officials and military leaders investigating the situation in Iraq, probing the facts presented, and demanding real answers to tough questions. And I am honored that more than 30 of America\'s most esteemed former admirals and generals, including two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and five retired officers of the four-star rank have endorsed my candidacy. The American people don\'t have to guess whether I\'m ready to lead or whether I understand the realities on the ground in Iraq or whether I\'d be too dependent on advisers to help me determine the right way forward. I\'ve been working day-in and day-out in the Senate to provide leadership to end this war. That\'s why I cosponsored legislation with Senator Robert Byrd to reauthorize the war, legislation that would actually end the president\'s authority to fight it. That\'s why I\'ve started laying the ground work for a swift and responsible withdrawal beginning in early 2009 by demanding that the Pentagon start planning for it now. I\'ve introduced legislation ensuring that Congress would be briefed on those plans and that\'s also why I\'m working to block President Bush\'s effort to keep this war going after he leaves office. I\'ve introduced legislation banning him from unilaterally negotiating a long-term security commitment to Iraq, including the possibility of permanent bases. I believe what matters in this campaign is not just the promises we\'ve made to end the war; what matters is what we\'ve actually done when it came time to match words with action. Because more than anything else, what we\'ve done is an indication of what we\'ll do. Now, my Democratic opponent talks a great deal about a speech he gave in 2002, and I commend him for making that speech. Speaking out for what you believe is a solemn, patriotic duty. He is asking us to judge him by his words, and words can be powerful, but only if the speaker translates them into action and solutions. Senator Obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail, but he didn\'t start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president. So when he had a chance to act on his speech, he chose silence instead. And out campaigning Senator Obama tells voters that as president he\'d withdraw combat brigades from Iraq within 16 months, but one of his top foreign policy advisers told a different story. She told a British television reporter, and I quote, ""he will, of course, not rely on some plan that he\'s crafted as a presidential candidate or as a U.S. Senator."" Senator Obama has said often that words matter. I strongly agree. But giving speeches alone won\'t end the war and making campaign promises you might not keep certainly won\'t end it. In the end the true test is not the speeches a president delivers, it\'s whether the president delivers on the speeches. I have concrete, detailed plans to end this war, and I have not waivered in my commitment to follow through on them. One choice in this election is Senator McCain. He\'s willing to keep this war going for 100 years. You can count on him to do that. Another choice is Senator Obama who has promised to bring combat troops out in 16 months, but according to his foreign policy adviser, you can\'t count on him to do that. In uncertain times, we cannot afford uncertain leadership. Here\'s what you can count on me to do: provide the leadership to end this war quickly and responsibly. Today I\'d like to talk about how I will do that, how as president, I will bring our troops home, work to bring stability in the region, and replace military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in helping to secure Iraq\'s future. The most important part of my plan is the first step, to bring our troops home and send the strongest possible message to the Iraqis that they must take responsibly for their own future. No more talk of permanent occupation, no more policing a civil war, no more doing for the Iraqis what they need to be doing for themselves. As president, one of my first official actions will be to convene the Joint Chiefs of Staff, my Secretary of Defense and my National Security Council and direct them to draw up a clear, viable plan to start bringing our troops home within the first 60 days of my taking office. A plan based on my consultation with the military to remove one to two brigades a month, a plan that reduces the risks of attack as they depart. As we bring our troops home, I will ensure we are fully prepared to take care of them and their families once they have returned. I will direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran\'s Affairs to prepare a comprehensive plan to provide the highest quality of health care, disability benefits, and social services for every single service member including every member of the National Guard and Reserve as well as their families, and I will make sure this plan is promptly implemented. In the Senate I\'m proud to have reached across the aisle to provide access to TRICARE for all members of the National Guard and reserve, even when they\'re not deployed. and to have passed my heroes at home act to help family members care for those who traumatic brain injury, the signature injury of this war because I believe when brave men and women sign up to serve our country, we sign up to serve them too. That is why I will also immediately adopt Representative John Murtha\'s urgent proposal to reduce the strain on our troops by reducing the permissible length of overseas deployments. Going forward, we will ensure that our troops spend as much time at tome as they have spent deployed. So every month they spend in the field, they will be guaranteed one month here at home. I will also implement a proposal that I, Representative Murtha, and others have been calling for, requiring that before any brigade is deployed, the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that it is fully combat ready. Sending brigades that do not meet this standard puts our soldiers in danger and our mission in Iraq or elsewhere at risk. In addition to removing American troops from Iraq, I will also work to remove armed private military contractors who are conducting combat-oriented and security functions in Iraq. For five yeas their behavior and lack of supervision and accountability have often eroded our credibility, endangered U.S. and Iraqi lives and undermined our mission. Now, Senator Obama and I have a substantive disagreement here. He won\'t rule out continuing to use armed private military contractors in Iraq to do jobs that historically have been done by the U.S. military or government personnel. When I am president I will ask the Joint Chiefs for their help in reducing reliance on armed private military contractors. With the goal of ultimately implementing a ban on such contractors. I\'ve already cosponsored the Stop Security Outsourcing Act requiring that security services for personnel at any U.S. diplomatic or consular mission be provided only by federal government personnel. It\'s also a time we put an end, once and for all, to the no-bid contracts that squander taxpayer money while lining the pockets of the president\'s cronies. Between 2000 and 2006, spending on no-bid contracts more than doubled, representing half of all federal procurement spending. Today companies like Halliburton are enjoying record profits thanks to a 700% increase in taxpayer funds awarded to them. But a recent congressional report identified 187 contracts valued at $1.1 trillion where federal auditors found massive overcharges, wasteful spending and poor oversight. I\'m proposing legislation to ensure that all new spending in 2009 is done through competitive contracting processes. The heads of each agency would have to certify to Congress under a sworn affidavit that their contracting awards processes are open and competitive. As president, I will work to pass this legislation into law and to end the era of no-bid contracts and handouts to Halliburton. It\'s an interesting comparison. We\'ve had a lot of talk in this town and elsewhere about earmarks, and I am one of those who believe we need more transparency and disclosure in the earmark process. But no-bid contracts are ten times more costly than earmarks, and when I introduce my legislation to eliminate no-bid contracts, I could not get, at least as of this moment, Senator McCain\'s support for that. As we bring our troops and contractors home, we cannot lose sight of our strategic interests in this region. The reality is that this war has made the terrorists stronger. Well, they may not have been in Iraq before the war, they are there now, and we cannot allow Iraq to become a breeding ground and safe haven for terrorists who seek to attack us and our friends and allies. So let me be clear - under my plan, withdrawing from Iraq will not mean retreating from fighting terrorism in Iraq. That\'s why I will order small, elite strike forces to engage in targeted operations against al Qaeda in Iraq. This will protect Iraqi citizens, our allies, and our families right here at home. The second part of my plan involves working to secure stability within Iraq as we bring our troops home, stability that will be key to a successful withdrawal of our troops. I believe it\'s really quite simple, greater political and economic stability means safer conditions for our departing troops and a smoother disengagement from our military\'s actions across Iraq. Right now no one doubts that the Iraqi government is failing its citizens. Government officials refuse to take the steps need to order to advance a solution, improve the economy, quell sectarian violence and better the lives of ordinary Iraqis. These failings are, in part, the fault of the Iraqis and in part due to the Bush administration\'s failure to match military efforts with political ones. For example, the U.S. has created an armed local security forces, such as the Awakening in Anbar and the ""Concerned Local Citizens,"" but they fail to hold the Iraqi government to its agreement to integrate these local militias and volunteers into provincial police forces or the national army. Violence has fallen in the short run, but in the long run sectarian divisions among Iraqis may only deepen. When I\'m president, we will pursue a more integrated strategy. We\'ll empower local leaders and use U.S. and international influence to press the Iraqis to reach political reconciliation, and I will call on the United Nations to strengthen its role in promoting this reconciliation. Not having been a party to the mistakes of the path five years, the U.N., which has already provided valuable technical assistance in Iraq, is far more likely to be viewed as a neutral, honest broker than the United States, especially when it acts on behalf of a broad coalition of concerned states and the international community. The new United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has indicated he is willing to play a key role in assisting the Iraqis. I will also work with China and Russia to ensure that the U.N. envoy in Iraq has the necessary authority by obtaining the Security Council\'s explicit endorsement of a strengthened U.N. mandate to promote reconciliation. I will also call upon the U.N. to help oversee the resettlement of the millions of refugees who have fled Iraq or have been displaced internally. Many are living in desperate conditions creating not just a humanitarian crisis but one affecting regional stability that poses direct threats to our security here at home which we must address immediately. While we focus our efforts on improving conditions so Iraqis don\'t have to flee in the first place, we have to recognize our moral obligation to help those we have put at risk in Iraq, the interpreters, soldiers who have assisted our troops. We will work with governments in both the Middle East and the west, including of course the United States, to find places for asylum seekers, and we will work with the U.N. to develop a plan to help them return, if possible, to Iraq once the country has stabilized. I would further seek to stabilize Iraq by insisting that the country\'s oil revenues, instead of U.S. taxpayer dollars, increasingly be used to fund Iraq\'s reconstruction. When President Bush began this war, his administration claimed that Iraqi oil revenues would pay for Iraq\'s reconstruction. Well, the Iraqi government has now earned tens of billions of dollars from oil. Some estimates indicate that revenues this year will top $55 billion. Yet since the beginning of the war, the U.S. has allocated roughly the same amount of money as Iraq for reconstruction, $47 billion from us versus $50 billion from them. And now it is even clearer that the Iraqi government is not spending its oil money on reconstruction. There are reports that Iraq spent less than a quarter of oil funds set aside for reconstruction in 2006, and the U.S. Comptroller General testified that as of November 2007 the capital expenditure rate for the central ministries in Iraq was only 7%. Oil profits are showing up in foreign banks even as Iraqi citizens lack basic services. As president I would immediately direct the Inspector General for Iraq to appoint a special council to investigate and make recommendations directly to me for how to ensure Iraqi oil revenues and U.S. taxpayer dollars on a declining trend are used to rebuild Iraq. It is unacceptable that these oil revenues go unused or worse end up in private accounts while citizens lack electricity and clean drinking water. We will support Iraq\'s efforts to rebuild their country, but we will not permit our money or theirs to be thrown away. I will work to crack down on the black market for oil in Iraq. According to recent news reports, insurgent groups a profiteering from a substantial black market in oil. The money they make is going in part to pay for IEDs, car bombs, and other tools of terror. The Iraqi government simply has not done its part to crack down on this corruption. The equation here is simple, if we cut off or disrupt these illegal sources of funding, we can deny the insurgents the money they need to maintain their campaigns of violence. So I will order a joint nationwide U.S./Iraqi crackdown on black marketers and oil smugglers. We\'ll beef up protection for oil lines to prevent illegal tapping and attacks. We will cut off illegal networks, identify where the stolen oil and other goods are going, who is stealing them, and capture those responsible. We will work with our international community to try to cut off access to the funds that hold these oil revenues. And we will maintain the crackdown success by sending a strong signal to the Iraqi government, show results in rooting out corruption or lose your aid. The third and final part of my plan to end the war involves replacing our military force in Iraq with an intensive diplomatic initiative in the region. Over the past four years, we\'ve learned the hard way about the need for a truly multilateral approach in Iraq, one built on sound strategy and long-range planning, not ideology and wishful thinking. the president\'s go it alone strategy has diminished our position in the region and around the world, and that diminished position, in turn, has made it increasingly difficult for us to bring about a political solution. Our friends and allies in the region have an especially large stake in building a stable Iraq, but until now in part because of the Bush administration\'s mismanagement of the war, they have lacked leadership and gotten a free pass. That must end. Ten months from now we will have a new opportunity to reach out and engage our allies. One of my very first international meetings as president would be with our treaty allies and our friends in the region including the Gulf States, Jordan, Egypt, and our European allies. Over the course of my career I have known and worked with many of these leaders already, and I will send them a very clear message - what happens in Iraq affects all of our interests, and it is all of our responsibility. It\'s time we did our part and paid our fair share. I will then convene a regional stabilization group composed of these key allies, other global parties, the states bordering Iraq. The mission of this group will be to develop and implement a strategy to create a stable Iraq. I would include in this regional stabilization group Iran and Syria. We must convince all countries in the region and beyond to refrain from getting involved in the Iraqi civil war, to hold themselves and others to their past pledges to provide funding in Iraq, and to support the central role for the United Nations. These will be critical first steps toward establishing a new American approach in the world, one that draws on the strength of our alliances and the power of our diplomacy, and uses the greatest military force on earth as a last, not a first, resort. Achieving all of this will not be easy. But we don\'t have any choice. When I look at the road ahead, I think about the men and women in uniform whom I\'ve had the profound honor of meeting and serving. Our troops serving not only in Iraq and Afghanistan, but across the globe. Our veterans recovering in V.A. hospitals and rehabilitation centers here at home, many with serious and life-altering injuries. The countless veterans who are not given the support and services they need to reenter civilian life. These men and women have made extraordinary sacrifices serving the country they love, and I\'m always struck by how no matter the extent and severity of their suffering, no matter how grave their own injuries, they always say the same thing to me, ""promise that you\'ll take care of my buddies. They\'re still over there. Promise you\'ll keep them safe."" I have looked these men and women in the eye, and I have made that promise, and I intend to honor it by ending this war as responsibly and quickly as possible. Thank you all very, very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 19, 2008","b'Remarks at the ""Solutions for America"" Event in Detroit, Michigan'","b""Thank you very, very much. Wow. I am thrilled to be here. It is great being here at AFSCME Council 25. I want to thank President Al Garrett for inviting us to his house and have this opportunity to be with you. I want to also thank Javier for his wonderful comments. I love seeing the way so many young people are intensely involved in this campaign and we want to keep it that way, including the young people right here in Michigan. I want to recognize just a few other people that I am pleased to be here with: Jim Blanchard, former Governor of Michigan, along with his wife Janet. Jewel Ware, who has done a wonderful job as the chair of the Wayne County Commission. I know her husband is here, and I am grateful Jewel's support. David Hecker, president of the Michigan AFT, Ron Duncan of RWDSU. I know that Debbie Stabenow your fabulous Senator was here earlier and her husband Tom Athans is here. I am thrilled to be with you in Michigan once again, because Michigan is a Bellwether state, it is a diverse state, it's a proud union state, and is a critical state for Democrats to win in November. I am here for one simple reason - to make sure Michigan votes are counted and your voices are heard in this election. I know that Governor Granholm couldn't here because she was long scheduled to be in Western Michigan, where she is working to help create jobs and grow the economy. But I want to applaud her for her energy, her creativity, her tenacity and dedication in tackling the problems that Michigan faces. Let's give Governor Granholm a big round of applause. I know Michigan, probably more than any other state, deserves a president who understands the challenges of a struggling economy, unfair trade policies, the loss of manufacturing jobs, the deterioration of health care coverage, and all of the other challenges from rising gas process to rising college costs. You deserve a president who will be your partner and that is what I intend to be if given the chance to serve. This has been an incredible primary season so far. There's been more passion and enthusiasm than anyone could have ever predicted. Democrats across the country are turning out in record numbers to have their say in this historic election. Here in Michigan, 600,000 people turned out on a cold and snowy day in January to cast your votes and you made it abundantly clear that you wanted your voices to be heard and your votes to be counted. In Florida, 1.7 million people did exactly the same. Now, these nearly 2.5 million Americans are in danger of being shut out of our democratic process. I think that is wrong and, frankly, it is un-American, and we cannot let that continue. My very first job in politics was working for the Democratic National Committee, going door-to-door, registering voters in Texas in 1972. I threw myself in to that hard work because I believed then, as I believe now, that every American has a right to be part of our great democracy. Every voice should have the chance to be heard and every vote counted. This goes way beyond this election and it goes way beyond who's running, because no matter where you were born, or how much money you were born into, no matter where you worship or the color of your skin, it is a bedrock American principle that we are all equal in the voting booth. For me, it has been a long struggle to get to the point where barriers were knocked down and doors opened and we still haven't completed that journey. But it is the vote that has given voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless. It is through that vote that women, African American, Latinos and so many others have claimed their rights as full and equal citizens. We have made our laws more just and our society more fair. Each vote is a declaration of our dreams for our children and a reflection of our prayers for our nation's future. That is why generations of brave men and women marched and protested, risked and gave their lives for this right. It is because of them that both Senator Obama and I stand before you as candidates for the Democratic nomination. It is because of all those who came before that we are both in this race today. We should carry on that legacy by saying clearly that we will protect and cherish the right to vote for all people. I've always stood up for voting rights. I'm proud of the legislation I've sponsored in the Senate to assure that every eligible voter can count and every vote is counted and I will always defend your right to vote, no matter whom you choose to vote for in the end, it is not about that at all. Because I believe that Michigan's families are just as important as the families of any other state. The father in Detroit wants the same opportunities for his children as the father in Des Moines, and he deserves the same voice in the future. The mother in Lansing needs access to health care just as much as the mother in Los Angeles, and she deserves the same voice and how we will provide quality, affordable health care to everyone. The families in the U.P. need good paying jobs that stay right here in America just as much as the families in Central PA, and they deserve the same voice in trying to get that done. The soldiers from across this great state need a Commander-in-Chief who will end the war in Iraq and bring them home. They certainly deserve the same voice in choosing that person. That's why I've been saying for some time that the people of Michigan and Florida must have a voice in selecting our nominee for president. I have called repeatedly for an agreement that would seat Michigan delegates at our national convention, because I believe your voices and your votes should count. When others made the decision to remove their names from the ballot, I didn't, because I believe your voices and your votes should count. That's why I've been saying we need to either count the votes that have already been cast in Michigan and Florida or have new, full, and fair elections so that we can have your voices and your votes counted. Senator Obama speaks passionately on the campaign trail about empowering the American people. Today, I'm urging him to match those words with action, to make sure the people of Michigan and Florida have a voice and a vote in this election. I have accepted the plan for a new vote in Michigan, proposed in draft legislation and approved by the Democratic National Committee. In fact, the DNC put out a statement earlier this morning making clear that the proposal fits within the DNC rules. It is fully within the party's rules. I call on Senator Obama to do the same. This is a crucial test. Does he mean what he says or not? I am pleased and grateful that on this issue, the people of Michigan have had such outstanding advocates in their Democratic leaders, and there are so many, including the Governor and Senator Stabenow and members of the legislature. But I especially want to thank four who have really been at the forefront: Senator Carl Levin, Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Debbie Dingell and Ron Gettelfinger of the UAW. People in Michigan and particularly Democrats in Michigan know that Michigan matters, both in the primary and in the general election. The road to a Democratic White House goes through Michigan and Florida. If Democrats send the message that we don't care about your vote, I'm sure John McCain and the Republicans would be happy to have them. In fact, the Republicans will argue that Michigan and Florida voters shouldn't trust the Democrats to look out for them when we won't even listen to you. Ignoring Michigan and Florida would be a grave mistake. We won't be able to end the war in Iraq, we won't achieve universal health care, we won't end the housing crisis and get the economy moving again unless we win in Michigan and Florida in November. For me, it's really very simple. We need your voices and you have a right to your vote. I am proud to stand with the people of Michigan in this cause and I hope that Senator Obama will join me, because when we look at the stakes of this election, they could not be higher. The next president of the United States will inherit a huge mess from George W. Bush and we're going to have to do a lot of cleaning up. I can just imagine what it will be like to try to undo the damage that we will inherit plus taking on the neglected agenda that the votes sand families of Michigan and American are waiting to have addressed. I've been criss-crossing our country, saying very clearly that I offer solutions, 21st century solutions about how we're going to get the economy moving again and creating good jobs with particular emphasis on a state like Michigan that deserves even more attention from the next president because you've been neglected and you've been ignored and your needs have been denied. It was amazing to me that the big three auto companies in the UAW had to beg for years just to have a meeting with the president. I met with them more than the president met with them, and what we were waiting for was just a smidgen of presidential leadership - we didn't ask for a lot. A little would have been welcome. Some idea that, you know what, the auto industry and our big three manufacturers and the hard-working members of the UAW deserve some help as we make this transition into a higher gas mileage economy, as we look for ways to support innovation from hybrid cars to more flexible fuel. That's all they were looking for, a partner who would be with them in this fight to save American jobs, to make sure that we retained leadership globally as we navigated through a much more challenging economy. But it didn't happen. So we're going to really have to go into high gear starting in January 2009 because we're going to have to make up for all the lost time and the lost opportunities. We have big challenges - how are we going to create new jobs? How are we going to get the tax codes to quit rewarding businesses for exporting jobs out of Michigan to foreign countries? How are we going to make that tax code fair and quit yielding a lower tax rate to some Wall Street money manager who makes 50 million dollars? Then what is paid by nurse, a teacher or a truck driver making $50,000 right here in Detroit or elsewhere across Michigan? And what are we going to do to finally tackle our energy dependence? We can't live with $112 a barrel, oil and gas moving up to $4 a gallon. The average American is going to just be bewildered and distressed trying to figure out how to cover all the expenses because the price of everything is going up, but wages are not going up. People are not being rewarded for working harder, doing more, and more, and more. How many of you know someone with two, and even three, jobs that don't pay what used to be paid in the job they used to have before it was exported or done away with? And we cannot continue the moral outrage and the economic calamity of having a health care system that doesn't cover everyone and continues to cost more and more and more every single year. We've got to move for universal health care and we've got to do it quickly because we can't be globally competitive and expect to have our individual businesses bear all these costs. And we're sure going to have to deal with our education system, with more opportunities for children in the pre-school years so that they're better prepared to go to school, with universal pre-kindergarten and more Head Start and early childhood development. And I will end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind, which hasn't worked and is not working. And we will make college affordable again for young people from middle class and working families. There's so much to be done here at home and, of course, around the world we have to restore America's leadership and our moral authority and that means we've got to begin ending the war in Iraq. And I have been outlining this week, as we mark the fifth anniversary of George Bush's preemptive war that he waged, I have been outlining plans as to what we can and must do to begin bringing our sons and daughters home. I am convinced that we can start within 60 days and do it in a responsible and careful manner, recognizing that the Iraqi government has to take responsibility for its own future, that we have given them the precious gift of freedom and it is up to them to decide whether or not they will use it. But we cannot win their civil war. There is no military solution. And as we bring our troops home we must take care of them. Our veterans deserve our greatest efforts to fulfill our obligations to them. Get the healthcare and the other services that they have so richly earned and we've got to have a 21st century GI Bill of Rights for these young men and women so they can go to school or start a business or buy a home. So there's a lot of work ahead but I am confident and optimistic that we can do this work together. And I know that the next president of the United States is going to have to have a united country with everyone once again believing that our best days are ahead, and working to achieve big goals again like universal healthcare and energy independence and so much more. Well, I sure want Michigan and Florida to be right in the forefront of helping to make the choice as to who will walk into that Oval Office next January. Thank you all very, very much."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 24, 2008",b'Remarks on Halting the Housing Crisis at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia',"b'Thank you. Thank you. It\'s great to be back here at Penn and in Philadelphia. I remember giving the commencement address here some years ago and I always had that image of the beauty of this campus and, of course, its extraordinary reputation. And I\'m delighted to have a chance to be here with you to talk about an issue that is critical not only to Pennsylvania but to our country. I want to thank Congresswoman Schwartz, she and I will be together later this afternoon. I\'m looking forward to that very much. Mayor Nutter, I have heard the governor say that you could be the second best mayor in Philadelphia history. I know you\'re aiming for first, so keep it up. You\'re doing a great job. And Governor Rendell who has been so visionary and strategic in his leadership first to Philadelphia, then of course to Pennsylvania. And what he just said about how he and his administration responded to the first signs of trouble from the mortgage market is just typical of Ed Rendell. He really is someone who is always looking to solve problems and that\'s why he\'s been so successful and why I\'m so grateful for his support. I want to take a moment to note yesterday\'s heartbreaking news that five years after the start of the war there have now been 4,000 U.S. military deaths in Iraq. Tens of thousands of our brave men and women have also suffered serious wounds, both visible and invisible, to their bodies, their minds, and their hearts. As president, I intend to honor their extraordinary service and the sacrifice of them and their families by ending this war and bringing them home as quickly and responsibly as possible. As the headlines of the past months have made clear, we are experiencing a crisis of confidence in our country. We have a crisis of confidence in our leadership with respect to Iraq and we have a crisis of confidence in our economy. What started out as a subprime mortgage crisis has now become a national credit crisis, rippling out from banks and boardrooms to businesses and living rooms across America. We\'ve had three straight months of private sector job losses. Consumer confidence is down and falling. The dollar has hit record lows and gas prices, record highs. And last week the Federal Reserve took unprecedented measures to rescue Wall Street, the likes of which we haven\'t seen since the Great Depression. These are not just red flags or warning signs - they are indisputable indicators that our economy is in serious trouble. And now we face an urgent question: how do we keep today\'s turmoil from spiraling into a long and painful recession? This is no easy task. The 21st century American economy is more complex and more interconnect with the global economy than ever before. It is shaped each day by billions and billions of individual transactions and interactions on every continent. Subject to crises or even just speculation in one country can move markets in dozens of others with the blink of an eye or a flick of a mouse. In today\'s economy, trouble that starts on Wall Street often ends up on Main Street. Sometimes within minutes, sometimes over the course of months or even years. When there\'s a run on mortgage-backed securities and the bottom falls out for investment banks, the bottom falls out for families who see the value of their homes, their greatest source of wealth, decline. When our credit markets freeze up, that doesn\'t just cause panic on our trading floors, but in small businesses that can\'t get the capital they need to survive. And on college campuses like this one, when the student loan for next semester falls through. When we continue to persist in brain dead energy policy as confidence in our currency erodes, that means gas prices so high you feel like it costs more to commute to work than you make when you get there. It means rising food prices that strain household budgets. It means having less left over for savings or ever dipping into savings to make ends meet. It means more challenges for the mayor because property tax revenues drop, businesses don\'t have the same ability to make that profit that benefits the city. It means more problems for the governor who has to look across a complex state economy trying to figure out how to keep what has been a remarkable string of real budget balances and surpluses. It causes problems for our country. Ultimately the true currency of today\'s American economy is confidence. When people lose confidence in the economy and our president\'s ability to manage it, problems become crises and crises lead to more crises. So we need a president who can restore our confidence, a president who is ready to confront complex economic problems with comprehensive solutions, a president who will act at the first signs of trouble, working with experts to identify the problem, with agencies to adapt regulations, with congress to pass necessary legislation, working to prevent crises rather than just reacting too little too late. We need a president who is ready on day one to be Commander-in-Chief of our economy. If you give me the chance, I will be that president. I will start by facing our economic situation as it is, not as we wish it would be. That means acknowledging that our economic crisis is, at its core, a housing crisis, a crises caused in part by unscrupulous mortgage lenders and brokers and unregulated transactions in mortgage-backed securities, in part by speculators who were buying multiple houses to sell for a quick buck and other buyers who didn\'t act responsibly. And in part by a president and administration who failed to anticipate and continue to downplay the problems we face. Unlike what happened here in Pennsylvania, when Governor Rendell started seeing problems - and I remember those articles we had in the newspaper, governor, where the housing supply was being, you know, expanded and people were putting zero money down and they were trying to once again get the American dream, they were commuting sometimes two hours to be able to afford that house. Well, those warning signals went unheeded in Washington. But thankfully, not in Harrisburg. And what we have to do now is to look at our housing crisis in greater detail. And I\'d like to outline my plans to address it. 2.2 million foreclosure notices went out last year - up 75% from 2006. Communities of color have been especially hard hit. Subprime loans are five times more common in predominantly African American neighborhoods than predominantly white ones. And 41% of loans to Hispanics are subprime compared to only 22% to whites. But this crisis isn\'t just about the more than 2 million households at risk of losing their homes and, of course, 2.2 million foreclosure notices means many more people than that because obviously you have homes where anywhere from two to ten people live. It\'s about the tens of millions of families who have lost value in their homes. When I talk about the home foreclosure crisis, sometimes people, I can tell, look at me a little skeptically because they, I can tell, they\'re thinking to themselves, I didn\'t buy one of those mortgages, I don\'t have an ARM, I\'m not at risk. But, in fact, that is just not the case. Home prices dropped almost 9% last quarter. Home prices for everyone. If you have paid off your home, if you have a fixed rate mortgage with a manageable interest rate, you have suffered the steepest decline on record. That means families have lost at least $1.9 trillion in housing wealth so far, nearly two-thirds of the size of the entire United States government budget. And today, nearly 9 million families are struggling with mortgages that are under water. They actually owe more for their mortgages than their homes are worth. So what was once their biggest financial asset is now a financial liability. The housing crisis is also a crisis for our cities, our towns and our neighborhoods. At least 41 million homes will lose value because of foreclosures in their neighborhoods, including 1.7 million homes right here in Pennsylvania. Abandoned homes and boarded up neighborhoods mean higher crime rates, lower property values, and plummeting tax receipts for cities and towns across America. Now, a year ago in March 2007 I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market, and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so. I warned this administration that the problems in subprime mortgages would soon spill over into regular mortgages. The response from our president? Well, his Treasury Secretary told Congress that the problem was, quote, ""contained."" And president himself assured us there would be a, quote, ""soft landing for the housing market."" The housing crisis then spread from subprime to traditional mortgages. And in August of last year, I warned the administration that the housing mortgage crisis would soon ripple out throughout the entire economy. Again, I called for immediate action and laid out concrete proposals to prevent foreclosures and help states hard hit by this crisis. I also called for tighter regulation of the housing market, starting with unscrupulous mortgage brokers who were taking advantage of our families. I would require mortgage brokers to disclose right up front that they\'re paid based on the size of the mortgage they sell, to put buyers on notice. I would work with states to develop strong, meaningful broker licensing standards to screen brokers and govern their conduct and I would require all brokers to register with the federal government so that home buyers can do their own background checks to ensure they\'re dealing with someone who will deal fairly with them. I also called for greater regulation of mortgage lenders. I would eliminate the prepayment penalties that lead to such high rates of default. I would require lenders to take into account the borrower\'s ability to pay property taxes and insurance fees when deciding whether to make a loan in the first place. Too many loan lenders haven\'t made that part of the calculation and too many families don\'t know that they need to budget for these expenses. In October, I proposed legislation, the Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act, that imposed new criminal penalties on lenders who were taking advantage of people, offering foreclosure rescue schemes that lure families in, take their money and do nothing to help them. I\'ve also proposed that we amend the bankruptcy code to give judges the discretion to write down the value of struggling families\' homes. Believe it or not, bankruptcy judges can write down the value of many other things to help families pay off their debt, but not their homes. They can write off the value or write down the value of second homes, which seems kind of ironic to me. Making this amendment to the code will help families in bankruptcy pay off their mortgages and stay in their homes. Now, the response to all of this from the administration? Well, they continued their wait and don\'t see approach, largely ignoring the mounting problems. By December of last year the mortgage crisis had become a national credit crisis. So I went to New York City and I told Wall Street they needed to do their part to address this crisis. I put forward an aggressive plan for a 90-day moratorium on all subprime foreclosures and a voluntary five-year freeze on interest rates for all subprime mortgages. The response from this administration? A plan that let banks off the hook and left homeowners to fend for themselves. In the words of one expert, the president\'s plan was the bank lobby\'s dream. This administration\'s top economic priority it seems has been to lavish roughly $400 billion in tax cut on the wealthiest 1% of Americans while families have lost nearly five times that in the value of their homes. Last week when it became clear Wall Street was on the brink of a financial melt down, the Fed and the administration sprang into action. The Fed extended a $30 billion lifeline to prevent Bear Stearns from imploding and took unprecedented action to provide tens of billions of dollars in credit for other struggling investment banks as well. Homeowners, on the other hand, have received next to no assistance. Well, let\'s be clear. When families are losing their homes, that\'s also a financial crisis. When people\'s greatest source of wealth is losing its worth, as college costs and health care costs and food and gas prices shoot up, that\'s a financial crisis too. When ""for sale"" signs line streets across our country, when cities and towns are struggling with the costs of foreclosed properties, that is also a financial crisis. Our families are feeling the anxiety right now. I hear their stories every day, from Florida to Wisconsin, from California and Nevada to Pennsylvania. Last month, a little girl stood up at a town hall I was holding and asked me what I was going to do ""about people and children that don\'t have any food or houses?"" I started to commend her on her concern for those less fortunate, when she interrupted me and said, ""I\'m losing my home."" Her mother is a hair dresser whose customers are tightening their belts. They\'re not coming in as often, they\'re not having as much done. They had an adjustable rate mortgage they could no longer afford. We\'ve come together today in the city where the American ideals of ""Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" - of justice and equality - were inscribed into our founding documents. But what does all that mean to a family that\'s lost its nest egg and the hopes and dreams that went with it? What does it mean to a little girl who goes to sleep at night worried about losing her home? Our housing crisis is at heart an American Dream crisis. Your home isn\'t just your greatest asset, your greatest source of wealth - it\'s your greatest source of security. It\'s what anchors you to your neighborhood and community. It\'s the center of your family. For the past seven years, we\'ve had a president who stands up for the special interests - for the insurance companies and the mortgage companies and Wall Street. Now it\'s time for a president who stands up for American families, a president who will rein in the special interests and rebuild the American middle class. Over the past week, we\'ve seen unprecedented action to maintain confidence in our credit markets and head off a crisis for Wall Street banks. It\'s now time for equally aggressive action to help families avoid foreclosure and to keep communities across our country from spiraling into recession. Today, I am announcing my four part plan to Protect American Homeowners: A plan to help our families keep their homes and help communities hard hit by the housing crisis. My plan starts with an aggressive new effort to help millions of at-risk families restructure their mortgages and stay in their homes. Of the tens of millions of Americans who have lost value in their homes, 8.8 million are struggling with these mortgages underwater. That is more than 10 percent of all homeowners -- the highest percentage since the Great Depression. If home prices fall another 15 percent, one third of all homeowners will find themselves in the same boat. The time for action is now - not a month from now, or a year from now - but now. And the reality is that many of our families need more than just basic refinancing. That\'s why I support new legislation proposed by my colleagues, Representative Barney Frank and Senator Chris Dodd that would expand the government\'s capacity to stand behind mortgages that are reworked on affordable terms. Currently, families apply to the government, and the government decides on an individual basis whether to work with them to restructure their mortgages. You heard the governor say that maybe there will be 1,000 families that will be helped in Pennsylvania. This is a slow process that helps relatively few families, and it simply isn\'t enough to revive our housing market. The Frank-Dodd legislation would move beyond this incremental approach by setting up an auction system for mortgage companies that hold hundreds of thousands of these mortgages. Through this system, these companies could sell mortgages in bulk to banks and other buyers. The buyers would be willing to purchase these mortgages - and restructure them to make them affordable for families - because they know the government will guarantee them once they are refinanced. This would be good for families, who can keep their homes. It would be good for mortgage lenders, because it\'s more profitable than foreclosures. It would be good for our economy, helping to unfreeze our credit markets. But given the severity of today\'s housing crisis, simply facilitating this auction process might not be enough to get our economy moving again. That\'s why I believe the Federal Housing Administration should also stand ready to be a temporary buyer - to purchase, restructure, and resell underwater mortgages. Just as it has in the past, this kind of temporary measure by the government could give our economy the boost it needs and families the help they certainly need. It would not require a single new federal bureaucracy, it would be designed to be self-financing over time - so it would cost taxpayers nothing in the long run. It is a sensible way for everyone - lenders, investors, mortgage companies and borrowers - to share responsibility, keep families in their homes, stabilize communities and the economy. In order to determine whether the approach outlined by Representative Frank and Senator Dodd is sufficient - or whether we need the government to step in as a purchaser - I am calling on President Bush to appoint an emergency working group on foreclosures. That is the second part of my plan. We simply cannot wait until Congress passes legislation to find the best way to help millions of families. That\'s why I\'m proposing an Emergency Working Group on Foreclosures. It could be led by a distinguished, non-partisan group of economic leaders like Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, Paul Volcker. It\'s the kind of proactive step that would help re-establish confidence in our economy by showing that the President and the Administration was taking our economic crisis seriously. I\'ve been calling for several weeks for the President to show some sense of urgency. The group\'s first order of business would be to determine how the government should implement the solutions proposed in the Frank-Dodd legislation - and whether this legislation goes far enough. If it\'s decided additional steps are needed, then we should investigate whether - and how - the Federal Housing Administration or other government entities, or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could buy, restructure and resell underwater mortgages. The group would report back to Congress on a very tight timeline - no more than three weeks. In the meantime, while the Emergency Working Group is being formed, we should implement the moratorium on foreclosures that I first called for in December. Every unnecessary home foreclosure just worsens the credit crisis and further depresses housing prices. Secretary Paulson and others have finally acknowledged the need for this moratorium in certain cases. I hope we will act to implement it as quickly as possible to implement it. The third part of my plan is a new housing stimulus package to provide $30 billion directly to states and localities, like Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, hard hit by this crisis. Right now, concentrated clusters of foreclosures are devastating some communities. A recent study of ten states by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that the foreclosure crisis will lead to 6.6 billion dollars in lost tax revenues in just those ten states alone. Just over a month ago, Congress passed, and President Bush signed, a $168 billion stimulus package. But this package did next to nothing to help homeowners and communities struggling with foreclosures. I said at the time, if we did not address the housing crisis, we would not be able to stem the bleeding. Congress is trying to combat a recession caused by the housing crisis without doing anything to address that crisis. Well, if the Fed can extend $30 billion to help Bear Stearns address their financial crisis, the federal government should provide at least that much emergency assistance to help families and communities address theirs. That\'s why I\'m calling for the creation of a one-time emergency $30 billion fund that would go directly to cities and states to address the housing crisis. This money could be used to purchase foreclosed or distressed properties, which cities and states could then resell to low-income families or convert into affordable rental housing. It could be used to help neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates avoid increased crime and blight by investing in everything from police and fire support to graffiti removal and better lighting. It could also be used by local agencies to provide counseling and refinancing to help families avoid foreclosure in the first place. Governor Rendell has been leading the way with programs like that here in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Homeowners Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program offers small, low-cost loans to families facing foreclosure. It has saved up to 40,000 homes since it started. And this past October, Governor Rendell launched two additional programs to help homeowners refinance and restructure their mortgages. And we\'re seeing results here in Pennsylvania: Since the end of 2006, Pennsylvania\'s foreclosure rate has decreased 11 percent. I look forward to working with governors like Governor Rendell and with mayors like Mayor Nutter, who is already providing such outstanding leadership here in Philadelphia, to replicate this kind of success across America. The fourth and final part of my plan involves passing new legislation to clarify legal liability for mortgage companies that act to help more borrowers stay in their homes. Right now, many mortgage companies are reluctant to help families restructure their mortgages because they\'re afraid of being sued by the investment banks, the private equity firms and others who actually own the mortgage papers. Because remember, all of these mortgages were bundled up in these huge packages and sold around the world. So you can\'t just go down to see your mortgage broker or your bank or your other lender to work out a deal because they no longer own the paper. This is the case even though writing down the value of a mortgage is often more profitable than foreclosing - both for mortgage companies and for most of those who own the mortgages. That\'s why I will be proposing legislation when Congress returns to provide mortgage companies with protection against the threat of such lawsuits. I know this kind of policy isn\'t particularly glamorous and it probably won\'t make headlines. But it will make a critical difference in helping families save their homes and getting our economy back on track. Now, some may claim that the plan I\'ve outlined today is a ""bailout."" They\'ll argue that it\'s not government\'s role to help. Well, that is the same kind of tired rhetoric we\'ve been hearing for years now. And I think the American people know better. We\'ve had enough of that old ideology. We\'re ready for solutions here and now. And to those who object to our government helping middle class families and low income families devastated by the housing crisis, I say this: We\'ve given Bear Stearns a $30 billion lifeline, we\'ve given their creditors, their lenders their customers and those associated with them the same lifeline. We are now lending billions of dollars a day to help Wall Street banks that aren\'t regulated, that are not held accountable. How can you tell a family about to lose their home that there\'s nothing we can do to help them? How can you tell them that if they had failed spectacularly we would\'ve helped them but because they are failing quietly, desperately, we are turning our backs? How can you tell them that there is nothing we can do to rebuild the American Dream? I have been across our country for years. I know how much a home means to all of us. I remember like it was yesterday when Bill bought our first home. It was back in 1975, and we were living in Arkansas and teaching at the university there in the law school. We weren\'t yet married - though not for lack of asking on Bill\'s part. And one day, we drove by this tiny red brick house with a ""For Sale"" sign in front. All I said was I thought it was a sweet-looking house and never thought about it again. Several weeks later, Bill said to me, ""Do you remember that house you liked? I had never been inside, I had never been outside looking inside, I had just driven by. I said, ""What house that I liked?"" He said, ""You know, that red brick house on California Drive. Well, I bought it, so now you\'d better marry me, because I can\'t live in it by myself."" It wasn\'t exactly a mansion. The kitchen needed a lot of work. But I did say yes. And that fall, we were married in the living room of that house, surrounded by our closest friends and family. That first home meant the world to us. It was where we started our life together, celebrated birthdays, anniversaries and holidays with our friends. And families across America feel the same way; whether it is your first house or your tenth house. It is part of who we are as Americans to look at that home ownership as such an important part of the American Dream. Today, we face unprecedented economic challenges. But we also have within our reach unprecedented economic opportunities. We\'ve got clean energy opportunities that we are not exploiting. Utilities are changing the way they do business, focusing on efficiency, not just producing energy. Renewables like wind and solar are the most exciting prospects for American manufacturing in decades. I\'ve even proposed that we establish a ""Carbon Reduction Mortgage Association"" or a ""Connie Mae"" - an idea that Vice President Gore first came up with. We\'d direct Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide loans to help people build more and retrofit more energy efficient homes. We\'d save money over the long run. We\'d create millions of ""green collar"" jobs. We\'ve got infrastructure opportunities to rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges and highways, like I-95 right here in Philadelphia. Opportunities to revolutionize our public transportation systems; cut down on traffic and pollution. We can do so much that will really build the strong economy we need in the 21st century. But we won\'t do it by just waiting and watching and losing the opportunity to act. We\'ve got so many great ideas that will give us the tools we need for the 21st century. Now, turning the economy around won\'t be easy, but we are gathered in the very city where our founders put to paper the words that have guided our nation - and inspired the world - for more than two-hundred years. Each generation of Americans has faced threats to our ideals. Each generation has met them. We have fought wars, overcome a recession, weathered all kinds of problems, lived through the Great Depression; we\'ve had market crises of all kinds. Through it all, as President Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon."" But we have to translate that hope into reality. We have to translate that conviction into solutions, and if we do, we will meet the current challenges with confidence and optimism. We will rebuild our economy - stronger, more vibrant, more resilient than ever before. It is a question of leadership. I hope we don\'t have to wait until the next president is sworn in, but that we will come together and exercise that leadership in both the public and the private sector as soon as possible. That\'s why I\'ve set forth this plan and hope that the administration will begin to act with the urgency that the crisis before us demands. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 25, 2008","b'Excerpts of Remarks to Reporters in Greensburg, Pennsylvania'","b'The following are excerpts from a press availability that Hillary Clinton held at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg earlier this afternoon: ""...Social Security is a big issue in this campaign. There are differences between myself and Senator Obama and there are very big differences between myself and John McCain. And I have to admit to being somewhat surprised when I saw that Senator McCain had said that he would try to continue to try to privatize Social Security along the lines of what President Bush tried and failed in doing in 2005. That is a very significant difference between the two of us."" ... ""...Pennsylvania as you know has a higher percentage of older people than most states so it is a particular concern to a lot of Pennsylvanians who are on Social Security, like a couple we heard from earlier today who keep seeing their expenses increase and realize that they are in a very difficult position trying to afford all of the necessities of life and being on a fixed income like they are. That\'s why it\'s so important that we are doing everything we can to meet the long term challenges of Social Security. The Social Security trustees just issued a report, actually while I was speaking, and there has been some improvement in the outlook for Social Security according to some, to the Social Security trustees. So I think that it reinforces what I have said for a long time, which is we have some long term challenges. It is not a crisis. We can fix what\'s needing to be changed in Social Security. Our real challenge is Medicare which is much more in crisis and deserves closer attention."" ... The following is Clinton\'s response to Sen. McCain\'s comments on the housing crisis.  ""It sounds remarkably like Herbert Hoover and I don\'t think that\'s a good economic policy. We have a framework of regulation, it needs to be updated and modernized. The government has a number of tools at its disposal that are well-suited for just this situation. I think that inaction has contributed to the problems we face today and I believe further inaction would exacerbate those problems. I\'ve laid out what I would do. I don\'t think it\'s an adequate response to say the government shouldn\'t be helping either banks or people because I think that would be a downward spiral that would cause tremendous economic pain and loss in our country and I don\'t see why we should wait by for that to happen.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 1, 2008",b'Remarks at the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Harrisburg',"b'Thank you very much. Is labor in the house? I am pleased to be in the House of Labor. I want to thank my friend and your native son, President McEntee, for that introduction and for more than - he hates when I say this - for more than 50 years, 50 years of leadership in AFSCME and the labor movement. When you have Gerry McEntee by your side, there is no battle too tough, there is no challenge too great and I am very grateful for his support and the support of the great union he has. I want to salute Bill George. His tough and passionate leadership of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO is legendary. When Bill asks what time is it, we all know the answer: it\'s union time. Because under his watch, more and more people are joining unions and becoming part of the labor movement right here in Pennsylvania. I am very cognizant of the fact that Bill and his wonderful family have suffered such a loss in the last month. But I\'m sure she\'s looking down and saying, you\'re looking good, Bill. And we think you\'re looking good because you make such a difference to so many people. Isn\'t it nice to have a president named George you can actually believe in? I also want to recognize Rick Bloomingdale and Pat Eiding. I know that you\'ve already been great to have Mayor Michael Nutter and Congressman Chris Carney. We\'ve got a couple of international presidents, Michael Goodwin and Warren George. I know that Senator Casey was here earlier and I\'m looking forward to inviting him to the White House to talk about what we will do on behalf of Pennsylvania and the American labor movement. I started my morning at the William J. Donovan Company where I got to visit with sheet metal workers at a company that\'s been in business for 95 years, understands the importance of having trained workers, starting people off as apprentices moving towards becoming journeymen. Once again, I was reminded that American workers are the hardest working, most productive workers in the world. As I watched these processes take place and ended up at a part of the factory where it hand work that has to be done because of the precession required. A lot of the work is going to pharmaceutical companies and hospitals that require the highest level of skill. I asked the gentleman working, how long has it taken you to get to the point where you can do this work that is so specific and where the slightest possible imperfection could cause a batch of drugs to be thrown out for example? He said, ""About 25 years."" Started as an apprentice, apprenticed for 10 years, and now doing work that has no equivalent anywhere in the world. These are jobs that can\'t be outsourced. These are jobs that go right to the heart of the skill and workmanship of American workers. I also think it says something that it takes a lot of experience before you are really, really good to do the job. I flew into Philadelphia yesterday, thanks to union members working in the air traffic control tower. I drove here today in a car built by union members from steel made by union members, over roads laid by union members. We passed by schools where children are taught by union members, by hospitals where people are cared for by union members, came to a hotel that is staffed by union members, in a building that was built by union members. Now, I\'m standing here with all the union members who are some of the hardest working, most compassionate, most patriotic Americans I know. So when some people, and you hear them, act like unions have no place in America, I wonder what country they are living in. Unions are America, and unions built America, and made America the greatest, richest, best country in the world. Let\'s not forget, we know what happens to workers when we don\'t have unions, don\'t we. Think about what life would be like here in Pennsylvania before the labor movement. Back in 1903, another courageous union leader and great woman by the name of Mother Jones led a march of children from here in Philadelphia to New York to demand an end to the scourge of child labor. In 1910, a landmark study found more than 500 industrial fatalities in Allegheny County in one year alone. And the Great Steel strike of 1990 included brutal repression of workers in Pittsburgh and protesting work weeks of up to 84 hours. Imagine, 84 hours a week in the dangerous conditions of those steel mills. The labor movement changed America for the better. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. summed up labor\'s significance before an AFL-CIO gathering much like this one. ""The labor movement,"" he said, ""was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress."" When the wave of union organization crested over the nation, it carried to secure shores not only itself, but the whole society. These words remind us that when Dr. King was taken from us 40 years ago this week, we lost a powerful voice for justice of all kinds, including economic justice. Dr. King knew that unions helped make the American dream a reality for millions of Americans. Labor helped build the middle class. We need unions not just in good times, but in hard times too; especially in hard times. With our economy facing a recession, we need unions standing strong because your negotiations help raise the standard of living for every American worker. When health insurance is out of reach for 47 million Americans, 1.2 million right here in Pennsylvania alone, we need unions standing up for the right, not the privilege, the right to quality affordable health care. When other countries exploit their own workers to get them an unfair advantage, we need unions standing up for workers rights here and around the world. No one knows better than our unions what it means to fight for the underdog. Every day, you are standing up for workers who need someone to stand up with them. And I\'m in this race for the very same reason - to fight for everyone who needs a champion in their corner. For me, this campaign is not about me - this campaign is about all of us. This campaign is meant to repudiate the political philosophies and the governing of the last 7 years. Because our current President and Vice President have a very different view of America. They honestly believe that somehow it works best for America when we keep giving more to those who already have more than enough, and that we take away from those who are struggling just to get to the level of subsistence and possibility. That\'s why they gave big tax breaks to oil companies making record profits, while you pay through the roof at the pump. I met with a group of truck drivers in Harrisburg yesterday. They are pretty fed up with high fuel prices and they were making their opinions known. Who is listening? I\'m listening, but it doesn\'t seem like the White House is listening. The president is too busy holding hands with the Saudis to care about American truck drivers who can\'t afford to fill up their tank any longer. I meet workers all over Pennsylvania and elsewhere who lost their pensions; they have seen companies go into bankruptcy and discharge their obligations. We have a vice president, who, when he was CEO of Halliburton which now gets all these no bid contracts, don\'t they, from the government? Workers lost $25 billion in pensions. But Dick Cheney got to strap on a golden parachute worth $20 million. You get tax breaks to people who don\'t need them while our children get stuck with the bill. Now, I never thought I\'d say this but ever since my husband got out of full time public service, he\'s actually made money, much to both of our amazement. But I have to confess, as recipients of all of George Bush\'s tax breaks, I can tell you I didn\'t need them, I didn\'t want them, I didn\'t ask for them. And when I am president, we\'re going to take those back from people making over $250,000 a year in America. And has there ever been in recent history a more anti-union, anti-labor president and White House? They are not just looking for the union label; they are looking to squash the union bug. They want to eliminate unions and union workers - it\'s ideological, it\'s personal. After seven disastrous years of George Bush and Dick Cheney, the stakes in this election couldn\'t be higher. And the need to change course couldn\'t be more urgent. But I am here to tell you, Senator John McCain, a friend of mine, someone whose service to our country I admire, is only offering more of the same. John McCain admits he doesn\'t understand the economy - and unfortunately he\'s proving that day after day on the campaign trail. He looked at the housing crisis, and he blamed consumers. His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush\'s tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100 billion additional corporate tax cut. The Bush/McCain philosophy could not be clearer - it\'s the ""ownership society"", which really means ""you\'re on your own."" If you\'re not a crony, if you\'re not wealthy, if you\'re not well-connected, you fend for yourself; the others are taken care of it. But don\'t take just my word for it. Even a Republican Senator Mel Martinez from Florida after listening to Senator McCain\'s economic pan gave it an ""incomplete,"" and he said: ""where I think he fell short"" is the fact that we need to do some things that can help families, that can help people."" Well, duh. Yeah, we do. We need to do something that can help the American people for a change - put the middle class back into the driver\'s seat. Give our families the opportunities they deserve. You know, sometimes when that phone rings at 3am in the White House it\'s an economic crisis. It seems like John McCain would just let it ring and ring and ring. Well that\'s not good enough for the families that I have met across Pennsylvania. I was with a group of families in Harrisburg yesterday at a diner, sitting around talking. What were they concerned about? The high price of gas; losing their homes to foreclosure, being able to afford to send or keep a child in college; wondering where that next job is going to come from. These are the stories and concerns that are on the minds of the people here in Pennsylvania. I think we\'ve had enough of a president who didn\'t know enough about economics, and didn\'t do enough for the American middle class. We\'re ready for a president who will meet the challenges of our time. Now I know taking on Senator McCain in November won\'t be easy. Republicans aren\'t going to give up without a fight. And no matter how beautiful your rhetoric, the Republicans are not going to turn off their attack machine - it doesn\'t have an off switch. But one thing you know about me is that when I say I\'ll fight for you, I\'ll fight for you. I know how to fight for you and that\'s exactly what I will do throughout this campaign. Look, I know there will be hurdles and setbacks between now and November. But I also know that I\'m ready. I know what it\'s like to stumble. I know what it means to get knocked down. But I\'ve never stayed down. I never will. And neither will you and neither will America. We are on the comeback trail as a country. This is one of the most important elections we\'ve ever had. There is so much at stake. You heard as President George talked about what a difference it made to go from a Republican governor and Republican senators and Republican members of Congress. But we\'ve got to finish the job and it\'s so important that the people of Pennsylvania have their voices heard and their votes counted. Senator Obama says he\'s getting tired of the campaign. His supporters say they want it to end. Could you imagine if Rocky Balboa had gotten half way up those Art Museum stairs and said, ""Well, I guess that\'s about far enough?"" That\'s not the way it works. Let me tell you something, when it comes to finishing the fight, Rocky and I have a lot in common. I never quit. I never give up. And I know that we are going to make it together - not just up those stairs, but we are going to climb that mountain to a better day for America. We have so much work to do and we won\'t get there if we quit or we walk away. We\'ll get there by staying and fighting and standing up for what we believe in. But I don\'t need to tell any of you this. No one knows better than organized labor how important it is to have a fighter on your side. When you send someone to the bargaining table, you need the strongest, toughest, most determined person you\'ve got. Not someone who is just going to talk about problems. But someone who will roll up her sleeves and get the job done for you. A President who gets up everyday and asks, ""What am I going to do for the American people today? What am I going to do to make sure you\'ve got good jobs that can\'t be outsourced? What am I going to do to make sure we have trade agreements that are pro-American and pro-worker and make sure that we can compete with anybody, anywhere, anytime?"" If you give me the chance, that\'s the kind of president I will be. That\'s what I\'ll do because that\'s what I\'ve always done. Alongside labor, I fought for and passed an extension of unemployment insurance in the wake of September 11. I went to the floor of the Senate everyday and stood up to the Republicans and said we are going to extend and expand unemployment insurance until we finally got it done. Alongside labor, I\'m fighting on behalf of the brave and patriotic workers who came to Ground Zero after September 11. Across the entire New York area, ironworkers, operating engineers, laborers, everybody dropped what they were doing and came rushing to see how they could help; so many of them got sick. They had to quit working. The man who could carry hundreds of pounds, run marathons could barely walk up stairs or breathe. Alongside labor, I\'ve fought for the collective bargaining rights of federal employees, The Department of Health and Human Services, The Department of Homeland Security, The Department of Defense, TSA screeners, and public servants like our firefighters and police officers. Alongside labor, I\'ve supported the Helmets to Hardhats program, to help veterans get those good jobs that they deserve to have after their service. I\'m working with my good friend, Congressman Murtha to expand this program and I am so proud to have Jack Murtha\'s endorsement. There isn\'t anyone I would rather have in a foxhole for a tough campaign and a tough election than Jack Murtha. And I\'ve fought alongside labor in my home state of New York - home to one out of every seven union members in America. I\'ve urged CEOs to return to the bargaining table, encouraged employer neutrality in organizing campaigns. I\'ve urged construction companies to hire local union workers, and I\'ve joined workers on the picket line. I\'ll keep standing with you, fighting for you, and speaking out every single day as President of the United States. Because I don\'t think the work ends with the election - the work begins with the election. We have to get into that White House. We\'re going to have to clean house once we get there. I\'ll start by ending this Administration\'s practice of harassing and bureaucratizing our labor organizations, making it impossible for you to do the work that you are entitled to do. And how\'s this for a radical idea: We\'re actually going to appoint people to the Department of Labor, the NLRB, and throughout the government who are actually pro-labor for a change. Next, we\'re going to stop outsourcing our government to private companies that are too often less qualified - and less accountable and actually cost more. Why on earth would we pay a private contractor more to do what a government employee was doing better for less? And let me just say this, I am deeply concerned about acceleration of the outsourcing of production for essential defense material. I was in Indiana the last couple of days of last week - everywhere I went talking to good hardworking Hoosiers, I heard about how company after company that used to do defense work had either lost the work or the company was gone. One specific example just stuck in my mind. All of you have seen those pictures of the precision guided missiles, right? Going down chimneys, hitting targets thousands of miles away. Well, the targeting is dependent upon these magnets and the magnets used to be made in Indiana, the company called Magnequest. The company was bought out, jobs were eliminated, production was moved to China. Not only did we lose jobs, we lost essential, valuable information because you\'re not going to tell me that the Chinese military doesn\'t have exactly what it takes to make those magnets. Now we are going to outsource our refueling tankers. Here\'s what I would do as president; I would strengthen our national defense that support both our men and women in uniform and American workers, and prevent the exporting of essential knowledge that keeps us safe and enables us to have the greatest military in the world. Most important of all we\'ll protect the right to organize for a new generation. This is a basic right and you know it\'s under attack. That\'s why I\'m proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. I am proud to stand up for it, speak out for it and fight for it in the Senate. We\'re going to take our case to the American people. And when I\'m President, I would sign it into law, and you\'re all invited to the signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. So if anyone asks you if labor will have a seat at the table in my White House. I hope you know my answer - of course you will. Labor built that table. There\'s going to be enough chairs around it for everybody to have a place. We\'re going to negotiate a new American bargain - for all of our people. Let me tell you what it will include: First, I will fight for every single job in America, we can\'t save them all, but we\'re going to save a lot more of them than we have been lately. Then we\'re going to create millions of new, high paying jobs that can\'t be outsourced. President Bush has stood by and watched as we\'ve lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since he became president. He\'s doing nothing about the loopholes in our tax code that actually encourage companies to ship jobs overseas. Meanwhile, Senator McCain believes business as usual on trade is just fine. He says that some lost jobs ""are not coming back;"" that seems fine with him too. Well I think it\'s time for a different approach. Today, I am announcing an aggressive infrastructure agenda will create at least 3 million jobs over the next decade. After the failed levees in New Orleans, the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota, we don\'t need any more devastating wake up calls. And you don\'t have to look any further than the problems you had with I-95 to know that we have to take action now. We\'re trying to run today\'s economy on yesterday\'s infrastructure - our bridges, our tunnels, our roads, our water systems and so much else - and we are jeopardizing American prosperity. So I will rebuild America by rebuilding, repairing and modernizing our infrastructure. And I want to salute the work of your great governor, another incredibly visionary effective leader, Ed Rendell on this issue. He has not only made great strides here in Pennsylvania but he\'s leading the way nationally on infrastructure. I intend to work closely with him as President. My Rebuild America plan will create a $10 billion Emergency Fund to identify and repair critical infrastructure problems. We\'ll modernize our transportation systems. We\'ve got a lot of transportation and transit workers here and I\'m proud to have your support. We\'re going to invest in public transit and inter-city rail. We\'re going to connect America with a national broadband infrastructure. All of our communication workers, our electrical workers, we need to have super information highway the way we have an interstate highway system so every part of America gets connected up, part of the global economy. We\'ll create a National Infrastructure Bank and I will use bonding authority to make these long-term investments. Think about it, in World War II we had War Bonds. Maybe it\'s time we ask Americans if they want to play a part in rebuilding America. I think millions and millions of Americans will make those contributions. Then we\'re going to turn around and put them into projects that will strengthen our economy and create room for that economy to grow. We can put at least 3 million Americans to work. We\'re also going to create at least 5 million additional jobs in green energy. Jobs making public buildings more energy efficient. Jobs weatherizing homes to make sure that people get more value for their dollar, to save on home heating and cooling bills. Jobs that will re-open shuttered factories to build the clean energy technologies. I was last night in Bucks County at one of the keystone industrial port centers, I saw these big wind turbines being made, with as I understand it union workers from the steelworkers, and I saw the future, and it is a future that we can expand. How will I pay for that? Take the tax subsidies away from the oil companies and put them to work in clean renewable energy. This is another critical difference between me and my Democratic opponent. My opponent talks about clean energy on the campaign trail, but when he had a chance to do something about it in the Senate - remember where I come from, my dad was from Scranton, actions speak louder than words - when he had a chance to do something about it he actually voted for Dick Cheney\'s energy bill. I voted against it. Once again, when it was time to turn talk into action, his promises were just words. We have to be smart and tough at the same time, it\'s not going to be easy to take on the oil companies and the oil producing countries. But I\'m ready to do it and with your help starting on April 22nd that is just what I will do. We\'ll going to make trade work for American families. Now, I\'ve been criticized by both President Bush and Senator Obama for this, but I believe we need a time-out on new trade deals. I\'ve been saying that for some time now. We\'ve got to have new trade policies before we have new trade deals. That includes no trade deal with Columbia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country. I appreciate Gerry talking about how I did speak out and oppose NAFTA, the president made a different decision but whether its President McEntee or David Gergen or the people that were in those meetings in the White House, they know that I raised a big yellow caution flag, I said I\'m not sure that this will work. And I have a plan to fix NAFTA, with the strongest possible labor and environmental standards in the core text of the agreement. And unlike my opponent, I will never come to Pennsylvania and tell the people here one thing while my staff says something else to a foreign government. You won\'t find me saying anything like that. When I say I\'ll fix NAFTA, I mean it - and I will back it up with action. Yes, we will finally get tough on China. Right now, China\'s steel comes here and our jobs go there. I testified before the international trade commission to try to put the breaks on the dumping of steel in our market. They manipulate their currency, they give illegal subsidies, they abuse workers\' rights. And what do we get in return? Tainted fish, lead-laced toys, and poisoned pet food and polluted pharmaceuticals. That is a bad deal for America. When I\'m President, China will be a trade partner not a trade master. And we\'re going to get that done. Finally, we\'re going to start investing in manufacturing again. Pennsylvania has lost 13,000 manufacturing jobs in the past year; nearly one-in-four manufacturing jobs since George Bush became president. Manufacturing thrived in Pennsylvania throughout the 20th Century. It can thrive again. I disagree with people who say we can\'t be a manufacturing company again because I believe you can\'t have a strong economy if you don\'t make things. I don\'t believe you can support all these other jobs that you represent workers in if you\'re not generating jobs from actually producing things. So, for me, it\'s not just a question of what\'s nice, it\'s critical and essential that we bring manufacturing back. We also need it for our defense sector, as I mentioned earlier. So, there\'s going to be a lot of work to be done and we\'re going to have a very progressive agenda for working families. I will provide health care for every body, not leaving any one out. Because it is long past time that we had affordable health care for every single American. And the big difference between me and my Democratic opponent. I\'m sure tomorrow he\'ll tell you he has a plan for universal health care, but his plan would leave out 15 million people, more than 400,000 here in Pennsylvania. You\'re going to leave out a member of the Painter\'s Union or a member of their family? Are you going to leave out someone who is already sick? You\'re going to leave out somebody who is making minimum wage? He chose to leave health care on the bargaining table when putting together his campaign. I\'m not just going to talk about universal health care; I\'m going to get it done. And the reason I am is because I am passionately committed to making our country do what we have not done both morally and economically. I could tell you hundreds of stories and I bet all of you could. You are so fortunate to have health care because you a member of a union and people negotiate for it. But, I was in Ohio, along the Ohio River during that campaign - I really liked how that Ohio primary turned out by the way - and what I heard was this typical tragic story - the kind of story I\'ve heard for 15 years and even longer going back to Arkansas. I was eating in a mobile with some folks in the area, the deputy sheriff. He said I sure hope we can get health care for everyone and he told me about a young woman from that town. She worked at the local pizza parlor. She didn\'t have anyone representing her. She got paid minimum wage, she didn\'t have anybody saying you know, minimum wage is a poverty wage, you can\'t make a living on minimum wage. She got pregnant and she was having trouble so she went to the nearest hospital. And I don\'t blame the hospital, but they said, look, we can\'t do anymore free care. You\'re from a neighboring town - there was no hospital in her county - you have to give us a $100 before we exam you. She didn\'t have $100. She went home. A little while later, she was still having trouble. She went back to the hospital and they told her the same thing. The third time she went to the hospital, she was in an ambulance. The doctors, the nurses in the emergency room tried to help her, but they couldn\'t save the baby and the baby died. And she was in such distress, they had to airlift her to the nearest big city in Columbus - take her the medical center. In the intensive care unit for 15 days, doctors and nurses and the hospital personnel did everything they could to save her life. Sitting there in that mobile home listening to that story was just upsetting me so much. I think it\'s morally wrong in our country, a young women and her baby died because she didn\'t have health insurance. I think it is so economically wrong. And for the lack of $100 to examine her and do what was necessary to save her and her baby, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent. We can do so much better than that. I will not rest as your president until we finally have quality, affordable, health care for every single American. There\'s a lot of work to be done, and I\'m prepared to do that work. I\'ve apprenticed and I\'ve learned how to do it. I have watched it being done for 8 years. I\'ve been on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and I know very well what it takes for the president and the Congress to actually make the changes we need. I\'m going to propose cutting middle class taxes by $100 billion and I think we can get it done. Because that money is going to go towards helping you afford college, help you afford to take care of an elderly relative, help you to afford health care. I\'m going to stand up again to President Bush\'s ill-advised policies, and I\'m going to end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind and we\'re going to start anew with the kind of partnership we need from a president. We\'re going to give Americans a secure retirement and we\'re going to make sure Social Security is safe and solid. None of this would be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy. I was thinking about that looking at the sheet metal workers today. How many mistakes were made before that perfection was reached? How much work had to be done before you felt confident in trusting that new assignment or that young sheet metal worker? We could go through any kind of work any of you do and say the same thing. Well, it\'s true about our government too. It\'s not going to be easy, but we can make it happen. Again, as Dr. King said, ""either we go up together, or we go down together."" And Gerry, he spoke those words 40 years ago this week, the sanitation workers on strike in Memphis - members of AFSCME Local 1733 - he urged them to move on, and that\'s what I urge us. There isn\'t anything we can\'t do as Americans once we start acting like Americans again - once we roll up our sleeves and we get to work. Some of you have heard me say this before, and I\'ll say it again it took a Clinton to clean up after the first Bush, and it\'ll take a Clinton to clean up after the second Bush and with your help, that is exactly what we\'re going to do. Thank you and God bless you, and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 4, 2008","b""Remarks on the 40th Anniversary of Dr. King's Death in Memphis, Tennessee""","b'Thank you all. I am deeply honored to be here today on this very important commemoration and for this significant gathering. I want to thank Bishop Blake for his leadership here at home and around the world, particularly in Africa. His personal commitment to the people and children of Africa has resounded so profoundly beyond his church and beyond our shores. It sets a good example and it issues a challenge for so many others. I thank you Bishop. This is a very distinguished gathering here. I want to recognize my long time friend Ambassador Charles Stith who did superb work in Tanzania and has continued with his innovative and unique commitment at Boston University to creating an archive for the papers and memory of African leaders. That will be part of our history. It will not be lost. It will be there for generations to come. One thinks about Dr. King studying at that great university and those who would follow in his footsteps or in any other\'s will now have a much broader and richer historical scholarship record to learn from. I want to thank my friends and another great leader, Reverend Eugene Rivers, for his commitment over many, many years to helping young people and providing alternatives in a way that keeps faith with our faith. But which puts aside the trappings of church and religion and goes into the streets. That has made such a difference to so many over such a long time. We are also honored to be with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives, Congressman John Conyers, who has led with such prophetic commitment as well to what is right. And now is in a position to influence the future of our country. It will be a good day, Mr. Chairman, when you don\'t have to be investigating all of the abuses of power of a president any longer. And we\'ll be able to come together around a positive agenda. Congressman Steve Cohen, I\'m grateful for his leadership. My dear friend, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who just came in, who is, I would say peripatetic, in that she has more miles logged than anyone I know. I talked to Sheila from Iraq, from Africa, from Texas, New York, Washington, D.C., because she is a woman on the move. I\'m so pleased that she is here as well. Mayor Willie Herenton, one of the great long-time committed mayors of this city, and is helping to oversee its renaissance. Memphis is on the way back, mayor and that has a lot to do with your spirit and your love of this city. Mayor Wharton of Shelby County, your partner in such activities. One of the reasons I wanted to be here today was not only to honor the memory, the legacy and the challenges left to us by Dr. King, but also to support Memphis and to support what you are trying to do to really seize the future with confidence and optimism. Bishop Brooks, Bishop Macking, other distinguished clergy who are here. I am not sure if all of us are aware of the coming together in Memphis today of so many from so many different groups to find common cause. Now we must leave Memphis united and committed to the changes that await our actions. Ruth Davis, the head of Memphis Sanitation Workers, that is such an important person to recognize because in a very real way we would not be here if it were not for that strike and that demand in for human rights and justice that happened 40 years ago. Secretary Rodney Slater, it is always an honor to be anywhere with my long-time friend from Arkansas. Some weeks ago I was with Reverend Billy Kyles at his church. As anyone who knows Reverend Kyles can attest, he has spent the last 40 years witnessing - witnessing to Dr. King\'s life and death, because he was a witness. A witness who has taken the horror and tragedy of that day and channeled it into a mission to reach out wherever anyone who would listen to what was at stake, and still is, in our country and around the world. It is hard to believe that it has been 40 years. And it is also heart-breaking to know that Dr. King has been gone from this earth longer than he was here. When one thinks of his life  such a short life  going by in just a moment of time, but having such a profound and lasting impact on all of us. As a young woman, I was privileged to be taken to hear Dr. King speak by a youth minister who opened my eyes and ears and my horizons. Dr. King\'s call to action that evening in Chicago led me to confront a world bigger and broader than the one I inhabited. He had a way of doing that, of pushing us outside our own comfort zone, of making it clear that we had to be part of the revolution that was going on. It wasn\'t a revolution of guns. It was a revolution of hearts and minds, of attitudes and actions. When one heard Dr. King speak, and I stood in line for a very long time that night to shake his hand. And he was gracious, and he was kind to lean over to shake the hand of a 14-year-old girl from the from the suburbs of Chicago, who went to an all-white church and an all-white school, and lived in an all-white suburb. But he didn\'t ask me, as I reached out my hand, where do you live, what is your experience? He just took it and looked in my face and thanked me for coming. That Dr. King had such a profound and lasting impact on a young white girl, that he had that kind of impact on millions of people of all colors, faiths, ages and walks of life, tells us something about the reach and power of his vision. It was a vision big enough and bold enough and grace-filled enough to embrace every last one of us. And when he came here to Memphis to speak out on behalf of workers, he wasn\'t only speaking for those sanitation workers who were denied their rights, who had seen two of their fellow workers die in a cascade of garbage a few weeks before. He was speaking out for all workers everywhere who are exploited and abused and denied their basic rights. When Dr. King protested the Vietnam War, he wasn\'t just speaking on behalf of black soldiers, but all soldiers and civilians  Vietnamese and Americans alike. When he worked on behalf of the poor here in America and around the world, he wasn\'t just speaking for the poor he knew, that he could see with his own eyes, but the poor who knew no boundaries of geography or color. And when he stood against discrimination, he wasn\'t just seeking to free African Americans from the shackles of slavery and the past that had been shaped by that abomination; he was seeking to break the shackles of hatred on the hearts of us all. He yearned for our country to fulfill the ideals that it had given lip service to, that were embodied in our founding documents. In his last speech here, he took us on a tour of history, but showed us the unfinished business and unrealized promises of America. Dr. King understood our constitution better than most of us. He knew it was crafted to expand as our hearts expanded. It was not a constricted document from one place in time, but an expansive proclamation of what America could become if we had the courage to do so. Slavery was written onto that document, but so was the potential for equality. He waged that revolution, but not just to change our laws, as I heard Bishop Blake talking about, but to change our hearts and behaviors. He reminded us that those who signed our founding documents were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir; the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In the end he asked nothing more than that we redeem that promise, each in our own way through faith-based institutions, through our businesses, our labor unions, through our political and public service. And even though as originally drafted we did not include Dr. King or me either, women and African Americans were left out of America\'s founding promises, but he never gave up and neither should we. His faith in America animated and sustained his journey. Like with any faith, there were dark moments when one doubts, when one is on the brink of giving up and throwing in the towel. But he would always come back from those dark places and so must we. The tenacity of Dr. King\'s faith is all the more extraordinary when we think of the ways it was tested. By all the critics and the media attacking his work, by the death threats, the bombings, the beatings, the stabbings, the murder, the grinding hard work day after day of just getting up and moving on, even the speech he gave here at this great complex wasn\'t supposed to be delivered. The crowd demanded it. And he came. He always answered the call. For those who are clergy, you know that it sometimes tests one\'s constitution and one\'s faith to constantly be asked to do more to reach out to keep going. Someone of lesser heart and lesser faith might have grown weary doing good, might have given up, but he persisted in the struggle. And we know the results. So much has changed. I look at the young people standing in the back of this room. And it may be hard for you to imagine what you read in the history books, what your parents and your grandparents tell you. Jim Crowe is now something you read about. The people in this room lived under it. Because of Dr. King, these young people, my daughter\'s generation, grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could attend school together. Because of him, after 219 years and 43 presidents who have been white men, this next generation will grow up taking for granted that a woman or an African American can be President of the United States of America. But as far as we\'ve come, we know the journey is far from over. Some days when you open up the newspaper and you read the headlines, it feels like we tumbled right back down that mountain top, doesn\'t it? Some days it\'s amazing how deep the valley can be. At times like those I think of what Dr. King said in his last speech, how he acknowledged we are living in a time of turmoil and upheaval, but then admonished us to remember only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. Dr. King saw the darkness of a nation torn apart by petty human differences, but he imagined one knit back together by our shared humanity. He saw so many going hungry in a land of plenty, but he envisioned an America where our prosperity was shared. He saw America embroiled in an endless war, but imagined a principled peace. While our problems were grave, he never stopped believing that our promise was greater. He saw us not as we were, but as we could and should be. Isn\'t it about time we started seeing ourselves as Dr. King saw us? Isn\'t it about time we came together as we have in Memphis to find the solutions to make America what it can and should be? When I say solutions, I mean good jobs. Jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs that give people a shot at the middle class, to be able to stay there and live with dignity and respect. When I say solutions, I mean respecting the role of the American labor movement that has given that dignity and respect to so many. This time, once again, to give back the support we need to those who help workers organize and demand their rights. When I say solutions, I mean finally addressing the scourge of poverty that stalks so many. I believe, mayor, Memphis has about a 25% poverty rate, down over the last years, but still far too high. I believe we should appoint a cabinet level position that will be solely and fully devoted to ending poverty as we know it in America. A position that will focus the attention of our nation on the issue and never let it go. A person who I could see being asked by the president every single day what have you done to end poverty in America? No more excuses. No more whining, but instead, a concerted effort. It\'s the kind of solution that Dr. King\'s son Martin has been passionately advocating for. When I say solutions, I mean schools worthy of our children that give each child a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. How about appointing Supreme Court justices who will actually uphold Brown versus Board of Education and not reverse the progress that has been made? When I say solutions, I mean quality, affordable health care for every American. No exceptions. Everyone entitled to health insurance. No more going into the emergency room. Instead, going in the front door to the doctor\'s office to be taken care of, to get that preventive health care that will keep you healthy. I mean restoring America\'s moral leadership in the world, leading the fight against AIDS, Malaria and TB, against poverty and genocide. We cannot let our brothers and sisters in Africa and around the world continue to suffer needlessly. And I mean ending the war that has claimed too many of our precious sons and daughters; ending it as quickly and responsibly as humanly possible. And yet we must demand that our government pass laws that reflect our values. Hate crimes laws, anti-discrimination laws, equal pay laws and so much more. But that is not enough. The solutions we seek are not just about what government does or business does or labor unions or even faith-based institutions do. It is what each and every one of us is called to do. There is still too much hatred dividing too many human hearts. Every one of us has a chance, practically every day, to stand up to intolerance and injustice. Like many of you here who are of a certain age, I will never forget where I was when I heard Dr. King had been killed. I was a junior in college. And I remember hearing about it and just feeling such despair. I walked onto my dorm room, took my book bag and hurled it across the room. It felt like everything had been shattered, like we would never be able to put the pieces together again. I joined a protest march in Boston. I wore a black armband. I worked to convince my college to recruit more students and faculty of color, but it felt like it wasn\'t enough. And then a few months later we heard of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, whose eloquence and courage had helped to persuade the people of Indianapolis to follow Dr. King\'s example of non-violence. I remember wandering through the encampments of the Poor People\'s March on Washington talking with those who had come from literally around the world to witness against poverty and injustice. It felt like the doors had closed on the hope that so many had felt. But that would have been such a disservice to Dr. King. To have taken the despair, the outrage and just ended with that. Dr. King taught us everything we needed to know about his legacy and how to carry it forward, but in the end it is up to each of us to walk that path. It is not an easy path. It was hard for him. It is hard for us. Sometimes we take steps backwards so maybe then we can figure out a new way forward. But I have abiding confidence, and yes, faith that we can make our way to higher ground. Whether or not we make it to the mountain top, whether we make it to the Promised Land is not for us to know, but I believe with all my heart it is for us to try. And when we get tired and when our faith starts to waiver, we can of course remember Dr. King\'s faith in us. How being dog-tired that night, he left the Lorraine Motel and came here. I\'m sure he would have liked a good night\'s sleep. I\'m sure he thought Reverend Abernathy had done a fine job and there were so many good preachers there. But he felt called and he answered the call. As the Scripture tells us, when we are called, we must answer. Who will you send? Send me. So here we are. Let us remember and return to the Well Springs of faith from which he drew. One should re-read Dr. King\'s last speech, just as we ask children to memorize the """"I have a dream"""" speech. One should re-read that last speech. Be reminded of the prophet Amos who did shout and commend us to let justice run down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. One can remember the sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ, who taught us to love our enemies. What an absurd teaching. At the time it was given, it was not even in the consciousness of humanity. Love our enemies? Turn the other cheek? What was he talking about? And yet, that has been a prophetic call that has echoed throughout the generations. One that Dr. King took to heart. And let us remember the faith and courage of Dr. King\'s brave widow. She returned to this city less than a week after his death to lead the march  the march for justice. She had not yet buried her husband and she was determined to carry on his work. With three of her children at her side, she did so with tens of thousands of people in solidarity with those striking workers. Let us remember how Dr. King\'s faith connects us through time and place and history. The notes of ""We shall overcome"""" were sung in Berlin as the wall came down, by Chinese students marching in Tiananmen Square, in South Africa at President Mandela\'s inauguration. I even had that song sung to me by a group of women, poor, desperately poor women in India, who sang it in Gujarati, their native tongue. From the prisoner of conscience in a Birmingham jail, to a prisoner of conscience on Robin Island, from the students sitting at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, to the students blocking the path of a tank in Beijing. Whether we are oppressed by tyranny, poverty, war or discrimination, that faith, that determination to keep fighting, working, building and believing has and always will carry us forward as long as we remember and as long as we remain committed to fulfilling Dr. King\'s legacy and dream. Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 5, 2008",b'Remarks at the Montana Democratic Party Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner in Butte',"b'Hello, Montana Democrats. Let me ask you something: Are you ready to take back the White House and take back this country? Well, so am I. I am thrilled to be here tonight on the ""richest hill on earth."" I wanted to come out here for St. Patrick\'s Day, but I\'m glad I decided to come tonight instead. Because the only party in Butte that is better than St. Patrick\'s Day is the Democratic Party. They say Butte could be considered the birthplace of the Democratic Party in the Rocky Mountain West. And I am pleased to be where Mike Mansfield walked these streets and worked in the mines up the hills. I am also pleased to be here with your great governor, Governor Schweitzer, who has made such an impression far beyond the borders of Montana. In New York, we love to quote Schweitzer-isms, there\'s a growing body of them. But it\'s great to be here and to be with my two colleagues, your great senators, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. Having Max and Jon in the Senate is such a great tribute to the people of Montana. I want to thank you for sending them there, and I know that you\'ll keep sending Max and you\'ll keep sending Jon because we need them there every step of the way. I also want to thank Congressman Pat Williams and State Senate Majority Leader Carol Williams for their support and endorsement. To all the elected officials, the active and committed Democrats in this audience: who says there aren\'t a lot of Democrats in Montana; there are people outside who couldn\'t get in tonight. This Mansfield-Metcalf dinner is a great place for us to celebrate the resurgence in the West of the Democratic Party. I am so glad that this election will go on because by holding the last primary, the ""last, best place"" is going to help choose the next president of the United States. It will not be a moment too soon. As I have travelled across our great country, the overwhelming feeling that I see expressed by not just Democrats, but even Republicans, Independents and people who don\'t frankly get very much involved in politics, is that we stand on the cusp of a new beginning for America. If you listen closely, you can almost hear it in the distance - the sound of the moving van pulling away from the back of the White House. We all wish that it would be tomorrow that President Bush would return to that ranch and cut that brush instead of cutting back on children\'s health care and cutting back on veteran\'s health care and cutting back on the future for our children. But I believe the whole world will breathe a sigh of relief when George Bush and Dick Cheney finally hand over those keys. But that\'s not when our work ends, that\'s when our work begins. I don\'t think we even know how much damage has been done to our country by the failed policies and the wrong-headed priorities of this administration. For the past seven years, President Bush has conducted a dangerous experiment in extremism. It has failed our country. He has had two priorities: tax cuts for the wealthiest and the war in Iraq, and he hasn\'t paid for either one of them. He inherited a balanced budget and a surplus and he\'s leaving behind a mountain of debt. He\'s mortgaged our future with his reckless spending, while ignoring the problems that continue to pile up. So here we are, in April of 2008, and we are borrowing money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. I don\'t believe it is right to stick our children and our grandchildren with the bill for President Bush\'s failed presidency. It will be up to us as Democrats to reassert the confidence and competence of our country\'s future. I am totally optimistic. I know how severe the problems are that we face. I understand completely how difficult it will be to turn our country around. But there isn\'t any problem America can\'t solve, there isn\'t any challenge we can\'t meet so long as we start acting like Americans again; rolling up our sleeves and getting to work together. The contrasts could not be greater; instead of trying to solve our problems, President Bush has used fear to divide us and fatalism to discourage us. He wants us to believe that we can\'t solve our problems, and that we shouldn\'t even try. Moving toward energy independence, well that would wreck our economy, they tell us. Moving toward universal health care, well that would wreck our health care system. Since when did America become the can\'t-do nation? As far as I know and the way I was raised, we know that you roll up your sleeves and you face the future realistically. Yes, we do have to do what is necessary to take back the future. But I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that America is ready. We are ready to be called to greatness again. We are ready to be asked to sacrifice on behalf of this country that we love. For seven years, the drug companies, the insurance companies, the oil companies and Wall Street have had a President; I think it\'s time the American people had a President again. We need a Commander-in-Chief who is ready on day one to end the war in Iraq and keep our children safe, someone who knows how to manage this economy and strengthen the middle class. The American people need a fighter on their side, a President who will get up every single day and work her heart out for you, for your families, for your jobs and your futures. I am here tonight because I am ready to be that President. If there is one word that sums up my campaign and what it\'s all about, its solutions. I\'m offering real solutions, not just speeches. I want to create a better future by making it clear that we have to not only set out a vision, we\'ve got to know how to get there. You know that old story about how our political parties are like driving a car, don\'t you? If you want to go forward, you put it in D. If you want to go backwards, you put it in R. Well, we\'re going forward in D. And here\'s why Democrats need to drive that car forward again. Tonight, across Montana and across America, teachers are grading papers and nurses are caring for the sick, and they need a President who listens to them. Tonight, janitors are cleaning up, and waitresses are pouring coffee, and police officers are standing guard. And they need a President who stands with them. Tonight, families are sitting down around the dinner table, talking about how to keep the farm in the family or how to keep up with the bills that are mounting, and they need a President who will deliver for them. Tonight, our brave men and women in uniform are serving across the globe, some on their second, their third or their fourth deployment. And they deserve a Commander-in-Chief who respects them, who cares for them and their families, and who brings them home and takes care of them once they do come back. Americans deserve so much better. I am in this race to offer those solutions, because I believe America\'s best days are still ahead of us. For me, this is not just about the next election. This is about the next generation and what we must do to keep faith, to ensure that our children and our grandchildren have the same blessings and opportunities that we were given, to make the most of their own lives, to take the tools that are the product of a free market and the incredible entrepreneurial energy and innovation of America and put it to work, not only for a better future for themselves but for our country and our world. So when I say solutions, I mean an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. An economy where prosperity is shared again, and we create good jobs, jobs that will rebuild our infrastructure, jobs in clean, renewable energy, jobs in science and research, jobs that can support a family with a middle class standard of living that gives people hope in the future that they are building for themselves. When I say solutions, I mean reigning in those corporate special interests and rebuilding the middle class. I have proposed $100 billion in middle class tax cuts, tax cuts that will go for healthcare, to make college affordable, for secure retirement. Part of the way we\'ll do that is to take away the $55 billion in tax cuts that have gone to those who, frankly, do not need your money more than you need your money. Explain to me how it can make any sense that we have a tax code that still gives tax benefits to companies that move jobs and profits out of Montana to foreign countries. We\'re going to end that. We\'re going to tell people the tax code of the United States will reflect the patriotic investment in jobs and businesses right here, in order to build a stronger economy. How is it fair that a Wall Street money manager making $50 million a year pays a lower percentage in taxes to our government than a nurse, a teacher, or a truck driver right here in Montana pays to that government of ours? And when I say solutions, I mean a return to fiscal responsibility. I was raised by a father who didn\'t believe in credit, didn\'t have a credit card, didn\'t buy a house until he could pay for it; so I\'m a little cheap. But I think that\'s what we need in a president again, who starts having the federal government live within our means. We\'re going to get back to pay-as-you-go, and we\'re going to take a scalpel to that budget and look for anything we can take out so that we put our priorities back in. Enough with the no-bid contracts to Halliburton and all of those crony companies of George Bush\'s. There is absolutely no evidence that outsourcing our government saves money, but what it does is line the pockets of those companies and remove accountability. Back in the 1990\'s, we saw rising incomes. The typical family saw $7,000 in income that came to them because the economy was moving up. More people were lifted out of poverty. It was a good time for America. Occasionally, in this campaign, I hear somebody criticize the 90\'s. That\'s fair. But I always wonder to myself, what is it they didn\'t like, the peace, or the prosperity? I could never figure that part out. When I say solutions, I mean making our federal government a partner with rural America. Now I don\'t want to shock you tonight, but you may be surprised to learn that New York is home to 34,000 family farms. I know, where do they all go under the Empire State Building? But across our state and across so much of rural America, there is a feeling that the deck is stacked against family farms. I\'m committed to working with your two great senators, to pass a strong Farm Bill that works for true family farms, with priorities like permanent disaster relief, strengthening country of origin labeling, renewable energy advances, rural development, broadband deployment. And I want to salute the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Tester. This Farm Bill needs to move and the president needs to get out of the way so that we can start taking care of rural America. It is great to have Senator Tester in the Congress as a family farmer and an organic farmer. He has been a breath of fresh air. And of course we couldn\'t have a Farm Bill or nearly any other bill that actually had any money attached to it without Senator Baucus. So Montana is right in the middle of these debates. When I say solutions, I mean declaring energy independence. I want America to sign a declaration of energy independence. I want our citizens to sign it because there\'s work for all of us to do to move toward energy independence. It\'s time we declared our independence from foreign oil. It\'s time we began looking for solutions from home grown energy. I want to be a president who is a good partner for Governor Schweitzer to help tap into the natural resources right here in Montana - biofuels, clean coal, wind energy. The future has so much potential but we\'ve been going backwards. We are actually more dependent on foreign oil today than we were on 9/11. Explain how that makes any sense. I was waiting for President Bush after 9/11 to say here\'s how we will respond, a goal that will move us away from our dependence on foreign oil. Well, we\'ve never heard a word like that and I know we\'re not going to move on clean coal or biofuels or wind or solar or the transmission and distribution system we need to transport what is created here elsewhere in the country. I know we won\'t do that until the two oil men leave the White House but as soon as they do, let\'s be ready. As President, I will invest in alternative energy with a $50 billion strategic energy fund paid for in two ways, by taking the tax subsidies away from the oil companies. It is hard to explain how a company like Exxon Mobil that makes $40 billion in profits last year needs your money to be successful. And certainly, when you look at what we need to do, that $50 billion strategic energy fund, we\'ll also ask the oil companies to be part of the solution instead of the problem. They can invest in renewable sources. They can clean up their facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or they can be subject to a windfall profits tax which we will take and put to work on developing alternative renewable energy here in Montana. I figure we can create at least five million new good jobs and these are jobs that can\'t be outsourced. These are jobs that can be done right here in Montana. Because it is way passed time for us to stop holding hands with the Saudis, and started holding them accountable. That\'s the kind of president that you can expect me to be. When I say solutions, I mean it is time to finally get tough on China. Right now, China\'s products come here and our jobs go there. We play by the rules, they manipulate their currency. We get tainted fish, lead-laced toys, contaminated pet food and polluted pharmaceuticals. I think that\'s a raw deal - and the United States government should say no more, no how, we\'re going to have new rules, they\'re going to play by the same rules and we\'re going to stand up for our consumers and our workers. When I say solutions, I mean finally providing universal health care. Every single American will be covered. We have two big problems. We have the problem of 47 million uninsured - including more than 160,000 right here in Montana - and then we have the problem of people who are insured except when it comes time to have the insurance company pay the bill, the insurance company won\'t pay the doctor or the hospital. So here\'s what I believe. If you have health insurance and you\'re happy with it, nothing changes. But if you are uninsured or underinsured, we\'re going to open up the Congressional Health Plan. Congress has a plan for itself and federal employees with more than 250 choices. It covers preventive care, mental health care, the kind of comprehensive health care that every American should have access to. For those who can\'t afford it, we\'re going to offer health care tax credits and I would like to see us limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for their health care premium to a small percentage of your income. And we we\'re going to regulate the insurance companies so they not longer can discriminate against people. I think it is way past time. In our country it is unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or religion or gender or ethnic origin and that is all for the good. But insurance companies can discriminate against you if you\'re sick or if you ever have been sick. It\'s time for us to tell the insurance companies no more discrimination, no more making life and death decisions. That should be left to doctors and nurses, not insurance company bureaucrats, and we\'re going to move toward universal health care coverage finally in America. When I say solutions, I mean public schools that are worthy of our children, starting with universal pre-kindergarten going all the way through. I believe you\'ve got to start with pre-school, with Head Start, Early Head Start, universal pre-k so that all of our children get off to a good beginning. And I will end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind. I believe in accountability and I have worked for that for more than 25 years, but I don\'t think you get that by turning our students into little test takers and our teachers into big test givers. We need a new partnership, a new partnership between the federal government, our schools, our students, our families and communities. I will offer that. I will also work to make sure that college is affordable for every single hard working student in America. When I say solutions, I mean keeping faith with our Native Americans, the first Americans. It is time that we had a president who understood that we should fully fund the Indian Health Service; that we should respect the government-to-government relationship, that we will have, once again, a partnership from the White House across America. Every tribe, both in Indian Country and in urban areas, because I believe we must keep faith with our very first Americans and I pledge, I will do whatever I can to make that happen. When I say solutions, I mean standing up always for Social Security. Senator Baucus led the fight against President Bush\'s attempts to privatize Social Security. I was proud to fight alongside him every step of the way. When I am president, you are never going to have to worry about anybody privatizing your Social Security. Of course, we have a lot of work to do around the world. We have to restore America\'s leadership and our moral authority. That begins by ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as possible. It means reaching out to the rest of the world to find common ground to combat our challenges. We can\'t tackle global warming alone; as president I will lead the way to a new global agreement that will include India and China and the other fast developing countries. Every part of the world must be committed to reversing global warming. When we think about taking on global warming or global terrorism or global epidemics, America, once again, must be respected. You cannot be a leader if no one is following and for too long under President Bush countries have been on the sidelines or even actively opposed to us. I will immediately launch comprehensive global diplomatic efforts asking distinguished Americans of both parties to travel across the world, to send a message that once again the United States wants to engage, wants to listen, wants to work with you. As we move from the war in Iraq to once again standing on behalf of peace and security, we will be bringing our sons and daughters home. They will need a new 21st century G.I. Bill of Rights, with money to go to college, money for a home, money to start a business. It has been heartbreaking as a senator to see how many of our veterans have been left alone to fight a bureaucracy and cut through the red tape to get the health care they need; to get the compensation they deserve. I will be a Commander-in-Chief who recognizes that we have the greatest military in the world but force should be used as a last resort, not a first resort in the interest of our country and furtherance of our values. And it almost goes without saying but it must be said, that we will bring our Constitution out of cold storage. We will restore the separation of powers, the checks and balances. We will end the abusive practices and power grabs of the Bush/Cheney administration. This is the America we will build together - an America where the next generation is always better off than the last. But in order to begin to do this work, we have to win in November. That means we have to defeat Senator McCain; a good man with a great record of serving America. He\'s a friend and colleague of mine and I admire his service, but he is offering the wrong ideas for our country. It is important that in the fall election we have a nominee ready to go toe-to-toe with John McCain on national security. He is willing to keep troops in Iraq for up to 100 years. I\'ll start bringing them home within the first 60 days of my taking office. Senator McCain has admitted he doesn\'t really understand the economy. And unfortunately, he is proving it in this campaign. He looks at the home mortgage crisis and who does he blame? Not Wall Street, which helped create this mess in the first place. He blames the homeowners. He doesn\'t seem to understand that if our federal government can find $30 billion to bail out one firm on Wall Street, we ought to be able to find $30 billion to help homeowners stay in their homes and not lose them to the predatory practices of the mortgage industry. I think we\'ve had enough of a president who didn\'t know enough about economics and didn\'t do enough for the American middle class. We\'re ready for a President who, no matter whether that 3 a.m. call is about national security or an economic crisis, actually answers the phone and doesn\'t let it ring and ring and ring, trying to avoid taking responsibility for the mess that will be there when George Bush leaves. Taking back the White House won\'t be easy. You\'d think that after George Bush\'s presidency the Republicans would apologize to America. It might go something like this: ""We are so sorry. We\'re not even going to run against you this time."" I don\'t think that\'ll happen. In fact, I\'m pretty sure that it\'ll be the same old Republican attack machine. They\'ll be out there in full force, and we\'re going to have to be ready to take them on. I want you to know that I\'m ready. I\'ve been in there, in their attack mode for a long time. I know what it\'s like to stumble. I know what it means to get knocked down. But I\'ve never stayed down. I never will. And neither will America. That\'s another reason why I feel right at home here because throughout Butte\'s history, you never quit. When the silver market crashed at the end of the 1800\'s, you refused to give up, you kept digging, and you found copper. When the deep copper mines closed in the 1950\'s, you found new mining technology and you kept going. Many times the national press and the pundits have said: ""Butte\'s a goner."" But you said: ""No, we aren\'t."" And your progress today proves you were right. I\'m awfully happy to be among people who have the spunk, the courage, and the determination to stay in the fight, to keep fighting for a better tomorrow, to know that we\'re going to bring that same spirit to this campaign. Because one thing you know about me, when I tell you I\'ll stand with you, I\'ll stand with you. When I tell you I\'ll fight for you, I will fight for you. That\'s what I have done my whole life, and that\'s what we\'re going to do all the way to the White House next January 20th, 2009. We\'re going to fight across all 50 states. We\'re going to campaign everywhere in America because we need to keep fighting because America is worth fighting for. Everyday that goes by in this campaign, I become more determined and more convinced that we will be able to convince the American people to believe once again in our future; that we are a nation of optimists, a nation of idealists. We know what it takes to continue the progress that is the American birth right. So tonight, we say with one voice: give us the child that wants to learn. Give us the people in need of work. Give us the veterans who need our care. We say, give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end. Give us this nation to lift, this world to lead, this moment to seize. The Democrats are ready, I am ready, and I know Montana Democrats, you\'re ready, too. Let\'s go forward to victory. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 9, 2008","b'Remarks at a Town Hall Meeting in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania'","b'In advance of President Bush\'s speech tomorrow, Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a town hall event with senior retired military officers and Pennsylvania veterans in Aliquippa, PA earlier today: ""Yesterday in the Senate Armed Services Committee, I asked General Petraeus for the conditions under which he would actually support a change of course in Iraq, and to begin a drawdown of our troops, given that the surge has failed to achieve its stated goal of political reconciliation among the Iraqis. Well, he didn\'t really answer me. ""I also asked Ambassador Crocker if the United States Congress would have the same opportunity as the Iraqi Parliament will have to review any agreement or long-term security pact that President Bush is negotiating with the Iraqis. Ambassador Crocker said that the Congress, your representatives, would not have that chance. ""I have two requests of President Bush for his speech on Thursday. First, I call on the President to answer the question that General Petraeus did not. What is our end game in Iraq given the failure of surge to achieve the objective that the president outlined for it? Second, I call on President Bush to pledge to the American people, who have sacrificed greatly for this effort that the United States Congress will have the chance to review and vote on any long-term security agreement he has negotiated with the Iraqis. ""President Bush must not saddle the next president with an agreement that extends our involvement in Iraq beyond his presidency. We have lost more than 4,000 of our best sons and daughters. They have given their lives in service to our country in honor and for the objective of giving the Iraqi people the greatest gift another human being can bestow - the gift of freedom. Tens of thousands of our young men and women have suffered - wounds both visible and invisible - to their bodies, their minds and their hearts. ""This war has cost more than $1 trillion if you factor in the lifetime of care and support that is due to our returning veterans, and of course, we must. Our ongoing military involvement in Iraq has also undermined our efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said last week that our continued involvement in Iraq has meant we cannot deploy the forces we need to that country. ""There has been a harsh and daily toll on our men and women in uniform, many of whom are on their second, third, and even fourth tours of duty. Among combat troops sent to Iraq for the third or fourth time, more than one in four show signs of anxiety, depression or acute stress, according to an official Army survey of our soldiers\' mental health. And we cannot forget the toll on military families. When fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives sign up to serve our country, their families sign up, too. ""So it is vital for our national security - and for the health and safety of our men and women in uniform - that we begin to end the war in Iraq and rebuild our military. A great Pennsylvanian, Benjamin Franklin once said, \'Well done is better than well-said.\'""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 12, 2008","b'Remarks at a Campaign Event in Indianapolis, Indiana'","b'Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a campaign event in Indianapolis, Indiana: ""I grew up in the Midwest. Born in Chicago, raised outside of that great city. I was raised with Midwestern values and an unshakeable faith in America and its promise. ""Now, like some of you may have been, I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small town America. Senator Obama\'s remarks are elitist and they are out of touch. They are not reflective of the values and beliefs of Americans. Certainly not the Americans that I know - not the Americans I grew up with, not the Americans I lived with in Arkansas or represent in New York. ""You know, Americans who believe in the Second Amendment believe it\'s a matter of Constitutional rights. Americans who believe in God believe it is a matter of personal faith. Americans who believe in protecting good American jobs believe it is a matter of the American Dream. ""When my dad grew up it was in a working class family in Scranton. I grew up in a church-going family, a family that believed in the importance of living out and expressing our faith. ""The people of faith I know don\'t ""cling to"" religion because they\'re bitter. People embrace faith not because they are materially poor, but because they are spiritually rich. Our faith is the faith of our parents and our grandparents. It is a fundamental expression of who we are and what we believe. ""I also disagree with Senator Obama\'s assertion that people in this country ""cling to guns"" and have certain attitudes about immigration or trade simply out of frustration. People of all walks of life hunt - and they enjoy doing so because it\'s an important part of their life, not because they are bitter. ""And as I\'ve traveled across Indiana and I\'ve talked to a lot of people, what I hear are real concerns about unfair trade practices that cost people jobs. ""I think hardworking Americans are right to want to see changes in our trade laws. That\'s what I have said. That\'s what I have fought for. ""I would also point out that the vast majority of working Americans reject anti-immigration rhetoric. They want reform so that we remain a nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws that we enforce and we enforce fairly. ""Americans are fair-minded and good-hearted people. We have ups and downs. We face challenges and problems. But our views are rooted in real values, and they should be respected. ""Americans out across our country have borne the brunt of the Bush administration\'s assault on the middle class. Contrary to what Senator Obama says, most Americans did much better during the Clinton years than they have done during the Bush years. ""If we are striving to bring people together - and I believe we should be - I don\'t think it helps to divide our country into one America that is enlightened and one that is not. ""We know there is an unacceptable economic divide in America today, but that is certainly not the way to bridge it. The way to do that is to roll up our sleeves and get to work and make sure we provide, once again, economic opportunity and shared prosperity for all Americans. ""People don\'t need a president who looks down on them; they need a president who stands up for them. And that is exactly what I will do as your president. ""Because I believe if you want to be the president of all Americans, you need to respect all Americans. And that starts with respecting our hard working Americans, and what we need to do here is to take a lesson from Allison transmission.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 13, 2008",b'Remarks at the Compassion Forum',"b""CAMPBELL BROWN, MODERATORJON MEACHAM, MODERATORBROWN: Tonight, we're going to spend about half of our time with Senator Clinton, about half of our time with Senator Obama. The order tonight was decided by coin toss. Senator Clinton won and has elected to go first. Questions will come from Jon and me and from some of the faith leaders assembled here in our audience, so let's get started. Without further ado, please welcome the senator from New York, Hillary Clinton. BROWN: Nice to see you. Welcome. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much. BROWN: Senator Clinton, welcome to you. CLINTON: Thank you. BROWN: Jon has got the first question. CLINTON: Great. Well, it's wonderful to be here. I want to thank Messiah College for hosting this. Very good of you to do this. (APPLAUSE) MEACHAM: Senator, we'll start with the news. You have been extremely critical of Senator Obama's recent comments in San Francisco in which he argued that some hard-pressed Americans have -- economically hard-pressed Americans have, and I quote, gotten bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. Senator, you have written of how faith sustained you in bitter times. Many of us have been sustained by our faith in bitter times. What exactly is wrong with what Senator Obama had to say? CLINTON: Well, I'm going to let Senator Obama speak for himself. But from my perspective, the characterization of people in a way that really seemed to be elitist and out of touch is something that we have to overcome. You know, the Democratic Party, to be very blunt about it, has been viewed as a party that didn't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans. And I think it's important that we make clear that we believe people are people of faith because it is part of their whole being; it is what gives them meaning in life, through good times and bad times. It is there as a spur, an anchor, to center one in the storms, but also to guide one forward in the day-to-day living that is part of everyone's journey. And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on. But I am very confident that, as we move forward tonight and beyond, people will get a chance to get to know each of us a little better, and that's really what I want to talk about. I will leave it to Senator Obama to speak for himself; he does an excellent job of that. And I will speak for myself on what my faith journey is and what, you know, leads me to this chair here tonight. BROWN: But, Senator, you've been out there on the stump attacking him pretty aggressively over this. And his response has been -- and he said it pretty bluntly tonight -- shame on you. You know that he is a man of faith. This is what he's saying. And to suggest that he is demeaning religion is you playing politics. CLINTON: Well, he will have to speak for himself and provide his own explanation. But I do think it raises a lot of concerns and we've seen that exhibited in the last several days by people here in Pennsylvania, in Indiana where I was yesterday, and elsewhere, because it did seem so much in-line with what often we are charged with. Someone goes to a closed-door fundraiser in San Francisco and makes comments that do seem elitist, out of touch and, frankly, patronizing. That has nothing to do with him being a good man or a man of faith. We had two very good men and men of faith run for president in 2000 and 2004. But large segments of the electorate concluded that they did not really understand or relate to or frankly respect their ways of life. And I think that is an issue for voters, as I've heard today from people I visited in Scranton and elsewhere. So this is a legitimate political issue. And there are some issues that are not. But this one is. And I do believe that Senator Obama will have a chance to explain himself tonight. And I'm sure he will take that opportunity. BROWN: Let's talk about your faith. And we warned people the questions tonight would be pretty personal. So I want to ask you. You said in an interview last year that you believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. And you have actually felt the presence of the Holy Spirit on many occasions. Share some of those occasions with us. CLINTON: You know, I have, ever since I've been a little girl, felt the presence of God in my life. And it has been a gift of grace that has, for me, been incredibly sustaining. But, really, ever since I was a child, I have felt the enveloping support and love of God and I have had the experiences on many, many occasions where I felt like the Holy Spirit was there with me as I made a journey. It didn't have to be a hard time. You know, it could be taking a walk in the woods. It could be watching a sunset. You know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about 60 books worth... (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: ... some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base. But I don't think that I could have made my life's journey without being anchored in God's grace and without having that, you know, sense of forgiveness and unconditional love. And I am not going to point to one or another matter. I mean, some of my struggles and challenges have been extremely public. And I have talked about how I have been both guided and supported through those, trying to find my own way through, because, for me, my faith has given me the confidence to make decisions that were right for me, whether anybody else agreed with me or not. And it is just such a part of who I am and what I have lived through for so many years that trying to pull out and say, oh, I remember, I was sitting right there when I felt, you know, God's love embrace me, would be, I think, trivializing what has been an extraordinary sense of support and possibility that I have had with me my entire life. MEACHAM: Senator, you -- right after New Hampshire, you and I had a conversation a couple of days after that in which you described your moment in the setting where you said that you worked very hard and it was seen as a turning point by many people. You described that as a moment of grace. CLINTON: Yes. MEACHAM: So that is a specific in... CLINTON: Right, right. Well, you know, Jon, it is -- it is perhaps a reluctance on my part that is rooted in my personal reserve, rooted in the way I was raised, that I worry and I -- you know, I understand you want to ask a lot of personal questions, and I appreciate that. But I also worry, as I suggested to you in that same interview, that you have to walk the walk of faith. And talking about it is important because it's important to share that experience. But I also believe that, you know, faith is just -- it's grace. It's love. It's mystery. It's provocation. It is everything that makes life and its purpose meaningful as a human being. CLINTON: And those moments of grace are ones that I cherish and, you know, in asked a specific question about how I felt when I shared my belief that politics is not a game, it is not a who's up, who's down. I mean, it is a serious search and we are so fortunate because we have taken the gifts that God gave us and we have created this democracy where we choose our leaders and we have to be more mindful of how important and serious a business this is. And, therefore, when I say politics is not a game, it is really coming from deep within me because I know that we have the opportunity to really give other people a chance to live up to their own God-given potential. And that, to me, is the kind of grace note that makes politics worthwhile. Because, believe me, there's a lot about it that is not particularly welcoming or easy. But every day as I travel around the country, I meet people whose faith just knocks me over. I mean, I was with a woman in Philadelphia Friday morning whose son was murdered on the streets in Philadelphia, whose grandson was murdered. And she and I just sat together and she told me about how strong her faith is and how it has sustained her and how she believes, you know, God is with her and she doesn't understand why this happened to her son and her grandson. But every day she's grateful, and she is determined to be the person that she believes God meant her to be. And so when I sit there and I listen to that woman tell me about how it felt and how today she is still, you know, getting up every morning, has a smile on her face, looking to go to her daycare business and take care of all of these children who have been entrusted to her, that's a moment of grace. But it's not about me. I mean, not every moment of grace is about you. More often it is about the interaction and the relationship. You know, grace is that relationship with God. But it's also the relationships with our fellow human beings in which we know grace is present. And so I just feel very fortunate that, you know, I have been able to experience that and I wish it for everyone. BROWN: Let's bring a question in from one of the religious leaders joining us tonight. Dr. Joel Hunter, who is senior pastor of the 12,000-member Northland Church in Longwood, Florida. Dr. Hunter? CLINTON: How are you, Dr. Hunter? Good to see you. PASTOR JOEL HUNTER, NORTHLAND CHURCH: I'm fine, Senator. Good to see you. Senator, many of the issues we're going to be talking about tonight, Darfur, AIDS, abortion, torture, could present you with choices that will have life and death consequences for countless people around the world. What are the first principles you fall back on to make such decisions? Are there certain activities or references or people with whom you consult in order to do what is morally right? CLINTON: You know, Dr. Hunter, I think this is one of the challenges that face any of us who are in public life where literally you do have the authority to make these decisions that could very well be life and death decisions and they are daunting and I do not pretend to know how I will deal with every single one of them. But I do have a sense of the process by which I will try to approach them. And it really is rooted in, you know, my prayer, my contemplation, my study. I think you have to immerse yourself in advice, information, criticism from others. I don't pretend to even believe that I know the answers to a lot of these questions. I don't. But I do believe that you have to be willing to expose yourself to many different points of view and then you have to make that decision. I think that for a lot of us, decisions are ones that you don't just make and put on a shelf. To be fair to be constantly struggling and challenging yourself, you have to keep opening up that decision and asking. CLINTON: And very often, as you know, some decisions look like they're 100-to-nothing until you actually examine them. And some decisions truly are right down the middle, and you're not sure which side of the line you will decide upon. You mentioned some of the very difficult decisions that we are going to face, and there are countless more. How do we get out of Iraq the right way? Everyone knows there is no easy, comfortable decision. I believe we've got to begin taking our troops out of Iraq based on my analysis of what I think is the best path forward for us and for the Iraqis. But I am deeply aware that there will be predictable and unpredictable consequences. And part of making a decision is having to live with the consequences. And I have been very fortunate in my life to have people whom I feel very comfortable talking to openly, with total frankness, seeking their guidance. They don't all agree with me; they don't all share my view, when I start the conversation, perhaps. But I don't think you can surround yourself only with people with whom you think you will agree. And, for me, being amongst people who challenge me, who make me uncomfortable, to be very blunt, is an important part of my decision-making process. I want to push back; I want to argue; I want to raise other hypotheticals and throw them back to see what the outcome is. But at the end of the day, since we are running to be the president of the United States, you have to be comfortable making a decision, because you cannot say, Well, let's put it on the back burner and then get back to it some time when it's clearer, for many of these decisions. And then you have to live with the consequences. But I hope I will never, ever find myself being defensive or abrupt and dismissive of people who disagree with me. I regret that that often happens in politics, and maybe it's because oftentimes the decision-making process is so exhausting. You know, if you're a person of faith, after you've prayed, if you're a person willing to subject yourself to criticism, after you've done it, you're just so relieved to make the decision you don't want to revisit it. But I don't think that a president can afford to do that. MEACHAM: Senator, do you believe personally that life begins at conception? CLINTON: I believe that the potential for life begins at conception. I am a Methodist, as you know. My church has struggled with this issue. In fact, you can look at the Methodist Book of Discipline and see the contradiction and the challenge of trying to sort that very profound question out. But for me, it is also not only about a potential life; it is about the other lives involved. And, therefore, I have concluded, after great, you know, concern and searching my own mind and heart over many years, that our task should be in this pluralistic, diverse life of ours in this nation that individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision, because the alternative would be such an intrusion of government authority that it would be very difficult to sustain in our kind of open society. And as some of you've heard me discuss before, I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare. And I have spent many years now, as a private citizen, as first lady, and now as senator, trying to make it rare, trying to create the conditions where women had other choices. I have supported adoption, foster care. I helped to create the campaign against teenage pregnancy, which fulfilled our original goal 10 years ago of reducing teenage pregnancies by about a third. And I think we have to do even more. CLINTON: And I am committed to doing that. And I guess I would just add from my own personal experience, I have been in countries that have taken very different views about this profoundly challenging question. Some of you know, I went to China in 1995 and spoke out against the Chinese government's one-child policy, which led to forced abortions and forced sterilization because I believed that we needed to bear witness against what was an intrusive, abusive, dehumanizing effort to dictate how women and men would proceed with respect to the children they wished to have. And then shortly after that, I was in Romania and there I met women who had been subjected to the communist regime of the 1970s and '80s where they were essentially forced to bear as many children as possible for the good of the state. And where abortion was criminalized and women were literally forced to have physical exams and followed by the secret police and so many children were abandoned and left to the orphanages that, unfortunately, led to an AIDS epidemic. So, you know, when I think about this issue, I think about the whole range of concerns and challenges associated with it and I will continue to do what I can to reduce the number and to improve and increase the care for women and particularly the adoption system and the other opportunities that women would have to make different choices. BROWN: Senator, I want to go to the other end of the spectrum and the end of life and ask you, do you believe it is compassionate, that it is appropriate to let someone who is really suffering choose to end their life? CLINTON: Again, this is one of those incredibly challenging issues. You know, the Terry Schiavo case in Florida posed that for many people. And it was one of those decisions to go back to Dr. Hunter's point, where there were people of good faith and people of strong feelings on both sides about what should happen to that woman's life. And I don't know that any of us is in a position to make that choice for families or for individuals, but I don't want us also to condone government action that would legitimize or encourage end-of-life decisions. Somehow there has to be a framework for us to determine how can people who are either able to make these decisions on their own do so? Or if they are not, how best do we create a decision process for their families to try to decide? And now we are being faced with a lot of these difficult decisions because of what the world we live in today with modern technology and so much else. And we're going to have to come to grips with them one way or another. BROWN: We've got to take a quick break, a commercial break. We'll be back. Much more with Senator Clinton, right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BROWN: Welcome back to the Compassion Forum, everyone. We're here with Senator Hillary Clinton. And Senator, there are a lot of Americans who are uncomfortable with the conversation that we're having here tonight. That they believe religion already has way too much influence in political life and public life. How do you reassure them? CLINTON: Well, I understand that concern because part of our obligation as leaders in America is to make sure that any conversation about religion is inclusive and respectful. And that has not always happened, as we know. And it is so personal. The spiritual journey that each of us takes or doesn't take. And I think it's important that we recognize that for good cause, I mean, we have been such a vibrant nation when it comes to religious experience in large measure because we've always protected ourselves against, you know, religion going too far, being too intrusive. So it is a balance. And we want religion to be in the public square. If you are a person of faith, you have a right and even an obligation to speak from that wellspring of your faith. But to do so in a respectful and inclusive way. So I understand why some people, even religious people, even people of faith might say, why are you having this forum? And why are you exploring these issues from two people who are vying to be president of the United States? And I think that's a fair question to ask. I am here because I think it's also fair for us to have this conversation. But I'm very conscious of how thoughtful we must proceed. BROWN: Another question from the audience. Rabbi Steve Gutow, who is director of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs is with us. Rabbi? RABBI STEVE GUTOW, JEWISH COUNCIL FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Senator Clinton? CLINTON: Yes, Rabbi. GUTOW: Back to China. China has continued to persecute and subject to oppression the people of Tibet. It continues to be the largest supplier of weapons to Sudan and the largest purchaser of its oil. Let's just say China is not doing all it can to stop the genocide in Darfur. You have said that America needs to return to being a moral voice of the world. Is our participation in the Beijing Olympics harmful to that moral voice? CLINTON: Well, Rabbi, I appreciate your asking this question because I think it's a question of both political and moral significance. And that's why last week I called on our president to decide he would not attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics because that is a public and very obvious ratification of our government's approval of the Beijing government's actions. CLINTON: Unless the Chinese began to take very visible steps to begin to end the suppression of the Tibetans and undermining their culture and religious beliefs, and if we could get more cooperation out of the Chinese government with respect to Sudan. And, of course, I would welcome even more action on behalf of human rights. But the challenge is, how do we try to influence the Chinese government? And I believe we have missed many opportunities during the Bush administration to do so. In fact, I think it's fair to say our policy toward China is incoherent and that has not been in the best interest of our values or our strategic interest. So I would urge the president at least to consider and, therefore, publicly say that he will not be attending the opening ceremonies. And let's see whether the Chinese government begins to respond because that for them would be a great loss of face and perhaps we would get more cooperation. We would get the process going that the Dalai Lama has asked for over many years. There could be a lot of ways that the Chinese government demonstrated it heard our concerns. BROWN: A question from Reverend William Shaw. He is the president of the National Baptist Convention. Reverend Shaw? CLINTON: He is. Hello, Reverend Shaw. Good to see you again. REV. WILLIAM J. SHAW, NATIONAL BAPTIST CONVENTION: Senator. Current U.S. policies toward developing countries -- trade policies, make it sometimes extremely difficult for poor people to access inexpensive generic drugs for the treatment of AIDS and other sicknesses. How would you shape the policies of your administration to ensure that the poor would have access to and could secure the drugs that they need to improve the quality of their lives, of their families and even the future of their country? CLINTON: Well, Reverend Shaw, I agree with your description of this problem, and I believe that our government must do so much more to get generic drugs and low-cost drugs to people suffering. Not only from HIV/AIDS, but the range of diseases that affect disproportionately the poor. It's one of the reasons why I voted against the free trade agreement with Central America, because there was a provision that would give even more power to our pharmaceutical companies to prevent exactly doing what you are discussing. I have been an outspoken advocate in urging that both our great pharmaceutical companies -- which do a lot of good. Because, after all, they invent the compounds and put them together that the generics then are able to copy. But we need to do much more to get our pharmaceutical companies to work with us to get the drug costs down and to open the pathway for generic drugs. And that's going to take presidential leadership. I commend President Bush for his PEPFAR initiative. It was a very bold and important commitment, but it didn't go far enough in opening up the door to generics and getting the costs down. And as president, I will do that. MEACHAM: Senator, we've heard about HIV/AIDS. Many people here are concerned about Darfur and a number of other humanitarian issues. Why do you think it is that a loving God allows innocent people to suffer? CLINTON: Well... (LAUGHTER) MEACHAM: And we just have 30 seconds. CLINTON: Yes. You know, that is the subject of generations of commentary and debate. And I don't know. I can't wait to ask him. Because I have... (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: I have just pondered it endless, endlessly. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: But I do want to just add that what that means to me is that in the face of suffering, there is no doubt in my mind that God calls us to respond. You know, that's part of what we are expected to do. For whatever reason it exists, its very existence is a call to action. Certainly in, you know, our... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, in my Judeo-Christian faith tradition, in both the Old and the New Testament, the incredible demands that God places on us and that the prophets ask of us, and that Christ called us to respond to on behalf of the poor are unavoidable. CLINTON: And it's always been curious to me how our debate about religion in America too often misses that. You know, His Holiness, the pope, is going to be coming to America next week, and he's been a strong voice on behalf of what we must do to deal with poverty, and deal with injustice, and deal with what is truly our obligations toward those who are the least among us. So maybe, you know, the Lord is just waiting for us to respond to his call, because this despair, this impoverishment of body and soul is what we are expected to be spending our time responding to, and so few of us do. Even those who are doing wonderful work with organizations represented in this audience, we are just not doing enough. And it's a personal call; it's a family community, religious call; and it's a governmental call. And we've got to do more to respond to that call. (APPLAUSE) BROWN: Quickly, just now you brought up the Bible. We were talking theology. Do you have a favorite Bible story? CLINTON: Oh, I have so many of them. You know, I was fortunate as a child growing up to be read Bible stories, to go to Sunday school, to go to Bible school. And Bill and I read, you know, Bible stories to Chelsea. And, you know, I have talked about Bible stories and parables a lot in my life with friends. And, you know, it depends upon what's going on in my life at the time. But clearly, for me, the recent Purim holiday for Jews raised the question of Esther. And I have been -- ever since I was a little girl -- a great admirer of Esther. And I used to ask that that be read to me over and over again, because there weren't too many models of women who had the opportunity to make a decision, to take a chance, a risk that, you know, was very courageous. And so that's the one that's most recently on my mind, because I have some rabbi friends who send me readings that go with the scripture of the week. And certainly, Esther is someone who I wish I knew even more about than what we know from the Bible. BROWN: A question from Eboo Patel, who is a Muslim, is the founder and executive director of the Interfaith Youth Core. Welcome. CLINTON: Hello. QUESTION: As-Salamu Alaykum, Senator Clinton. CLINTON: Thank you. QUESTION: My name is Eboo Patel. I'm an American Muslim, and I lead an organization called the Interfaith Youth Core. And it's my privilege to watch a range of faith communities come together around the common value of compassion. Americans of all faiths and no faith at all genuinely believe in compassion and want to apply that in addressing global poverty and climate change. Can we do that without changing our standard of living? CLINTON: Well, I believe there is so much we can do that we're not doing that would not change our standard of living as an imposition from the outside, but which would inspire us to take action that would impact how we live. And I don't think we would notice it demonstrably undermining our standard of living, but it would give us the opportunity to set an example and to be a model. When I think about the simple steps any one of us can take -- you know, turning off lights when one leaves a room, unplugging appliances, changing to compact florescent bulbs -- you know, my husband and I have done that -- I don't think it's impacted our standard of living, but we feel like we're making a small contribution to limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, you know, being more mindful of our purchases. I hope that, as president, I can model that and lead that effort so that people don't feel so threatened by the changes we're talking about when it comes to dealing with global warming. In preparation for the pope's visit, I was reading that the Vatican is the first carbon-neutral state in the world now. Well, that shows leadership. And I don't think it has impacted the work or the living. You know, Ambassador Flynn, who was our ambassador to the Vatican, might know. But it was a great statement. And we can do more. CLINTON: And I think that, with leadership, people will find ways to take those first steps. And then we can take even more. Now there's so much that I have to do as president with the cap in trade system, with moving away from our dependence on foreign oil, but I'm going to look for ways that will cushion the costs on middle class and working and poor people. Because I don't believe that they should have to bear more than what they are bearing right now as we make this transition. And I believe we can accomplish that. BROWN: Let's go to Lisa Sharon Harper. She is the executive director of New York Faith and Justice. Welcome to you. LISA SHARON HARPER, N.Y. FAITH AND JUSTICE: Thank you. Senator Clinton, underdeveloped nations and regions that lack widespread access to education and basic resources like water, and they tend to be some of the most unstable and dangerous regions of the world. Places like Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan. Our national security is at stake, but our military is stretched. As president, would you consider committing U.S. troops to a purely humanitarian mission under the leadership of a foreign flag? CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying, No. 1, I believe strongly that we have to get back to leading on issues like health care and education and women's rights around the world. I have introduced legislation called The Education for All Act. And it's bipartisan. I introduced it first in '04 and then we reintroduced it on a bipartisan basis in '07. And the work that I would want to do to have the United States lead the world in putting the 77 million kids who aren't in school into school, having us lead when it comes to health care, particularly in malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS, but also women's health which has been woefully neglected. I believe we should demonstrate our commitment to people who are poor, disenfranchised, disempowered before we talk about putting troops anywhere. The United States has to be seen again as a peacekeeper, and we have lost that standing in these last seven years. Therefore, I want us to have a partnership, government to government, government with the private sector, government with our NGOS and our faith community to show the best of what America has to offer. You know, I really appreciated President Bush after the tsunami struck, asking his father and my husband to represent the United States and our concern for the people who have been devastated. And, yes, the military was there delivering supplies. That sent a loud message and it was resonating throughout South Asia -- in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world. America's favorability rose dramatically because we were seen as caring and compassionate toward those with whom we had very little contact or, in fact, some, you know, level of distrust previously. So I think we have to concentrate first and foremost on restoring our moral authority in the world and our standing in the world. And there are lots of ways that the United States military can be helpful and can show the better face of America. After the Pakistan earthquakes, we sent in military teams to help people. So I think that is my emphasis right now. Before we get to what we might do hypothetically, let's see what we will do realistically to rebuild America's moral authority and demonstrate our commitment to compassionate humanitarianism. MEACHAM: Senator, this is our last question for you. To return to faith, do you believe God wants you to be president? CLINTON: Well, I could be glib and say we'll find out, but I -- I don't presume anything about God. I believe, you know, Abraham Lincoln was right in admonishing us not to act as though we knew God was on our side. In fact, our mission should be on God's side. And I have tried to take my beliefs, my faith and put it to work my entire life. And it has been gratifying to do the little I've done to try to help other people, which is really what motivates me. CLINTON: That's why I get up in the morning and see whether there's an individual I can help or a problem I can solve. And I wouldn't presume to even imagine that God is going to tell me what I should do. I think that he has given me enough guidance, you know, through how I have been raised and how I have been, thankfully, given access to the Bible over so many years, commentary and the like. So I just get up and try to do the best I can. And I think that I see through a glass darkly. I don't believe that any of us know it all and can with any confidence say that we are going to, you know, be doing God's will unless, you know, we are just out there doing our very best, hoping that we make a difference in people's lives. And that's what I am trying to do in this campaign. That's what I would try to do as president. And I couldn't be sitting here had it not been for the, you know, gift of grace and faith that keeps me going and, frankly, challenges me. You know, we haven't talked much about the challenge that faith gives us individually. I really worry when people become very complacent in their faith, when they do believe they have all the answers, because I just don't think it's humanly possible for any of us to know God's mind. I think we are just searching. We are on this journey together, and we need to approach it with a great deal of humility. And that's what I'm trying to do in this campaign, and we'll see what turns out. But whatever happens, I will get up the next day and try to continue on my journey to do what I can to try to fulfill what I believe to be God's expectations of us. BROWN: Senator Clinton, it was a very different kind of evening. You've been a good sport. Thank you. CLINTON: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)"""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 15, 2008","b""Remarks to the Newspaper Association of America's Annual Conference in Washington, DC""","b'I know that in this audience there are members of the media from New York, including Margaret Sullivan from the Buffalo News and Arthur Sulzberger from the New York Times and others who I don\'t have on this card, but I am very pleased to be here with all of you. First, I want to say that this speech is entirely off the record. Well, you know that those days are long gone. And I am delighted to be back here once again. I was listening to Gilbert introduce me and talk about what I said back in 2004 and how times have certainly changed. But I want to thank newspaper publishers collectively for one of my favorite headlines of all time, which has given me great strength and encouragement over the last months, ""Dewey Beats Truman. And I often recall it as I\'m travelling from place to place around our country. I also want to thank you for those of you who have invested in the coverage of this historic campaign. Your hard-working reporters and columnists are there with us every step of the way. Some have literally been on my campaign from the very first days. And they are working extraordinarily hard, given the hours we keep and the miles that we log. And I appreciate your continuing attention to these important issues, just as I do more generally what you do every day to convey to your readership the scope and scale of the challenges and opportunities confronting our nation and our world. I know this is your mission. It\'s a mission that predates our country but was certainly inscribed into our First Amendment. And it is essential that we have you to inform an active citizenry who are the owners and operators of this democracy. I\'m also well aware that there are many who are worried, even as we speak, about those who work with you, journalists imprisoned, Americans as well as those from other countries, journalists who have been murdered and kidnapped in the course of their work. I was recently at an event held by Vital Voices honoring Mariane Pearl whose husband Daniel\'s murder is a horrific and tragic reminder of the dangers that journalists increasingly face in the complex and dangerous globe. So thank you. Thank you for what you\'re doing. Thank you also for what you do here at home. There are many stories that have really made a difference. One in particular that I paid a lot of attention to was The Washington Post\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning series on the disturbing conditions at Walter Reed. What was going on there at the outpatient facility was a national disgrace. What was happening took place outside of public scrutiny, and it took a lot of effort to piece the story together. And once that story broke into public consciousness, the public and the public officials began to respond. Now, that episode is instructive to me in two ways. It was a lesson about the still very profound power of the traditional press to both serve and shape the public interest. But it was also a reminder of the consequences of presidential power misapplied, misdirected or missing in action. And that\'s what I would like to discuss with you today: the power and promise of the presidency. And I\'d like to begin at the beginning. Our Constitution instructs the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and calls upon the president to swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. The presidency is not royalty. Our Constitution is crafted carefully to prevent by election what our founders overthrew by revolution. The president is the one elected representative of the whole American people. Our president is balanced by the Congress, which speaks for regions and states, and by the courts, which defend the individual and other important rights against assaults on our liberties. The president is the only constitutional office holder with the power to speak for all of us and with the potential to unify us in the service of our national interest. Unfortunately, our current president does not seem to understand the basic character of the office he holds. Rather than faithfully execute the laws, he has rewritten them through signing statements, ignored them through secret legal opinions, undermined them by elevating ideology over facts. Rather than defending the Constitution, he has defied its principles and traditions. He has abused his power while failing to understand its purpose. This administration\'s unbridled ambition to transform the executive into an imperial presidency in an attempt to strengthen the office has weakened our nation. It has corrupted and corroded our moral authority and brought our prestige and reputation to its lowest ebb. The president has failed to use the power of the presidency, the power he sought to inflate, to expand opportunity and make a real difference in people\'s lives. This president seems to believe it\'s a good day in the White House when the government does little for ordinary Americans. That is how this administration defines the presidency: limited government, but unlimited power. Well, I have a different view. I believe in the power of the presidency to set big goals for America and to solve the problems of Americans, to ensure that our people have the tools they need to turn challenges into opportunities, to fulfill their God-given potential, and to build better lives for themselves and their children. That\'s the kind of president I will be every day in the White House, whether the issue is health care or child care, foreign policy, or the future of our economy. I am running for president because I believe in the promise of America and I believe in the power of the presidency to help fulfill that promise. Now, that\'s not a sound bite. It\'s what I have learned, experienced and intended, as best I could, throughout my life. I\'ve had many opportunities. I\'ve been blessed. And I understand that those blessings came from the hard work of my parents, my teachers, others in the village that surrounded and helped to nurture and raise me; my church, which helped to guide me; and, of course, the positive actions of my government that directly affected my life. As a young girl, I could not go to certain colleges, compete for certain scholarships, participate, if I\'d had the sporting ability, in certain sports, or obtain some kind of financial aid for playing them. There were certain jobs that were closed to me and other young women. And the horizons were not quite as broad as those for my brothers. I grew up in a middle-class family, at a time when our nation was investing in the middle class. After World War II, my father started a small business, saved up enough money to purchase a home. He, like so many veterans coming back from World War II, were anxious to get on with their lives. He moved us to a suburb where he paid taxes for better schools, and where our nation made unprecedented investments in public education. I was able to go to college and then to law school because the federal government wanted to make investments in young people. And so, when I went to law school, unable to get any financial help from my family, I worked, I had a small scholarship, and I borrowed money from the federal government at about 2% interest. And I and so many others had a chance to pursue our academic dreams because our government wanted us to. As I have seen over the last years in public life as a Senator from New York and now as a candidate for the presidency how many families and how many young people don\'t have any confidence or any reason to believe that their government cares about their future. I believe that we have to change that. The magnitude of the problems be fore us present a unique challenge and chance to bring this generation of Americans together, to fulfill our common purpose. And finding the nation to do so is the responsibility of our president. Nine months from now, a few days, we will have a new president taking the oath of office from the steps of the Capitol. That new president will inherit the job at a time of unprecedented challenges and stress. Our economy is at risk of a deep and painful recession threatening the opportunities for millions of Americans to fond and keep jobs that are satisfying and well paid, to buy their own homes or keep the ones they have, send their children to college, to save for retirement, even to afford their health care premiums, their gas bills, their utility bills, and so much else that makes up a middle class lifestyle here in our country. Our health care system is in crisis. It threatens not only the health of our families but the opportunities for our businesses as they compete in the global marketplace. Our security is threatened by the interconnected dangers of extremism, terrorism, rogue regimes, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and certainly by the ongoing war in Iraq and the climate crisis that does threaten our way of life. That\'s why it is so important that in this election we restore balance and purpose to the presidency as the first step to restore opportunity and moral authority in America. I believe I bring a unique set of experiences to this mission; one, of my lifetime of work going back 35 years, and my incredible opportunities now on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. I have seen what happens when a president tries and succeeds on some fronts, but fails on others. I certainly witnessed and was part of the consequences of a process to create universal health care that was viewed as too insulated from people and their representatives in Congress. But I also participated in and helped to bring about successes, like the Children\'s Health Insurance Program which was a bipartisan accomplishment. I watched as my husband made other important progressive steps on behalf of America. As a Senator, I\'ve seen how working with Congress as a president makes a real difference, and the absence of presidential involvement leaves a vacuum. Congress\'s role in deliberating on legislation may not always bring people together who do not agree, but it is essential that the process be recognized and respected. I have worked hard to hold this administration accountable because all too often the president has failed to share information with the Congress, to be willing to recognize the checks and balances that have certainly been a blessing to our system of government for so many years. I will bring most of my time in the White House and now my time in the Senate, some critical lessons to the presidency. First, I will restore faith in our government by resorting integrity to our government. For seven years, this administration has exhibited ideological disdain for government. And because they view government with contempt, they treat it with contempt. They don\'t believe government can or should be a source for the public interest, so they treat it as a source of favors for private interests. As president I will restore an old-fashioned idea - appointing qualified people to positions in government again. I will immediately begin implementing an agenda of reform to end no-bid contracts, to close the revolving door between public sector work and private sector lobbying, to restore fiscal responsibility, to modernize our government, and to open its books to greater scrutiny. Second, I will restore openness in government. When I am president, the era of Bush/Cheney secrecy will be over. On April 27th, 1961, President Kennedy addressed one of the predecessors of this association, the American Newspaper Publishers Association. The failed invasion of Cuba known as the Bay of Pigs had taken place just one week before. President Kennedy spoke of the threat threatening the United States. He wrestled publicly with the basic tension that exists whenever our security is threatened between the government\'s responsibility to keep some secrets and the public\'s right to know. But he understood the importance of openness to the integrity and vitality of government even in the aftermath of his own failures. He said, ""There is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions."" Just days after an embarrassing failure, the president of the United States came before your predecessors, begged for scrutiny, and challenged the nation to mobilize without compromising democratic values. That kind of open leadership has been sorely lacking these past seven years. In fact the Bush administration has dramatically widened the definition of classified information to shield more and more materials from public scrutiny, has widened the scope of the states secrets privilege to shield this program from judicial review, and has widened the reach of executive privilege to shield its activated from Congress. From warrantless wiretaps at home to secret prisons overseas, the Bush administration has conducted illegal activities and stonewalled efforts of the people and the Congress to discover them and to hold the administration accountable. When I am president I will empower the federal government to operate from a presumption of openness, not secrecy. That\'s why I am a co-sponsor of the Free Flow of Information Act, allowing reporters to protect sources, help insure that whistle blowers can blow the whistle, and you can keep the public informed and keep office holders accountable. I will direct my administration to prevent needless classification of information that ought to be shared with the public. We will adopt a presumption of openness and Freedom of Information Act requests and urge agencies to release information quickly if disclosure will do no harm. It was Attorney General Janet Reno\'s approach, and it will be my Attorney General\'s approach, as well. Third, because solving problems starts by recognizing facts, I will restore evidence based decision making to our government. A free and open society depends upon evidence based inquiry. Shortly after I arrived in the Senate, it became abundantly clear to me that the White House had very little interest in facts or evidence and I started saying in speeches on the floor and in other settings that they wanted to turn Washington into an evidence-free zone. Unfortunately, they have succeeded all too well and we will have to reverse that. This administration has also waged a war on science; rewriting scientific reports, allowing politicians to overrule and silence government researchers, politicizing important decisions affecting our environment and our public health. I will stop political appointees from manipulating the government\'s scientific conclusions and prevent the suppression of public statements from government scientists. I will put in place new whistleblower protections for scientists who step forward to protest political interference. Our government will once again value and encourage scientific discovery and open inquiry, and we will regain our place as the world\'s leading innovation nation. Fourth, because government abuse is checked by the separation of powers, I will restore respect for our co-equal branches of government. I\'ll start by limiting the excessive executive powers this president has accumulated, like the unilateral power to wiretap, or detain try people, even American citizens. I will work with Congress again as a partner to solve problems. I\'ll end the use of signing statements to rewrite the laws that Congress has passed. I\'ll shut down Guantanamo, disavow torture and restore the right of Habeas Corpus. I will end the practice of using executive privilege as a shield against the public\'s right to know and congress\' duty to oversee the president. Finally I will make crystal clear that the president and the executive branch will comply with the laws of our nation. My Department of Justice will interpret those laws fairly accurately honestly and publically. We\'ll release Justice Department interpretations so that you know exactly what our understanding is and how laws are being executed. The President is not above the law in our system of government and we need to make that absolutely clear starting next year. These changes both represent and drive the transformation I believe is needed in our government starting on day one of my administration. I do not believe that power is an end in itself but a means. A means limited in scope of serving the interest and protecting the safety of our nation, while creating opportunity for our people. But the question before us is deeper than how the next president will restore our government and our Constitution. The question is how the next president will employ our government. I am here and I am running for president because I have seen the promise of America and I do understand the promise of the presidency and on day one I will bring my hard won experience, whatever strength and knowledge I posses to fulfill that promise. I will start by trying to live up to the model described by teddy Roosevelt - ""All that in me lies to do will be done to make my work a success."" And I plan to hit the ground running starting on day one and throughout my first 100 days. During that time I will call on congress to send to my desk the bills the president vetoed, from supporting stem cell research to expanding Children\'s Health Care and I will sign them, allowing scientists to better explore the promise of new cures for disease- diseases like Parkinson\'s, Alzheimer\'s, diabetes and so much else. And we will provide health insurance for millions more of our children as a down payment on achieving health care for all Americans with no exceptions. My administration will call together meeting of mortgage lenders, banks, community organizations and regulators to negotiate an immediate freeze on foreclosures, because so many Americans are hurting and the projection is that more than 2 million families will be foreclosed on this year. I will call for a timeout on new trade agreements and review all existing trade agreements and I will call on Canada and Mexico to work with me to renegotiate NAFTA. My budget to congress will restore fiscal sanity while cutting taxes for middle class families to the tune of 100 billion dollars a year, ending tax breaks for oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street and others to the tune of 55 billion dollars a year. I will work with Congress to introduce a comprehensive immigration bill. My administration convene a summit within 100 days to negotiate a new climate change treaty to replace Kyoto and one that includes China, India and other rapidly developing and very big green house gas emitting nations. I will work with the Congress to submit a comprehensive energy bill that will move us toward ending our dependence on foreign oil and increasing the percentage of renewable fuels we use to produce electricity. I will overturn the global gag rule to allow nongovernmental organizations to practice free speech and use other funding sources to provide women with access to the full range of reproductive health care around the world. I will call a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and demand that the Pentagon draw up plans to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq responsibly and carefully starting within 60 days of my inauguration. I will reach out to the rest of the world and ask distinguished Americans of both parties to be emissaries on our behalf traveling across the globe telling both governments and people that the united states is willing once again to work with you to try to find common ground on our problems from global warming to global terrorism to global epidemics. I will sign executive orders ending the war on science, ordering the closure of Guantanamo, reversing many of the anti-labor provisions that President Bush adopted and looking very clearly at what we have to do to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class in our country. In short, starting from day one, the Bush-Cheney era will be over in name and in practice. We are fortunate in our country that we get to overturn our government peacefully and thoroughly. The question is the path we select at such an important juncture. I know this campaign has gone on a long time, but elections do end and when the campaigns conclude and the banners are town down and the speeches are finally finished, all that\'s left is the choice we have made. We have seen the power of the presidency placed in hands unready or unwilling to address the paths that lie ahead. Jus think of the days after September 11th. Imagine if President Bush had tapped into the wellspring of American energy, initiative and goodwill. The president could\'ve launched a Manhattan project for renewable energy, the president could have called on our young people to serve in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps help to start what I\'ve advocated, a Green Corps. The president could\'ve said we need to reach out to the rest of the world because clearly the world needs to be as committed to ending acts of horrific terrorism as we are. The president could have responded to our health challenges by investing in public health here and around the world. The president could\'ve said we need to be smarter about how we engage with the rest of the world so let us lead in trying to make education more universally available to the 77 million children who are shut out, including in countries like Pakistan where too often the young boys are then turned over for indoctrination to the Madrassas because there are no alternative. The president literally could have access to do anything, called on our patriotism and our unity. But he only asked us to draw on our wallets and go shopping. We have also seen throughout our history the power of the presidency placed in hands ready to transform our nation for the better, to call upon those better angels of our nature, to summon the unique and wonderful spirit that sets America apart and carries forward, constantly believing that tomorrow can be better than today. We\'ve overcome tyranny, we\'ve ended the injustice of slavery, we\'ve expanded civil rights and women\'s rights, we\'ve endured and grown stronger through the Depression and World Wars, and yes, we have become a much better and fairer country for all that we have done on behalf of those who were initially left our of our constitution or who lacked even the basic power to organize for themselves. Throughout our history we have achieved in those moments improbable and even impossible triumphs. And each time we have rediscovered the boundless forces of American strengths and character. That is what we must do again. In a message to congress from the citizens of America at the onset of the Civil War, President Lincoln called upon our nation to save itself. ""It is a struggle,"" he said, ""for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the path of laudable pursuit for all, to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life."" Those are the stakes. In your hands rest an awesome responsibility - to inform us and educate us. And to help us be committed to that race that lies ahead. We must not turn away from the urgency of our times and the immediacy of the tasks before us. I know that we are fully up to it; I have no doubt. No matter how daunting it may seem, there is no one who can count us out if we are willing and able to rise and meet the challenges and seize the opportunities before us. It would be a grave abdication of our birthright, of our history as Americans were we to do any less. Thank you all very much.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 21, 2008","b'Interview with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC\'s ""Countdown""'","b'KEITH OLBERMANN, HOST: Senator Clinton joins us now from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Thanks for some of your time tonight, senator. How are you? CLINTON: I\'m great. Thanks a lot, Keith. OLBERMANN: Let\'s start with something that got remarkably short shrift in last week\'s debate. Is the election in the fall, in your estimation, going to be decided on the price of a gallon of gas and is it not true that a president can\'t really do anything about the price of a gallon of gas? CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s going to be very much influenced by the economy. I don\'t know what else might happen between now and then but it appears to me that the economy is not going to recovery and in fact the price of gas is going to be a big issue. I think oil hit $117 a barrel today which is just unbelievable. When George Bush became president it was $20 a barrel. I do think there are things that we can do in the short run. I would, if I were president, launch an investigation to make sure that there\'s not market manipulation going on. I am still haunted by what we learned during the Enron scandal about those electricity traders manipulating the market and causing the people in California, Oregon and Washington to pay such high prices that were not at all related to supply and demand. I\'d also release some of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That has in the past had a good effect on lowering the cost at least in the short term. And I would do what I could to try to alleviate the cost right now if we could come up with a way to make up for the lost revenue with a gas tax holiday like for example, a windfall profits tax on the oil companies on a basis to try to fill the highway trust fund while we let people off from paying the federal gas taxes. I would consider that. But you\'re right. Ultimately we\'re going to have to have an energy policy that actually moves us from our dependence on foreign oil and being literally over the oil barrel with the oil producing countries and companies. I think if the president were to make a speech tomorrow, Keith, and that\'s the kind of speech I would give right now, that we are finally serious. We\'ve had enough of the problems that come from being so dependent and not looking to ourselves to produce homegrown energy to fuel our vehicles, try to help our auto companies and auto workers, quickly move to higher gas mileage cars and more biofuels and all of the other solutions that are out there, you would see the price drop because I think the companies and the countries that supply our oil would be worried that we actually meant it this time. And they would once again try to lull us into a false sense of security. So I would do all of that and I think it would have an impact and then of course we have to follow through to make sure that we do everything we can to take back control over our own energy destiny. OLBERMANN: You mentioned the oil suppliers and obviously leads us into something else that really flew by during the debate that seemed awfully important. In that debate you were asked about a hypothetical Iranian attack on Israel and your hypothetical response as commander in chief and you said, let me read the quote exactly, ""I think that we should be looking to create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than Israel. Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would include massive retaliation from the United States but I would do the same with other countries in the region."" Can you clarify since there was no follow-up to that which hypothetical Middle East conflicts would incur massive retaliation by this country and what constitutes massive retaliation? CLINTON: Well, what we were talking about was the potential for a nuclear attack by Iran. If Iran does achieve what appears to be its continuing goal of obtaining nuclear weapons and I think deterrence has not been effectively used in recent times. We used it very well during the Cold War when we had a bipolar world and what I think the president should do and what our policy should be is to make it very clear to the Iranians that they would be risking massive retaliation were they to launch a nuclear attack on Israel. In addition, if Iran were to become a nuclear power it could set off an arms race that would be incredibly dangerous and destabilizing because the countries in the region are not going to want Iran to be the only nuclear power so I could imagine that they would be rushing to obtain nuclear weapons themselves. In order to forestall that, creating some kind of a security agreement where we said, no, you do not need to acquire nuclear weapons if you were the subject of an unprovoked nuclear attack by Iran, the United States and hopefully our NATO allies would respond to that as well. It is a theory that some people have been looking at because there is a fear that if Iran, which I hope we can prevent, becoming a nuclear power, but if they were to become one some people worry that they are not deterrable, that they somehow have a different mindset and a worldview that might very well lead the leadership to be willing to become martyrs. I don\'t buy that but I think we have to test it and one of the ways of testing it is to make it very clear that we are not going to permit them if we can prevent it from them becoming a nuclear power but were they to become some their use of nuclear weapons against Israel would provoke a nuclear response from the United States which personally I believe would prevent it from happening and that we would try to help the other countries that might be intimidated and bulled into submission by Iran because they were a nuclear power, avoid that state by creating this new security umbrella. OLBERMANN: Not to equate nuclear conflict or its use as a deterrent to the Pennsylvania primary but that is the other headline, I suppose, of the day. Let me ask you about the campaign and something you said in Pittsburgh today and again, let me read the quote about being president. ""It\'s the toughest job in the world and you have to be ready for anything. Two wars, skyrocketing oil prices, an economy in crisis. Well, if you can\'t take the heat, get out of the kitchen."" That is almost word for word the narration of this new ad that your campaign put out today, and that ad flashes a very brief image of Osama bin Laden. For nearly six years now since Senator Max Cleland was cut down by a commercial that featured a picture of bin Laden, that has been -- that tactic has been kind of a bloody shirt for many Democrats. Is it not just, in your opinion, as much of a scare tactic for a Democrat to use it against another Democrat, as it is for a Republican to use it in a race against the Democrat? CLINTON: Well, first of all, that ad is about leadership, and I obviously believe I do have the leadership experience and qualities to become the president and the commander in chief. And as you said in the beginning, lots of times important issues get short shrift in the back-and-forth in a campaign. But the fact is that the next president will be sworn in at a time of very, very difficult world conditions, and here at home, a lot of challenges. This is one of the most serious elections we\'ve ever had. And as people zero in on the choice they have to make here in Pennsylvania and around the country and the remaining contests and then certainly in the fall, I want people to really understand what a serious decision it is. There is nothing at all that is in any way inappropriate in saying, look, presidents face the unexpected all the time. Katrina was also a part of that ad. We don\'t know what the next president will face. And I like to ask audiences to consider this as a hiring decision. If you were to hire the person you thought was ready on day one to do the toughest job in the world, what would you look for? What kind of resume would you be trying to seek out? I obviously believe that I have a unique set of qualifications and experiences that prepared me for this moment in time. I would not be in this race, Keith, I would not be campaigning hard across Pennsylvania as I have been for the last week if I did not believe I would be the best president of the three of us still in this contest, and that I would be the stronger candidate against John McCain and the Republicans in the fall. And I know that national security will be a prime issue when we get to the fall. I don\'t think anybody will be surprised by that, and no Democrat who wants to win in the fall should be surprised. We\'re going to have to go toe to toe with John McCain on national security. In fact, we\'re going to have to stand up to whatever the Republicans throw our way. And I do think we ought to get real about some of the big issues that we\'re going to face in the White House starting next January and certainly during the campaign leading up to the election of the next president. OLBERMANN: The resumes of all three of you who are in this semi-final round, if you will, of the hiring decision came up over the weekend. Senator Obama said all three of the current presidential candidates -- himself, yourself and Senator McCain -- would be better presidents than is Mr. Bush. You were critical of him for saying that, Senator Obama that is, by saying, ""we need a nominee who will take on John McCain, not cheer on John McCain, and I will be that nominee."" But earlier in this campaign, last month on the 6th of March, you had also said that you thought it was -- and again, this is a direct quote -- ""imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold, and I believe that I\'ve done that. Certainly Senator McCain has done that, and you\'ll have to ask Senator Obama with respect to his candidacy."" To some degree, Senator, in those remarks from last month, hadn\'t you already cheered on Senator McCain at Senator Obama\'s expense? CLINTON: No, not at all. I think that obviously, Senator McCain has military experience. He has a long experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where I served with him. And I think most people in this country would look at his experience in the military and in the Senate, and on national security say he does cross that threshold. The problem is that he has the wrong ideas. He would continue the Bush policies on Iraq, which I think is wrong for the country. And in fact, his statement about his being willing to leave troops in Iraq for up to 100 years is something that I absolutely reject. That would be worse than President Bush. And when it comes to the economy, his policy seems to be more of the same, more of the same failed policies that have brought us to the brink of a recession, that have brought us huge deficits and an exploding debt. And I think that\'s wrong as well. So, you can have a license to practice law, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that somebody should hire you to perform certain services and take on certain cases. And I don\'t think that Senator McCain is the president or commander in chief that we will need. And I don\'t want to in any way say he would be better. It would be hard to be worse than George Bush. I said several years ago I think he is the worse president we\'ve had. And I think you\'ve echoed that sentiment on many occasions on your show. So I don\'t think that he would be better than George Bush. I think he\'s more of the same of President Bush, and I don\'t think the country can afford that. OLBERMANN: President Buchanan\'s supporters are still arguing that point with both of us, but we see eye to eye on it, I think. (LAUGHTER) OLBERMANN: One thing about the -- this has been touched on, I\'d say once an hour during the entire campaign -- this historical nature of both your candidacy and Senator Obama\'s. And it has so many important and positive things for this country. But there\'s a -- necessarily an unfortunate flip side to this. And I\'ve see it in person with some protesters out here on the plaza next to this very studio in the last couple of weeks. Do you believe, as some of them seem to, that criticism of your campaign is necessarily sexism or largely sexism, or sometimes sexism? CLINTON: Well, I think the historic nature of the campaign is causing a lot of cognitive dissonance among so many people, Keith. And a few of them are in the media, I believe, because no matter what happens in this election , the fact that Senator Obama and I are in this close race for the Democratic nomination means that forever forward, every little girl, and every African-American child, will be told that, yes, you too can grow up to be president. I think that is not just historic, I think it\'s wonderful. But there have been, and you\'ve reported on some of them, moments when people have said things, or expressed opinions, that are certainly not mine and certainly not Senator Obama\'s. Speaking for myself, I know that I\'m trying to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling that exists in our country. I take on that challenge willingly and gladly, because I think it\'s the right thing to do. But I also believe that people have to take a look at us individually. And I hope that\'s what they are doing. That they\'re asking themselves who will do the best job under difficult circumstances. And we\'re going to break some real barriers as we already have in this campaign. And I hope that that will push our society beyond some of the remnants of discrimination on the basis of race or gender that we still see from time to time. OLBERMANN: One thing about this particular primary in Pennsylvania -- a lot of us who felt that you and President Clinton were sorely mistreated in the late 90\'s, to say nothing of the Constitution being sorely mistreated thought that the phrase that you introduced to that sad conversation, ""the vast right-wing conspiracy, was pretty apt if not perfect. And we thought -- maybe I\'m just speaking for myself, I don\'t know -- but one of the few utterly unforgivable individuals in that entire equation was Richard Mellon Scaife, among other things is the publisher of the ""Pittsburgh Tribune-Review."" I mean, seriously, to some degree, senator, I quit this job the first time around because of Richard Mellon Scaife and people like him. And I realize you have a primary to win but why on earth did you meet with Richard Mellon Scaife and why did you accept or at least not reject his endorsement of you over the weekend. CLINTON: Well, Keith, nobody was more surprised than I when I was invited to the editorial board and I was very open to meeting - and frankly, I was very curious. I had only once the gentleman once in my life in a receiving line, just in a matter of seconds. Obviously I was on the receiving of quite a bit of his activities during the nineties. Much to everyone\'s dismay, most certainly mine. But I was curious and he has a lot of interesting people who write for that people and work for him. And it was a fascinating question. A lot of give and take. They certainly don\'t agree with me on many of my positions and I was dumbfounded both to have been invited and then to have been endorsed. But I do believe in redemption, Keith, I believe in deathbed conversions and I think it\'s possible for anyone to see the error of their ways. So I\'m bringing people together as we speak. Anyone who doubts my ability to bridge the most incredible chasms can point to those recent remarks. OLBERMANN: I\'ll leave the remark about the deathbed conversion when there\'s more time. Senator Clinton, thank you for your time and safe travels. CLINTON: Thank you. It\'s great to talk with you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 21, 2008",b'Interview with Larry King',"b'LARRY KING, HOST: Tonight, Senator Hillary Clinton -- her eleventh hour campaign on the eve of a crucial primary...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for you, but, of course, I have to win. And that really depends upon what happens on Tuesday in the Pennsylvania primary.(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: One-on-one with the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, right now, on LARRY KING LIVE.Good evening.We welcome to LARRY KING LIVE, from the capital of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Senator Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate.What a run this has been.Lots of things to cover tonight, Senator.We\'ll start, though -- we did a survey. And the number-one problem Americans say they\'re faced with is gas prices.If that\'s true, what can a president -- you, President Bush -- do about it?CLINTON: Well, Larry, it\'s great to be on your show. And thanks for giving me this chance to be with you, even though I wish I were there in the studio with you, as we have on so many occasions in the past.KING: Me, too.CLINTON: And everywhere I go across Pennsylvania -- I\'m in Harrisburg right now. About 10 days ago, I met with some independent truckers who are going to forced out of business if these gas prices continue to rise.Yesterday, I was in Johnstown, introduced by a man who said he didn\'t know what he was going to do because his truck had cost $100 to fill up. And it is becoming a huge economic crisis for most Americans.Here\'s what I would do if I were president right now.Number one, I would investigate these prices. I\'m not satisfied at all that there isn\'t any manipulation going on or price-gouging. I still remember during the Enron scandals finding out that there were traders in energy who were deliberately manipulating the market so that consumers in California, Oregon and Washington paid higher electricity prices.I would also release some of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would help bring down the price. It usually does.I would also consider a gas tax holiday, if we could make up the lost revenues from the Highway Trust Fund. And my suggestion would be a windfall profits tax on the oil companies. They\'ve been making record profits in the last years.But I would also do something else. As president, I would make it absolutely clear that the United States was not going to be over the oil barrel any longer, that we were going to get serious about energy independence.You see, I think, Larry, if we did that, if our president said that tomorrow and really meant it and worked with Congress to pass every piece of legislation we needed, that he has so far resisted supporting, the oil companies and the oil countries would drop the price, because they would want to lull us back into a false sense of security...KING: So...CLINTON: ...so that maybe we wouldn\'t follow through. But this time, we must follow through.KING: So all of the above?CLINTON: Yes, sir, all of the above. And it could be done tomorrow if the president were willing.KING: OK. You\'re using Osama bin Laden -- at least he\'s flashed on the screen -- in a new campaign ad.Let\'s look at a bit of it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN AD) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It\'s the toughest job in the world. You need to be ready for anything. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Now, we saw bin Laden there.Barack Obama says that you\'re practicing the politics of fear. How do you respond to that? CLINTON: Well, I am talking in that ad about the reality, that the next president will inherit some of the most dangerous and difficult decisions that any president has had to make in a very long time. And I think it\'s important that we have an election that asks people to consider who they would hire for the toughest job in the world. We\'ve got two wars. We have to end the war in Iraq and we need to win the war in Afghanistan. We\'ve got these spiraling oil costs that are really hurting people, an economy that\'s in crisis. I don\'t think there\'s any doubt in anyone\'s mind that whoever we elect has to be ready to take on these decisions. And we don\'t know what else might be out there waiting.And I want people to think seriously about leadership, because that\'s what I\'m offering in this campaign. I think I\'m ready. I have a unique set of qualifications that will prepare me to step into that Oval Office and, on day one, be the commander-in-chief we need to end the war in Iraq and to be the president to turn the economy around.KING: How do you respond, Senator, to the complaints that the campaign -- both campaigns, in a sense -- have gotten so negative?Robert Reich, the former Labor secretary in your husband\'s administration, a longtime friend of yours, is one of the people who says that he\'s now backing Obama.Here\'s what he told CNN. I\'d be interested in your comment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT REICH, FORMER SECRETARY OF LABOR: But this crescendo of negative mudslinging from the Clinton camp, diverting attention from the big issues this country faces. I just thought, I can\'t be silent any longer. I\'ve got to take a stand and I\'ve got to follow my conscience.(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Did that hurt you?CLINTON: Well, I don\'t think that he\'s followed the campaign very closely, because, clearly, there has been a relentless series of attacks coming from the other side.I\'ve spent the vast majority of this campaign giving very specific speeches about the solutions that I offer on all of the important issues facing our country. And, in fact, the press that covers me on a regular basis, I think, is kind of bored, because I just talk about solutions and what we\'re going to do to get more jobs and get health care for everyone and make sure we have a clean, renewable energy future and all of the other concerns that voters talk to me about.But in the last, you know, couple of weeks, Senator Obama\'s campaign has become increasingly negative. He says one thing on the stump and his campaign does something else.I\'d like nothing better than to stay focused on the differences between our health care plans. I have a plan that will get to universal health care and cover everyone and he doesn\'t.I have a plan to end the home foreclosure crisis and I don\'t think his measures up.So I would be really pleased to talk about a lot of the hard questions that are going to face the next president. But, you know, in a campaign, it does get sometimes back-and-forth. Actually, I think this has been, on balance, a pretty civil and positive campaign, compared to many that we\'ve seen in the last years. And it is fair to compare and contrast the differences between us. And voters get to make up their own minds about, you know, who they can count on to make the very difficult decisions and bring about the positive results we need.KING: It may be perception then.We have an e-mail from Collins in Riverview, Florida, who says: ""I\'ve noticed you started with the negative ads once you fell behind in the nomination race. So my question is, do you think you\'d be in contention at this point if you had not gone negative?""Now, you don\'t think you\'ve gone negative.Would you agree that a lot of the public thinks you have?CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know what the public thinks. But I certainly believe that any fair reading of this campaign, the kinds of things that my opponent\'s campaign has said, the kind of ads that they and their allies have run, the sort of phone calls and mailings -- remember in Ohio, I had to call them out on the misleading, negative mailings that they were sending out about my health care plan and about my position to change and fix NAFTA.And I think the people of Ohio took a hard look at who was being misleading and who wasn\'t, and that\'s why I won such an overwhelming vote in Ohio.So I can imagine the people who only, you know, follow it from, you know, some of the snippets on TV might, you know, not be sure exactly who\'s saying what and what the campaigns are doing.But the people in the states where we\'re competing who follow it very, very closely, I think, are well aware of, you know, who is running what kind of ads and the fact that Senator Obama is outspending me three or four to one and, you know, literally just running ads around the clock. You know, that\'s all part of the campaign. And at the end of the day, voters get to decide who they think would be best suited to do the tough job that the next president will face.KING: And a big part of that decision will happen tomorrow.Senator Clinton will be here right after the break, where we are just getting...CLINTON: That\'s right.KING: ...that\'s a big one tomorrow.We\'re just getting started.Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: You\'re electing a president to solve problems, not to give speeches. And that should be what we\'re focused on.(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: The very tough Senator Hillary Clinton on the stump in Pennsylvania. The campaign -- the primary is tomorrow.Some say, Senator -- I almost said Hillary, because I\'ve known you such a long time.(LAUGHTER)KING: I left out the ""Senator"".CLINTON: Ha-ha! We\'ve known each other a long time, Larry. That\'s all right.KING: That this campaign has been so rough that whoever wins, it\'s going to be a Pyhrric victory; that the winner is going to lose in November because you knocked each other around so much.A good chance of that?CLINTON: Oh, I don\'t think so at all. Again, by any historic standard, Larry, this has been a very civil and positive campaign. I know we both have very intense supporters and people take this campaign incredibly personally. But at the end of the day, we\'re going to have a unified Democratic Party. Whatever differences there are between my opponent and myself pale in comparison to the differences we have with Senator McCain and the Republicans.And the important question for Democrats is who is stronger to actually go up against John McCain in the fall, because I believe that the Democratic Party, the people who have turned out and voted, will fall in behind our nominee. And then it will be up to the nominee to make the case against a very tough candidate.There is no doubt in my mind that the Republicans are not going to give up the White House without a terrific fight. And I happen to believe that I\'m better suited to go up against Senator McCain. But I\'ve said on many occasions, I\'m going to do whatever I can do to make sure we have a Democratic president in the White House next January. KING: In a recent debate -- in fact, you reiterated it ""yes, yes, yes,"" that you thought Barack Obama could defeat McCain.Is he better prepared than McCain?CLINTON: Well, I think he can win, but I think I will win. I really believe that or I wouldn\'t be sitting here talking to you...KING: But is he better prepared?CLINTON: ... From Harrisburg.Well, I think that he would be...KING: Is he a better prepared candidate?CLINTON: Well, that\'s going to be up to the voters to try to sort through. Lots of what Senator McCain is saying is just wrong for the country. So it doesn\'t really matter what credentials he\'s offering. And, obviously, he has very extraordinary credentials, with his military service and his service in the Senate.But the bottom line is that his policies are wrong for America. I don\'t think we want to continue George Bush\'s policy in Iraq. And I sure don\'t think we want to follow along with what Senator McCain said, that he\'d be happy if we had to have troops in Iraq for the next 100 years, if that\'s what it took.And I sure don\'t believe that people want to continue George Bush\'s economic policies, which have brought us these skyrocketing gas prices and increasing costs for everything and stagnant wages for most middle-class Americans.So Senator McCain certainly will play up his credentials and he has every right to do so. That\'s who he is. But at the end of the day, I want this election in the fall to be not a personality contest. It should be about what this person will do come the time when they\'re sworn in as the president.Remember, a lot of people may have been taken in by George Bush back in 2000. He ran as a compassionate conservative. And I\'m not sure people really understood or even knew what that meant. And many people have been sorely disappointed at the outcome.Well, this election in the fall needs to be between the Republican and the Democratic candidate, toe-to-toe on national security, taking them to task over the economy, standing up for universal health care, talking about the issues that matter here at home and around the world. And I believe that I am the better candidate to do that.KING: Senator McCain said, by the way, on this program, that he\'s a good friend of yours.Is that true?Are you friendly in the Senate and out of the Senate?CLINTON: We are friends. Yes, I deeply respect Senator McCain and his service and patriotism. We\'ve gone to Iraq and Afghanistan together. We\'ve worked on behalf of a sensible policy to deal with global warming. So I enjoy his company.And when I\'m president, I\'m going to ask him to come over to the White House quite often and take trips with me, because he has a perspective. I don\'t agree with it and I think that he\'s the wrong person to be president at this time, but we\'re friends and we\'ll remain friends.KING: Are you saying if you\'re president, you would use Senator McCain?CLINTON: Well, I\'m going to reach out to Republicans, all kinds of Republicans, because I think it\'s important that we try to have a bipartisan foreign policy. I have very strong convictions about what we should do, but I\'m going to listen and enlist Republicans, as well as Democrats -- not only elected ones, but distinguished Americans of both parties.We have a lot of repair work to do in the world. And as president, I would ask people to, you know, really help me restore American leadership. I\'d like to have a bipartisan foreign policy. I think it\'s been unfortunate that the president and the vice president have been so partisan in their pursuit, wrongly, of the goals that they have had in foreign policy.So a lot of people in the Senate that I don\'t agree with on many issues will have -- and at different settings and on different concerns -- a lot to contribute to America.KING: So maybe a Republican or two in the cabinet?CLINTON: I think we should look at that. We need to try to have a bipartisan government. We\'ve got to restore confidence and competence to the American government.KING: During...CLINTON: You know, the American people actually have to believe that their president can solve problems for them. That\'s why I\'ve spent so much time in this campaign talking about being a problem solver and a change maker, somebody with a proven track record of experience in doing that.KING: All right. During the campaign, Senator, you\'ve constantly touted yourself as the candidate with experience, been through fire, knows how Washington works.Senator Obama frames your experience this way.Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Here is, essentially, Senator Clinton\'s argument. Her basic argument in this election -- and it\'s become clearer as time goes on -- is that you can\'t really change Washington. You can\'t really change the say anything, do anything, special interest driven game in Washington. And because you can\'t change it, you might as well select somebody who knows how to play the game better because they\'ve been at the game longer. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Does he have a point, that you -- can you change the system you\'ve been a part of for 20 years? CLINTON: Well, I think that most of our great presidents who actually produced transformational change have been involved in the political life of our country. You know, Senator Obama was in the state senate about three and a half years ago. And I was in the Senate of the United States, working on a lot of these issues. I represent change. The fact that I am, as a woman, competing to become the president of the United States would be an extraordinary change.But it\'s also more than that, Larry. I\'ve taken on the special interests. It\'s easy to talk about it and to give speeches, but I was there 15 years ago fighting for universal health care. And I still am. I was there when we helped to form the Children\'s Health Insurance Program and took on the insurance companies and had the drug companies have to finally agree to test drugs for kids, instead of just having them prescribed.You know, I took on the Bush White House over health care for National Guard and Reserve members. And on so many issues, I\'ve been on the front lines of making change.I think I know exactly what it will take, because I do have this unique experience, having been in the White House, having served a full term and then reelected with 67 percent of the vote, because I served the people of New York, who gave me the chance to go to the Senate, I think gives me a perspective that is essential.KING: I\'ve got to...CLINTON: You know, I wish it were that easy, to show up in Washington and say, let\'s get everybody together and we\'re all just going to change because the president wants us to. That\'s not the way it\'s ever worked. Not the way it will work.But I have a proven record of getting bipartisan legislation through the Senate as a first lady, as someone who understands what it\'s going to take.KING: I\'ve got to...CLINTON: And I think that counts for a lot.KING: We\'ve got to get a break.We\'re not finished just yet. We\'ve got some more to ask Senator Clinton ahead on LARRY KING LIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: We\'re back with Senator Clinton.If the level of violence in Iraq, Senator, is the same or worse, say, in January of next year, would you still advocate your plan of phased redeployment?CLINTON: I would, Larry, because I don\'t think anyone can predict the future. We don\'t know what the consequence of any of our actions will be in Iraq. One thing I\'m confident of, however, is staying there is not the right decision for America. Our military is stretched thin. We have given the Iraqis the precious gift of freedom. Our young men and women have performed heroically.The Iraqis have not stepped up and taken responsibility, as we had hoped; that they would begin to make those decisions that only they can make for themselves.And by our staying in Iraq, we are losing ground elsewhere in the world. Our military and foreign policy experts have all said that we have lost ground in Afghanistan. The Middle East is in a much more dangerous position than it was. We have all kinds of problems, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. China and Russia are reasserting their positions in the world. We are not moving to really take the global leadership that America must take for our own security and for the stability of the rest of the world.As we begin to withdraw our troops, I believe that will help to focus the Iraqis, unlike the blank checks that President Bush has given them. And that they will have to understand that we are not going to be there to save them, protect them, to step in for them.And we\'ll also have to engage in very vigorous diplomatic efforts with the other countries in the region that have a big stake in a stable Iraq.So, yes, I am committed to doing it responsibly...KING: All right...CLINTON: ...carefully. But I will begin to withdraw troops within 60 days.KING: How are you going to do tomorrow?CLINTON: Well, I hope I do well. I never make predictions. I\'ve campaigned hard. We\'ve been all over the state. I think people have worked extremely hard for me and I hope to do well. Obviously, it\'s important for me. But I think it\'s also important for my opponent. He should try to win this state, which he\'s been doing, because he knows he hasn\'t won any big state except his own. And I think that\'s important for Democrats -- who\'s won the big states, who\'s been there to put together the electoral map that we need to win in the fall.KING: If you...CLINTON: He has yet to close the deal on those big states.KING: Senator, if you win it, say, by 5 percent or less, will that be a measuring stick?There are those who will say, then, you should leave the race if you\'re that close in Pennsylvania.(LAUGHTER)KING: Or you don\'t look at that?CLINTON: Well, I sure don\'t, Larry. A win is a win. But, again, I think this is such a close race. And neither of us has the delegates we need to get the nomination. We\'ve got nine more contests after Pennsylvania, some very important states that are still up to bat. And I think we\'re going to go all the way through this process and see where we stand in June.We also, don\'t forget, have to decide how we\'re going to seat the delegates from Florida and Michigan. 2.3 million people voted. I don\'t want to disenfranchise either of those states. They\'re also critical to an electoral victory for a Democrat.You know, they say that the path to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue goes through Pennsylvania. And if I\'m fortunate enough to win tomorrow, that will be yet another state that I have won in, being outspent dramatically by my opponent, and have been able to put together the coalition that is really going to be the base of our campaign against John McCain in the fall.KING: So what you\'re saying unequivocally tonight is that you\'re not prepared to lose at all? You\'re going right through June, you\'re going to Denver?CLINTON: Well, I\'m going until we get Florida and Michigan resolved. I\'m going until everybody has had a chance to vote in this process. I\'m going until the automatic delegates have made their judgments, based on their independent assessments, as to who of us would be better against John McCain in the fall and who would be the best president for our country.KING: Have you enjoyed this?CLINTON: I really have. I have really enjoyed it. It is grueling. There\'s no doubt about that. But every day something happens that just lifts my spirits. You know, this morning, I started in Scranton, Larry. And there was a man, a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. And the people he lived with had brought him to my event. He\'s been in a wheelchair for 30 years. And it\'s the first time he\'s ever registered to vote, so that he could vote for me.And when somebody tells me that, no matter how tired I am, no matter how difficult the challenges are, I know I\'m doing the right thing.KING: Yes.CLINTON: Because these are the people that I want to go to the White House and fight for. You know, a lot of Americans really need a fighter and a champion on their side. And that\'s what I\'m offering and that\'s what I\'m prepared to do.KING: If events don\'t turn your way and you\'re not the nominee, would you and President Clinton campaign vigorously for Senator Obama?CLINTON: Without a doubt. We\'re going to do everything we can to make sure a Democrat is elected president. That is the ultimate goal here, to have a Democrat sworn in next January.We\'ll have a Democratic nominee. We\'ll have a unified Democratic Party. I\'ll work my heart out to make sure that we have a Democratic victory.KING: Senator, thank you so much.Always good seeing you.CLINTON: It\'s great to talk to you.KING: And we hope our next interview will be in person.CLINTON: It will be, Larry.KING: The next one together.CLINTON: I\'m looking forward to it.Thank you so much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 22, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Pennsylvania Primary',"b'Thank you so much. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Oh, thank you. It\'s a long road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and it runs right through the heart of Pennsylvania. For six weeks Senator Obama and I have crisscrossed this state, meeting people up close, being judged side by side, making our best case. You listened and today you chose. With two wars abroad and an economic crisis here at home, you know the stakes are high and the challenges are great, but you also know the possibilities. Those possibilities are endless, if we roll up our sleeves and get to work with a president who is ready to lead on day one. That means ready to take charge as Commander-in-Chief and make this economy work for middle class families. And I thank you. I thank you, Pennsylvania, for deciding I can be that president. For me, the victory we share tonight is deeply personal. It was here in Pennsylvania where my grandfather started work as a boy in the lace mills and ended up as a supervisor five decades later. It was here where my father attended college and played football for Penn State. And I am back here tonight because of their hard work and sacrifice. And I only wish they could have lived to see this moment, because in this election I carry with me not just their dreams, but the dreams of people like them and like you all across our country - people who embrace hard work and opportunity, who never waver in the face of adversity, who stand for what you believe and never stop believing in the promise of America. I\'m in this race to fight for you, to fight for everyone who has ever been counted out, for everyone fighting to pay the grocery bills or the medical bills, the credit card and mortgage payments, and the outrageous price of gas at the pump today. You know, the pundit\'s question whether Pennsylvanians would trust me with this charge and tonight you showed you do. You know you can count on me to stand up strong for you every single day in the White House. This has been a historic race and I commend Senator Obama and his supporters tonight. We are, in many ways, all on this journey together to create an America that embraces every last one of us. The women in their nineties who tell me they were born before women could vote and they\'re hopeful of seeing a woman in the White House. The mothers and fathers at my events, who lift their little girls on their shoulders and whisper in their ears, ""see, you can be anything you want."" Tonight, more than ever, I need your help to continue this journey. This is your campaign and this is your victory tonight. Your support has meant the difference between winning and losing. We can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively. So, I hope you\'ll go to HillaryClinton.com and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands. Some people counted me out and said to drop out, but the American people don\'t quit and they deserve a president who doesn\'t quit either. Tonight all across Pennsylvania and America, teachers are grading papers and doctors and nurses are caring for the sick, and you deserve a leader who listens to you. Waitresses are pouring coffee and police officers are standing guard and small businesses are working to meet that payroll, and you deserve a champion who stands with you. And of course, all across the world, our men and women in uniform, some on your second, third or fourth tour of duty, you deserve a Commander-in-Chief who will finally bring you home and who will rebuild our strained military, do whatever it takes to care for our veterans wounded in both body and spirit. Today, here in Pennsylvania, you made your voices heard and because of you, the tide is turning. We were up against a formidable opponent who outspent us three to one. He broke every spending record in this state trying to knock us out of the race. Well, the people of Pennsylvania had other ideas tonight. The presidency is the toughest job in the world, but the pressures of a campaign are nothing compared to the pressures of the White House, and today, Pennsylvanians looked through all the heat and saw the light of a brighter tomorrow - a tomorrow of shared prosperity and restored world leadership for peace, security, and cooperation. After seven long years of President Bush, we\'ve got our work cut out for us and we don\'t have a minute to waste. So, it\'s high time we stop talking about our problems and start solving them and that is what my campaign is all about. All through this campaign, I have offered solutions: solutions for good jobs you can raise a family on; jobs that can\'t be shipped overseas; and on Earth Day, clean, renewable green jobs that can put us on the right track to the future; solutions for independence from foreign oil and exploding gas prices; quality affordable healthcare not just for many Americans or most Americans but for every single American, no exceptions and no excuses; affordable college and real improvements in public schools, not the failure that is No Child Left Behind. We\'re going to end the war on science and have a renewed commitment to science and research. We will tackle everything from Autism to Alzheimer\'s, cancer to diabetes, and make a real difference. I look forward to discussing all of these issues with the people of Indiana, North Carolina and the states that I\'ll be visiting in the coming weeks. Not long ago a woman handed me a photograph of her father as a young soldier. He was receiving the Medal of Honor from President Truman at the White House. During World War II, he had risked his life on a daring mission to drive back the enemy and protect his fellow soldiers. In the corner of that photo, in shaky handwriting, this American hero had simply written: ""To Hillary Clinton, keep fighting for us."" And that is what I\'m going to do because America is worth fighting for. You are worth fighting for. It was in this city that our founders declared America\'s independence and our permanent mission to form a more perfect union. Neither Senator Obama nor I nor many of you were fully included in that vision, but we\'ve been blessed by men and women in each generation who saw America not as it is, but as it could and should be. The abolitionists and the suffragists, the progressives and the union members, the civil rights leaders, all those who marched, protested and risked their lives because they looked into their children\'s eyes and saw the promise of a better future. Because of them, I grew up taking for granted that women could vote. Because of them, my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could attend school together. And because of them and because of you, this next generation will grow up taking for granted that a woman or an African American can be the president of the United States of America. I am so honored by the support and the hospitality of all of the people of Pennsylvania. I want to especially thank Governor Rendell and Mayor Nutter, Lieutenant Governor Catherine Baker Knoll and the State Treasurer Robin Wiessmann and State Party Chair T.J. Rooney. These are great leaders and dear friends, as are my friends from the Congress, Representatives Murtha, Sestak, Schwartz and Kanjorski. Their support means the world to me and the support of 100 mayors across this commonwealth and so many other state and local leaders who worked hard for this victory tonight. I want to thank my friends in our labor unions for standing with us every step of the way. And my outstanding staff, volunteers and supporters here in Pennsylvania and across America. I especially want to thank my family for their incredible love and support. Bill and Chelsea have crisscrossed Pennsylvania from one end to the other. My brothers Hugh and Tony who love Pennsylvania with all their hearts, from our childhood summers in Lake Winola, and my mother who is with us tonight. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but if you\'re ready, I\'m ready. I might stumble and I might get knocked down, but as long as you\'ll stand with me I will always get right back up. Because for me, in the end, the question isn\'t whether we can keep America\'s promise, it\'s whether we will keep America\'s promise. So let me ask you tonight - will we once again be the can-do nation, the nation that defies the odds and does the impossible? Will we break the barriers and open the doors and lift up all of our people? Will we reach out to the world and lead by the power of our ideals again? Will we take back the White House and take back our country? I believe with all of my heart that together we will turn promises into action, words will become solutions, hope will become reality, so my answer to any who doubt is ""yes, we will."" Thank you and God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 30, 2008","b'Excerpts of Hillary Clinton\'s Interview on the ""Bob and Tom"" Show'","b'In her morning interview with the ""Bob and Tom"" show, Hillary Clinton described her commute to work with a sheet metal worker, her approach to rising gas prices, and her readiness to be Commander in Chief,Excerpts and links for audio follow below.  **[Click here] for audio.** Q: I\'m curious Senator, on the campaign trail; exactly how much sleep are you getting each night? Hillary: Not enough. The closer you get to  good morning! You know, I\'m in a truck in Indiana, we just pulled up to the Indiana toll road booth, we just put gas in the truck. We\'re trying to draw a lot of attention to how much more costly it is to do anything in life anymore, especially fill up your tank or drive to work. So I am with this wonderful young man, I am just saying hello to the tollbooth attendant, how are you today? Tollbooth attendant: Good, how are you? Hillary: Excellent, nice to meet you. Tollbooth attendant: Nice to meet you! Hillary: Thank you! She\'s got a big smile on her face Q: You still owe her a quarter, come on. They don\'t care if you are a senator, Mrs. Clinton. Hillary: You\'re not supposed to tell anybody! --- **[Click here] for audio. **  Q: I admire all of you candidates for putting up with them. I don\'t know how you can even live your life with all of the constant criticism. And you\'re taking on a big role  do you really think that when you wake up in the morning that you really want to do this, you want to be the president? Because it\'s going to be a really tough thing to fix when you get in there, if you do get in there. HRC: Boy, are you right. First of all, it\'s the toughest job in the world anytime, it\'s going to be especially tough given what we will inherit. We\'ve got two wars, we\'ve got an economy in trouble, we\'ve got gas prices exploding. You go down the line and people are really wondering what happens next? Our country is not headed in the right direction. But I do get up everyday more determined than ever, because I meet somebody everyday like this wonderful young man and his family that I am driving to work with who get up everyday and they go into work and they deal with all of the challenges that they have. And sometimes it\'s pretty daunting when I meet someone with a chronic illness or who has just lost their job and can\'t find another one, and I just want to get in there and start cleaning it up and trying to get us to solve our problems again. So yeah, I\'m fired up, I\'m ready and I think people are ready. --- **[Click here] for audio.**  Q: Senator Clinton, if you are, when you are elected president, do you think you are going to be even more under the microscope as president, since you\'ll be the first female president, than if, say, John McCain were elected and had to take on all of these horrible issues that face our country? Hillary: I\'m sure that it will continue to be very high scrutiny, but it will be about the real challenges facing our country. People will be asking what am I doing to fix the economy or how am I getting us out of Iraq. That\'s what we should be focusing on. But all the rest of it comes with the territory these days. I am used to it  if you can\'t stand the heat, you\'ve got to get out of the kitchen because as Harry Truman said, this is a pretty hot kitchen when you get to Washington, D.C., especially if you are the president. But I hope that we can try to stay focused on what is really happening in people\'s lives, like today with these gas prices. One of the reporters in South Bend, where I am, said that prices went up 20 cents overnight  this makes no sense to me. That\'s why I want to go after the oil companies and their outrageous profits. And I want to go after OPEC, they are not a free market, they set the price, they determine how much supply there is. And I think we need a president who is willing to take on these tough fights again. And we really are going to have to pull our country together to make life better for middle class families because everybody I talk to in Indiana and North Carolina, around our country, is really feeling the stress. Q: I think we should shoot for gas prices the same as they were during the Truman... Hillary: I\'m not sure if any of you were alive back then, but... Q: I was. Hillary:: Were you? I remember the days when my late father would load us in the car after church and we would wander around looking for the lowest price of gas. We would spend all afternoon just driving in the country, okay, 22 cents, 20 cents, but I heard there was somebody at 19 cents. Well, those days are gone. But when George Bush became president, oil was $20 a barrel. Now it is $120 a barrel. Q: I remember my dad calling a family meeting when gas reached 33 cents a gallon. He said, ""No one is driving anymore!"" Hillary: I had the same kind of dad. Q: Our guest is Hillary Clinton, I know you have to go, Mrs. Clinton. One last sort of semi-silly question. Do you get a chance to drive a car anymore? When is the last time you got to be by yourself and drive a while and think? Hillary: No, I don\'t because obviously I have Secret Service protection and I rarely even get to sit in the front seat. The best part of what I am doing right now is I am sitting in the front seat. You can\'t imagine what that feels like. Q: You\'ve got to yell shotgun, Senator. Hillary: I\'m shotgun! I\'m hoping to convince this wonderful young man that we\'re going to drive by his work place; we\'re going to go out and just drive around for a few hours. Q: Senator, Thanks for your time, best of luck and I hope you find some cheap gas today. I don\'t think you will. Good luck. Hillary: I don\'t think it\'s going to happen. That\'s why I am trying to get the oil companies to pay the gas tax for the summer. Let them have to bear the cost. Q: Thanks for calling. Hillary: Great to talk to you, bye bye.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 3, 2008","b'Remarks in Wake Forest, North Carolina'","b'Hillary Clinton delivered the following remarks at a ""Get Out the Vote"" event today in Wake Forest, NC:'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 4, 2008","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b'STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to Indianapolis. We are here in the Conrad Hotel with about 200 voters, armed with questions for Sen. Clinton. It is a diverse group. We pulled it together with the help of local colleges, civic and political organizations. It\'s a mix of Obama supporters, Clinton supporters and undecided voters, including independents and Republicans. We\'re also joined by a similar, somewhat smaller group in North Carolina, who have gathered at ABC\'s affiliate in Raleigh, Durham, WTVD. We asked everyone to bring a question. I\'ve gone through all of the questions. I have a lot of questions of my own as well. And for any who don\'t know, I worked for President [Bill] Clinton, from 1991 to 1996. And with that, let me welcome Sen. Clinton. CLINTON: How are you, George? STEPHANOPOULOS: I am doing well. Thanks for being here. CLINTON: Welcome to Indianapolis. STEPHANOPOULOS: Good to be here. Gas tax has become the defining issue in this primary and in North Carolina. You and Sen. John McCain called for suspending the 18.4 cent federal gas tax. Sen. [Barack] Obama calls it a gimmick. He says it\'s pandering. He says it won\'t really bring any help to consumers, and he also said this. ... What\'s your response? He says you\'re not being truthful. CLINTON: Well, No. 1, my proposal is very different from Sen. McCain. Sen. McCain has said take off the gas tax, don\'t pay for it, throw us further into deficit and debt. That is not what I\'ve proposed. What I\'ve proposed is that the oil companies pay the gas tax instead of consumers and drivers this summer. Now, why am I proposing this? Well, No. 1, I am absolutely convinced that these record profits of the oil companies are a result of a number of factors beyond supply and demand. I think there has been market manipulation. In fact, Exxon Mobil official testifying under oath before the House of Representatives committee said that if it were just market factors, then the price of oil would be like $50 or $55 a barrel. We know that there\'s market manipulation going on. So I would launch an investigation if I were president right now by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. I would also quit buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We\'re 97 percent full. We don\'t need to keep buying it at these prices, and I would release some. I would begin to go directly at OPEC. I think it\'s been 25 years where we\'ve, you know, largely just been at the mercy of the OPEC countries. But this gas tax issue to me is very real, because I am meeting people across Indiana and North Carolina who drive for a living, who commute long distances, who would save money if the oil companies paid this $8 billion this summer, instead of it coming out of the pockets of consumers. STEPHANOPOULOS: Economists say that\'s not going to happen. They say this is going to go straight into the profits of the oil companies. They\'re not going to actually lower their prices. And the two top leaders in the House are against it. Nearly every editorial board and economist in the country has come out against it. Even a supporter of yours, Paul Krugman of The New York Times, calls it pointless and disappointing. Can you name one economist, a credible economist who supports the suspension? CLINTON: Well, you know, George, I think we\'ve been for the last seven years seeing a tremendous amount of government power and elite opinion basically behind policies that haven\'t worked well for the middle class and hard-working Americans. From the moment I started this campaign, I\'ve said that I am absolutely determined that we\'re going to reverse the trends that have been going on in our government and in our political system, because what I have seen is that the rich have gotten richer. A vast majority -- I think something like 90 percent -- of the wealth gains over the last seven years have gone to the top 10 percent of wage earners in America. STEPHANOPOULOS: But can you name an economist who thinks this makes sense? CLINTON: Well, I\'ll tell you what, I\'m not going to put my lot in with economists, because I know if we get it right, if we actually did it right, if we had a president who used all the tools of the presidency, we would design it in such a way that it would be implemented effectively. Now, look, I have long-term plans too. I mean, it\'s a misnomer to say this is all that I\'m doing. It\'s not. I have a comprehensive long-term energy plan that would go right at dependence on foreign oil. We\'ve got to undermine this incredible addiction that we have. We use more foreign oil today than we did on 9/11. That is a disaster for America. Also that we\'ve got to move toward more alternative and renewable fuels, and get out gas mileage up. You know, increase those standards. STEPHANOPOULOS: But that\'s one of the problems here. You\'ve already spent, according to our research, the windfall profits tax on this strategic energy fund for renewable energies and alternative energies. CLINTON: No, the tax subsidies -- the tax subsidies will go right into that. I\'m talking about something temporary this summer. My longer-term plan is, yes, to put an excess profits tax on the oil companies above a certain level of profit that would go in to help us make the transition. But let\'s step back here a minute, George. You know, it\'s really odd to me that arguing to give relief to the vast majority of Americans creates this incredible pushback. When the federal government, through the Fed and the Treasury, gave $30 billion in a bailout to Bear Stearns, I didn\'t hear anybody jump up and say, ""that\'s not going according to the market. That\'s rewarding irresponsible behavior."" We\'ve got to get out of this mindset where somehow elite opinion is always on the side of doing things that really disadvantage the vast majority of Americans, and get back at looking hard at what we\'re going to do to stop the housing crisis. You know, for months now, I\'ve been saying we need a moratorium on home foreclosures and we need to freeze interest rates. I think that would help us stem what\'s happening in not just the housing market, but the general decline in the economy. Well, we can\'t get that through the Congress either. And on health care, on so many of these issues where costs have gone up, where people are really feeling squeezed, there just doesn\'t seem to be an understanding about what people are going through. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me go to one of the voters who\'s feeling squeezed. Kara Glennan [phonetic spelling] is here. Kara is a Democrat. She\'s supporting Obama. I think you\'ve contributed $25 to him. What\'s your question on the gas tax? VOTER QUESTION: I have -- Sen. Clinton, I actually make less than $25,000 a year, so talking about gas prices is not academic for me. I really do feel pain at the pump. However, I do feel pandered to when you talk about suspending the gas tax. I don\'t think that it\'s really a reasonable plan, and call me crazy, but I actually listen to economists, because I think that they know what they studied. You say that you have both a short- and a long-term plan for our energy consumption. However, since the suspension of the gas tax would encourage continued overconsumption, which could possibly cancel out any price savings and also undermine our efforts to curb global warming, and your long-term plan includes trying to, say, curb global warming, don\'t you feel that these two plans are in conflict? CLINTON: No. And let me stand up, because I can see you better from this angle. You know, actually, I\'m glad you asked this question, because I want to make it very clear that we\'re talking about short-term relief and a long-term plan. And I have a very comprehensive, long-term plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, increase the mileage of our automobiles, and to do it in a way that will push us forward as a leader in the world again, which we have not been, on the issue of global warming. And I invite everyone to go to my Web site, HillaryClinton.com, and read about it. But if you are driving on average in America this summer, you\'ll save -- according to Department of Energy figures -- about $70. If you are a long-distance commuter, and a lot of people in Indiana and North Carolina are, if you are a truck driver who depends upon your truck for your living, you\'re going to save a lot more. In fact, truckers will save about $2 billion in fuel costs. You see, I really believe we\'ve got to start right now demonstrating a willingness to take on these oil companies. I voted against the big oil giveaway in the 2005 energy bill. My opponent voted for it. I\'m on record as taking on the oil companies. And I think having a good debate, like we\'re having right now in this campaign, helps to lay the groundwork for what we\'re going to need to do. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sen. Clinton, let me bring this back to Sen. Obama and what he said there. He said you weren\'t being truthful. And that seems to be going straight at the Achilles heel of your campaign. Our recent poll showed six out of 10 voters think you\'re dishonest. That\'s a heavy burden to carry into the general election. What do you say to Democrats who are worried about that? CLINTON: Well, obviously, it\'s troubling that people would have that opinion, because I think most of the people who have voted for me and support me in New York -- and I was reelected with 67 percent of the vote -- believe they can count on me. And they have good reason to count on me, because I\'ve gotten up year after year, going back many years, to stand up for controversial issues, like health care for every American, something that I feel passionately about. So have I drawn a lot of fire from people who have come right at me and, frankly, you know, done a lot of attacking of me? Sure. But I think that goes with being a leader. You see, I just have a fundamental disagreement about how you get change in America. I wish that we could all just get together and decide we\'re going to make change. I wish that were the case. But maybe I know enough about human nature and about our political system to understand, you really have to take these interests on. They do not go gently into the night. STEPHANOPOULOS: But don\'t voters have to trust you as you\'re taking these interests on? CLINTON: Well, the voters of New York have trusted me twice, and I think that people throughout this campaign, as I have campaigned across Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, North Carolina, have seen me in person, as opposed to what they hear about me. And I know you hear a lot about me. There is a lot out there that, you know, I have no control over. But if you really look at what I\'ve done and where I stand, I have a consistent record of standing up for people and fighting for people and getting results for people, and that\'s what I would do as your president.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 5, 2008",b'Interview with Katie Couric of CBS News',"b'COURIC: So let me start by by asking you, Senator Clinton, you dismissed opposition to your tax gas holiday by economists as elitist, but a new CBS poll finds that about half of all voters also think it\'s a bad idea. And many think it\'s politically motivated. Do you think this proposal will end up hurting you more than helping you? CLINTON: No, not at all. In fact, a lot of people don\'t understand that I\'m not proposing that we don\'t replace the revenues that would be lost. That\'s Senator McCain\'s position. In fact, I\'m saying we should make the oil companies pay the gas tax this summer out of their record profits so that we don\'t make the deficit bigger. We don\'t deplete the highway trust fund. But all across Indiana and North Carolina people are responding because they\'re living with it. You know, they\'re looking at their own economic situation, they\'re their personal economist, and they\'re saying, ""you know, we just can\'t deal with this."" If they\'re truckers, if they commute long distances, if they have to use their truck or their vehicles for their job, like farmers do, it\'s really a burden. And there is no contradiction between providing immediate relief by trying to give folks, on average, it would be $70 - for a lot of people it would be a lot more, because they drive more - while at the same time we try to get a president who\'s actually going to declare energy independence and start us on a path to get off our dependence on foreign oil. COURIC: But, Senator Clinton, a lot of people say it would be a lot less money than $70 for those three months, and Senator Obama said earlier today your plan\'s a gimmick. It\'s phony, and rather than helping consumers it will just lead oil companies to raise prices. And, by the way, it would never pass in Congress. CLINTON: Well, number one, I think we\'ve gotta start going after the oil companies. Senator Obama supported a gas tax holiday without paying for it three times when he was in the state senate. So I\'m really focusing on what we can do to give people immediate relief, Katie. I don\'t see this false choice that Senator Obama and others set up between, oh, we\'ve gotta wait for the long term. Get a president in January. Oil hit $120.21 a barrel today, I\'m convinced that energy traders are manipulating the market. I would launch an investigation by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. I would close what\'s called the Enron loophole which leaves these traders totally unregulated. So there\'s a lot that I would do. But providing this direct relief, number one, according to the Department of Energy, would be about $70. But, number two, let\'s start standing up for the vast majority of Americans again, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury bailed out their (unintel) to the tune of $30 billion I didn\'t hear all this hand wringing. You know, there were folks who were basically being, you know, given an opportunity to avoid the consequences of what they had done, which caused a lot of trouble for everybody else. The people I\'m talking to who drive every day for a living, they\'re just looking for a little help. Because gas is up, groceries are up. They feel really squeezed. and I think they need a president, and they need advocates in public life, who are gonna take on the big interests like oil companies. COURIC: Yesterday you said we should move on from Reverend Wright, but your campaign continues to raise this issue with superdelegates. So are you telling the public one thing and superdelegates something else? CLINTON: No, that\'s just not the case. Our campaign responds to questions and concerns of those that talk to us, voters. A lot of voters on rope lines raise it. I say, ""let\'s talk about the economy, let\'s talk about healthcare, let\'s talk about education."" COURIC: You have a lot of superdelegates raising it? CLINTON: Well, well, it\'s not, you know, the press has done a pretty good job keeping this in the news for more than a week. Let\'s talk about, how this is on the minds of a lot of people. It\'s something that is in the atmosphere. But I have consistently said that I want to run a campaign on the specific proposals that I have put forth. I\'ve been going across this country talking about solutions. I want to be a problem solver. I think I\'m the best candidate. I believe I\'d be a better candidate to beat John McCain, and I think when voters, superdelegates, anybody really looks at what\'s at stake at this election, they should vote for somebody who would be commander-in-chief on day one and end the war in Iraq... COURIC: But. CLINTON: .and be the president who turns the economy around, that\'s what I\'m offering. COURIC: But, Senator Clinton, are superdelegates raising the issue of Reverend Wright with your campaign? CLINTON: Katie, I know the people across America have thought about this, like they think about everything else that comes into the atmosphere. So, of course, people talk about that. They talk about a lot of things, but what people talk to me about are gas prices and grocery prices and jobs, and trying to make sure that their kids have as good a future as they\'ve had. COURIC: After tomorrow there will be more superdelegates up for grabs than elected delegates. You need the vast majority of these remaining superdelegates to become the nominee and yet, even since your victory in Pennsylvania, Senator Obama has picked up 22 new ones. You\'ve only gotten 13. Why is that? CLINTON: Well, I think we\'re making a lot of progress and many people are waiting to see what happens in the remaining contest. Which I think is a, you know, smart idea. I now have more people who have voted for me, if you include Michigan and Florida, and those were legally officially certified elections, so I sure include them. Two point three million people voted in those elections, so more people have voted for me. The delegate race is very tight. Neither of us can get to the nomination without getting a lot of delegates, but I think people are going to ask themselves, number one, who\'d be the best president, who has the ability to beat John McCain, and I think they\'ll look at, you know, where we stand when it comes to the votes of - those who actually cast them over the course of the last month. COURIC: But, Senator Clinton, in fairness, Senator Obama\'s name wasn\'t even on the ballot in Michigan. CLINTON: That was his choice. Nobody made him take - cross his name from the ballot. I kept it on because I happen to think the people of Michigan deserved a chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted. We agreed only that we wouldn\'t campaign, and I didn\'t campaign, and in both cases, the voters said, wait a minute, we want to be part of this process. It\'s a very significant election. We want to be on record as saying who we think should be the nominee and the president. And I think the Democratic party has to come to terms with the fact that two of our biggest, most important states that Democrats sure have to try to win in the fall, deserve to have their votes translated into delegates. And I\'m hoping that that happens soon. COURIC: And, finally, Senator Clinton, when I spoke with Senator Obama earlier today, he said that your argument about attracting working class white voters is the only argument you have left. And that he has won these voters in critical states like Iowa, Wisconsin and Virginia, so have you really cornered that market? CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s always important to look at the facts, and to look at this, at the states that I\'ve won. If we had the same rules as the Republicans, which keep their eye on the prize, which started its electoral college in November, I would already be the nominee, because I have won a majority of the delegates from those big states. That\'s not the rule, we\'re playing by the rules, but I want Democrats to really focus on who is best able to win, and I have a very broad coalition of women and working people - people who get up every day and work hard, who we have to try to win back from the Republicans - hispanic voters, young voters in a lot of states where I did better. So, you know, I think that I can make a much stronger case that I go into the race against John McCain much better positioned to actually win in November. That\'s what we\'re gonna be talking about, and that\'s what eventually will have to decide after we finish all of these elections. COURIC: Will you stay in the game no matter what happens tomorrow? CLINTON: Well, I never make predictions. We\'re gonna wait and see how the people of Indiana and North Carolina decide. I started out so far behind in both of these states, they\'re really must-win states for Senator Obama. He has told other, everybody for several months that he would win both of these states. We\'ve waged vigorous campaigns. We\'ve, I think, made up some ground. We\'re gonna see what happens tomorrow. COURIC: Senator Hillary Clinton. Senator, thank you. CLINTON: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 6, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Indiana and North Carolina Primaries',"b'Thank you, Indiana. Thank you. Not too long ago, my opponent made a prediction. He said I would probably win Pennsylvania. He would win North Carolina, and Indiana would be the tie-breaker. Well, tonight we\'ve come from behind, we\'ve broken the tie, and thanks to you, it\'s full speed on to the White House. This has been an extraordinary experience, traveling across Indiana, having an opportunity to meet so many of you. And for everyone who holds your breath at the gas pump, afraid to see how much it cost today, and for everyone working day and night because you want the world for your kids. For every young person with big dreams who deserves a world of opportunity, and for all those who aren\'t in the headlines but have always written America\'s story, tonight is your victory right here. I want to commend Senator Obama and his supporters on their win in North Carolina. We are, in many ways, on the same journey. It\'s a journey begun long before we were born. It is a journey by men and women who have been on a mission to perfect our union, who marched and protested, who risked everything they had to build an America that embraces us all. And tonight, once again, I need your help to continue our journey. This has always been your campaign and this is your victory, because your support has meant the difference between winning and losing. And we can only keep winning if we\'re able to keep competing against an opponent who does outspend us massively. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com and support our campaign. This is a very touching moment for me. I grew up in the Midwest, born in Chicago, raised in Park Ridge, Illinois. My dad was a World War II vet who started his own small business, and originally from Scranton, PA., that\'s right. My mother had a difficult childhood, but worked hard to provide a loving home for us. And she didn\'t attend college herself, but was determined her children would. And I don\'t think she ever dreamed she would see a night like this. Their story, like every one of our stories, is the American story. It\'s a story of men and women who embrace opportunity, never waver in the face of adversity, and never stop believing in the promise of America. And yet today, I have met so many people here in Indiana and across America who feel invisible. You sure feel invisible when you\'re paying $60 or $70 to fill up your tank. You feel invisible when the money you took to the grocery store no longer meets your needs for the next week. You feel invisible when your health insurance disappears and college is out of reach. And you can\'t believe how invisible you feel when your loved one who served our country in war is ill-served back at home. I know these stories and I see you and I hear you. And I know how hard you\'re working, working for yourselves and working for your families. And I will never stop fighting for you, so that you can have the future you deserve. Tonight, Hoosiers have said that you do want a President who stands strong for you, a President who is ready on Day One to take charge as Commander-in-Chief and keep our families safe; a President who knows how to make this economy work for hardworking middle class families. And there are a lot of ideas about how best to do that. Because we need all of the good common sense that Americans have to offer. I know that we have got an important debate going on right now about how we are going to help families deal with these gas prices. They have gone up so fast, so out of sight in the minds of the people that I talk with and I think it\'s time that we really had a concerted strategy. You\'ve heard me say this and I\'ll say it again. I think its time to give Americans a break this summer and to make the oil companies pay the gas tax out of their record profits. I say it\'s time to cover every single American with health insurance. And I say it\'s time to freeze foreclosures for families most at risk of losing their homes, including our soldiers who are in harm\'s way and are being foreclosed on here in America. Fundamentally, I believe that Americans need a champion in their corner, that for too long we\'ve had a president who has stood up and spoke out for the wealthy and the well-connected. But I don\'t think that\'s what Americans need or what they\'re looking for now. And I think standing up for working people is about the American Dream and the Democratic Party. And I think standing up for the middle class is about who we are and who we can be if we stick together. So it is important that as we go forward in this campaign that we recognize we are all on the same team. We are going to be standing up for you. We\'re going to be looking for a way to turn this country around and bring it back to what it should stand for and be all about - better futures for you and your children, solving the problems that affect us here in America. I know that people are watching this race and they\'re wondering, I win, he wins, I win, he wins. It\'s so close. And I think that says a lot about how excited and passionate our supporters are and how intent so many Americans are to really taking their country back. But I can assure you, as I have said on many occasions that no matter what happens, I will work for the nominee of the Democratic Party, because we must win in November. And I know that Senator Obama feels the same way, because we have been on this campaign trail now for a long time. And we know how desperately people want to see a change, and it will not be a change if the Republicans keep the White House. It will be more of the same, something that no one, no matter what political party you may be, can afford. It is time for all of us to recognize what is at stake in this election, not just for Democrats as we decide who will be our nominee, but for all Americans. The soldiers and the veterans that I meet, they always say to me, promise you\'ll take care of my buddies. They rarely ask for themselves. And they need a president who will take care of them. And when I talk with the people who come to rallies and events like this, very often it\'s with a bit of hesitation that they tell me they\'ve lost their job, they\'ve lost their health care; they can\'t afford to go to college. And it just breaks my heart, because when I think about the America that I grew up in, the future was unlimited, the potential was there for all of us if we were willing to work hard and do our part. So this journey that we\'re on together is one that has been a blessing for me, because I know what this country has meant to me and I know what it still means to all of you. It is now our responsibility to ensure that it will always mean the same for our children and our grandchildren. I will never give up on you and on your families and on your dreams and on your future. And I want to thank the people of Indiana for your hospitality and your vote of confidence and I especially want to thank your wonderful Senator, Evan Bayh. Evan is an outstanding leader for this state and for America. He\'s been your governor. He\'s now your senator. He\'s someone whom I look to for advice and counsel. He\'s worked tirelessly on this campaign and I\'m so grateful to him and his wonderful wife Susan. I also want to thank the people of North Carolina, who were so hospitable and gracious to us. And I especially want to thank Mike and Mary Easley for their friendship and support. Governor Easley is a visionary leader for North Carolina and we had so much fun campaigning in the Tar Heel state. And while we are celebrating tonight, I would like to take a moment to express my deepest sympathies to the victims of the devastating cyclone in Burma. Our hearts and prayers go out to the people there and I call upon the Junta that has ruled Burma for so many years to please let the rest of the world in to help. This is a time when everyone should be there to lift up those who are affected by this deadly storm. And I want to thank all of my friends who have worked so hard. I want to thank my friends in labor. I want to thank my staff, my volunteers and my supporters. And I especially want to thank my family for their incredible love and support. Bill and Chelsea. People ask us all the time, how do you keep going? We love getting out and meeting people. We love having a chance to be with all of you, and didn\'t Chelsea do a great job? I know a lot of people enjoyed seeing my husband again out on the campaign trail. So now it is on to West Virginia, Kentucky, Oregon, and the other states where people are eager to have their voices heard. For too long, we\'ve let places like West Virginia and Kentucky slip out of the Democratic column. Well, it\'s time for that to change and these next primaries are another test. I\'m going to work my heart out in West Virginia and Kentucky this month and I intend to win them in November in the general election. I want the people in these upcoming states to know we are going to work hard to reach out to all of you, because we want you to know that the Democratic Party is your party. And a Democratic President will be good for you. So please, come join us in our campaign. And I am running to be the President of all of America - north, south, east and west, and everywhere in between. That\'s why it is so important that we count the votes of Florida and Michigan. It would be a little strange to have a nominee chosen by 48 states. We\'ve got a long road ahead, but we\'re going to keep fighting on that path for America, because America is worth fighting for. And we believe in America\'s potential and possibility that has so ignited hope and the dreams of people throughout our country and around the world. People who left everything behind in order to come here and be part of this great experiment in democracy; dissidents and dreamers on every continent who look to us and our ideals for their hope and inspiration. All those around the world who wept for us and prayed for us on September 11th, who laid wreaths and flew flags at half mast and printed that unforgettable headline, ""We are all Americans."" That is the reach of America\'s embrace, through time, place and history. And I know we can once again open our arms to the world. We can once again be the can-do nation; a nation that defies the odds and greets the future with optimism and hope. There isn\'t anything America can\'t do once we make up our minds to start acting like Americans again. And that is exactly what we intend to do. Thank you, and God bless you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 11, 2008","b'Remarks in Grafton, West Virginia'","b'Good afternoon. Oh my goodness. This is just such a pleasure and we are thrilled to be here. What better place to spend Mother\'s Day than here in Grafton, not far from the Andrews Methodist Church, where the very first Mother\'s Day was celebrated 100 years ago. So this is the hundredth anniversary and I want to thank all of you for spending part of this day with us here at the B and O Railroad Heritage Center. I want to thank the County Commission President Dave Goebel for being here and all the elected officials who are here with us. It is exciting to be here with my daughter too, because whether you\'re a son or a daughter, or in fact, a father or a mother, or maybe a grandfather or a grandmother \'\' or even a great grandparent, you know that you\'re part of an ongoing celebration every mother\'s day that began as a simple commemoration of a West Virginia woman and that\'s what I think is so special. When I walked through the home and saw where Ann Maria Reeves Jarvis lived, and there\'s so much there that is authentic and of period, it really did touch my heart. I was told by Tom and Olive who were taking us through that people come sometimes every Mother\'s Day, they bring friends and relatives from out of the area to experience this real walk back through history. I was inspired when I first read about Ann Maria and how she worked so hard to raise her family like so many women in those days. She had ten children but only four survived. She taught Sunday School. I also learned that she was a Methodist like I am and her husband was a Baptist like my husband. For 52 years of marriage they never went to church together. Well, Bill and I have done that a few times. They eventually, under the leadership of Ann Maria, organized what were called Mothers\' Work Days and they worked to improve sanitation and health conditions and raise funds for medicine, and try to care for women with tuberculosis. They inspected bottled milk and food and treated wounded soldiers, both Yankee and Confederate. The upstairs bedroom, which is the guest bedroom, there is both the grey and the blue on the bedspread because they cared for any wounded soldier; it was safe passage if they made it to the Jarvis home. That was very inspiring to me. She had a tremendous sense of duty and obligation and her story might have been lost in history had her own daughter not come forward with the idea of Mother\'s Day and to honor her and all mothers for the contributions. So as we look at the mothers and the grandmothers who are gathered here today and as we think about the tens of millions of mothers across our country who are busy taking care of their children, doing their jobs, supporting their communities and living lives of faith and service, we are reminded from generation to generation that our progress often come from the hard work, determination and the tenacity of women. I wanted to begin by saluting my own mother who couldn\'t be here, because my mother, as some of you may have heard me say or read in my book, didn\'t have the benefit of a stable family growing up. Her parents were unable to care for their two young daughters and were divorced in the 1920s which wasn\'t very comment back then. My eight year old mother and her five year old sister were sent away on a train all by themselves from Chicago to California to live with grandparents who had little interest in raising them. So when my mother was about 14, she left that home and was hired as a live\'in helper by a woman who encouraged and supported her. My mom took care of the children in the morning, got them off to school, then she could go to high school, she would come right back and take care of them when the kids got home from school. She never had the chance to go to college, but she was determined that her own children would have that chance. As I grew older and learned more about my mother\'s own story, it really impressed upon me more fully what it took for her to forge ahead in the face of life\'s challenges. I saw how hard she worked every single day to support my father and our family, to raise me and my brothers, and to be involved in teaching Sunday School to helping out at the neighborhood school. My mother didn\'t have the luxury to put up her feet and take a breather. She just kept going, kept working, kept meeting her responsibilities and pursuing her dreams for her children so that we could have opportunities that she, and prior generations, never ever dreamed of. She wasn\'t alone. Judging from the mothers I meet across our country, I\'ve come to believe that hard work, determination and resiliency are encoded in our DNA. We know we have the ""worrying"" gene. We know we have the ""put your coat on because it\'s cold outside"" gene. Well, we also have the ""stand up and fight for what you believe in"" gene. Take, for example, my grandmother, my father\'s mother, Hannah Jones. She was a formidable woman. She died when I was quite young but I have vivid memories of her. She was the kind of woman who never took no for an answer. And one time, when my father and a friend were hitching a ride on the back of an ice truck, and their feet were dangling over the back of it, the truck came to an abrupt halt and skidded and smashed into something crushing my father\'s feet. He was rushed to the hospital, word went out to Hannah that her son had been seriously injured. She got to the hospital only to be met by doctors who said that they had to amputate his feet. Hannah said no. And she barricaded my father and herself in their hospital room, would not let anyone in until her brother\'in\'law who happened to be a doctor arrived and then she basically browbeat him into agreeing to save my father\'s feet. My father went on to play football in high school and college. They did a good job, I think. But if it hadn\'t been for that mother saying ""no, you\'re not going to do this,"" my father\'s life would have been so much different. So when I think of Hannah, I think of the mother who is working to help her child who is labeled a failure in school until he finally experiences success. I think of the mother who petitions the mayor or the city council or the police chief to demand more protection for children when they are outside playing in the neighborhood. Or the mother who takes matters into her own hands and sends body armor to her son or daughter in Iraq when the military didn\'t provide it. This is not a new phenomenon. Women have been standing up for what we believe in, defying convention, and going forward for a long time. What about the brave suffragists who didn\'t abandon their fight for the right to vote even when they were ostracized and harassed and thrown in jail? What about Harriet Tubman, who wouldn\'t back down in the face of danger as she led slaves out of bondage on an underground railroad? What about Dolores Huerta, who helped to found the United Farm Workers and worked long and very unglamorous hours as a grassroots activist to bring dignity to the lives of other mothers? What about Sally Ride, who wouldn\'t give up her dream of soaring into space when women were told they didn\'t have the ""right stuff"" to become astronauts? What about the women around the world like the extraordinary Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who became the president of Liberia in 2005 and whose leadership has literally helped to mother a wounded and suffering nation? I find inspiration from all of these women and from their stories and I find inspiration as I travel around West Virginia and America. I find inspiration from the mothers and grandmothers I meet every single day. I was in Indiana toward the end of the campaign; in fact it was the very last event we did in Evansville. We were in a high school gym, hundreds of people were there and after I spoke I was shaking hands and I came upon a beaming glowing mother, standing next to the wheelchair which her son, who was incredibly, profoundly disabled. She introduced me with such love and pride to her son. And he could be well understood by me but she could understand everything he was saying. She proceeded to interpret for him how excited he was about this campaign. And how he knew exactly what I was saying across Indiana. Jobs, jobs, jobs. And he said it over and over and over again. I think of all of these mothers who take whatever life throws at us, gets up every morning, gets the kids ready for school, does the laundry, buys the groceries, cooks the dinners, helps on the homework and maybe works a day shift, a nightshift or a double shift. And mothers who tell their daughters ""you are just as smart and capable as anyone else and don\'t ever think you aren\'t."" Women who ask the PTA ""why don\'t we do more to get girls into math and science classes."" Women who dare to compete in the board room and the back room, the locker room and the newsroom, the halls of academia and the corridors of political power. Through their perseverance and resilience these women are standing up for the bedrock principle of American democracy \'\' the promise of opportunity for anyone who is willing to work hard and pursue their dreams. That is a principle and a promise that must always include girls and women. Now, if you are a woman of a certain age, as I am, you have likely experienced a moment along the way when your own sense of limitless possibility collided with a harsher reality. For me, it was a small moment. I was a teenager; I dreamed of being an astronaut. So I wrote to NASA to volunteer for astronaut training and find out what you had to do to be prepared. I got a letter back: Girls were just not accepted into the program. The truth is, given my poor eyesight and very, very modest athletic abilities, I would have never been accepted in any event. But the rejection, however small, carried a message. I hadn\'t realized until then that anyone be denied an opportunity simply on the basis of being a girl. Later, in a class of 235 students at law school, I was one of only 27 women enrolled, at that time the largest group ever. Today women are the majority of students in law school. But I remember when I was just starting my legal career and a colleague advised me not to be a trial lawyer because, he said, I had no way of getting the one thing every trial lawyer needed. When I asked him what, he said, ""a wife."" I said, ""Really?"" Very seriously he said, ""When you\'re in a long trial and you\'re busy, who\'s going to make sure you have clean socks for court?"" I had honestly never thought of that and I had always washed my socks myself. So it didn\'t seem like it would be that big an obstacle. Thankfully, I, like generations of women today, are able to make our own choices because other women stood up and demanded that for us. I often think about how much lives have changed for women since when my own mother was born in 1919, when I was born in 1947, and when Chelsea was born in 1980. We\'ve made an enormous amount of progress. Women are now neurosurgeons and NASCAR drivers, judges and generals, CEOs and CPAs. But it\'s also true that the higher you go up in the ranks, the thinner it becomes, whether it\'s business, or law, or politics, or other fields. Women still face a lot of barriers, some visible, some invisible. In 2008 it\'s really important we recommit ourselves to making sure that our daughters and our sons have an equal chance to lead and serve in the future. Over the past few days I\'ve gotten emails from around the country from people offering words of encouragement and advice. One man from California wrote: ""Keep fighting. No matter what the outcome may be, the fact that you stood throughout the constant ups and downs in this race, one thing is sure: You never wavered and you never gave up."" A woman named Linda said, Linda wrote and said: ""Don\'t give up. I\'m supporting you looking at my girls and knowing that when the going gets tough, you keep forging ahead."" A Californian wrote, ""For the sake of all future and current mothers everywhere, keep your head up and keep on in this race, keep fighting, I am with you all the way."" But I guess my favorite message was from a woman named Angela. ""Keep strong,"" she said, ""it\'s not over until the lady in the pantsuit says it is."" I share that, because the underlying lesson is not so much about me but about all of us. About whether or not we do stay with what we start, whether or not we can make progress if we don\'t commit ourselves to it and see it through, unless we are wiling to stand in the face of adversity. The same is true for our country. We need to rise to the challenges facing us, no matter how daunting, and take care of the unfinished business before America. Unfinished business that resonates not only for women but for all of us - for children whose lives and well\'being is affected because their mother is paid lower wages than male counterparts doing the same job. For husbands who share the burdens placed on a family when a woman can\'t get maternity leave or get a bank loan or qualify for a decent pension. For fathers who want their daughters to have the same opportunities as their sons \' to compete at sports, or be engineers, or fly jets or break any barrier to be whatever they dream, including president of the United States. It\'s unfinished business that we see everyday in the headlines, the supermarket lines, the bank lines, the emergency room lines. The question before us as a nation is whether we will forge ahead with that sense of resilience and purpose that has always marked America. Will we address the mortgage crisis so more families don\'t lose their homes? Will we finally achieve health care so that every single American has quality, affordable health care? Will we get serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil? Will we tackle the gas prices that are going up astronomically? Will we stop shipping American jobs overseas? Will we adopt green energy policies including clean coal that will make economic sense and protect us, and our children\'s children? Will we make college affordable again for the young people who are now being shut out of going to college? Will we end No Child Left Behind, which is not working? Will we bring our troops home from Iraq and end this war that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars? Will we take care of those who have taken care of us - our veterans. West Virginia has the highest proportion of veterans anywhere in our country. I am running for president because I believe we can answer all of those questions. I know we can achieve solutions to fix our economy and create new jobs and safeguard people\'s homes from foreclosure, relieve the burden of soaring food and gas prices. I believe we can bring our troops home with honor, following a strategy that is smart and safe starting within 60 days of my becoming president. I believe we can once again see good jobs with rising incomes, to do more to support children and families, especially in places like West Virginia. And for just a moment, I\'d like to mention your wonderful Senior Senator, Senator Robert C. Byrd. Many of you know that Senator Byrd lost his mother when he was only 1 year old. He grew up in poverty, but was fortunate to be taken in by an aunt and uncle who gave him the love and foundation of family. Every year around Mother\'s Day, Senator Byrd gives a speech on the Senate floor in appreciation of mothers. When I came to the Senate, and my mother spent a lot of time with us, she now lives with us, she used to watch C\'Span all the time to see if she could catch a glimpse of me - to be very honest about it. And she fell in love with Senator Byrd. And a few years ago I took her to have lunch with Senator Byrd in his office and she told him how much she appreciated his Mother\'s Day speeches. In 2003, he said something so cogent that I just want to repeat it here. ""That the best mothers invest the best of themselves in their families - they are high\'stake brokers, and we, their families, are the stocks on their exchange. If we simply try our best, she will consider the return on her investment to be well met."" One of the poems he read that year was ""Like Mother, Like Son"". Although he barely had a chance to know his mother, to this day he still feels her gentle presence, her soft urging to do his best to make her proud. Bill and I often talk about the challenges he faced in his family - when after his father died before he was born, his mother had to leave him to go to school to become a nurse. He was left with her parents while she was away. And there is such a poignant picture of him being taken to go visit his mother who was in nursing school in New Orleans. And he is about 3 years old and he is all dressed up in a little suit that his grandmother had bought for him for the trip. And I remember his mother, Virginia, telling me that she was so happy to see him but it was so heartbreaking when he left on the train going back to Arkansas. One of Bill\'s earliest memories is seeing his mother drop to her knees and just sobbing as her son left. But she was there to get a better education so she could take better care of him. I know Bill, like Senator Byrd and millions of sons across America, as well as daughters from coast to coast, carry their mother\'s love with them everyday. I think there is more we can do to make sure that young parents are not so stressed out. It is hard raising children today. There are so many demands - the jobs don\'t pay what they used to, which means that usually you have to have both parents working, don\'t you? If you are a single mom, honestly, I think you are a miracle worker to be able to manage the family and a job at the same time. I think we should do more to help young families -I would like to see us experiment in our country with what other countries have. And that is not only expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act, so that we protect more families in times of emergency. I am very proud that millions and millions of people have taken advantage of that, the first bill that my husband signed. But we need to expand it because right now it cuts off at 50 employees - we need to bring that down to 25 employees because when you have a newborn baby, or you adopt a baby, or your spouse or yourself is sick, or your parent is sick, it is terrible having to make a choice between losing your job and taking care of your loved one. I just worked to pass legislation which we have passed to extend the Family and Medical Leave to the families of wounded soldiers. Because so many of them, when they are brought back to the country they need extensive and lengthily care, and they need their families by their side. So we\'re going to make sure we protect their jobs and I\'d like that to be available for more people. Here in West Virginia, that would help a lot of West Virginians. I also want to push for something that is not available in very many places today. That is some form of paid leave for limited purposes, because what happens now with unpaid leave is that if you can\'t afford to go from your job, you can\'t take it even if it is available to you. If we had a small limited program of paid leave that the federal government would work with the states to provide, 490,000 workers in West Virginia in the private sector might be eligible. I also think it is important we look at the end of life and the beginning of life together. We need more child\'care for families. We have 64,000 children under six in West Virginia that don\'t have good child\'care. But we also have many, many families taking care of loved ones and they don\'t get much help doing it. The average family in America taking care of a child with a disability, a spouse with Alzheimer\'s, a parent with Parkinson\'s, will spend at least $5,000 out of pocket taking care of that loved one. I think we should give a $3,000 caregiver tax credit so that families are not put at a financial disadvantage for doing what they are doing out of love and dedication. I also would like to see us make it easier and less expensive to buy long\'term care policies. It\'s one of the biggest concerns families have What happens if my parent or my grandparent or my spouse is no longer able to take care of him or herself and I physically can\'t do it any longer and don\'t have any help to do it. How can we get some long\'term care in the home or in some other setting? And I think we should have a long\'term care tax credit, as well, so people can buy long\'term care insurance. On all of these issues, it really does matter whether we are going to care for one another. And I think it is interesting that this holiday we start today was the idea of a woman, right here in Grafton. Anna Jarvis prevailed against the odds. If you were to come with an idea right now for a national holiday and you persevered for nine or ten years like she did, it would be a labor of love. And that is what it sometimes does take to make the changes that are going to benefit us. I want to just end by spotlighting another mother, because this whole question of equal pay for equal work really is at the core of my belief that we have got to get to equality in the workplace. Lily Ledbetter was a mother who raised her two children while working at a tire factory in Alabama. For almost two decades, before she learned she was being paid far less than her male counterparts doing the same job. She sued under the Equal Pay Act, which has been in existence for 40 years. The Supreme Court, controlled by the new Bush Chief Justice threw her case out. They said she didn\'t file the complaint soon enough. The only problem was she hadn\'t known until after all those years she wasn\'t being paid the same. You don\'t go up to your fellow employees and say show me your pay stub. You just don\'t do that. The information was a secret. So we tried to fix that loophole in the Senate a few weeks ago but the Republicans blocked us. I want people to remember that in this upcoming election season. Because when women in workplaces are discriminated against, paid lower wages than they deserve, that affects their husbands, it affects their children, it affects the family income. When women make $.77 on a dollar for a man and a mom goes to the grocery store, the checkout counter person doesn\'t say, you only make $.70, so we are going to cut the cost of the groceries by 25%. That doesn\'t happen. So we have got to remedy that. And there is a lot of other unfinished business. But it is exciting to know that we are here on the hundredth anniversary of this celebration. And in two days, the voters of West Virginia will join the tens of millions of Americans who have already cast their vote for president. I am asking for your support so that I can continue to fight for you and fight to finish the work that we have started. I would not be standing here if it were not for all the women who went before. Not only the women in my own life, like my mother and my grandmother, or my wonderful daughter whom I am so thrilled to have with me here today, but it is also because of countless women and men whose names we may never know who really believed strongly in what they thought would make their community and their country better places. So I leave you today with a Mother\'s Day message I received a few days ago from a 23 year old young women in Kentucky: ""Happy Mother\'s Day,"" She wrote, ""Hopefully I will be wishing you one next year as president. You have already succeeded as the world\'s hardest job, being a mother. The second hardest job should be a breeze for you."" Happy Mother\'s Day everybody.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 13, 2008",b'Remarks Following the West Virginia Primary',"b'Thank you, West Virginia. You know, like the song says: ""it\'s almost heaven,"" and I am so grateful for this overwhelming vote of confidence. There are some who have wanted to cut this race short. They say ""give up, it\'s too hard, the mountain is too high,"" but here in West Virginia, you know a thing or two about rough roads to the top of the mountain. We know from the Bible that faith can move mountains and, my friends, the faith of the Mountain State has moved me. I am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard. I want to commend Senator Obama and his supporters. This continues to be a hard-fought race, from one end of our country to the other. And yes, we\'ve had a few dust-ups along the way, but our commitment to bring America new leadership that will renew America\'s promise means that we have always stood together on what is most important. Now, tonight I need your help to continue this journey. We are in the homestretch. There are only three weeks left in the final contests, and your support can make the difference between winning and losing. So I hope you\'ll go to HillaryClinton.com and support our campaign. You\'ve heard this before  there are many who wanted to declare a nominee before the ballots were counted or even cast. Some said our campaign was over after Iowa, but then we won New Hampshire. Then we had big victories on Super Tuesday and in Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania, and of course, we came from behind to win in Indiana. So, this race isn\'t over yet. Neither of us has the total delegates it takes to win and both Senator Obama and I believe that the delegates from Florida and Michigan should be seated. I believe we should honor the votes cast by 2.3 million people in those states and seat all of their delegates. Under the rules of our party, when you include all 50 states, the number of delegates needed to win is 2,209, and neither of us has reached that threshold yet. This win in West Virginia will help me move even closer. Now, in a campaign, it can be easy to get lost in the political spin and the polls or the punditry, but we must never lose sight of what really counts, of why all of us care so much about who wins and who loses in our political system. An enormous decision falls on the shoulders of Democratic voters in these final contests and those Democrats empowered to vote at our convention. And tonight, in light of our overwhelming victory here in West Virginia, I want to send a message to everyone still making up their mind. I am in this race because I believe I am the strongest candidate - the strongest candidate to lead our party in November of 2008 and the strongest president to lead our nation starting in January of 2009. I can win this nomination if you decide I should, and I can lead this party to victory in the general election if you lead me to victory now. The choice falls to all of you, and I don\'t envy you. I deeply admire Senator Obama, but I believe our case, a case West Virginia has helped to make, our case is stronger. Together, we have won millions and millions of votes - by the time tonight is over, probably 17 million, close to it. We\'ve won them in states that we must be prepared and ready to win in November  Pennsylvania and Ohio, Arkansas and New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Michigan, Florida, and now West Virginia. It is a fact that no Democrat has won the White House since 1916 without winning West Virginia. The bottom line is this  the White House is one in the swing states and I am winning the swing states. And we have done it by standing up for the deepest principles of our party with a vision for an America that rewards hard work again, that values the middle class and helps to make it stronger. With your help, I am ready to go head-to-head with John McCain to put our vision for America up against the one he shares with President Bush. Now, I believe our party is strong enough for this challenge. I am strong enough for it. You know I never give up. I\'ll keep coming back, and I\'ll stand with you as long as you stand with me. Together, we will draw the stark distinctions that will determine the future direction of our nation, the difference between ending the war in Iraq responsibly or continuing it indefinitely, between health care for everyone and more uninsured Americans, between standing up for the middle-class families that you represent or standing up for the corporate special interests. So, I ask you, Democrats, to choose who you believe will make the strongest candidate in the fall and who is ready to execute the office of the presidency of the United States. People ask me all the time, why am I in this race. Well, I\'m in it because of the people that I have worked for my entire life and the people I meet along the campaign trail, people who need someone who fights for them because they\'re fighting so hard every single day, the people who drive for miles to show their support, who come with the home-made sign, who raise money by skipping those dinners out, who have stood fast and stood strong. I\'m in this race for the millions of Americans who know that we can do better in our country, for the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran, the college student. All of the hardworking men and women who defy the odds to build a better life for themselves and their children. You will never be counted out, and I won\'t either. You will never quit, and I won\'t, either. The question is, why do so many people keep voting? Why did 64% of Democrats say in a recent poll they wanted this race to continue? Because in the face of the pundits and the naysayers, they know what is at stake. They know that we have two wars, an economy in crisis on the brink of a recession, $9 trillion of debt, oil prices shooting through the roof, gas prices and grocery prices hurting people who desperately are looking for a way to just keep going day to day. They know they need a champion. They need someone who\'s going to never stop fighting for health care that covers everyone, no exceptions, for an economy that lifts everyone up, for good jobs that won\'t be shipped overseas, for college affordability, for all that you can do to own a home and then to keep it. This election is fundamentally about whether or not the American dream remains alive and well, for our children and our grandchildren. This is the core of my life and my political beliefs: that we owe so much to future generations, that we do not want to see that dream recede, that we know people have to work hard, and we expect you to do just that and to take responsibility, but at the very least, you should have a President who is on your side again. And I believe that this campaign has been good for the Democratic Party and good for our country. People are discussing and debating issues. They are turning out in record numbers to register and to vote. There is an excitement about politics that is the lifeblood of our democracy. For me, this election isn\'t about who\'s in or who\'s out or who\'s up or who\'s down. It\'s about the common threads that tie us together  rich and poor, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. We are united by common values. We all want a better world for our children, and we want the best for our country. And we are committed to putting a Democrat back in the White House. And our nominee  our nominee will be stronger for having campaigned long and hard, building enthusiasm and excitement, hearing your stories and answering your questions. And I will work my heart out for the nominee of the Democratic Party to make sure we have a Democratic President. As we look at the stakes in this election, I think we can all agree it\'s been unprecedented. We haven\'t had an election like it for as long as anyone can remember. It is still so close and it really does depend upon those who will vote in these next contests and those who have the awesome responsibility as delegates of our great Democratic Party. I\'m asking that people think hard about where we are in this election, about how we will win in November, because this is not an abstract exercise. This is for a solemn, crucial purpose: to elect a president to turn our country around, to meet the challenges we face and seize the opportunities. It has been a long campaign, but it is just an instant in time when compared with the lasting consequences of the choice we will make in November. That is why I am carrying on, and if you give me a chance, Democrats, I\'ll come back to West Virginia in the general election and we\'ll win this state and we\'ll win the White House. I am honored and grateful for the support and hospitality of the people of West Virginia. I spent a few minutes with your wonderful national treasure, Senator Byrd, this morning and we talked about his beloved West Virginia. I told him where I\'d gone and what I\'d seen. I talked about the people I had met. And he just broke into the biggest smile. I don\'t know that any man has ever loved a state more than Robert C. Byrd loves West Virginia. I am grateful for the graciousness of Governor and Mrs. Manchin. Governor Manchin is winning a great victory himself tonight, and I want to thank Joe and Gayle for welcoming me to Governor Manchin\'s hometown as we went to Fairmont for a great election last night. I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Truman Chafin, former Governor Hulett Smith, Brigadier General Jack Yeager, all of the West Virginia veterans who honored me by their support and I honor their service. Thanks to my friends in the labor unions who stood with us every step of the way, we wouldn\'t be here without you. And a special thanks to my outstanding staff, volunteers and supporters here in West Virginia and across America. At least once, usually a half a dozen times a day, Bill and Chelsea and I check in with each other and I wish every West Virginian could have heard our calls as we compared our experiences here in this state. We\'ve had the best time. And I will be back. As we move on now to the next contests, in Kentucky and Oregon, in Puerto Rico, in Montana and South Dakota, tonight I\'m thinking about Florence Steen from South Dakota, eighty-eight years old and in failing health when she asked that her daughter bring an absentee ballot to her hospice bedside. Florence was born before women had the right to vote, and she was determined to exercise that right, to cast a ballot for her candidate who just happened to be a woman running for president. Florence passed on a few days ago, but I am eternally grateful to her and her family for making this such an important and incredible milestone in her life that means so much to me. I\'m also thinking of Dalton Hatfield, an 11-year-old boy from Kentucky, who sold his bike and sold his video games to raise money to support my campaign. This is a great and good nation because of people like Florence Steen, Dalton Hatfield, and their families. Her memory and his future are worth fighting for. As long as we remember that there is no challenge we cannot meet, no barrier we cannot break, no dream we cannot realize. So, let\'s finish the job we started. America is worth fighting for. Thank you and God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all so very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 14, 2008","b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN\'s ""The Situation Room""'","b'BLITZER: And joining us now, Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, the Democratic presidential candidate.Senator Clinton, thanks very much for joining us.CLINTON: Thank you very much.BLITZER: Congratulations on your win yesterday in West Virginia. A big win for Senator Clinton.CLINTON: Well, it was a big win. And it was a very gratifying one because I had campaigned hard there, and I think that the issues that I\'ve been championing on the economy and health care really resonated with the voters in West Virginia.And as I have said many times in the last couple of weeks, no Democrat has won the White House since 1916 without winning West Virginia. So I took that as a good sign.BLITZER: You did well there. All right. Let me get your reaction. The current issue of ""TIME"" magazine, which you\'ve probably seen, you see a cover like this and it says, ""And the Winner Is..."", and a little asterisk. What do you think when you see something like this?CLINTON: I think it\'s a great picture of Barack.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: You know what I think? Is that this is the closest election we\'ve ever had that anybody can remember. Each of us has brought millions of new people into the process. I think I\'ve now been privileged to receive the votes of 17 million Americans.And that\'s pretty much the same as Senator Obama. The delegate race remains close. We have contests yet to go. People have been trying to end it. And the voters just won\'t let it happen.As a recent poll suggested, 64 percent of Democrats want to see this continue. And I think for good reason, because it\'s one of the most substantive, exciting, energizing political events I can remember in my lifetime.And there is no winner yet. You have to have, now with the special election of a Democrat from Mississippi, 2,210 delegates to actually stay...BLITZER: You\'re including Florida and Michigan.CLINTON: Which we have to. We have to include them.BLITZER: Because in -- they\'re going to be meeting, the Rules Committee of the DNC...CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: ... May 31st.CLINTON: That\'s right. BLITZER: They have to make a decision.CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: What do you want them to do?CLINTON: Well, what I would want them to do is to seat the whole delegations based on the votes that were taken, because I think the voters who came out, over 2.3 million of them in both states, clearly believed that their votes would count. And they may have violated the DNC rules, but other states did as well.BLITZER: Because right now the DNC says that the number is, what, 2,025 or 2,026?CLINTON: That\'s just not a practical answer. That would mean that only 48 states would determine who the nominee of the Democratic Party is. And that\'s not the way the election works.BLITZER: So you\'re staying in at least through May 31 and June 3...CLINTON: That\'s right.BLITZER: ... which is the last -- you\'re not going anywhere.CLINTON: I\'m not going anywhere, Wolf...BLITZER: All right.CLINTON: ... except to Kentucky and Oregon and Montana and South Dakota, and Puerto Rico.BLITZER: In these remaining states. Let\'s talk about some of the issues, the key issues, the economic issues, issue No. 1, the economy. Gas prices...CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: ... right now. You\'ve said in recent days you want to get tough with the major oil exporting countries, OPEC, because of the huge cost per barrel, the resultant price of a gallon of gas.But when you say get tough with OPEC, what does it mean when you have members of OPEC like Ahmadinejad of Iran or Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, or Gaddafi of Libya? How do you plan on getting tough with them?CLINTON: Well, I actually have a four-part program that I would put into effect were I president today to deal with these rising gas prices, which are going to hit $4 soon. And it\'s an enormous burden on people who drive any considerable distance.BLITZER: But what kind of leverage do you have on OPEC? CLINTON: Well, four things, and I\'ll get to OPEC quickly. I would go after the energy traders and speculators. I think they are adding to the cost of a barrel of oil. I believe there is significant evidence of that.So I would launch a Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission investigation and really try to rein them in and close what\'s called the ""Enron loophole."" I approve and voted for what the Congress did yesterday, which is to quit filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I would even release some money.I have advocated a gas tax holiday that is paid for. That is not what Senator McCain wants. He wants one that is not paid for. And Senator Obama doesn\'t want one at all. But I would pay for it out of the record profits of the oil companies.Nine countries that are members of OPEC are members of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, where they have agreed to certain rules that I believe OPEC by definition violates. Also, we have never used antitrust laws in our country to really go at the heart of what is a monopoly cartel.There is something fundamentally wrong and outdated in having the oil-producing countries getting together a couple of times a year and saying, OK, here\'s how much we\'re going to produce and here\'s how much we\'re going to charge for it. And I think there is enough market power in the world, if we use the tools available to us, to rein that in.BLITZER: Because Barack Obama says this...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: You say you\'ve been in the White House for eight years, you\'ve had two terms as a United States senator, and haven\'t said a word about OPEC. And now suddenly you\'re going to take it right to OPEC?(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, he\'s wrong about that. I have voted, actually, in the Senate on several occasions to try to get the president of the United States to do something about OPEC. Obviously, President Bush wasn\'t inclined to do so, the Republican Congress before him was not inclined to do so.So we\'re going to have, I hope, a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. That is the time when we\'ll be able to take on this unfinished business when it comes to energy.BLITZER: Looking back, did the Clinton administration, during eight years of your husband in the White House, do enough toward energy independence?CLINTON: Well, they certainly tried between both the president and the vice president. And my husband often says laughingly that tax credits and energy programs were the only things that he couldn\'t get the Republican Congress to even look at, because obviously they had a very different view about what we should be doing.But now I think it\'s clear to everyone, even the Republican nominee, Senator McCain, who has been very eloquent in the last few days, talking about how we have to cap greenhouse gas emissions, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue.We need a long-term strategy, like the one I\'ve outlined on my Web site, hillaryclinton.com. You can read all about it. And we need a short-term strategy to try to provide relief to citizens right now.BLITZER: You were recently asked about your proposal to have a holiday on the gas tax. And you would pay for it by having a windfall profit tax on ExxonMobil and some of the other big oil companies. And then when you were pressed on economists who would endorse your idea, you said you\'re not going to put your lot in with economists.CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: Which raised questions. Are you not going to believe in what economists say?CLINTON: No, but I think there\'s that old saying. You can find an economist to say nearly anything. Now, some of the economists were against it because they misunderstood my policy. They thought it wasn\'t paid for. And I would agree with those who said we can\'t afford a gas tax holiday that will add to the deficit, that will take money out of the highway trust fund. Others are against the mechanism of a windfall profits tax. They think that doesn\'t necessarily work well and that the cost will be passed on.My attitude is I think we could design such a windfall profits tax that would work, that would be enforceable and that would not be passed on. I have been advocating a windfall profits tax on the oil companies to supplement a strategic energy fund that I have recommended for more than three years, and it\'s because I think that there is such a disconnect between what the oil companies have been raking in as profits and any comparable investment or effort that they\'ve made to produce those profits.There does seem to me to be an opportunity here both to take away the subsidies for the oil companies, which clearly don\'t need our tax dollars to make these huge profits, and to try to impose a windfall profits tax.BLITZER: But you will consult with economists...CLINTON: Of course.BLITZER: ... you believe in economists, and if you\'re president of the United States you\'ll work with economists, because when you said, ""I\'m not going to put your lot in with economists..."" CLINTON: Well, not totally. Not totally. You know, sometimes economists are not right. And I think there are political...BLITZER: But most of the economists have criticized your plan.CLINTON: Well, again, some of them didn\'t understand it and some of them don\'t believe it could be done. But you listen to all kinds of advisers, but then you have to try to make up your mind. Franklin Roosevelt, during the New Deal, a lot of economists said that\'s a terrible idea, you\'re going to be priming the pump, you\'re going to be putting people to work. That\'s a terrible idea, that\'s a betrayal of the American capitalist system. But he said, you know we\'ve got to put people to work.Well, I think we\'ve got to reign in the oil companies. And there are certainly economically appropriate ways of doing that.(END VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: Stand by for much more of my interview with Senator Hillary Clinton. She\'s strongly defending Barack Obama from his critics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I think that that\'s really, you know, just an overstatement and exaggeration of any kind of, you know, political meaning.(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: So what exaggeration about Obama is Clinton talking about? You\'re going to find out. That\'s coming up in my next installment of this interview.Plus, the one thing in our interview that got Senator Clinton rather emotional. You\'ll want to see this.And a new shocker in the battle for control of Congress. We\'re going to tell you why it could help Senator Obama make his case that he can win the White House.Stay with us. You\'re in ""The Situation Room.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Now back to my interview with Senator Hillary Clinton on racial divisions in the Democratic Party and on global tensions that some say could play to John McCain\'s strengths.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: When it comes to the war in Iraq, another issue on the minds of Americans right now, you\'ve criticized Senator McCain for suggesting U.S. troops could stay there perhaps for 100 years. But you yourself back in 2005 suggested, you know what? If there\'s a peaceful environment like along the lines of Korea or Germany or Okinawa, maybe it wouldn\'t be that bad for a long-term U.S. military presence in that kind of environment. Is the criticism of Senator McCain, who\'s made similar comments, is it warranted?CLINTON: Well, I think it is for this reason, that there isn\'t any significant milestone that the Iraqi government has met. It\'s a very different situation than Germany or Korea.BLITZER: But if they were to meet those milestones and if there were a new peaceful environment?CLINTON: But Wolf, I don\'t think though -- I think you\'re confusing kind of cause and effect. I don\'t believe that they will serious attempt to meet those milestones until they are absolutely convinced we are going to withdraw. I believe that is the best way to focus their attention.Everything we\'ve tried, including the most recent effort with the surge, has not resulted in the gains that were either hoped for or forecasted. I believe we\'ve got to bring our troops home. There are continuing missions -- guarding our embassy, Special Forces perhaps dealing with al Qaeda -- but that\'s a very different scenario than what we have today. Therefore, I would begin to bring our troops home.BLITZER: The Israelis are celebrating their 60th anniversary right now as an independent state. Here is what McCain said about Barack Obama. And I want to get your reaction. He said, ""I think"" -- this is McCain -- ""I think it\'s very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States. I think that people should understand that I will be Hamas\' worst nightmare. If Senator Obama is favored by Hamas, I think people can make judgments accordingly."" McCain was referring to a statement by the North American spokesman for Hamas endorsing, in effect, Barack Obama. Is McCain right?CLINTON: No, I think that that\'s really, you know, just an overstatement, an exaggeration of any kind of, you know, political meaning. And I don\'t think that anybody should take that seriously.BLITZER: But you have confidence in Barack Obama as president would be a strong supporter of Israel?CLINTON: I would -- yes, I do. I would believe that that would be the policy of the United States, and it\'s been our policy for 60 years.BLITZER: Because the criticism he gets from McCain and his supporters -- McCain\'s supporters -- is that he would be willing to meet unconditionally with the leader of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and given the statements that Ahmadinejad has made about destroying Israel, that doesn\'t -- that doesn\'t reassure, let\'s say, Israel.CLINTON: Well, I think that\'s a different issue. You know, I objected when that statement was made back in an early debate, because I don\'t believe that a United States president should commit to meet unconditionally with leaders of rogue nations. That doesn\'t mean you don\'t eventually meet with them under appropriate circumstances, but not without conditions.BLITZER: Let\'s talk about an issue that\'s come up in this campaign. The issue of race in the campaign. You were widely quoted in that ""USA Today"" interview. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)CLINTON: There was just an ""A.P."" article posted that found how Senator Obama\'s support among working -- hard working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how the -- you know, whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me. I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on.(END AUDIO CLIP)BLITZER: Now, your great friend and supporter, Congressman Charlie Rangel, said -- and I\'m quoting now -- ""It\'s the dumbest thing you could have said.""CLINTON: Well, he\'s probably right.BLITZER: Oh, he is? All right. Well, explain.CLINTON: Well, absolutely. Well, I was -- I was referencing an AP article, and, you know, obviously I have worked very hard to get the votes of everyone. And I have campaigned hard, I understand that we\'ve got to put together a broad coalition in order to win in the fall. We\'ve got to get to that 270 electoral vote margin. And I know Senator Obama has worked hard to reach out to every community and constituency.So I\'m going to continue to do that. That\'s what I think is in the best interest of our party and that\'s how we will win in November.BLITZER: Well, as someone who has championed civil rights all of these years, and you see all these stories coming up, and he\'s getting 90 percent of the African-American vote, you\'re doing well with these white working class voters, as you did in West Virginia, for example, Pennsylvania, in Ohio, how does that make you feel when you see this issue all of a sudden explode out there?CLINTON: Well, I obviously regret people exploding an issue like that because I think it\'s not only unfounded but, you know, it\'s offensive. I think people vote for me because they think I\'d be the better president. I think people vote for him because they think he\'d be the better president. I think people vote for me because they believe I\'ll fight for them. I think they vote for each of us for whatever combination of reasons that appeal to the individual voter. That\'s the way it\'s supposed to be in America. And I\'ve worked very hard to make it clear to people in this campaign that we need a champion back in the White House.I am not one who believes that we\'re going to be able to come to Washington in 2009, hold hands with everybody, and take on the drug companies and the oil companies and the health insurance companies, and everything we have to do, and that just somehow that will all happen. I think politics is the hard boring of hard boards, as Max Weber said. And from my perspective, people who know how hard it will be to create the changes we need are attracted to my candidacy. People who feel that maybe life hasn\'t been fair, the odds are stacked against them, they want somebody who is going to go to bat for them.(END VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: And you also got a chance to ask Senator Clinton something.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Clinton, I have a question for you. I was wondering, why do you believe that so many of your strongest Democratic supporters say that they would vote for Senator McCain over Senator Obama in the fall if you were not to win the nomination?(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: As a CNN iReporter, you posed questions like that one. Straight ahead, you\'re going to find out how she answered those questions.Also, one question I asked her actually made Senator Clinton very emotional. You\'re going to want to hear exactly what was asked and how she responded.Stay with us. More of the interview with Senator Clinton right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: We continue now with my interview with Senator Hillary Clinton. She\'s defending her decision to keep on fighting, and she\'s vowing her party will be united in the end.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: At CNNPolitcs.com we invited people to submit a question through our iReporters. A couple came in that I want to play for you, get your brief response. This one was from someone named Billy Sutton (ph). He is a Clinton supporter-turned-Obama supporter. But watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Clinton, I have a question for you. I was wondering, why do you believe that so many of your strongest Democratic supporters say that they would vote for Senator McCain over Senator Obama in the fall if you were not to win the nomination?(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, I\'ve heard that from both my supporters and Senator Obama\'s supporters.BLITZER: Because the exit polls showed that -- a big chunk of it.CLINTON: Both his supporters and my supporters might stay home or not vote for the other, and I just have to say as strongly as I can, Billy (ph), that that would be a terrible mistake. Anybody that has ever voted for me or voted for Barack has much more in common in terms of what we want to see happen in our country and in the world with the other than they do with John McCain.So I\'m going to work my heart out for whoever our nominee is. Obviously, I\'m still hoping to be that nominee. But I\'m going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me, the 17 million people who have voted for me, understand what a grave error it would be not to vote for Senator McCain -- Senator Obama and against Senator McCain. And I know that Senator Obama has said that he will do the same to campaign for me.So, you know, in the heat of a primary campaign people get -- their passions are high, they feel intensely. That\'s all understandable. But once we have a nominee, we\'re going to have a unified Democratic Party.BLITZER: Because Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, among others, says the best way to heal this Democratic Party, irrespective of who gets the nomination, is for the two of you to be on the ticket.CLINTON: I know. I think he made a speech or wrote something to that effect. And it\'s premature for either of us to talk about that. I think both of us are committed to doing everything we can to win in the fall. I certainly am.And I will do -- I mean, I will do whatever it takes, because I know what four more years of basically the same Bush policies would mean to America, even though they would be carried out by someone else. They are more of the same. And we cannot afford that.BLITZER: We also got a variant of this question from a lot of our viewers. This was from a McCain supporter. He asked this question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why do you continue to stay in this race for the Democratic nomination? Barack Obama is well ahead of you in the delegates and now ahead of you in the superdelegates. Many of them have switched to him after he won by a large margin over you in North Carolina primaries last week.(END VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: Well, I\'m really touched that a McCain supporter would be so concerned about our primary.But let me say that, after my big win last night in West Virginia, the delegate difference is extremely narrow. It is -- people have gone to conventions and fought out nominations with far fewer delegates. We have a close, close race here. And it is a matter of inches. And we\'re going to keep going until someone gets 2,210 delegates. That\'s the way our system works. BLITZER: John Edwards has says he gives you a lot of credit for being willing to stick -- stick in there and fight it out. He, as you know, dropped out. And I guess the question is, how do you do it every single day? CLINTON: You know, Wolf, something happens every single day that just lifts my spirits and energizes me. A lot of the people who have worked their hearts out for me in this primary season, they\'re not quitters in their own lives. I mean, the single mom in Indianapolis who\'s never given money to anybody and gives me $20 a month out of her paycheck, and goes to my headquarters every lunch hour to work for me, or the little boy who sells his bicycle from Kentucky, or the 88-year-old woman dying in a hospice in South Dakota who just demands that her daughter bring her an absentee ballot, I mean, these are people who I feel like I\'m representing and that I have a -- a very personal connection to. So, you know, I don\'t believe in quitting. You may not win in life, but you do the best you can. You go the distance. You don\'t walk off the court before the buzzer sounds. You never know. You might get a three-point shot at the end. And, so, we\'re going to -- we\'re going to finish this process. It\'s been a privilege and an honor to have met so many Americans, been to so many of the beautiful places in this country. And I feel like I\'m doing it for the right reasons. And I still believe I would be the better president and the stronger candidate against Senator McCain. BLITZER: We have one final question, because we\'re out of time, and it involves your daughter, Chelsea. I have been watching her since she was a little girl. She came to Washington back in \'93, in the \'92 campaign, and now she\'s a grown woman. And she\'s out there, campaigning for you every single day. I think she\'s in Puerto Rico right now. And I know you talk to her every single day. CLINTON: Right. Right. BLITZER: And what goes through your mind, when you have your own daughter out there, working as hard for you as she is? CLINTON: Well, it\'s one of the most incredibly gratifying experiences of my life, as a person and as a mother. You\'re going to make me get very emotional. She is an exceptional person, and she\'s worked so hard, and she\'s done such a good job, that I\'m just filled with pride every time I look at her. You know, obviously, we are very close. We are in communication all the time. But she is doing this because she believes I would be a good president, but also because she cares so much about our country\'s future. She did grow up in the White House. She knows what a difference a president makes. If anybody ever doubted what difference a president makes, after seven years of George Bush, I think the doubts should be put to rest. So, she\'s doing it because she\'s my daughter, but she\'s doing it because, as she says, she\'s a young American who cares about our future. BLITZER: And she\'s doing it because she loves you. CLINTON: Absolutely. BLITZER: Senator Clinton, thanks very much. CLINTON: Thanks.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 14, 2008",b'Interview with Charlie Gibson of ABC News',"b'GIBSON: Senator, taking a, a practical and realistic objective, maybe even cold-blooded view of this race, can you win it? CLINTON: Of course I can. And, that\'s because no one has won it yet. There is no nominee. No one has reached the 2,210 number, which is the, uh, number of delegates needed to win, if you include Michigan and Florida, and both Senator Obama and I agree that we have to include Michigan and Florida, and get their delegates seated. So I think that we\'ve got some additional contests to go. We\'ve got people who are trying to make up their minds, looking at who they believe would be the better president, and the stronger candidate against Senator McCain. GIBSON: But the math is daunting. It may be after next Tuesday that Senator Obama will have the majority of pledge delegates, and indeed, superdelegates are coming to him in a rather steady flow. Indeed, in the last week, he won more of those than you were able to pick up in West Virginia. CLINTON: Well, he, um, has, uh, to reach what is the, the magic number of 2,210. And, uh, he\'s not there yet, and we are working hard. We were thrilled by our victory in West Virginia last night. It was a great validation of my message about fighting for people, and, uh, we\'re going onto Kentucky, and Oregon, and the rest of the contest, and then we\'ll see what happens with Michigan and Florida, and by, you know, June 4th, we\'ll have a clearer idea about where everyone stands. GIBSON: You have cited often, in campaign appearances, I\'ve heard you talk about your 30 plus years in politics. If you were a pundit, commenting objectively on this race, what would you be saying? CLINTON: I would be saying it\'s one of the most exciting, closest races, that we\'ve ever had, at least that anyone can remember. That millions and millions of Democrats and other Americans have been energized, and brought into the process. That each candidate has, uh, drawn, in the neighborhood of seventeen million votes. In fact, I\'m slightly ahead in the popular vote, right now. And that the Democrats should be celebrating, uh, that there is so much interest and excitement, uh, about their candidates. And like everything in life, there is an endpoint. We\'re not there yet, but, uh, it will be reached. But to ask someone, uh, to stop, when it\'s so close, seems to defy political history, or human nature. I\'ve never heard of such a thing going on. You go back and look at, um, uh, political candidates- people went to the conventions with nowhere near the number of votes they needed. Uh, Senator Kennedy kept his, uh, challenge, to President Carter, going for a long time. Obviously, we\'re going to have a unified Democratic party, when we have a nominee, but we don\'t have a nominee, yet. GIBSON: Part of the equation, also, is money. And I know you\'re meeting with your chief financial people, and chief financial supporters, today. How, how deeply in debt is the campaign? CLINTON: Well, we\'ve had, uh, to compete against, uh, uh, a pretty, uh, well-financed war chest. I\'ve raised more money, uh, for a primary election, than anybody ever in American history, except for my opponent, and, uh, from time to time, for the last month, he\'s outspent me two, three, four to one. Uh, and as you know, I\'ve lent money to my campaign, and, uh, we\'ve had to, uh, you know, sort of forward some money, but we\'re going to be fine. We\'re getting the money we need to compete in these last contests, and, uh, I\'m not entertaining any kind of, uh, uh, conclusion, until everybody has a chance to vote. GIBSON: The estimates are the campaign, though, is somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty million dollars in debt. Is that true? CLINTON: Well, Charlie, we\'re going to have enough money to compete, and, uh, I\'m someone who\'s always, uh, taken care of any obligation I\'ve ever had, and if we have any, we will, but I hope to be the nominee, and, uh, that\'ll be taken care of in due course. GIBSON: Given the math of this election, what do you say to someone about why they should contribute at this stage, to your campaign? CLINTON: Because I would be the stronger candidate against Senator McCain. If you look at the electoral map, I think that the argument in my favor is, um, overwhelming. I\'ve won the big states that we have to win. I\'ve won swing states that we have to win. I have a very broad coalition. And, if you were to apply the Republican rules, because the Republican party basically conducts their primary more in line with the electoral map, uh, because they want it to be winner take all in these states, because they know that\'s a, a clearer indication of who will likely win in the Fall, or at least be much more competitive, um, I, I would already be the nominee if we had the Republican rules. Well, we don\'t, so we\'re playing by the rules we have, but when you win the states that I\'ve won, and you put them on an electoral map, I\'ve won more than 298 electoral votes. Senator Obama\'s won about 217. Now, in my electoral vote total, are some states that I don\'t think are going to be easy to win for a Democrat, like Texas, or Oklahoma, or possibly, Indiana. But there are many more states in his electoral map that will be very difficult for a Democrat to win, like Alaska, and Idaho, and Utah, and the rest. So, I, I think that people who are serious about us winning in the Fall, have to start looking at the electoral map, and figure out how we\'re going to have a candidate who actually gets to the 270 electoral vote majority. GIBSON: But, but that\'s an interesting argument, and I wonder if you make it to super delegates. Are you saying, ""I can win Pennsylvania, he can\'t. I can win Ohio, he can\'t. I can win Michigan, he can\'t."" CLINTON: What I\'m saying is that based on the evidence we have, I have a much stronger argument to make, that I can win those states. Uh, I\'ve won them, number one. Uh, and I believe that, uh, I will win them in the Fall. GIBSON: And that he won\'t? CLINTON: Well, I will win them. Um, he could, and he has to make that case to his supporters, and to others. But I think my case is a stronger one. GIBSON: I\'m not sure much should be made of exit polls, but yesterday in West Virginia, sixteen percent of the voters in that state, as they came out of the polling places, admitted, admitted that race was the reason they voted against Barack Obama. Does, does that, in your mind, expose a fault line, in his campaign? CLINTON: No. I think that\'s regrettable, because obviously this is such a historic campaign. Uh, race and gender are facts. Uh, the first African American, the first woman. Uh, but I believe that the vast majority of voters yesterday, an overwhelming majority, uh, chose between us based on who could be better for the economy, and healthcare, and college affordability. Uh, that\'s what I think is really at stake in this election, and I believe that people who, uh, look at the two of us, who look at our records, who look at our plans, who look at our ability to get things done, um, are attracted to my candidacy. GIBSON: You\'re somebody who has worked on civil rights issues for many years in your lifetime. When you see polling results like that, does it disturb you? And, and what does it say about the country? CLINTON: Well, it does, and it also disturbs me when about the same number of people in a lot of polls say that they wouldn\'t vote for a woman. It\'s, it\'s really regrettable. We\'ve come so far in our country, and I think this campaign has shattered so many barriers.And we\'re going to keep shattering them, uh, no matter how it turns out. Uh, because after all, it\'s the Democratic party, who has put forth the two of us. It\'s the Democratic party who has put forth candidates who are making history. And, the vast majority of the voters have, you know, taken into account, obviously who we are, but more importantly, what we stand for, and what we would do if we were their president. And I think that is to the great credit of the voters of this country. GIBSON: You made reference to the fact that some people are concerned still about a female candidate for president. Just looking at the ABC poll of this week. Among whites who hadn\'t gone to college, seventeen percent say they\'d be at least somewhat uncomfortable with a black president. The same group apt to be uncomfortable with a woman president, twenty-one percent. Does that present a real obstacle for whichever one of you is a candidate, in the Fall? CLINTON: Well, we\'re breaking new ground here, Charlie. There are people, as your polls just, um, recited, who, uh, have reluctance about a woman, have reluctance about an African American. But thankfully, those are a relatively small minority, and I\'m not sure that those people would ever vote for, you know, one of us, uh, so we\'re just going to, you know, make it clear that we\'re running for president, uh, in order to be the president, the president of all the people. I want to represent all fifty states, every kind of person that we have in the United States. I\'ve always done that, throughout my entire life and career. I believe strongly in bringing people together. I\'ve been a champion for women\'s rights, and civil rights, and human rights, and, uh, so I\'m going to keep doing everything I can to dear down any artificial barrier that stands in the way of someone being able to, uh, see, uh, the merit of a person\'s candidacy. And, uh, I think we\'ve made a lot of progress in the last, uh, uh, year, in this campaign, getting that job done. GIBSON: A couple of times, you\'ve quoted a different number of delegates that would be needed. Most people work on the premise of two, 2,025, you, uh, included the number over 2,200, which would include Michigan and Florida. Are there active negotiations between your campaign, and Barack Obama\'s, at this stage, some sort of a compromise, that would work out a seating of the Florida and Michigan delegations? CLINTON: Well, both Senator Obama and I agree that the delegation should be seated. It\'s really not up to us, and our campaigns, uh, to make that determination. It is up to the Democratic National Committee, and they have scheduled a meeting on May 31st, which I hope will resolve it. Um, it\'s not, it\'s not my place, or Barack\'s place, to dictate how the DNC makes that determination. It is up to them. Uh, but the important thing is to make sure they are seated. That\'s why the number is, uh, 2,210, because I believe we have to seat Michigan and Florida. Uh, I know that Senator Obama agrees we have to seat them. It\'s a question of, in what way we\'re going to seat them, but once the numbers of their delegates are determined, then they go into the base, and then you have to get a majority of all the delegates. We can\'t be sending a nominee, uh, to our convention, based on only forty-eight states. That would be a, a grave error. And particularly, these two states, that are so important for our electoral chances in the fall. GIBSON: Uh, and I know that meeting is coming on May 31st, but I also think that if, um, that if you and Senator Obama\'s campaigns came to some agreement on what should be done about Michigan and Florida, I think the party might take that, uh, as a real indicator of what ought to be done. I\'m just wondering if there are conversations underway, between the campaigns. CLINTON: No. And, and I, I, I think I would have to respectfully point out, Charlie, that, uh, the leaders of those states have pretty strong opinions, and? GIBSON: Hmm. CLINTON: ?Some of them are for me, and some of them are for Barack, and some of them are uncommitted. Uh, but they don\'t want anybody dictating to them. They want to, uh, do this on their own, and, in each state, there\'s been a challenge filed by a Democratic National Committee member, and, uh, I, I think that, uh, uh, we\'re not in any active negotiations, in part because I don\'t think that that\'s the way this will be resolved. I think it\'ll be resolved, uh, by the states, working with the Democratic National Committee. GIBSON: To have any chance of winning this thing, at this stage, do you have to beat Barack Obama at somewhere where he might be favored? I.E., do you have to win Oregon? CLINTON: I don\'t think so. I think this is a question of who has the most votes, who has the most delegates, who\'s the stronger candidate. I\'m going to work hard, because obviously I value every single one of these remaining contests. And I have been campaigning in, uh, uh, each of them. So I\'m going to do the best I can. But at the end of the day, it\'s the total, uh, picture that will be evaluated by those who have to make this decision. GIBSON: And the one best argument, at this stage, for Hillary Clinton- is it an issue, is it experience, is it electability? What is it? CLINTON: Well I think it is electability, based on experience, based on the issues I stand for, like universal healthcare, a core Democratic value. And based on the states that I\'ve won, the coalition that I have put together, which I believe is a stronger base, on which to run a winning, general election campaign against Senator McCain. GIBSON: Senator Clinton, good to talk to you as always, thank you. CLINTON: Great to talk to you. Thanks, Charlie.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 14, 2008",b'Interview with Katie Couric of CBS News',"b'COURIC: Sen. Clinton, you had an impressive victory yesterday in West Virginia. But, according to our polls, an overwhelming number of your supporters in that state, 73 percent, said they would not be satisfied with Barack Obama with the Democratic nominee. Sixty-one (percent) of your supporters said the same thing after the Pennsylvania primary. Isn\'t that evidenced that, by staying in this race, you are dividing the party? CLINTON: No, not at all. I mean, a primary always creates passionate feelings in supporters. My opponents have a lot of supporters who say the same thing, obviously. But once we have a nominee, which we don\'t yet have, we\'ll have a unified Democratic party. And I\'m gonna work my heart out to make sure we elected a Democratic president. I will make the strongest possible argument that anyone who voted for me or voted for Sen. Obama has much more in common than they do with Sen. McCain and the Republicans. We cannot afford four more years of these failed Republican policies. And the only way we\'ll replace them, since, I\'m sorry to say, appears Sen. McCain is offering more of the same, is by electing a Democratic. So I\'m confident we\'ll have a unified party, we\'ll make a strong case, and will be victorious in November. COURIC: Yet, nearly a third of your supporters in both West Virginia and Pennsylvania said if you are not the nominee they will vote for John McCain in November. So do you think staying in this race helped John McCain the most? CLINTON: No, not at all. In fact, I believe it would hurt our eventual nominee if it is not me, if I were to get out of this race before everyone\'s had a chance to vote. Because it would appear as though I had been somehow pushed out. People had been deprived their right to vote. We will finish this process. We will finish the elections that are still to come. We will seat the Michigan and Florida delegates, I hope, by May 31st. And then we\'ll have a nominee, or very close to it, and we\'ll know who the nominee is. And I will be in a very strong position, as will Sen. Obama, to make the case that we fought a hard fight, everybody participated, now it\'s time to coalesce behind our nominee. And I think we\'ll get a lot of people to agree with that. COURIC: So that one third number, nearly one third number of people who voted for you in West Virginia and Pennsylvania saying they would rather have John McCain in November than Barack Obama, it doesn\'t trouble you? CLINTON: No, because there are a lot of Sen. Obama\'s supporters, if you go back and look at polling, who say the same thing. That they won\'t vote. They\'ll stay home. I that\'s the heat of the primary speaking. And that\'s what happens in the primary. But this has been a very positive and civil primary election process. And I am absolutely confident that once we have a nominee both Sen. Obama and I are gonna work as hard as we can to make the case to our supporters that they should support the nominee so we can have a Democratic president. COURIC: You have the support of blue-collar white voters. But you only get about eight percent of African-American voters. And that\'s usually, as you know Sen. Clinton, what Republicans get. What do you think is behind this racial divide? CLINTON: Oh, I think its pride. I think its excitement. I absolutely understand and respect that. But once we get to November, my supporters, his supporters, no matter who they are, are gonna take a hard look at John McCain in the course of the campaign and realize this is someone who didn\'t support Dr. Martin Luther King holiday. This is someone who has supported President Bush down the line on so many of the issues that really matter to people no matter who they are and where they live. We\'re gonna make a very strong case why our Democratic nominee should attract every single one of the 34 million people who have voted for us. I\'ve received nearly 17 million, Sen. Obama\'s received nearly 17 million; I\'m slightly ahead. Those 34 million people, they will end up voting for the Democrat because there is no reason why they should want to continue the failed policies of George Bush. COURIC: When you give those numbers you\'re including Florida and Michigan? CLINTON: Of course. Because those were legitimate certified elections that were legal and valid, and people actually exercised their right to vote. The only dispute is how do they get the delegates out of those votes? COURIC: And I\'ve raised this with you before, Sen. Clinton, but Barack Obama\'s name wasn\'t even on the ballot in Michigan. CLINTON: Well, that was his choice. He didn\'t have to take his name off. There was no rule requiring that he took his name off. But he did run, along with his supporters, a very vigorous campaign to get people to vote uncommitted. So he had a presence there, even though his name wasn\'t on the ballot. COURIC: A lot of people were struck last week when you noted that you had won the support of hard working Americans, white Americans. Using those words, do you think that was dangerously close to playing the reverse race card? CLINTON: No, not at all. I was just referring to an AP article. You know, people have voted for me because they believe I\'d be a better fighter and a better champion. They believe I would fight for universal healthcare. That I\'d make college affordable. That I\'d try to do something about these outrageous gas prices. That I have a real plan to get out of Iraq. So I think that, you know, there is no doubt that we\'ve had a wonderful, incredibly historic campaign. Obviously, race and gender are part of it, because of who the candidates are. But people have been voting based on who they thought would be the better president and the stronger candidate against Sen. McCain. COURIC: But do you think using the phrase ""white Americans"" was loaded and possibly polarizing? Do you regret it at all? CLINTON: Well, I just was quoting from an article. And obviously, if it gave any pause to anyone then I regret that. But it was, you know, it was just an article that had been written, not by me, but by an objective news service. But this has been an incredibly positive and civil campaign. And we\'ve brought so many new people into the process that I think, you know, once we get to a nomination we\'re going to close ranks behind our nominee. And all voters from every part of our country are going to recognize that we must elect a Democratic president. COURIC: If Barack Obama declares victory, Senator Clinton, once he reaches that magic number of 20 25, will you still hold out if Florida and Michigan have not been counted? CLINTON: Absolutely. Because that\'s not the right number. How can we have a nominee based on 48 states? Especially two states that are so critically important to the Democratic chances in the fall. I think that would be a mistake. We\'re gonna finish this process in three weeks. I just think everybody ought to take a deep breath. We\'re going to, by June 3rd, have all the remaining primaries. We\'ll have the Democratic National Committee making a decision about Florida and Michigan. And then we will be able to look at where each of us stands. And that\'s what I think is the proper way to proceed. COURIC: Can you lay out for me, right now, Senator Clinton, the scenario where, over the next several weeks, you get enough delegates to win this nomination? CLINTON: Certainly. I think that we\'ll do well in these upcoming contests. I think we will get delegates out of Florida and Michigan. I think the super delegates are not bound to support anyone. They don\'t have to stay with any person. They can make a decision today and change it tomorrow. And their job, according to the rules of the DNC, is to exercise independent judgment to determine who would be the best president, and who would be the better, stronger candidate against John McCain. And I think I have a stronger case. I think at the end of this process that case will be self evident and we\'ll see what happens. COURIC: But national polls show you and Sen. Obama doing equally well against Sen. McCain. So why do you continue to insist that you are, in fact, more electable? CLINTON: Well, those are national polls. But if you look at state-by-state polls, which is, after all, how we conduct national elections, because you have to get to 270 electoral votes, I\'ve won states with more than 298 electoral votes. Sen. Obama has won states with 217 electoral votes. Now, some of the states I\'ve won, like Texas and Oklahoma and Indiana are long shots to be in the Democratic column. But many of the states he\'s won, like Alaska and Idaho and Utah and Nebraska and Kansas are also very long shots. And I am closer, if you look at the electoral map, in fact, if we had the same rules as the Republicans have, I would be the Republican nominee right now. And I think it\'s time people start looking at the electoral map. I know one of the news channels had an electoral map during their coverage last night. And . it\'s a pretty convincing story. I\'ve carried the big states. I\'ve carried the swing states. I\'ve carried the states a Democrat has to carry in order to win. COURIC: After your victory in Pennsylvania, you mentioned super delegates a minute ago, after your victory in Pennsylvania, Barack Obama won, so far, the commitment of 57 super delegates. You\'ve netted 15. Aren\'t things trending his way in the super delegate department? CLINTON: Well, I think we both have been picking up super delegates. I think that will continue. But I go back . COURIC: But he\'s gotten 57, Senator, and you\'ve gotten 15. CLINTON: Well, but I go back to the basic point. The game isn\'t over. The elections aren\'t over. No buzzer has sounded. We have to get to 2,210 delegates and then we\'ll have a nominee. And, until we get there, we\'re not likely to know who that nominee will be. COURIC: Can you just help me understand, and perhaps viewers as well, I thought the reason Michigan and Florida weren\'t being counted was because they defied the DNC calendar. CLINTON: Well, they did, but so did other states. And the other states didn\'t face any kind of penalty. And that\'s the argument that is being made by, obviously, people from Michigan and Florida. Who are pointing out that if the DNC rules are to be applied evenly then other states would have also been penalized? The Republicans faced the same dilemma. They quickly disposed of it. They decided to award 51 percent . delegates. They went on. We haven\'t made a decision yet. But we certainly must make a decision. And that decision, I hope, will be made on May 31st. COURIC: Your campaign is . $20 million in debt. With five more contests to go where will you get the money? CLINTON: Oh, well, we\'re getting contributions as we speak. People have been incredibly generous. You know, I have raised more money than anyone ever running in a primary election, except for my opponent. We both have been just breaking every fundraising record there is. But he has out spent me two, three, sometimes four to one. In order to compete in the contests that we\'ve had, I\'ve had to lend my campaign money. And, obviously, we\'re going to, you know, continue to ask our supporters to go to my website, HillaryClinton.com, contribute to make sure this campaign is able to compete in the upcoming contest. And I expect to be the nominee and we\'ll take care of whatever obligations we have. And I\'m someone who always takes care of my obligations. And that is something that I will certainly intend to do. COURIC: So, today, as we speak, you still expect to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States? CLINTON: I do. I absolutely do expect to be the nominee. COURIC: And, if that doesn\'t happen, when will you know, in your heart of hearts, it\'s time to say, ""I gave it my best shot, but I\'m bowing out gracefully?"" CLINTON: That is something that, if we come to it, I will certainly know. But we\'re not there yet. COURIC: I know you said you\'re not going to think about this until the time comes, but . I always ask you questions you\'re not ready to answer; (laughter) so today is no different. A lot of your supporters, including Ed Rendell, for example, governor of Pennsylvania, and a lot of Barack Obama\'s supporters, really want you to consider taking the number two spot on the ticket. Will you, today, rule that out if Barack Obama is the nominee? CLINTON: You know, Katie, I have said I will do whatever I\'m asked and whatever I can do to make sure we win November. But it presumptuous and premature for either one of us to be talking about that kind of decision. It has to be considered once we have a nominee. Which I\'m sure it will be. But I\'m gonna work my heart out. I will do whatever I can to make sure we win the White House. COURIC: So is the translation of that somewhat circumlocutions answer I\'m open to it? CLINTON: Well, I\'m not entertaining it. It\'s just not even anything I\'m entertaining right now. COURIC: And, finally, most games have the opportunity, Senator, to do a ""do-over."" Your husband knows about this well on the golf course. Looking back on your campaign, if you had just one ""do-over,"" what would it be? CLINTON: Katie, I haven\'t had time to think about that. COURIC: Oh, come on Sen. Clinton. CLINTON: No . I mean, someday I\'ll be happy to talk to you about that. Maybe we\'ll do an interview in the White House. But right now I\'m just too focused on today and tomorrow. I don\'t have time or energy to look backwards. I\'m thrilled by my big win in West Virginia. And I\'m looking forward to the upcoming contest. COURIC: So if there\'s one do over you\'re not willing to talk about it publicly at this juncture. CLINTON: I don\'t have the time or the energy to think about it. I\'ve gotta keep focused on the future. COURIC: Sen. Hillary Clinton, thank you very much for your time. CLINTON: Thank you. It\'s great always talking to you, Katie.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 18, 2008","b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN\'s ""Late Edition""'","b'BLITZER: And joining us now, Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, the Democratic presidential candidate. Senator Clinton, thanks very much for joining us.CLINTON: Thank you very much.BLITZER: Congratulations on your win yesterday in West Virginia. A big win for Senator Clinton.CLINTON: Well, it was a big win. And it was a very gratifying one because I had campaigned hard there, and I think that the issues that I\'ve been championing on the economy and health care really resonated with the voters in West Virginia.And as I have said many times in the last couple of weeks, no Democrat has won the White House since 1916 without winning West Virginia. So I took that as a good sign.BLITZER: You did well there. All right, let me get your reaction. The current issue of ""TIME"" magazine, which you\'ve probably seen, you see a cover like this and it says, ""And the Winner Is..."", and a little asterisk. What do you think when you see something like this?CLINTON: I think it\'s a great picture of Barack. You know what I think? Is that this is the closest election we\'ve ever had that anybody can remember. Each of us has brought millions of new people into the process. I think I\'ve now been privileged to receive the votes of 17 million Americans.And that\'s pretty much the same as Senator Obama. The delegate race remains close. We have contests yet to go. People have been trying to end it. And the voters just won\'t let it happen.As a recent poll suggested, 64 percent of Democrats want to see this continue. And I think for good reason, because it\'s one of the most substantive, exciting, energizing political events I can remember in my lifetime.And there is no winner yet. You have to have, now with the special election of a Democrat from Mississippi, 2,210 delegates to actually stay...BLITZER: You\'re including Florida and Michigan.CLINTON: Which we have to. We have to include them.BLITZER: Because in -- they\'re going to be meeting, the Rules Committee of the DNC...CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: ... May 31st.CLINTON: That\'s right. BLITZER: They have to make a decision.CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: What do you want them to do?CLINTON: Well, what I would want them to do is to seat the whole delegations based on the votes that were taken, because I think the voters who came out, over 2.3 million of them in both states, clearly believed that their votes would count. And they may have violated the DNC rules, but other states did as well.BLITZER: Because right now the DNC says that the number is, what, 2,025 or 2,026?CLINTON: That\'s just not a practical answer. That would mean that only 48 states would determine who the nominee of the Democratic Party is. And that\'s not the way the election works.BLITZER: So you\'re staying in at least through May 31 and June 3...CLINTON: That\'s right.BLITZER: ... which is the last -- you\'re not going anywhere.CLINTON: I\'m not going anywhere, Wolf...BLITZER: All right.CLINTON: ... except to Kentucky and Oregon and Montana and South Dakota, and Puerto Rico.BLITZER: In these remaining states. Let\'s talk about some of the issues, the key issues, the economic issues, issue No. 1, the economy. Gas prices...CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: ... right now. You\'ve said in recent days you want to get tough with the major oil exporting countries, OPEC, because of the huge cost per barrel, the resultant price of a gallon of gas.But when you say get tough with OPEC, what does it mean when you have members of OPEC like Ahmadinejad of Iran or Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, or Gaddafi of Libya? How do you plan on getting tough with them?CLINTON: Well, I actually have a four-part program that I would put into effect were I president today to deal with these rising gas prices, which are going to hit $4 soon. And it\'s an enormous burden on people who drive any considerable distance.BLITZER: But what kind of leverage do you have on OPEC? CLINTON: Well, four things, and I\'ll get to OPEC quickly. I would go after the energy traders and speculators. I think they are adding to the cost of a barrel of oil. I believe there is significant evidence of that.So I would launch a Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission investigation and really try to rein them in and close what\'s called the ""Enron loophole."" I approve and voted for what the Congress did yesterday, which is to quit filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I would even release some money.I have advocated a gas tax holiday that is paid for. That is not what Senator McCain wants. He wants one that is not paid for. And Senator Obama doesn\'t want one at all. But I would pay for it out of the record profits of the oil companies.Nine countries that are members of OPEC are members of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, where they have agreed to certain rules that I believe OPEC by definition violates. Also, we have never used antitrust laws in our country to really go at the heart of what is a monopoly cartel.There is something fundamentally wrong and outdated in having the oil-producing countries getting together a couple of times a year and saying, OK, here\'s how much we\'re going to produce and here\'s how much we\'re going to charge for it. And I think there is enough market power in the world, if we use the tools available to us, to rein that in.BLITZER: Because Barack Obama says this...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: You say you\'ve been in the White House for eight years, you\'ve had two terms as a United States senator, and haven\'t said a word about OPEC. And now suddenly you\'re going to take it right to OPEC?(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, he\'s wrong about that. I have voted, actually, in the Senate on several occasions to try to get the president of the United States to do something about OPEC. Obviously, President Bush wasn\'t inclined to do so, the Republican Congress before him was not inclined to do so.So we\'re going to have, I hope, a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. That is the time when we\'ll be able to take on this unfinished business when it comes to energy.BLITZER: Looking back, did the Clinton administration, during eight years of your husband in the White House, do enough toward energy independence?CLINTON: Well, they certainly tried between both the president and the vice president. And my husband often says laughingly that tax credits and energy programs were the only things that he couldn\'t get the Republican Congress to even look at, because obviously they had a very different view about what we should be doing.But now I think it\'s clear to everyone, even the Republican nominee, Senator McCain, who has been very eloquent in the last few days, talking about how we have to cap greenhouse gas emissions, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue.We need a long-term strategy, like the one I\'ve outlined on my Web site, hillaryclinton.com. You can read all about it. And we need a short-term strategy to try to provide relief to citizens right now.BLITZER: You were recently asked about your proposal to have a holiday on the gas tax. And you would pay for it by having a windfall profit tax on ExxonMobil and some of the other big oil companies. And then when you were pressed on economists who would endorse your idea, you said you\'re not going to put your lot in with economists. CLINTON: Right.BLITZER: Which raised questions, are you not going to believe in what economists say?CLINTON: No, but I think there\'s that old saying. You can find an economist to say nearly anything. Now, some of the economists were against it because they misunderstood my policy. They thought it wasn\'t paid for. And I would agree with those who said we can\'t afford a gas tax holiday that will add to the deficit, that will take money out of the highway trust fund. Others are against the mechanism of a windfall profits tax. They think that doesn\'t necessarily work well and that the cost will be passed on.My attitude is I think we could design such a windfall profits tax that would work, that would be enforceable and that would not be passed on. I have been advocating a windfall profits tax on the oil companies to supplement a strategic energy fund that I have recommended for more than three years, and it\'s because I think that there is such a disconnect between what the oil companies have been raking in as profits and any comparable investment or effort that they\'ve made to produce those profits.There does seem to me to be an opportunity here both to take away the subsidies for the oil companies, which clearly don\'t need our tax dollars to make these huge profits, and to try to impose a windfall profits tax.BLITZER: But you will consult with economists...CLINTON: Of course.BLITZER: ... you believe in economists, and if you\'re president of the United States you\'ll work with economists, because when you said, ""I\'m not going to put your lot in with economists..."" CLINTON: Well, not totally. Not totally. You know, sometimes economists are not right. And I think there are political...BLITZER: But most of the economists have criticized your plan.CLINTON: Well, again, some of them didn\'t understand it and some of them don\'t believe it could be done. But you listen to all kinds of advisers, but then you have to try to make up your mind. Franklin Roosevelt, during the New Deal, a lot of economists said that\'s a terrible idea, you\'re going to be priming the pump, you\'re going to be putting people to work. That\'s a terrible idea, that\'s a betrayal of the American capitalist system. But he said, you know we\'ve got to put people to work.Well, I think we\'ve got to reign in the oil companies. And there are certainly economically appropriate ways of doing that.BLITZER: When it comes to the war in Iraq, another issue on the minds of Americans right now, you\'ve criticized Senator McCain for suggesting U.S. troops could stay there perhaps for 100 years. But you yourself back in 2005 suggested, you know what? If there\'s a peaceful environment like along the lines of Korea or Germany or Okinawa, maybe it wouldn\'t be that bad for a long-term U.S. military presence in that kind of environment. Is the criticism of Senator McCain, who\'s made similar comments, is it warranted? CLINTON: Well, I think it is for this reason, that there isn\'t any significant milestone that the Iraqi government has met. It\'s a very different situation than Germany or Korea.BLITZER: But if they were to meet those milestones and if there were a new peaceful environment?CLINTON: But Wolf, I don\'t think though -- I think you\'re confusing kind of cause and effect. I don\'t believe that they will serious attempt to meet those milestones until they are absolutely convinced we are going to withdraw. I believe that is the best way to focus their attention.Everything we\'ve tried, including the most recent effort with the surge, has not resulted in the gains that were either hoped for or forecasted. I believe we\'ve got to bring our troops home. There are continuing missions -- guarding our embassy, Special Forces perhaps dealing with al Qaeda -- but that\'s a very different scenario than what we have today. Therefore, I would begin to bring our troops home.(END VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: Just ahead, more of my interview with Hillary Clinton. She gets emotional, you\'re going to want to see why in part two of this interview. That\'s coming up next.Also, this note. On Tuesday, I\'ll be with the best political team on television. We\'ll be bringing you the results from the Kentucky and Oregon primaries. Our live coverage begins 7 p.m. Eastern from the CNN Election Center. You\'re watching ""Late Edition,"" the last word in Sunday talk.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to ""Late Edition,"" I\'m Wolf Blitzer in Washington. Coming up in our next hour, John Edwards strongly defends Barack Obama\'s foreign policy credentials and tells us why he decided to back his former Democratic rival. But right now, here\'s part two of my interview with Senator Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: The Israelis are celebrating their 60th anniversary right now as an independent state. Here is what McCain said about Barack Obama. And I want to get your reaction. He said, ""I think"" -- this is McCain -- ""I think it\'s very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States. I think that people should understand that I will be Hamas\' worst nightmare. If Senator Obama is favored by Hamas, I think people can make judgments accordingly."" McCain was referring to a statement by the North American spokesman for Hamas endorsing, in effect, Barack Obama. Is McCain right? CLINTON: No, I think that that\'s really, you know, just an overstatement, an exaggeration of any kind of, you know, political meaning. And I don\'t think that anybody should take that seriously.BLITZER: But you have confidence in Barack Obama as president would be a strong supporter of Israel?CLINTON: I would -- yes, I do. I would believe that that would be the policy of the United States, and it\'s been our policy for 60 years.BLITZER: Because the criticism he gets from McCain and his supporters -- McCain\'s supporters -- is that he would be willing to meet unconditionally with the leader of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and given the statements that Ahmadinejad has made about destroying Israel, that doesn\'t -- that doesn\'t reassure, let\'s say, Israel.CLINTON: Well, I think that\'s a different issue. You know, I objected when that statement was made back in an early debate, because I don\'t believe that a United States president should commit to meet unconditionally with leaders of rogue nations. That doesn\'t mean you don\'t eventually meet with them under appropriate circumstances, but not without conditions.BLITZER: Let\'s talk about an issue that\'s come up in this campaign. The issue of race in the campaign. You were widely quoted in that ""USA Today"" interview. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)CLINTON: There was just an ""A.P."" article posted that found how Senator Obama\'s support among working -- hard working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how the -- you know, whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me. I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on.(END AUDIO CLIP) BLITZER: Now, your great friend and supporter, Congressman Charlie Rangel, said -- and I\'m quoting now -- ""It\'s the dumbest thing you could have said.""CLINTON: Well, he\'s probably right.BLITZER: Oh, he is? All right. Well, explain.CLINTON: Well, absolutely. Well, I was -- I was referencing an AP article, and, you know, obviously I have worked very hard to get the votes of everyone. And I have campaigned hard, I understand that we\'ve got to put together a broad coalition in order to win in the fall. We\'ve got to get to that 270 electoral vote margin. And I know Senator Obama has worked hard to reach out to every community and constituency.So I\'m going to continue to do that. That\'s what I think is in the best interest of our party and that\'s how we will win in November.BLITZER: Well, as someone who has championed civil rights all of these years, and you see all these stories coming up, and he\'s getting 90 percent of the African-American vote, you\'re doing well with these white working class voters, as you did in West Virginia, for example, Pennsylvania, in Ohio, how does that make you feel when you see this issue all of a sudden explode out there? CLINTON: Well, I obviously regret people exploding an issue like that, because I think it\'s not only unfounded, but, you know, it\'s offensive. I think people vote for me because they think I\'d be the better president. I think people vote for him because they think he\'d be the better president. I think people vote for me because they believe I\'ll fight for them. I think they vote for each of us for whatever combination of reasons that appeal to the individual voter. That\'s the way it\'s supposed to be in America. And I\'ve worked very hard to make it clear to people in this campaign that we need a champion back in the White House. I am not one who believes that we\'re going to be able to come to Washington in 2009, hold hands with everybody, and take on the drug companies and the oil companies and the health insurance companies and everything we have to do, and that, just, somehow that will all happen. I think politics is the hard boring of hard boards, as Max Faber said. And from my perspective, people who know how hard it will be to create the changes we need are attracted to my candidacy, people who feel that, maybe, life hasn\'t been fair, the odds are stacked against them. They want somebody who\'s going to go to bat for them. BLITZER: At CNNpolitics.com, we invited people to submit a question through our i-reporters. A couple came in that I want to play for you, to get your brief response. This one was from someone named Billy Sutton. He\'s a Clinton supporter turned Obama supporter. But watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Senator Clinton, I have a question for you. I was wondering, why do you believe that so many of your strongest Democratic supporters say that they would vote for Senator McCain over Senator Obama in the fall, if you were not to win the nomination? (END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, I\'ve heard that from both my supporters and Senator Obama\'s supporters. BLITZER: Because the exit polls showed that, a bug chunk of them.CLINTON: Right, that both his supporters and my supporters might stay home or not vote for the other. And I just have to say, as strongly as I can, Billy, that that would be a terrible mistake. Anybody who has ever voted for me or voted for Barack has much more in common, in terms of what we want to see happen in our country and in the world, with the other than they do with John McCain. So I\'m going to work my heart out for whoever our nominee is. Obviously, I\'m still hoping to be that nominee. But I\'m going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me, the 17 million people who have voted for me, understand what a grave error it would be not to vote for Senator McCain -- Senator Obama, and against Senator McCain. And I know that Senator Obama has said that he will do the same to campaign for me. So, you know, in the heat of a primary campaign, people get -- their passions are high. They feel intensely. That\'s all understandable. But once we have a nominee, we\'re going to have a unified Democratic Party. BLITZER: Because Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, among others, says the best way to heal this Democratic Party, irrespective of who gets the nomination, is for the two of you to be on the ticket. CLINTON: I know. I think he made a speech or wrote something to that effect. And it\'s premature for either of us to talk about that. I think both of us are committed to doing everything we can to win in the fall. I certainly am. And I will do -- I mean, I will do whatever it takes. Because I know what four more years of basically the same Bush policies would mean to America, even though they would be carried out by someone else. They are more of the same. And we cannot afford that. BLITZER: We also got a variant of this question from a lot of our viewers. This is from a McCain supporter. He asked this question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Why do you continue to stay in this race for the Democratic nomination? Barack Obama is well ahead of you in the delegates, and now ahead of you in the superdelegates. Many of them have switched to him after he won by a large margin over you in the North Carolina primaries last week. (END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, I\'m really touched that a McCain supporter would be so concerned about our primary. But let me say that, after my big win last night in West Virginia, the delegate difference is extremely narrow. It is -- you know, people have gone to conventions and fought out nominations with far fewer delegates. We have a close, close race here. And it is a matter of inches. And we\'re going to keep going until someone gets 2,210 delegates. That\'s the way our system works.BLITZER: John Edwards says he gives you a lot of credit for being willing to stick in there and fight it out. He, as you know, dropped out. And I guess the question is, how do you do it every single day? CLINTON: You know, Wolf, something happens every single day that just lifts my spirits and energizes me. A lot of the people who have worked their hearts out for me in this primary season -- they\'re not quitters in their own lives. I mean, the single mom in Indianapolis who\'s never given money to anybody, and gives me $20 a month out of her paycheck, and goes to my headquarters every lunch hour to work for me, or the little boy who sells his bicycle, from Kentucky, or the 88-year-old woman dying in a hospice in South Dakota who just demands that her daughter bring her an absentee ballot. I mean, these are people who I feel like I\'m representing, and that I have a very personal connection to. So, you know, I don\'t believe in quitting. You may not win in life, but you do the best you can. You go the distance. You don\'t walk off the court before the buzzer sounds. You never know. You might get a three-point shot at the end. And so we\'re going to finish this process. It\'s been a privilege and an honor to have met so many Americans, been to so many of the beautiful places in this country. And I feel like I\'m doing it for the right reasons. And I still believe I\'d be the better president and the stronger candidate against Senator McCain. BLITZER: We have one final question, because we\'re out of time. And it involves your daughter Chelsea. I\'ve been watching her since she was a little girl. She came to Washington back in \'93, in the \'92 campaign, and now she\'s a grown woman. And she\'s out there campaigning for you every single day. I think she\'s in Puerto Rico right now. And I know you talk to her every single day. CLINTON: Right. Right.BLITZER: And, you know, what goes through your mind when you -- when you have your own daughter out there, working as hard for you as she is? CLINTON: Well, it\'s one of the most incredibly gratifying experiences of my life, as a person, and as a mother. It\'s going to make me get very emotional. She is an exceptional person. And she\'s worked so hard, and she\'s done such a good job that I\'m just filled with pride every time I look at her. You know, obviously, we are very close. We are in communication all the time. But, you know, she is doing this because she believes I\'d be a good president but also because she cares so much about our country\'s future. She did grow up in the White House. She knows what a difference a president makes. If anybody ever doubted what difference a president makes, after seven years of George Bush, I think the doubts should be put to rest. So she\'s doing it because she\'s my daughter, but she\'s doing it because, as she says, she\'s a young American who cares about our future. BLITZER: And she\'s doing it because she loves you. CLINTON: Absolutely. BLITZER: Senator Clinton, thanks very much. CLINTON: Thanks.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 20, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Kentucky and Oregon Primaries',"b'Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you all very, very much. I am so grateful for this victory. And I am so appreciative, because tonight I am thinking about why we are all here. It is not just to win a primary, or even just to win an election; what propels us is the struggle to realize America\'s promise. A nation where every child can achieve his or her God-given potential, where every man and woman has a fair chance, where we fulfill the ideals our founders pledged their lives to defend and our nation was born to uphold. I want to say a special word this evening about someone who has spent his whole life dedicated to realizing the promise of America. Senator Ted Kennedy is one of the greatest progressive leaders in our party\'s history, and one of the most effective senators in our country\'s history. He\'s my friend, and he\'s my inspiration. More than that, he is a hero to millions of Americans whose lives he has fought to better. I am proud to have stood side-by-side with Ted Kennedy to increase the minimum wage, to extend health insurance to millions of children, to help stop insurance companies from discriminating against the sick. But the privileges that I have had and so many others have had because of the battles we have fought side-by-side with him are just a mere handful of what he has done during his entire public service; five extraordinary decades devoted to America. And as a lifelong champion for social justice and equality, his work has made the path easier for me, for Senator Obama, and for countless others. He has been with us for our fights and we\'re with him now in his. And I know he is going to fight with all of his legendary might, supported by his wonderful wife Vicki and his entire family against this latest challenge. And we wish him well and send our thoughts and prayers to him. Tonight we\'ve achieved an important victory. It is not just Kentucky bluegrass that is music to my ears. It is the sound of your overwhelming vote of confidence even in the face of some pretty tough odds. Some have said your votes didn\'t matter, that this campaign was over, that allowing everyone to vote and every vote to count would somehow be a mistake. But that didn\'t stop you. You\'ve never given up on me because you know I\'ll never give up on you. This is one of the closest races for a party\'s nomination in modern history. We\'re winning the popular vote and I\'m more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot counted. I commend Senator Obama and his supporters and while we continue to go toe-to-toe for this nomination, we do see eye-to-eye when it comes to uniting our party to elect a Democratic president in the fall. But I need your help. Your support has made the difference between victory and defeat. Though we have been outspent massively, your support has helped us make our case on the air and on the ground, and your help will keep us going. We\'ve made it this far together, so please go to HillaryClinton.com and together we will make history. And I can\'t do it without you. Now, you know that the stakes are high. After all this country has been through the past seven years, we have to get this right. We have to select a nominee who is best positioned to win in November, and someone who is best prepared to address the enormous challenges facing our country in these difficult times. That is what this election is all about. Now, I\'m told that more people have voted for me than for anyone who has ever run for the Democratic nomination. That is more than 17 million votes. Now, why? Why do millions keep turning out to vote in the face of naysayers and skeptics? Because you know that our political process is more than candidates running, or the pundits chattering, or the ads blaring. It is about the path we choose as a nation and whether or not we will solve our toughest problems. Whether or not we will have a president who will rebuild the economy, end the war in Iraq, restore our leadership in the world and stand up for you every single day. The people I meet along the campaign trail don\'t always make the headlines; the nurses and teachers, the truckers and soldiers, the waitresses and firefighters, the police officers and coal miners, the college students and line workers. The men and women who get up every single day, work hard to make a difference for their families. The people struggling to make ends meet, to find a good job, to pay the bills, to have a shot at the American Dream. For too long, too many Americans have felt invisible in their own country. Well, you\'ve never been invisible to me. I\'ve been fighting for you my entire life. And I want you to remember, we are in this race because we believe that every single American deserves quality, affordable health care, no exceptions. We are in this race because we believe everyone deserves a shot at the American Dream, the opportunity to work hard at a good job to get ahead, to save for college, for a home, for retirement. To fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left at the end of each month; to build a better life for you and your children. We are in this race because we believe this new century poses new challenges to meet and new opportunities to seize, if we only had a president ready, willing and able to lead. To turn the climate crisis into an energy revolution and create million of new jobs; to turn the risks of the new global economy into the rewards of new prosperity shared by all of our people. We are in this race because we believe it will take a Commander-in-Chief with the strength and knowledge to end the war in Iraq safely and quickly, and a president with experience representing the people of the United States in more than 80 countries to restore our leadership and moral authority in the world. And yes, we are in this race because we believe America is worth fighting for. This continues to be a tough fight. And I have fought it the only way I know how - with determination, by never giving up and never giving in. I have done it, not because I wanted to demonstrate my toughness, but because I believe passionately that for the sake of our country the Democrats must take back the White House and end the Republican rule. This country needs our combination of strength and compassion to help people struggling with their bills, living the hard reality of everyday life, in need of our leadership on issues from health care to energy to Social Security. That\'s why I\'m still running and that\'s why you\'re still voting. And I\'m going on now to campaign in Montana, South Dakota, and Puerto Rico. And I\'m going to keep standing up for the voters of Florida and Michigan. Democrats in those two states cast 2.3 million votes and they deserve to have those votes counted. That\'s why I\'m going to keep making our case until we have a nominee, whoever she may be. It is especially sweet tonight because Kentucky has a knack for picking presidents. This state delivered two terms to a president named Clinton. And it\'s often been said, as Kentucky goes, so goes the nation. Neither Senator Obama nor I have won the 2210 delegates required to secure the nomination. And because this race is so close, still separated by less than 200 delegates out of more than 4,400, neither Senator Obama nor I will have reached that magic number when the voting ends on June the 3rd. So, our party will have a tough choice to make. Who is ready to lead our party at the top of our ticket? Who is ready to defeat Senator McCain in the swing states and among swing voters? Who is ready to rebuild the economy and the war in Iraq and protect our national security as Commander-in-Chief? Who is ready on Day One to lead? There are so many Kentuckians that I want to thank. I am so honored by your support and hospitality to me, to Bill and to Chelsea, and I want to thank Jerry and Charlotte Lundergan and my entire Kentucky Steering Committee, including former Governors Wendell Ford, Julian Carroll, John Y. Brown, Martha Layne Collins and Paul Patent. I want to thank Speaker Jody Richards and his wife Neva, former Attorney General, Greg Stumbo, Majority Leader Rocky Adkins and Tina Ward-Pugh, and Terry McBrayer, Joetta Wickliffe and Loretta Bosley. I want to thank my friends in labor for standing by us every step of the way. I am grateful to the Kentucky Veterans for Hillary and honored by your support and your service. I want to thank my chairman, Terry McAuliffe, and my family. I am so grateful to the outstanding staff, volunteers and supporters in Kentucky and in Oregon and across America who have worked so hard. Now, I have one more request to all of my supporters tonight, to the people I\'ve met along the campaign trail, to everyone who has knocked on doors and volunteered and put up signs and donated to this campaign. Keep working. Keep fighting. Keep standing up for what you believe is right, because that is exactly what I\'m going to do. People ask me all the time, how do you keep going? Well, it is you who keep me going. And tonight, I\'m thinking about all of the women I\'ve met who were born before women could vote. Just this week, I met 89-year-old Emma Hollis, an African-American woman, she has seen so many barriers crumble and fall in her lifetime, but she is not finished yet. She has been volunteering out of our campaign office in Covington to help our campaign break the highest and hardest glass ceiling in the land. I\'m thinking about Andrea Steagall, a strong and composed young woman, 20 years old, who drove across Kentucky to meet me. Her husband, Justin, is deployed in Afghanistan. And she told me how important it is that we have a president who will always stand up for our veterans. And I am honored by her support, and by her family\'s service and sacrifice. And I\'m thinking again about Dalton Hatfield, the 11-year-old from Kentucky, who sold his bike and his video games to raise money to support my campaign. And then he asked others to give, too, and he was able to really give me a boost. And this week, I finally had the chance to meet him in Prestonsburg and to say, Dalton, thank you so much .The $422 you raised helped carry the day in Kentucky. That\'s why I\'m in this race, to fight for your future, and that\'s why whatever happens, I\'ll work as hard as I can to elect a Democratic president this fall. The state motto of Kentucky is, ""United we stand, divided we fall."" Words that have a special place in our history. They inspired American revolutionaries to unite the colonies, to defy an empire and create a new nation, to invent a new form of government, of the people, by the people, for the people. And they have bound our nation together in service and sacrifice, even in our darkest hours. We will come together as a party, united by common values and common cause; united in service of the hopes and dreams that know no boundaries of race or creed, gender or geography. And when we do, there will be no stopping us. We won\'t just unite our party; we will unite our country and make sure America\'s best years are still ahead of us. Thank you, and God bless you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 21, 2008","b'Remarks on Counting Every Vote at a ""Solutions for America"" event in Boca Raton, Florida'","b'It\'s exciting to be with some wonderful supporters and friends. I thank your senator and my friend, Ted Deutch, he\'s a real leader. He and I have talked about the issues that matter to you over many years, and I\'m so grateful to have his support. Commissioner Burt Aaronson, who has also led the way in so many important things here in Palm Beach County. I want to thank Jean Enright, one of your port commissioners. I want to thank Anne Gannon, the tax collector who is here, Representative Kelly Skidmore. And I am especially pleased to be accompanied today by a longtime friend of mine, Congresswoman Corrine Brown, who is a real fighter and a champion. She has a tremendously important position in the House of Representatives, where she does work on behalf of veterans and the needs, not only of her constituents in the Jacksonville area, but indeed all of Florida and America. Now, this year\'s presidential election is like none other in history. And we have had more people engaging and volunteering, casting their ballots, than ever before. Everywhere I go, people tell me, ""I\'ve never given money to a campaign in my life; this year is different. I\'ve never followed an election before; this time I can\'t stop watching."" And there\'s a reason for that. With our economy in crisis, and with two wars and our children\'s future in the balance, more people than ever before are taking politics seriously. I happen to welcome that because this is a democracy, and we\'ve all got to participate. In fact, we want more democracy, not less democracy. We want more people taking a part in the selection of their president. Here in Florida, more than 1.7 million people cast their vote, the highest primary turnout in the history of Florida. And nearly 600,000 voters in Michigan did the same. And not a day goes by that I don\'t meet someone who grabs my hand or holds up a sign, no matter where I am, in Kentucky or anywhere else, and says, ""Please, make my vote count."" I receive dozens and dozens of letters and emails and phone calls, every couple of hours it seems like, all making the same urgent request: please count my vote. We used to be worried about voter apathy, didn\'t we? We worried why Americans didn\'t participate. Now, people are worried that their participation won\'t matter. I believe the Democratic Party must count these votes. They should count them exactly as they were cast. Democracy demands no less. I am here today because I believe that the decision our party faces is not just about the fate of these votes and the outcome of these primaries. It is about whether we will uphold our most fundamental values as Democrats and Americans. It is about whether we will move forward, united, to win this state and take back the White House this November. That has to be the prize that we keep in mind. Because here in America, unlike in many other nations, we are bound together, not by a single shared religion or cultural heritage, but by a shared set of ideas and ideals, a shared civic faith, that we are entitled to speak and worship freely, that we deserve equal justice under the law, that we have certain core rights that no government can abridge and these rights are rooted in and sustained by the principle that our founders set forth in the Declaration of Independence. That a just government derives its power from the consent of the governed, that each of us should have an equal voice in determining the destiny of our nation. A generation of patriots risked and sacrificed lives on the battlefield for that ideal. The union they ultimately formed was far from perfect. It excluded many of our citizens; people like Congresswoman Brown, me, my daughter. But it was an ideal that set forth a goal that we have consistently worked for. Fortunately, in each successive generation, this nation was blessed by men and women who refused to accept their assigned place as second-class citizens. Men and women who saw America not as it was, but as it could and should be, and committed themselves to extending the frontiers of our democracy. The abolitionists and all who fought to end slavery and ensure freedom came with the full right of citizenship. The tenacious women and a few brave men who gathered at the Seneca Falls convention back in 1848 to demand the right to vote. It took more than 70 years of struggle, setbacks, and grinding hard work and only one of those original suffragists lived to see women cast their ballots. There are women here today  as with my own mother  who were born before the Constitution granted us the right to vote. This is not something lost in the mists of memory and history; this is real. The generations here in this room have seen change. The men and women who knew their Constitutional right to vote meant little when poll taxes and literacy tests, violence, and intimidation made it impossible to exercise their right, so they marched and protested, faced dogs and tear gas, knelt down on that bridge in Selma to pray and were beaten within an inch of their lives. Some gave their lives to the struggle for a more perfect union. There is a reason why so many have fought so hard and sacrificed so much. It is because they knew that to be a citizen of this country is to have the right and responsibility to help shape its future, not just to make your voice heard, but to have it count. People have fought hard because they knew their vote was at stake and so was their children\'s future. Because of those who have come before, Senator Obama and I and so many of you have this precious right today. Because of all that has been done, we are in this historic presidential election. I believe that both Senator Obama and myself have an obligation as potential Democratic nominees - in fact, we all have an obligation as Democrats - to carry on this legacy and ensure that in our nominating process every voice is heard and every single vote is counted. This work to extend the franchise to all of our citizens is a core mission of the modern Democratic Party, from signing the voting rights act and fighting racial discrimination at the ballot box, to lowering the voting age so those old enough to fight and die in war would have the right to choose their Commander-in-Chief, to fighting for multi-lingual ballots so you can make your voice heard no matter what language you speak. I am proud of our work today. We are fighting the redistricting initiatives that would dilute African American and Latino votes. We are fighting efforts to purge voters from the rolls here in Florida and elsewhere. We are fighting voter identification laws that could wrongly keep tens of thousands of voters from casting their ballots this November. We carry on this cause for a simple reason, because we believe the outcome of our elections should be determined by the will of the people - nothing more, nothing less. We believe the popular vote is the truest expression of your will. We believe it today, just as we believed it back in 2000 when right here in Florida, you learned the hard way what happens when your votes aren\'t counted and the candidate with fewer votes is declared the winner. The lesson of 2000 here in Florida is crystal clear. If any votes aren\'t counted, the will of the people is not realized and our democracy is diminished. That is what I have always believed. My first job in politics was on the 1972 presidential campaign registering African-American and Hispanic voters in Texas. That work took me from home to home in neighborhood after neighborhood. I was determined to knock on every door and sign up every voter I could find. While we may not have won that election, I have never given up the fight. It is a fight I continue to this day. Because I think it is appalling that in the 21st century, voters are still being wrongly turned away from the polls, ballots are still mysteriously lost in state after state, African-American and Hispanic voters still wait in line for hours while voters in the same state, even in the same county can wait just minutes to cast their votes. That\'s why I\'ve been working since 2004 with my dear friend Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones to pass the Count Every Vote Act; comprehensive voting rights legislation designed to end these deplorable violations. It will ensure that every eligible voter can vote, every vote is counted, and every vote can verify his or her vote before it is finally cast. I will continue to fight for that same principle every day in this campaign. The fact is, the people of Florida voted back in January. You did your part. You showed up in record numbers and you made informed choices. But today, some months later, you still do not know if these votes will help determine our party\'s nominee. You still don\'t know if this great state will be represented at our convention in August. It is time you knew, because the more than 2.3 million people who voted in Florida and Michigan exercised their fundamental American right in good faith. You watched the news. You went to the candidates\' web sites, you talked to your friends and neighbors, you learned about our records and policies so you could make informed voting decisions. You didn\'t break a single rule, and you should not be punished for matters beyond your control. Now, I know that Senator Obama chose to remove his name from the ballot in Michigan, and that was his right. But his choice does not negate the votes of all those who turned out to cast their ballots, and we should not let our process rob them and all of you of your voices. To do so would undermine the very purpose of the nominating process. To ensure that as many Democrats as possible can cast their votes. To ensure that the party selects a nominee who truly represents the will of the voters and to ensure that the Democrats take back the White House to rebuild America. Now, I\'ve heard some say that counting Florida and Michigan would be changing the rules. I say that not counting Florida and Michigan is changing a central governing rule of this country - that whenever we can understand the clear intent of the voters, their votes should be counted. I remember very well back in 2000, there were those who argued that people\'s votes should be discounted over technicalities. For the people of Florida who voted in this primary, the notion of discounting their votes sounds way too much of the same. The votes of 1.7 million people should not be cast aside because of a technicality. The people who voted did nothing wrong, and it would be wrong to punish you. As the Florida Supreme Court said back in 2000, before the United States Supreme Court took the case away from them, as your Supreme Court said, it\'s not about the technicalities or about the contestants. It\'s about the will of the people. And whenever you can understand their intent, it should govern. It\'s very clear what 1.7 million people intended here in Florida. Playing a role in the nominating process in a two-party system is just as important as having a vote in the presidential election on Election Day count. We know it was wrong to penalize voters for the decisions of state officials back in the 2000 presidential election. It would be wrong to do so for decisions made in our nominating process. Democrats argued passionately. We are still arguing, aren\'t we, for counting all the votes back in 2000, and we should be just as passionately arguing for that principle today, here in Florida and in Michigan. It is well within the Democratic Party rules to take this stand. The rules clearly state that we can count all of these votes and seat all of these delegates, pledged and unpledged, if we so choose. And the rules lay out a clear process for doing so. With this process, if hope we will honor the will of those who came out to cast votes. Think of how that day was. Workers who rushed to the polls between shifts; students who came between classes, parents who rearranged their family\'s schedules, senior citizens who arranged transportation to the polls, all so you could have your votes counted. And whether you voted for better schools for your kids or a secure retirement for your parents, for jobs you can raise a family on, for health care you can afford, to bring your son, your grandson, your daughter or your granddaughter back from Iraq or bring back America\'s reputation in the world. Whether you voted for me or Senator Obama or Senator Edwards or someone else, each vote you cast is a prayer for our nation, a declaration of your dreams for your children and grandchildren; a reflection of your determination to ensure that our country lives up to its promise. Each vote is a tool, one used throughout history to break barriers, open doors, and widen the circle of opportunity. I remember when President Lyndon Johnson addressed the Congress and the nation urging the passage of the Voting Rights Act. He declared, ""I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy."" It was urgent, elevated language, but it was not hyperbole. Now, as back then, those are the stakes. That\'s why here in Florida, even when you were told your primary might not count, you voted anyway. A Floridian I know from Tallahassee told me about his mother\'s canasta club. It\'s a group of women in their golden years who gather every week to play cards and visit. They talked about that Florida primary every week as they gathered around the card table. They followed the news closely. They discussed the candidates and their positions on the issues. They knew about the dispute over the primary schedule and the question of seating delegates. And when it came time to vote, like so many other good citizens of this state, the ladies of the canasta club dutifully cast their ballots for the candidates of their choice. They made informed choices. They did nothing wrong, and they should not be punished for doing their civic duty. You knew then what Americans know, that this political process of ours is about more than the candidates running, the pundits commenting or the ads blaring. It\'s about the path we choose as a nation. If anyone ever doubted whether it mattered who our president was, the last seven years with George Bush should have removed every single doubt from anyone\'s mind. That\'s why you voted, and that\'s why I\'m running. And that\'s why you\'ve been organizing and raising your voices, hoping to have your votes count. You refused to stay home then, and you refuse to stay silent now. Because you want to change America\'s future and you have faith that your party, the Democratic Party, will give you that chance. I\'m here today because I believe we should keep that faith, listen to your voices and count every single one of your votes. If we fail to do so, I worry that we will pay not only a moral cost, but a political cost as well. We know the road to a Democratic White House runs right through Florida and Michigan. And if we care about winning those states in November, we need to count your votes now. If Democrats send the message that we don\'t fully value your votes, we know Senator McCain and the Republicans will be more than happy to have them. The Republicans will make a simple and compelling argument. Why should Florida and Michigan voters trust the Democratic Party to look out for you when they won\'t even listen to you? Now, if you agree with me, I urge you to go to my website, HillaryClinton.com, and join the more than 300,000 who have already signed our petition asking the Democratic National Committee to count your votes. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the territories will have a chance to play a role in this historic process. Now is not the time for our party to have a dialogue about which states and which votes should count. The people of Florida are all too familiar with where that discussion can lead. In the end, we cannot move forward as a united party if some members of our party are left out. Senator Obama and I are running to be president of all Americans and all 50 states. And I want to be sure that all 50 states are counted and your delegates are seated at our convention. So will you join me in making sure your voices are raised and heard so that your votes can be counted? Because remember, it\'s been the mission of the Democratic Party, guided always by the understanding that as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""the ultimate rulers of our democracy are not the president, the senators, the members of Congress and government officials, but the voters of this country."" In this Democratic Party, the voters rule. So let\'s make sure your voices are heard and your votes are counted. Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 28, 2008",b'Letter to Superdelegates',"b'Dear ___________, The stakes in this election are so high: with two wars abroad, our economy in crisis here at home, and so many families struggling across America, the need for new leadership has never been greater. At this point, we do not yet have a nominee - and when the last votes are cast on June 3, neither Senator Obama nor I will have secured the nomination. It will be up to automatic delegates like you to help choose our party\'s nominee, and I would like to tell you why I believe I am the stronger candidate against Senator McCain and would be the best President and Commander in Chief. Voters in every state have made it clear that they want to be heard and counted as part of this historic race. And as we reach the end of the primary season, more than 17 million people have supported me in my effort to become the Democratic nominee - more people than have ever voted for a potential nominee in the history of our party. In the past two weeks alone, record numbers of voters participated in the West Virginia and Kentucky primaries. And with 40 and 35 point margins of victory, it is clear that even when voters are repeatedly told this race is over, they\'re not giving up on me - and I am not giving up on them either. After seven years of feeling invisible to the Bush administration, Americans are seeking a President who is strong, experienced, and ready to take on our toughest challenges, from serving as Commander in Chief and ending the war in Iraq to turning our economy around. They want a President who shares their core beliefs about our country and its future and ""gets"" what they go through every day to care for their families, pay the bills and try to put something away for the future. We simply cannot afford another four - or eight - years in the wilderness. That is why, everywhere I go, people come up to me, grip my hand or arm, and urge me to keep on running. That is why I continue in this race: because I believe I am best prepared to lead this country as President - and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock Republicans have had on the electoral map and beat Senator McCain in November. Recent polls and election results show a clear trend: I am ahead in states that have been critical to victory in the past two elections. From Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to West Virginia and beyond, the results of recent primaries in battleground states show that I have strong support from the regions and demographics Democrats need to take back the White House. I am also currently ahead of Senator McCain in Gallup national tracking polls, while Senator Obama is behind him. And nearly all independent analyses show that I am in a stronger position to win the Electoral College, primarily because I lead Senator McCain in Florida and Ohio. I\'ve enclosed a detailed analysis of recent electoral and polling information, and I hope you will take some time to review it carefully. In addition, when the primaries are finished, I expect to lead in the popular vote and in delegates earned through primaries. Ultimately, the point of our primary process is to pick our strongest nominee - the one who would be the best President and Commander in Chief, who has the greatest support from members of our party, and who is most likely to win in November. So I hope you will consider not just the strength of the coalition backing me, but also that more people will have cast their votes for me. I am in this race for them -- for all the men and women I meet who wake up every day and work hard to make a difference for their families. People who deserve a shot at the American dream - the chance to save for college, a home and retirement; to afford quality health care for their families; to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left over each month. I am in this race for all the women in their nineties who\'ve told me they were born before women could vote, and they want to live to see a woman in the White House. For all the women who are energized for the first time, and voting for the first time. For the little girls - and little boys - whose parents lift them onto their shoulders at our rallies, and whisper in their ears, ""See, you can be anything you want to be."" As the first woman ever to be in this position, I believe I have a responsibility to them. Finally, I am in this race because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case - and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard - everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee. In the end, I am committed to unifying this party. What Senator Obama and I share is so much greater than our differences; and no matter who wins this nomination, I will do everything I can to bring us together and move us forward. But at this point, neither of us has crossed the finish line. I hope that in the time remaining, you will think hard about which candidate has the best chance to lead our party to victory in November. I hope you will consider the results of the recent primaries and what they tell us about the mindset of voters in the key battleground states. I hope you will think about the broad and winning coalition of voters I have built. And most important, I hope you will think about who is ready to stand on that stage with Senator McCain, fight for the deepest principles of our party, and lead our country forward into this new century.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 1, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Puerto Rico Primary',"b'Thank you so much. I have four words for you: Te quiero Puerto Rico! Never before have these beautiful islands had such an important voice in a presidential election. And I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I cannot thank you all enough. Bill and Chelsea and I are so grateful to the bottom of our hearts for your generosity and your kindness, and I hope that we have helped to draw attention to the concerns of Puerto Rico and we have also helped to spotlight the beauty and the spirit of this wonderful place. I am grateful for this show of overwhelming support. I came to Puerto Rico to listen to your voices because your voices deserve to be heard. And I hear you, and I see you, and I will always stand up for you. I also want to recognize Senator Obama and his supporters. Our two campaigns have turned out record numbers of new voters, determined to chart a new course for America. Now, this primary election has been hard fought because there is so much at stake and we must elect a Democratic president. I am I am overwhelmed by this vote today and I cannot complete this journey without your help. We have two contests left in South Dakota and Montana, and you can make the difference by visiting hillaryclinton.com and helping us make sure we go strong. Every contribution will help us make our case to the voters who are going to be heading to the polls. And I want you to know that this election is really about your future. You voted even though some tried to tell you that your votes wouldn\'t count. You voted for the person you believe will be the stronger nominee and the strongest president. And you are not alone. You are joining millions of people across the United States, more than 17.6 million, plus the votes that we\'ve received today. People who don\'t always make the headlines; who don\'t always feel like your voices are being heard. I think about these people all the time, because that\'s who I care most about. The nurse on her second shift who still can\'t pay her credit card bills; the worker who can\'t afford the gas on the way to work, the waitress on her feet without health care. The small business owners saddled with rising energy bills; the college student who can\'t afford to continue college; the farmer, the teacher, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran. The people yearning for a president who will rebuild the economy and a Commander-in-Chief who will restore our leadership and moral authority in the world. I know that people face tough times. But what I\'ve been impressed by is the resourcefulness and resilience that the people here and across the United States use to face whatever challenges they confront, because they believe they can keep working for a better tomorrow. The American Dream may bend under the weight of challenges we failed to meet and presidents who have failed to lead. It may bend, but it will never break, because that\'s what keeps so many of us going; the thought of a better life tomorrow and a better future for our children. I believe that the people of the United States need a champion in the White House, someone who will be a president in their corner and on their side. I believe you are voting because you want a president who will stand up for universal health care. Who will stand up for action to address the housing crisis, who will stand up for better jobs to protect Social Security. You want to cut through the speeches and the sound-bites to real solutions. And so today you\'ve come out strong. You have defied the skeptics. More people across the country have voted for our campaign, more people have voted for us than for any candidate in the history of presidential primaries. We are winning the popular vote. Now, there can be no doubt, the people have spoken and you have chosen your candidate. And it\'s important where we have won. We are winning these votes in swing states and among the very swing voters that Democrats must win to take back the White House and put this country back on the path to prosperity. Together, we\'ve won the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arkansas, West Virginia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, and, yes, Michigan and Florida. And I hope by my second term, regardless of what the people of Puerto Rico decide about the status option you prefer, you too will be able to vote for the next president of the United States. So, when the voting concludes on Tuesday, neither Senator Obama nor I will have the number of delegates to be the nominee. I will lead the popular vote. He will maintain a slight lead in the delegate count. The decision will fall on the shoulders of those leaders in our party empowered by the rules to vote at the Democratic Convention. I do not envy the decision you must make, but a decision has to be made, and in the final assessment, I ask you to consider these questions: Which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary? Which candidate is best able to lead to us victory in November? And which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad? I am in this race because I believe I am that candidate, and I will be that president. We are winning the popular vote because we have stood for the core principle of our party, a party that believes in universal health care - no one left out. A party that believes hard working, middle-class families deserve a fair shot at the American Dream, a party that believes we must bring our troops home from Iraq safely, responsibly, and honorably. A party that cherishes every child, values every family, and counts every single vote. We are winning against John McCain and beating him in the key states. We have what it takes to get the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the White House. And the majority of voters know who is ready on Day One to serve as our president. A president who will bring strength, knowledge, and experience to the White House to solve our toughest problems. A president who knows firsthand the challenges of the job, as well as its power to make a positive difference in people\'s lives. That\'s why I\'m in this race. Ultimately it\'s not about Senator Obama or me. It\'s about you - your hopes, your interests, your futures. It\'s about the direction we choose as a nation. With two wars abroad and an economic crisis at home, we have to get this right. Our country cannot afford four more years of more of the same. So, today Puerto Ricans across this beautiful place that I have come to enjoy so much made your voices heard and your votes counted, and for that, I want to thank my co-chairs, Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Puerto Rico Democratic Chair Roberto Prats, political directors Rafi Rodriguez Aguayo and Representative Jorge Colberg, Elections Representatives, Representative ""Junior"" Gonzalez and Rene Estades. Jose Hernandez Mayoral, Former Governor Carlos Romero, Miguel Lausell, Virgilio Ramos, and Luisette Cabanas. And special thank you to coordinator Ramon Luis Lugo, deputy coordinator Francisco Domenech, and advisor Jeffrey Farrow. And I want to thank all of my volunteers, my staff, my supporters; everyone who waved at us as we caravanned all day yesterday. And I want to reiterate what I have said across Puerto Rico, together, in my first term, we will finally enable the status question to be resolved, based on the principles that government should be representative at all levels, and the people of Puerto Rico deserve the opportunity to choose from among all of the options. Together we will work to ensure that Puerto Rico is treated equally when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid and the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, tax breaks for creating jobs, and more. I will be your champion. And I want to thank all of my friends in our labor unions, all of them who have done so much for us. It has been a joy to work with every single union that has been here supporting me. We would not be here without you tonight. And I want to say a special word of thanks to the Hispanic community, not just in Puerto Rico, but across the United States. I am so honored you have stood by me throughout this campaign. I am grateful for your love, your friendship, and your support. What we have seen in this campaign and what we have always known is that Hispanic Americans, Latinos from every part of Latin America, care deeply about the future of the United States. You contribute so much to the greatness of this country, to business and academia, to labor, to the professions, to entertainment, to sports, to every part of society. And you have also contributed greatly to expanding the horizons and the diversity of our country. I am so grateful to you, and I am so proud of the support you have given me. I also wish to thank my family for their incredible love and support, Bill and Chelsea, my mother, my brothers, Hugh and Tony, my sister-in-laws, Maria and Megan, and all who are helping here in Puerto Rico and South Dakota and Montana. Because we are in this to choose a candidate who we know will not only stand up for us but unite us. We will be strengthened by the enthusiasm of the millions of people who have voted and volunteered in all of these contests. We are propelled by this unique moment in history. The campaign has been an extraordinary journey, and I am grateful for every day of it; every single day something happens which reinforces my commitment and lifts my spirits. It might be a young child who is introduced and says, ""I want to grow up to be president."" It might be a young mother who says, ""I have no health insurance. I hope you will help me."" It might be an older man, who says, ""I am a veteran, but I cannot get the help I deserve."" Every story like that reinforces my commitment to what we are doing together. People deserve better from their government. The people of Puerto Rico deserve better from the federal government. So, I call on you to travel this final stretch with me, to join me as we take America back and lead our country with confidence and optimism into this new century. Let\'s keep fighting for our dream. Let\'s keep fighting for what we believe. Let\'s keep fighting for one another. Let\'s keep fighting for America. America is worth fighting for. Thank you, and God bless you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 3, 2008",b'Remarks in New York City Following the Montana and South Dakota Primaries',"b'Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you all so much. Thank you, and thanks so much to South Dakota. You had the last word in this primary season, and it was worth the wait. (APPLAUSE) I want to start tonight by congratulating Senator Obama and his supporters on the extraordinary race that they have run. Senator Obama has inspired so many Americans to care about politics and empowered so many more to get involved. And our party and our democracy is stronger and more vibrant as a result. So we are grateful. (APPLAUSE) And it has been an honor to contest these primaries with him, just as it is an honor to call him my friend. And, tonight, I would like all of us to take a moment to recognize him and his supporters for all they have accomplished. (APPLAUSE) Now, 16 months ago, you and I began a journey to make history and to remake America. And from the hills of New Hampshire to the hollows of West Virginia and Kentucky, from the fields of California to the factories of Ohio, from the Alleghenies to the Ozarks to the Everglades, to right here in the great state of New York, we... (APPLAUSE) We saw millions of Americans registering to vote for the first time, raising money for the first time, knocking on doors, making calls, talking to their friends and neighbors, mothers and fathers lifting their little girls and their little boys onto their shoulders and whispering, ""See, you can be anything you want to be."" AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! (APPLAUSE) MRS. CLINTON: And I think, too, of all those... AUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! MRS. CLINTON: ... all those wonderful women in their 90s who came out to see me, because they were born before women could vote, and they wanted to be part of making history, and the people who drove for miles, who waved their handmade signs, who went to all the events that we held, who came to HillaryClinton.com and showed the tangible support that they felt in their hearts. And I am just enormously grateful, because, in the millions of quiet moments, in thousands of places, you asked yourself a simple question: Who will be the strongest candidate and the strongest... (APPLAUSE) Who will be ready to take back the White House and take charge as commander-in-chief and lead our country to better tomorrows? People in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories, all had a chance to make your voices heard. And on election day after election day, you came out in record numbers to cast your ballots. Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes... (APPLAUSE) ... for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. (APPLAUSE) Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting. You\'re the nurse on the second shift, the worker on the line, the waitress on her feet, the small business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran, the student, the hard-working men and women who don\'t always make the headlines, but have always written America\'s story. You have voted because you wanted to take back the White House. And because of you... (APPLAUSE) ... we won, together, the swing states necessary to get to 270 electoral votes. (APPLAUSE) And you know... AUDIENCE: Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will! Yes, she will! MRS. CLINTON: In all of the states, you voted because you wanted a leader who will stand up for the deepest values of our party, a party that believes everyone should have a fair shot at the American dream, a party that cherishes every child, values every family, and counts every single vote. (APPLAUSE) I often felt that each of your votes was a prayer for our nation, a declaration of your dreams for your children, a reflection of your desire to chart a new course in this new century. And, in the end, while this primary was long, I am so proud we stayed the course together. (APPLAUSE) Because we stood our ground, it meant that every single United States citizen had a chance to make his or her voice heard. A record 35 million people voted in this primary... (APPLAUSE) ... from every state, red, blue, purple, people of every age, faith, color, and walk of life. And we have brought so many people into the Democratic Party and created enthusiasm among those we seek to serve. And I am committed to uniting our party so we move forward stronger and more ready than ever to take back the White House this November. (APPLAUSE) You know, for the past seven years, so many people in this country have felt invisible, like your president didn\'t even really see you. I have seen the shuttered factories, the jobs shipped overseas, the families struggling to afford gas and groceries. But I\'ve also seen unions re-training workers to build energy- efficient buildings, innovators designing cars that run on fuel cells and biofuels and electricity, cars that get more miles per gallon than ever before, cars that will cut the cost of driving, reduce our reliance on foreign oil, and fight global warming. (APPLAUSE) I have met too many people without health care, just a diagnosis away from financial ruin. But I\'ve also seen the scientists and researchers solving the medical mysteries and finding the treatments and cures that are transforming lives. I\'ve seen the struggling schools with the crumbling classrooms and the unfair burdens imposed by No Child Left Behind. But I have also met dedicated and caring teachers who use their own savings to buy supplies and students passionately engaged in the issues of our time, from ending the genocide in Darfur to once again making the environment a central issue of our day. (APPLAUSE) None of you, none of you is invisible to me. You never have been. (APPLAUSE) I see you, and I know how hard-working you are. I\'ve been fighting for you my whole adult life, and I will keep standing for you and working for you every single day. Because in your courage and character, your energy and ingenuity, your compassion and faith, I see the promise of America every day. The challenges we face are great, but our determination is greater. You know, I understand that that a lot of people are asking, ""What does Hillary want? What does she want?"" Well, I want what I have always fought for in this whole campaign. I want to end the war in Iraq. (APPLAUSE) I want to turn this economy around. I want health care for every American. I want every child to live up to his or her God-given potential. And I want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be respected, to be heard, and no longer to be invisible. (APPLAUSE) You see, I have an old-fashioned notion, one that\'s been the basis of my candidacy and my life\'s work, that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their own dreams. This nation has given me every opportunity, and that\'s what I want for every single American. (APPLAUSE) That\'s why I want universal health care. It is wrong... (APPLAUSE) ... that Americans pay 50 percent more for health care than the people of any other wealthy nation, with costs doubling this decade, and nearly 50 million people without any health insurance at all. It is wrong for parents to have to choose between care for themselves or their children, to be stuck in dead-end jobs just to keep their insurance, or to give up working altogether so their kids will qualify for Medicaid. I\'ve been working on this issue not just for the past 16 months, but for 16 years. And it is a fight... (APPLAUSE) It is a fight I will continue until every single American has health insurance, no exceptions and no excuses. I want an economy that works for all families. That\'s why I\'ve been fighting to create millions of new jobs in clean energy and rebuilding our infrastructure, jobs to come to all of our states, and urban and rural areas, and suburban communities and small towns. And that\'s why I sounded the alarm on the home mortgage crisis well over a year ago... (APPLAUSE) ... because these are the issues that will determine whether we will once again grow together as a nation or continue to grow apart. And I want to restore America\'s leadership in the world. I want us to be led once again by the power of our values, to have a foreign policy that is both strong and smart, to join with our allies and confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to global terrorism and global warming. These are the issues that brought me into this race. They are the lifeblood of my campaign. And they have been and will continue to be the causes of my life. And your spirit... (APPLAUSE) ... your spirit has inspired me every day in this race. While I traveled our country, talking about how I wanted to help you, time and again you reached out to help me, to grab my hand or grip my arm, to look into my eyes and tell me, ""Don\'t quit. Keep fighting. Stay in this race."" (APPLAUSE) Now, there were days... (APPLAUSE) ... when I had the strength -- there were the days when I had the strength enough to fight for all of us. And on the days that I didn\'t, I leaned on you, the soldier on his third tour of duty in Iraq who told his wife, an Iraqi veteran herself, to take his spending money and donate it to our campaign instead... (APPLAUSE) ... the 11-year-old boy in Kentucky, who sold his bike and video games to raise money for our campaign, the woman who came to a rally hours early, waited and waited to give me a rosary, and all those who whispered to me, simply to say, ""I am praying for you."" So many people said this race was over five months ago in Iowa, but we had faith in each other. And you brought me back in New Hampshire, and on Super Tuesday, and in Ohio, and in Pennsylvania, and Texas, and Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Puerto Rico, and South Dakota. (APPLAUSE) I will carry your stories and your dreams with me every day for the rest of my life. Now, the question is: Where do we go from here? And given how far we\'ve come and where we need to go as a party, it\'s a question I don\'t take lightly. This has been a long campaign, and I will be making no decisions tonight. (APPLAUSE) But this has always been your campaign. So, to the 18 million people who voted for me, and to our many other supporters out there of all ages, I want to hear from you. I hope you\'ll go to my Web site at HillaryClinton.com and share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can. And in the coming days, I\'ll be consulting with supporters and party leaders to determine how to move forward with the best interests of our party and our country guiding my way. And I want... (APPLAUSE) I want to conclude tonight by saying, ""Thank you."" Thank you to the people across America for welcoming me and my family into your homes and your hearts. Thanks to all of you in every corner of this country who cast your votes for our campaign. I am honored and humbled by your support and your trust. Thanks to my staff and volunteers for all those long hours and late nights. (APPLAUSE) And I thank your families and your loved ones, as well, because your sacrifice was theirs. And I especially want to thank all of the leadership of my campaign, our chairman, Terry McAuliffe, and everyone who worked so hard. (APPLAUSE) And, of course, my family, for their incredible love, support, and work, Bill and Chelsea... (APPLAUSE) ... Hugh and Maria, Tony and Megan, Zach and Fiona, and my mother, who turns 89 tomorrow. (APPLAUSE) And, finally, I want to thank all of the people who had the courage to share your stories with me out on the campaign trail. Tonight, I am thinking of a woman I met just yesterday in Rapid City, South Dakota. We were outside Tally\'s Restaurant. There was a crowd there as I was walking into the restaurant, and she was standing right up against the barrier. She grabbed my hand, and she said, ""What are you going to do to make sure I have health care?"" And as she was talking, she began to cry. She told me she works three jobs; she has suffered from seizures since childhood; she hasn\'t been able to afford insurance ever since she left her parents\' home. It is shameful that anyone in this country could tell that story to me. (APPLAUSE) And whatever path I travel next, I promise I will keep faith with her and with everyone I met across this great and good country. You know, tonight, we stand just a few miles from the Statue of Liberty and from the site where the Twin Towers fell and where America rose again. Lady Liberty\'s presence and the towers\' absence are a constant reminder that here in America we are resilient, we are courageous, we embrace all of our people, and that, when we face our challenges together, there is no barrier we can\'t overcome, no dream we can\'t realize, nothing we can\'t do if we just start acting like Americans again. Thank you all very much. God bless you, and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 4, 2008","b'Remarks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference in Washington, D.C.'","b'Thank you all very, very much. Thank you. It is wonderful being here with all of you, among so many friends and I feel like this is a giant family reunion. The largest AIPAC gathering in history and I feel like I am among family and thank you for the warm welcome. I want to thank my friend, Lonny Kaplan, for his leadership and that introduction. I also want to thank Howard Friedman for his leadership as president and to congratulate David Victor on his election. I want to commend Howard Kohr, AIPAC\'s distinguished board of directors, and all of the AIPAC staff who work so hard every day all year round. And I particularly want to acknowledge the many students in the audience from around the country, the future of AIPAC and the U.S.-Israel relationship. I want to pay tribute to one member of the AIPAC family and my very good friend who is not with us this year, Congressman Tom Lantos. Tom bore witness to the worst of human cruelty and devoted his life to stopping it. He taught us to stand up for what\'s right, even when it\'s hard, especially when it\'s hard. And we will always cherish his memory and his wonderful family will always be in our hearts. And finally, I want to thank all of you for coming to Washington, D.C., once again to stand strong with Israel and to strengthen that special bond between our countries. Being here today, I am reminded of a passage in Isaiah: ""Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted sentinels; all day and all night, they shall never be silent."" Just like the sentinels of old, you are never silent, you never grow weary and you never stop standing up for and fighting for Israel. Now, I know that there are some who say you shouldn\'t be here, who say speaking up for a strong, American-Israeli relationship is somehow at odds with America\'s interests. Well, I believe that speaking up for a strong American-Israeli relationship is essential to our interests. And I reject that our common commitment to Israel\'s survival and well-being is not in the best interests of the United States of America. I think you not only have a right to stand up for what you believe in, you have a responsibility as Americans to do so. You are acting in the highest American tradition, exercising a right enshrined in our constitution - the right to petition your government. And I applaud you for it. Of course, I am privileged to represent one of the largest Jewish constituencies in the world. Is there anyone from New York even here in this audience today? I know you will be talking to your Members of Congress this week, but you won\'t need to ask me where I stand, because you already know the answer. I stand with you and for you. v The United States and Israel have an incredible bond, as allies, friends, as partners. We have shared interests. We have shared ideals. These are not just common values. They are our core values: freedom, democracy, and human rights, women\'s rights, a robust civil society. And we stand with Israel, because Israel demonstrates that democracy can flourish in the most difficult conditions, because its very existence is a stinging rebuke to hatred and the holocaust, because in defeating terror Israel\'s cause is our cause, and because Israel\'s struggle is a struggle not just for the Jewish people but for all people who want to live in peace and security under a democratically elected government. President Harry Truman certainly understood the importance of Israel. He recognized the new nation just 11 minutes after David Ben-Gurion read the proclamation of independence. So it is with joy and some sense of relief that we celebrate the 60th anniversary of that day. And for all of the trials and tears, what a remarkable 60 years it has been. From my first trip to Israel in 1982 to my most recent, I have seen firsthand what Israel has achieved - the desert is blooming again. And we can be so proud of the role that America has played in this success. Every American president since Truman recognized the special relationship and has made it stronger. Israel is stronger because of us and because of you. But even as we celebrate these achievements, we know the work is far from over. Israel is not yet safe. The values that Israel represents are not yet secure. Our hearts go out in particular to the courageous citizens of cities like Sderot and Ashkelon who live in fear that a rocket will fall on their homes or their children\'s schools at any moment. I have seen these security challenges firsthand. In 2002, I went to the Sbarro Pizzeria with then President Olmert just a few weeks after that tragic suicide bombing there. I visited with victims of terrorism in the Hadassah Hospital. I have been to Gilo and seen the security fence protecting Israeli families from attacks in their own homes. I have stood up and have spoken out for their right to have that protective fence. As a senator from New York, who has talked way too much, I have seen the tragic toll of terrorism on 9/11 here at home as well. My support for Israel does not come recently or lightly. I know it is right in my head, in my heart and in my gut. And that is exactly the commitment we need in our next president - a Democratic president, because the Democratic Party\'s strong commitment to the state of Israel since the days of Harry Truman endures today. It is one of our party\'s most cherished values and it will continue under the next Democratic president. I know Senator Obama understands what it is at stake here. It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him. It is an honor to call him my friend. And let me be very clear: I know that Senator Obama will be a good friend to Israel. I know that Senator Obama shares my view that the next president must be ready to say to the world: America\'s position is unchanging, our resolve unyielding, our stance nonnegotiable. The United States stands with Israel, now and forever. Let me underscore that I believe we need a Democrat in the White House next January because it is not just Israel that faces challenges in the 21st century, America does, too. The next president will inherit grave problems, difficult threats - a war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq, America\'s reputation at an all-time low, the continued threat of terrorism at home and abroad. President Bush has moved us in the wrong direction. For all the strong rhetoric you heard from Senator McCain on Monday, he will continue the same failed policies in Iraq and weaken our security, making the Middle East a more dangerous place. America needs a new beginning in our foreign policy to make our country stronger and, frankly, to make our position in the world more credible, to give us the strategic leverage back that we have lost over the last seven years. We cannot stand strongly with Israel if we are not strong at home and if we are not respected and considered strong and the leader of the world everywhere else. We have a rare moment of opportunity to change America\'s course and restore our standing in the world. We must seize this moment by leading our friends and allies in building the world we want rather than simply defending against a world we fear. We must build a world that will be safer, more prosperous, and more just. I believe security and opportunity go hand-in-hand. When children have hope, a real belief that there is opportunity ahead for them, we help to dry up the swamp of fear and pessimism that breeds terrorism. That means supporting education, not just for boys but for girls too. It also means that real economic opportunity can\'t grow where there is no security. And that opportunity alone is not enough to overcome extremism. I have been very specific about how I would make this new foreign policy vision that I share, and I think many of you do as well, a reality. Today I want to lay out three principles that I hope will guide us in all that we do with Israel and why it is important to put that relationship into the broader context of what foreign policy is in the best interests of the United States. First, I have a bedrock commitment to Israel\'s security because Israel\'s security is critical to our security. When Islamic extremists, including the leaders of nations, proclaim death to America, death to Israel, we understand that our two nations are fighting a shared threat. Those of us in this room know this bond is so much more personal than any security agreement or risk assessment. We know a shared threat can also mean shared sorrow. When eight young men were killed in a Jerusalem yeshiva in March including a 16-year-old American named Abraham David Moses, we reunited in our grief. So, I strongly support Israel\'s right to self-defense. Israel has both the right and the obligation to defend its citizens and I believe America should aid in that defense. I am proud to support the $2.5 billion in security assistance for Israel and the Foreign Aid Bill and I am committed in making sure that Israel maintains a military edge to meet increasing threats. Part of our commit Israel\'s security is a commitment to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. I am deeply moved by the legacies of so many leaders who have sacrificed so much in the quest for peace, like my friend Yitzhak Rabin, and the warrior, Ariel Sharon, who is in our thoughts and prayers. We must support Israel and in making the tough choices for peace. I believe that U.S. diplomacy is critical to making progress and consistent U.S. involvement can lower the level of violence and restore our credibility in the region. We need to talk to all sides but all parties must know we will always stand with Israel in its struggle for peace and security. Israel should know that the United States will never pressure her to make unilateral concessions or to impose a made-in-America solution. Palestinians will need to do their part by renouncing violence and teaching their children the ways of peace and tolerance. We must show Palestinians and moderate Arabs that the path of reconciliation is better than the terrorist road to self-destruction. I am deeply concerned about the growing threat in Gaza. Hamas has built a military force equipped with sophisticated weapons from Iran. Hamas\' campaign of terror has claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent Israelis. Its charter calls for the destruction of Israel. It has shown no commitment to peace or to renouncing violence. So, we must be clear about how we feel about our next president negotiating directly with Hamas. Here is how I feel: until Hamas renouncing terrorism and recognizes Israel, negotiating with Hamas is unacceptable for the United States. We must continue to demand a return of the Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas and by Hezbollah - Ehud Goldwasser, Eldad Regev, Gilad Shalit. I have been privileged to know Karnit Goldwasser, Ehud\'s wife and I was proud to sponsor the resolution that passed the Senate calling for their immediate release. I will not stop fighting and pressing for these soldiers to come home until they finally are safely home with the families that are waiting for them. The second principle is a simple one: no nuclear weapons for Iran. Iran is a country whose leaders, whose president denies the Holocaust. He defies the international community. His government trains, funds, and arms Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists in attacking Israeli civilians. He threatens to destroy Israel. Just this week, he said that Israel is about to die and will soon be erased. We can never let Iran obtain nuclear weapons. The next president will have to deal with the Iranian challenge from day one. This is not just in Israel\'s interests. It is in America\'s interests and the world\'s interests, and this is a threat that I take very seriously. I\'m a co-sponsor the Iran Nonproliferation Act. I support calling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard what it is: a terrorist organization. I have also said that should Iran ever, ever contemplate using nuclear weapons against Israel, they must understand what the consequences will be to them. But we must do everything in our power to prevent such an unthinkable day from ever happening and the best way to do that is to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons in the first place. We should start by developing an international consensus against Iran\'s nuclear program with a set of tougher sanctions if Iran continues to defy the international community. We should also work with Israel and moderate Arab neighbors to roll back Iran\'s influence in that region. If the Iranian government wants to become a responsible member of the international community, we would wholeheartedly welcome that change but Iran simply cannot be allowed to continue its current behavior and I wish to underscore I believe that we are further behind in constraining Iran today because of the failed policies of President Bush than we would have been had we taken a much more aggressive engagement course earlier. That is why it is imperative that we get both tough and smart about dealing with Iran before it is too late. Now my third principle is standing up against hatred and anti-Semitism wherever it is found and it is not only Israelis and Jews who need to be speaking out against anti-Semitism, it is every fair-thinking person who understands that it directly affects you as well. I have spoken out for years against anti-Semitism in Palestinian schools. I am appalled, still today, the Palestinian textbooks reject Israel\'s right to exist and describe Israel\'s founding as a catastrophe that\'s unprecedented in history. That is not education, it is indoctrination. We also know that the Saudis have textbooks describing Jews as wicked and we were all revolted when Iran\'s President held a conference to deny the holocaust, but our vigilance against anti-Semitism must go beyond the Middle East. It must receive no quarter anywhere in the world. The next president will face a test of resolve on this issue, at the 2009 Durban Conference, also called the Durban II. I will never forget how the world\'s first conference against racism became a mockery of itself when it descended into anti-Semitism and hatred. The debacle at Durban must never be repeated. We should take very strong action to ensure anti-Semitism is kept off the agenda at Durban II and if those efforts fail, I believe that the United States should boycott that conference. The challenge of fighting anti-Semitism is indeed great, but we know it is possible to change hearts and minds. We saw it recently when Magen David Adom was finally included in the international Red Cross after years of being singled out for being Israeli. On one of my trips to Israel, I met an MDA member named Natan, an Ethiopian Jew who had saved many innocent lives when he tackled a terrorist carrying explosives. It was a miracle that Natan had survived. His valor was extraordinary and it was just what you would expect from a member of the MDA. That\'s why I was so proud to take up the MDA\'s cause, sponsoring legislation and speaking out. And I was very pleased as all of us were when the International Red Cross righted this historic wrong. On a personal level, I was honored when Natan accepted my invitation to come to New York and walk with me in our Salute to Israel parade. In a way we are still walking together and the image of this very dignified Ethiopian Jew, now an Israeli, walking in that parade down Fifth Avenue, bearing the scars of his heroic rescue effort to prevent the terrorists from destroying more lives, was one I will carry with me my entire life because that was really Israel. It wasn\'t just everyone on the sides of the streets waving. It was this proud young man who had kept Jewish traditions alive and as a long string of those for centuries who had done so and who had finally come home to Israel and had given so much to protect the country that had given him a new life. So while it can be easy to be discouraged when we look at the challenges ahead, we can never lose our resolve and never give up hope. What gives me not just hope but the underlying reality that can be delivered by those who work together, is that the power of the values we share with Israel are such an unshakable and unbreakable bond, and the difference that America can make is so critical. Let me leave you with just in glimpse of why America matters and why AIPAC matters. In her memoir, one of my personal heroines, Golda Meir, wrote about the wonderful moment, 60 years ago, when Israel joined the family of nations and America stood at her side. Here is what she wrote: ""a few minutes after midnight, my phone rang. It had been ringing all evening and as I ran to answer it, I wondered what bad news I would hear now."" Doesn\'t that sound familiar? ""But the voice at the other end of the phone sounded jubilant. \'Golda, are you listening? Truman has recognized us.\' I can remember what I said or did but I remember how I felt. It was like a miracle and I was filled with joy and relief."" That was the decision that one American president made, to be there for Israel at a time of need. That is the decision that the next president must be ready to make as well. To the members of AIPAC, just know your cause is just, your voice is strong. Washington and the world is listening. So go forth and speak up for what you know is right. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel and God bless America. Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 7, 2008",b'Remarks Conceding the Democratic Presidential Nomination',"b'Thank you so much. Thank you all. Well, this isn\'t exactly the party I\'d planned, but I sure like the company. I want to start today by saying how grateful I am to all of you  to everyone who poured your hearts and your hopes into this campaign, who drove for miles and lined the streets waving homemade signs, who scrimped and saved to raise money, who knocked on doors and made calls, who talked and sometimes argued with your friends and neighbors, who emailed and contributed online, who invested so much in our common enterprise, to the moms and dads who came to our events, who lifted their little girls and little boys on their shoulders and whispered in their ears, ""See, you can be anything you want to be."" To the young people like 13 year-old Ann Riddle from Mayfield, Ohio who had been saving for two years to go to Disney World, and decided to use her savings instead to travel to Pennsylvania with her Mom and volunteer there as well. To the veterans and the childhood friends, to New Yorkers and Arkansans who traveled across the country and telling anyone who would listen why you supported me. To all those women in their 80s and their 90s born before women could vote who cast their votes for our campaign. I\'ve told you before about Florence Steen of South Dakota, who was 88 years old, and insisted that her daughter bring an absentee ballot to her hospice bedside. Her daughter and a friend put an American flag behind her bed and helped her fill out the ballot. She passed away soon after, and under state law, her ballot didn\'t count. But her daughter later told a reporter, ""My dad\'s an ornery old cowboy, and he didn\'t like it when he heard mom\'s vote wouldn\'t be counted. I don\'t think he had voted in 20 years. But he voted in place of my mom."" To all those who voted for me, and to whom I pledged my utmost, my commitment to you and to the progress we seek is unyielding. You have inspired and touched me with the stories of the joys and sorrows that make up the fabric of our lives and you have humbled me with your commitment to our country. 18 million of you from all walks of life  women and men, young and old, Latino and Asian, African-American and Caucasian, rich, poor and middle class, gay and straight  you have stood strong with me. And I will continue to stand strong with you, every time, every place, and every way that I can. The dreams we share are worth fighting for. Remember - we fought for the single mom with a young daughter, juggling work and school, who told me, ""I\'m doing it all to better myself for her."" We fought for the woman who grabbed my hand, and asked me, ""What are you going to do to make sure I have health care?"" and began to cry because even though she works three jobs, she can\'t afford insurance. We fought for the young man in the Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said, ""Take care of my buddies over there and then, will you please help take care of me?"" We fought for all those who\'ve lost jobs and health care, who can\'t afford gas or groceries or college, who have felt invisible to their president these last seven years. I entered this race because I have an old-fashioned conviction: that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their dreams. I\'ve had every opportunity and blessing in my own life  and I want the same for all Americans. Until that day comes, you will always find me on the front lines of democracy  fighting for the future. The way to continue our fight now  to accomplish the goals for which we stand  is to take our energy, our passion, our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next President of the United States. Today, as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run. I endorse him, and throw my full support behind him. And I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me. I have served in the Senate with him for four years. I have been in this campaign with him for 16 months. I have stood on the stage and gone toe-to-toe with him in 22 debates. I have had a front row seat to his candidacy, and I have seen his strength and determination, his grace and his grit. In his own life, Barack Obama has lived the American Dream. As a community organizer, in the state senate, as a United States Senator - he has dedicated himself to ensuring the dream is realized. And in this campaign, he has inspired so many to become involved in the democratic process and invested in our common future. Now when I started this race, I intended to win back the White House, and make sure we have a president who puts our country back on the path to peace, prosperity, and progress. And that\'s exactly what we\'re going to do by ensuring that Barack Obama walks through the doors of the Oval Office on January 20, 2009. I understand that we all know this has been a tough fight. The Democratic Party is a family, and it\'s now time to restore the ties that bind us together and to come together around the ideals we share, the values we cherish, and the country we love. We may have started on separate journeys  but today, our paths have merged. And we are all heading toward the same destination, united and more ready than ever to win in November and to turn our country around because so much is at stake. We all want an economy that sustains the American Dream, the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford that gas and those groceries and still have a little left over at the end of the month. An economy that lifts all of our people and ensures that our prosperity is broadly distributed and shared. We all want a health care system that is universal, high quality, and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance. This isn\'t just an issue for me  it is a passion and a cause  and it is a fight I will continue until every single American is insured  no exceptions, no excuses. We all want an America defined by deep and meaningful equality  from civil rights to labor rights, from women\'s rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. We all want to restore America\'s standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq and once again lead by the power of our values, and to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming. You know, I\'ve been involved in politics and public life in one way or another for four decades. During those forty years, our country has voted ten times for President. Democrats won only three of those times. And the man who won two of those elections is with us today. We made tremendous progress during the 90s under a Democratic President, with a flourishing economy, and our leadership for peace and security respected around the world. Just think how much more progress we could have made over the past 40 years if we had a Democratic president. Think about the lost opportunities of these past seven years  on the environment and the economy, on health care and civil rights, on education, foreign policy and the Supreme Court. Imagine how far we could\'ve come, how much we could\'ve achieved if we had just had a Democrat in the White House. We cannot let this moment slip away. We have come too far and accomplished too much. Now the journey ahead will not be easy. Some will say we can\'t do it. That it\'s too hard. That we\'re just not up to the task. But for as long as America has existed, it has been the American way to reject ""can\'t do"" claims, and to choose instead to stretch the boundaries of the possible through hard work, determination, and a pioneering spirit. It is this belief, this optimism, that Senator Obama and I share, and that has inspired so many millions of our supporters to make their voices heard. So today, I am standing with Senator Obama to say: Yes we can. Together we will work. We\'ll have to work hard to get universal health care. But on the day we live in an America where no child, no man, and no woman is without health insurance, we will live in a stronger America. That\'s why we need to help elect Barack Obama our President. We\'ll have to work hard to get back to fiscal responsibility and a strong middle class. But on the day we live in an America whose middle class is thriving and growing again, where all Americans, no matter where they live or where their ancestors came from, can earn a decent living, we will live in a stronger America and that is why we must elect Barack Obama our President. We\'ll have to work hard to foster the innovation that makes us energy independent and lift the threat of global warming from our children\'s future. But on the day we live in an America fueled by renewable energy, we will live in a stronger America. That\'s why we have to help elect Barack Obama our President. We\'ll have to work hard to bring our troops home from Iraq, and get them the support they\'ve earned by their service. But on the day we live in an America that\'s as loyal to our troops as they have been to us, we will live in a stronger America and that is why we must help elect Barack Obama our President. This election is a turning point election and it is critical that we all understand what our choice really is. Will we go forward together or will we stall and slip backwards. Think how much progress we have already made. When we first started, people everywhere asked the same questions: Could a woman really serve as Commander-in-Chief? Well, I think we answered that one. And could an African American really be our President? Senator Obama has answered that one. Together Senator Obama and I achieved milestones essential to our progress as a nation, part of our perpetual duty to form a more perfect union. Now, on a personal note  when I was asked what it means to be a woman running for President, I always gave the same answer: that I was proud to be running as a woman but I was running because I thought I\'d be the best President. But I am a woman, and like millions of women, I know there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious. I want to build an America that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us. I ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of. I ran as a mother who worries about my daughter\'s future and a mother who wants to lead all children to brighter tomorrows. To build that future I see, we must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and mothers, and that women enjoy equal opportunities, equal pay, and equal respect. Let us resolve and work toward achieving some very simple propositions: There are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the twenty-first century. You can be so proud that, from now on, it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories, unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee, unremarkable to think that a woman can be the President of the United States. And that is truly remarkable. To those who are disappointed that we couldn\'t go all the way  especially the young people who put so much into this campaign  it would break my heart if, in falling short of my goal, I in any way discouraged any of you from pursuing yours. Always aim high, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in. When you stumble, keep faith. When you\'re knocked down, get right back up. And never listen to anyone who says you can\'t or shouldn\'t go on. As we gather here today in this historic magnificent building, the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead. If we can blast 50 women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House. Although we weren\'t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\'s got about 18 million cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time. That has always been the history of progress in America. Think of the suffragists who gathered at Seneca Falls in 1848 and those who kept fighting until women could cast their votes. Think of the abolitionists who struggled and died to see the end of slavery. Think of the civil rights heroes and foot-soldiers who marched, protested and risked their lives to bring about the end to segregation and Jim Crow. Because of them, I grew up taking for granted that women could vote. Because of them, my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could go to school together. Because of them, Barack Obama and I could wage a hard fought campaign for the Democratic nomination. Because of them, and because of you, children today will grow up taking for granted that an African American or a woman can yes, become President of the United States. When that day arrives and a woman takes the oath of office as our President, we will all stand taller, proud of the values of our nation, proud that every little girl can dream and that her dreams can come true in America. And all of you will know that because of your passion and hard work you helped pave the way for that day. So I want to say to my supporters, when you hear people saying  or think to yourself  ""if only"" or ""what if,"" I say, ""please don\'t go there."" Every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward. Life is too short, time is too precious, and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been. We have to work together for what still can be. And that is why I will work my heart out to make sure that Senator Obama is our next President and I hope and pray that all of you will join me in that effort. To my supporters and colleagues in Congress, to the governors and mayors, elected officials who stood with me, in good times and in bad, thank you for your strength and leadership. To my friends in our labor unions who stood strong every step of the way  I thank you and pledge my support to you. To my friends, from every stage of my life  your love and ongoing commitments sustain me every single day. To my family  especially Bill and Chelsea and my mother, you mean the world to me and I thank you for all you have done. And to my extraordinary staff, volunteers and supporters, thank you for working those long, hard hours. Thank you for dropping everything  leaving work or school  traveling to places you\'d never been, sometimes for months on end. And thanks to your families as well because your sacrifice was theirs too. All of you were there for me every step of the way. Being human, we are imperfect. That\'s why we need each other. To catch each other when we falter. To encourage each other when we lose heart. Some may lead; others may follow; but none of us can go it alone. The changes we\'re working for are changes that we can only accomplish together. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are rights that belong to each of us as individuals. But our lives, our freedom, our happiness, are best enjoyed, best protected, and best advanced when we do work together. That is what we will do now as we join forces with Senator Obama and his campaign. We will make history together as we write the next chapter in America\'s story. We will stand united for the values we hold dear, for the vision of progress we share, and for the country we love. There is nothing more American than that. And looking out at you today, I have never felt so blessed. The challenges that I have faced in this campaign are nothing compared to those that millions of Americans face every day in their own lives. So today, I\'m going to count my blessings and keep on going. I\'m going to keep doing what I was doing long before the cameras ever showed up and what I\'ll be doing long after they\'re gone: Working to give every American the same opportunities I had, and working to ensure that every child has the chance to grow up and achieve his or her God-given potential. I will do it with a heart filled with gratitude, with a deep and abiding love for our country and with nothing but optimism and confidence for the days ahead. This is now our time to do all that we can to make sure that in this election we add another Democratic president to that very small list of the last 40 years and that we take back our country and once again move with progress and commitment to the future. Thank you all and God bless you and God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"August 26, 2008","b'Address at the Democratic National Convention in Denver: ""United We Can Build a Better America""'","b'I am honored to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama. My friends, it is time to take back the country we love. Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future. And it\'s a fight we must win. I haven\'t spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal health care, helping parents balance work and family, and fighting for women\'s rights at home and around the world . . . to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people. And you haven\'t worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership. No way. No how. No McCain. Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our President. Tonight we need to remember what a Presidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and the ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you -- the American people, your lives, and your children\'s futures. For me, it\'s been a privilege to meet you in your homes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me everyday that America\'s greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people -- your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for your children, and your determination to keep going, often in the face of enormous obstacles. You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and . . . you even made me cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives. And you became part of mine. I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn\'t have health insurance and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care. I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me: ""Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there....and then will you please help take care of me?"" I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours. He said he just didn\'t know what his family was going to do. I will always be grateful to everyone from all fifty states, Puerto Rico and the territories, who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush Administrtation. To my supporters, my champions -- my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: Thank you. You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history. Along the way, America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas Democratic Party Chair, Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his heart that America and the South could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom. And Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to many of us, a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter, stronger and better. Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all. Our heart goes out to Stephanie\'s son, Mervyn, Jr, and Bill\'s wife, Rebecca, who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention. Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at home, and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of work ahead. Jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices. The Supreme Court in a right-wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock. The biggest deficit in our nation\'s history. Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. Putin and Georgia, Iraq and Iran. I ran for President to renew the promise of America. To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American Dream, to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month. To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs. To create a health care system that is universal, high quality, and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance. To create a world class education system and make college affordable again. To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labor rights, from women\'s rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. To help every child live up to his or her God-given potential. To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good, not of private plunder. To restore America\'s standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans. And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming. Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. Those are the reasons I ran for President. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too. I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible? We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges. Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what is possible in America. This won\'t be easy. Progress never is. But it will be impossible if we don\'t fight to put a Democrat in the White House. We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a President who understands that America can\'t compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators, while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas. We need a President who understands that we can\'t solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy. We need a President who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class. Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up, not the top down. He knows government must be about ""We the people"" not ""We the favored few."" And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he\'ll revitalize our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again. He\'ll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new, clean energy future. He\'ll make sure that middle class families get the tax relief they deserve. And I can\'t wait to watch Barack Obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single American. Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home - a first step to repairing our alliances around the world. And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw Michelle\'s speech last night knows she will be a great First Lady for America. Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama\'s side. He is a strong leader and a good man. He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic, tough, and wise. And, of course, Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill. They will be a great team for our country. Now, John McCain is my colleague and my friend. He has served our country with honor and courage. But we don\'t need four more years . . . of the last eight years. More economic stagnation ...and less affordable health care. More high gas prices ...and less alternative energy. More jobs getting shipped overseas ...and fewer jobs created here. More skyrocketing debt ...home foreclosures ...and mounting bills that are crushing our middle class families. More war . . . less diplomacy. More of a government where the privileged come first ...and everyone else comes last. John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn\'t think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatize Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it\'s okay when women don\'t earn equal pay for equal work. With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they\'re awfully hard to tell apart. America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good. And I know what that can mean for every man, woman, and child in America. I\'m a United States Senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to participate in the first convention on women\'s rights in our history. And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter - and a few sons and grandsons along the way. These women and men looked into their daughters\' eyes, imagined a fairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight. To rally and picket. To endure ridicule and harassment. To brave violence and jail. And after so many decades - 88 years ago on this very day - the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution. My mother was born before women could vote. But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for President. This is the story of America. Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up. How do we give this country back to them? By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad. And on that path to freedom, Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice. If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If they\'re shouting after you, keep going. Don\'t ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going. Even in the darkest of moments, ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going. I\'ve seen it in you. I\'ve seen it in our teachers and firefighters, nurses and police officers, small business owners and union workers, the men and women of our military - you always keep going. We are Americans. We\'re not big on quitting. But remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president. We don\'t have a moment to lose or a vote to spare. Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance. I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation. We\'ve got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope. That is our duty, to build that bright future, and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great - and no ceiling too high - for all who work hard, never back down, always keep going, have faith in God, in our country, and in each other. Thank you so much. God bless America and Godspeed to you all.'"

I'm what they call a non-traditional college student. I'm taking business administration management, and I also am doing the continuing ed program here at Kirkwood.Clinton: Great.Well, first I want thank you, Nick, for having me here and a few of my friends in the college. I just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory. I got to talk with the instructor and four of the students, all of whom are high school students who are doing what you have described as the great opportunity to mix your high school years with college learning and college credits as you move forward.And I am really pleased to be at a community college that is visionary and effective and trying to serve as a bridge for people who are non-traditional but coming back to add to their stills all the Beltway high school students who are taking advantage of the opportunities. And the cooperation between the college and the high school is something I want to see a lot more. This is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us.And before we get started  because I want to hear from each of you, I want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of  I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today. I think we all know that Americans have come back from some tough economic times. And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work. But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker. There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks. And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here the last two days. And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills in order to make the best of their own lives. I looked at the figures. The average Iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt. And that's I think the ninth-highest debt load in the country. And people are struggling. I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money.We're got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track. And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion. I want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead. And a lot of people in the last few days have asking why do you want to do this? What motivates you? I thought a lot about it and I guess the short answer is I've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example. She had a really difficult childhood, was mistreated, neglected, but she never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going. My father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family. And then I was thinking, too, about the lessons from my church. You're supposed to give back. You're supposed to do what you can to help others. And that's what I tried to do. And we'll have more time to talk about as that as we go forward.When I got out of law school, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. One of the projects there was literally going door to door. This was back in the '70s when kids with disabilities were basically shut out of our schools. And thanks to your great former Senator, Tom Harkin, that's no longer the case. But I was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out. And I was able in Arkansas to work to try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. And as first lady, to fight for health care reform and keep fighting until we get health care insurance for kids. Then as Senator, dealing with the problems that faced New York after 9/11 and trying to help people get what they needed, the victims' families and first responders. It was an incredible honor to do that. Then, as secretary of state, standing up for our country.So when I look at where we are as a country, I'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. But we can't take that for granted. So I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four big areas, four big fights that I think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what I think we should be doing. And they're pretty powerful forces.We need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment, and we need to protect our country from the threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon.So I'm here in Iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that and to hear from people about what's on your minds, what the challenges that you see are. And I'll work hard to meet as many people. I'll be rolling out ideas and policies about what I think will work. But I want it to be informed by what's actually working and to build on what works going forward, and to stand up for those who have a different vision of our country, a different one than what I grew up with and a different one than I think is best for everybody.So with that what I'd love to do is just, you know, ask a few questions and hear...[end of transcript]"""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 20, 2015","b'Remarks in Keene, New Hampshire'","b'Clinton: Well, thank you all so much for inviting me here today and giving me a chance to not only learn more about this business, which is a family business, 112 years young.Unknown: That\'s right.Clinton: And to meet some of the people who work here, as I did when I was walking through, and as you\'ve just introduced yourself. I am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy. Small business is the backbone of the American economy. Here in New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses. And they employ more than half of the workers, the employees, in the state of New Hampshire. So New Hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business.And I come from a small business family. My father had a very small business. He printed drapery fabrics in a print plant. And he did much of the work himself, sometimes with day laborers, sometimes with my mother and my brothers and me, literally, taking the squeegee, pour the paint on the silk screen. You take the squeegee, you go down, then you lift it up and you go to the next and you keep going.And I saw where now there\'s a machine that you just bought that\'s printing on all kinds of material. And I\'m thinking back to those years in my father\'s small print plant. But he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced.And so from my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprised to see that when I began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn\'t know what they were saying.And it turns out that we\'re not producing as many small businesses as we used to. And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business. There are lots of issues and we\'ll get into some of those, I hope, Dave, and the rest of you, as well.So I want to hear from each of you, because part of what I\'m doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do. I want to embed what I propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of American workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again. Really, we have to do more for young people, because what we\'re finding is that with student debt  and New Hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country  that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business.When I was in Iowa last week, I met a young man, who  his dream had been to own a bowling center is his hometown. He graduated from college, because he\'d worked, like you, during the summers, and he  and he wanted to own that business. He got a chance to do it.With his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems.And even now, he\'s got the business, but he runs it  he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it. Here\'s a young, ambitious guy. And when I think about my dad, it was a lot easier in those days to have an idea, to get what you needed and to go to work.The other piece of this, as we were walking around and Dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country. And many of them, if I\'m right, Dave, are from Europe.Unknown: That\'s correct.Clinton: And so you think  I mean, Europe has high wages. They have high costs. Why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us? What\'s wrong with this picture?You can  you can see that maybe lower-cost places that are mastering the art of machine production would be competitive, but these are high-value machines. These are very sophisticated machines.How do we get that into more basic production again so that we can resume our lead in manufacturing, something that I think is essential? A lot of people disagree with me. They say, ""Oh, you know, those days are over."" I don\'t believe it.You walk around here, you see these machines from, you know, Italy or Germany or wherever else they\'re from. Why? Why aren\'t we producing those machines? What do we need to do to jump-start advanced manufacturing once again in our country?So my bottom line is, we\'ve gone through some tough times, and I think Americans have done everything they could think of to do to get through those tough times.But now it\'s not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them.So in order to put together a set of policies for my campaign, I really want to make sure that they are in line with the real lives and the real working experiences of the people that I would love to represent as your president.So we\'re going to take on four big fights. You know, we\'re going to fight to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday, and make the middle class mean something again in this country. We\'re going to fight to have strong families and strong communities. And of course, it\'s no accident that I\'m at a [inaudible] whose customer market is between six months and six years. That\'s  that\'s right where I am focused these days.I want to make sure we have a functioning political system. I\'m going to fight for that.I will work with anybody. I\'ve done that. I did it as senator. I will do it again.But I will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.And then finally, we always have to be vigilant to protect our country against the threats we know  we can see them  but then the threats we can\'t see  pandemic diseases, cyber warfare, et cetera.So I\'m excited about this campaign. I\'m thrilled to be back in New Hampshire. I see some of my friends out there in the audience.And the first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991. I celebrated my birthday here in  in Keene, and I have a lot of wonderful memories.So with that, Dave, I\'m going to turn it back to you, and  and we can start hearing from some of the folks.Question: I think maybe I\'ll ask the initial question, and you guys will chime in.But  but, you know, early childhood is obviously our interest and  our selfish interest, but also, we\'re fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. And I would like you to elaborate on exactly what you think you might do for child-care in the future if  if you\'re  you know, if you\'re elected.Clinton: Well, that\'s a question near and dear to my heart, because I think every society starts with our youngest citizens. And when I got out of law school, I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. And so my whole adult life, both professionally and my volunteer work, has been around children and families and it is to me the most important commitment we can make.And now it\'s not only that we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren, but we now know that the way brains develop, thanks to all the great research that is being done by our scientists, that those early years really are critical to the success that a child will have in school and what that child can learn and then what that child can choose to do, what kind of opportunities will be available.So I think we have to start in the family. And I\'ve been working on a project to convince parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to read, talk and sing to their babies and that\'s equally important in any child care setting.So when you are producing furniture that give kids a chance to be part of a circle, to work on a table, all of that, it\'s safety and stimulation are the two most important needs that little, tiny babies have. And I think we need a much more broadly based universal pre- Kindergarten program so that kids have a chance to get ready for school.And I really applaud states  and they are not  you know, they\'re not all the states that you might think of  Oklahoma has a universal pre-K program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school.And I think the child care problem, I was looking at a statistic that it can cost as much as $12,000 a year in New Hampshire for quality child care. That\'s more than the community college costs, as I understand it.And what are we going to do about that?How can you expect, you know, most families to afford that kind of cost?So we\'ve got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school  and I know there\'s a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that\'s where you come in.And you were telling me about a light table and other things that you prepare for settings where little kids are  that\'s all to stimulate them and give them a chance to develop that brain and learn more so they are better prepared for school.Question: Yes. Thank you.Guys, you want to start off, anybody?Question: Well, my grandson goes to the Head Start across the way over there [inaubible] in there it\'s filled with Whitney Brothers products, all down the hallways. They\'re all on coat lockers. In there are all their  are little tables and chairs. And it made me feel so proud that I worked here, that these people were buying [inaubible].[audio gap]Question:  more for substance abuse, help in our area, there\'s very limited resources here. And we would like to see something in that respect.Do you have Clinton: Well  Question:  any further ideas?Clinton: I do, actually. I am  I\'m really concerned because, Pam, what you just told me, I\'m hearing from a lot of different people. There is a hidden epidemic. You know, the drug abuse problem, whether it\'s pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence. This is a quiet epidemic. And it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city. And at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs. I see Senator Kelly here and I know how committed she is to trying to get resources.So we\'re  we\'ve got a perfect storm. We have an increasing problem that\'s only beginning to break through the service so that people  you know, I think a lot of people are thinking, well, that\'s somebody else\'s problem, it\'s not my problem and indeed it is all of our problem. And we don\'t have enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they want to get help, where do you send them?What kind of opportunities do they have for treatment?And I am convinced that the mental health issues  because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues  is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it\'s a big issue that people raised with me.And when I was in Iowa last week, I literally heard from one end of the state, from Davenport to Council Bluffs, about this problem and how the state was shutting all their inpatient facilities and there was nowhere for people to be sent.So we\'ve got to do more. We have treatment in the Affordable Care Act, which is a good thing, which we  and we have at least on paper, what\'s called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems.But we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue  I\'ll just end with this. You probably have read about this small county in Southern Indiana where there was an epidemic of HIV among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was I guess turned to powder.So now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted HIV. So this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away. We need a concerted policy, national, state, local, public, private and we need to try to help young people like the mother of your grandson.Question: Thank you.Question: Well, the drug issue is not really a no-issue here. I mean, as a kid myself, as the son of a minister, of a preacher, the little town that I grew up in, I was the only kid my age who was not involved in drugs of some sort. The dealer lived across the street, the kids used their drugs in the front lawn of the house next door. I mean  and there was no  really no recourse in upstate New York at that time because this little town of 300,000 acres, one town cop, two local sheriffs, that\'s a lot of territory to cover.So it\'s not really a no issue but it is certainly an ongoing issue.Clinton: You know, that\'s exactly right. It\'s not a new issue, but it\'s taken a new  kind of a new turn, if you will. And I think more young people  maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because I can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don\'t see that anymore.And so I think for a lot of young people, especially if it\'s pills, I think they believe, well, what\'s wrong with that? I mean, you know it\'s a prescription pill so that means it must be OK. And they don\'t know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them. That\'s a good point. Yes.Question: Bill?Question: Well, I was in the line with the drugs and things, you made a point that educating the kids at an early age, it might be advantageous to really push the drug issue there at Head Start, you know, just in a  in a way that they\'ll understand it, no, it\'s not a good thing to do, even though your friends might do it. You don\'t need to do this. You don\'t have to. There\'s other ways.Clinton: Yes, so starting early.Question: Start it early.Clinton: And, Chris, you hire a lot of people, so you see this, don\'t you and Question: Yes. Whitney Brothers actually does drug testing. It\'s a pre-employment drug testing in order to come to work here, so we want a drug-free workplace.Clinton: Well, I think that sends a strong message and a lot of employers are either doing that or thinking about that going back to doing it, from what I\'m hearing.Is that what you hear from your human resource contacts as well?Question: Yes. And Workmen\'s Comp likes having it, too, because we haven\'t [inaubible] machines that people are running and if they\'re high, running them and obviously there\'s going to be  someone\'s going to get hurt.Coordination and everything goes downhill.Clinton: Yes.What are some of the other issues?Jim, like, what\'s on your mind economically and kind of how you see things for yourself and your family?Question: Well, thank you. Because my kids are all grown and they\'re in their late 20s so they\'re  have established themselves and they\'re doing their thing, so I don\'t have to worry about them anymore in the way I used to with young kids. But for myself, I\'m getting, you know, up in age and looking for  I\'ve worked for small companies all my life. And most of them have just enough money to give you minimal health care, to, you know, retirement. I have very little saved for retirement because of you know, trying to make ends meet with kids and you know, it\'s [inaubible] the resources. And the company I just left before I came here a year ago closed their doors because of the economy  they were  they were making super insulated panels for the building industry, which I thought was the way to go.And so when they closed their doors, I was 27 years working for them, left me with  looking for a new job and thankfully [inaubible] you know, Whitney Brothers were looking for my skills to help them with their products and I\'m very thankful for being here.But you know, I look at, you know, hope your ideas on health care and Social Security and you know, where are those  where are those heading? [inaubible] probably I\'m in my late 50s right now and you know, 10 years from now I\'m going to hopefully work less. You know, what\'s going to  you know, and so, in regards to our company here, [inaubible], what could be done to help you know, bolster our company here to help us all live a little better life?Clinton: Can I ask you, you worked for 27 years.Was there any kind of retirement account, kind of [inaubible] 401(k), anything?Question: There was initially; that lasted until the economy went belly up back in 2008. And you know, our company went right down the tubes. So it was, you know, people weren\'t going to, you know, to spend that extra little bit of money to get a better  a better product.And you know, the same what happens here. I mean, we\'re struggling to try to fight with, you know, the Chinese and other people who are making similar items to us and are, you know, cutting costs and we\'re, you know, we look at every penny that we put into the  into our products here and try to you know, get everything out of it we can with the CSN machines, with the  with the processes that we use.So, yes, the company I work for was  I always thought was the way to go.Clinton: Well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that American worker productivity has continued to go up. American workers work longer and harder and more productively than the vast majority of workers anywhere in the world.But it\'s been very difficult to turn that increased productivity into increased wages and increased benefits. And in some cases, where you have small companies, it\'s the margin\'s just too thin. You know, it\'s really hard to do that. In some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to. They\'d rather stock buybacks than increase the, you know, the wages and salaries of the people who\'ve actually contributed to the productivity and the profits.So I think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat.So what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market.And Dave and I were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings. I mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product?How do you compete with, as you say, somebody doing the same thing in China?So I think we have to look at this from kind of the top and the middle and try to figure out what\'s the best way to do it.On Social Security, though, you know, there is a lot of loose talk about Social Security. And I don\'t know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their Social Security  they\'ve worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from Social Security.You know, the Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035. So what do we do to make sure it is there and we don\'t mess with it and we don\'t, you know, pretend that it\'s a luxury, because it\'s not a luxury. It\'s a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.So I think there will be some big political arguments about Social Security. And my only question to everybody who thinks we can privatize Social Security or, you know, undermine it in some way is  and so then what\'s going to happen to all these people like you, who worked 27 years at this other company?What\'s going to happen? It\'s just wrong.So part of what we have to do is say, look, let\'s everybody take a deep breath. Let\'s figure out what works and how we build on what works. And let\'s not get into arguments, as I say, about ideology and rhetorical, you know, attacks and claims. Let\'s just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, OK, we\'re going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life. And so I\'m 100 percent committed to that.Question: That sort of dovetails with what Mary\'s situation  and I don\'t know your whole circumstances, Mary, but you know, Mary worked here for a number of years, quit, and then come back. If you could just talk briefly about why you came back and was it a  was it a financial decision or was just because you were bored or what?Question: Actually, it was a financial situation. As a homeowner there\'s always overhead that have to be done, those things you have to keep up that you don\'t really count on when you\'re not working. So coming back to work and I said I have, why not come back to Whitney Brothers? It\'s a place that I know I\'m familiar with, I like it and I like the product. [inaubible] financially.Clinton: Did you think, Mary, when you retired the first time that you had enough resources to be able to take care of your needs and then something unexpected happened?Question: Yes.Clinton: OK.Question: Yes.Clinton: OK.Are you Question: I thought I could  I could live like comfortable, not above but comfortable.Clinton: What  did you start drawing Social Security?Question: Yes.Clinton: What did you get a month, do you  do you remember what you were drawing on Social Security?Question: [inaubible]?Clinton: Yes, when you started?[crosstalk]Question: You don\'t remember what you  what amount you were [inaubible] amount?Question: Yes, yes.Question: [inaubible] amount.Well, I also had a retirement, too, but I dropped from a Social Security $1,400.Clinton: $1,400 a month? OK.Question: Yes.Clinton: So I think that, you know, if you  if you look just realistically, especially if you still own your home, you\'re still obviously very independent and able to take care of yourself, you are going to have a lot of expenses, both predicted and unpredictable.So when you came back, did you believe that you were here for a period of years, or are you going to Question: Just Clinton:  take it year by year?Question:  yes, part-time.Clinton: OK, part-time. All right.Question: Going to catch up on those [inaubible].[laughter]Clinton: I can tell, yes. They were calling you every day, saying, why don\'t you come back?It really was a  it was really unexpected expense, right?Question: Her kind of experience, you know, being here so many years, it\'s really priceless, I mean  and that brings up something I would like to have you address and that  one of the biggest problems we have, Madam Secretary, is getting good CNC adult center trained in math and computers and, you know, we\'re  we compete against a lot of local companies that are  you know, you look at our ads in the local newspapers or on the Internet, I mean, i is CNC folks, it\'s a  people that have math skills. You know, we\'re  our machines are metric and our  the architects and dealers are in standards so where we\'re switching. So you need intelligent employees. And you know, we have the college and the high school do have technical services.But it just doesn\'t seem to be [inaubible] we\'re always struggling to find people like that.Would you agree?Question: Yes, I do agree.Question: Yes.So I mean, what Clinton: Well, I met  I met a young man, I don\'t know if he\'s out here Question: Dan? Dan Brown, somewhere?Clinton:  yes, he went to the Keene State College program to learn these skills and that\'s what we need more of, right. You need at the high school and the college level, community, four-year college, more programs that are related to the skills that employers actually need.You know, what are the job skills that you are trying to [crosstalk]Question: It\'s technical skills, it\'s [crosstalk]Question:  I think there is a place for the humanities, but it\'s the technical skills, the electricians, the plumbers, those are the guys that we\'re looking for, and those are the people.Clinton: Well, I think we have to get back to encouraging more young people to see these as careers and then we have to have both more education-based skills programs and employer-based skills programs, you know, the kind of apprenticeship programs and other training programs that are both public and private and try to give young people the opportunities.It\'s really important that we do more to publicize why these skills are going to get you a good job. I think we have kind of lost the thread here. Too many young people don\'t know  nobody\'s told them that, you know, you can get a really good job, as you just named, an electrician or a welder, you name it  and the computerized numeric control systems that you\'re talking about on these big machines, that takes, you know, a year or two of training to really understand, because that\'s a level beyond what we typically think of as technical education.So I would love to hear from you  and maybe start with you, indeed, Chris, because when people come for a job interview, where have they gotten their skills or do they even know that those skills would enhance their chance to get hired?Question: I think the majority of the people that come here, on the job training, they\'ve been other places so they\'ve done  it\'s not really any tool change.There is a career center at the high school, but it\'s more metal and more wood. It  you know, it can go hand in hand, but with us, we look more for wood and it\'s more on-the-job training that people [inaubible].Question: Yes, so we\'re having to train relatively green people to run the machines. And it has worked out, but, I mean, again, you know, in the  in the local marketplace, we are competing against a lot of different companies that are  that need CNC operators. So you know, we might train someone for a year or two and they might go somewhere else for a couple of dollars more. And that  I mean, that\'s life, that\'s tough, but we would like to think that there could be a greater pool of technical  technically skilled people in this [crosstalk]Question: Hard for us to retain the CNC operators because with  we are doing wood manufacturing and we are going against the overseas people. So we need to keep our costs low and we only can pay so much [inaubible].Clinton: Yes, so you have got cost pressures plus skill pressures.Question: Right.Clinton: Well, I think, first of all, we just have to have more programs that are going to prepare more people. I mean, that sounds so simplistic, but we kind of backed off from what used to be called vocational education and I think that we made a mistake because we backed off, thinking that it was going to be picked up by either businesses or community colleges, technical schools and that didn\'t happen fast enough. It\'s starting to happen now. There are more and more places where you can get these kind of advanced skills, but we need to create a bigger pool of people in order to meet the needs that you are talking about.I visited a community college in Iowa last year that takes high school students and trains them on CNC. And then they are able to really be job prepared when they leave high school, which is amazing. But they still have a relatively  they might graduate  I think they told me 30 or 40 a year, when the demand is much greater than that.So I think we have to take up  I really approve of the president\'s proposal to try to make community college as free as possible. That would be a big help here in New Hampshire, where it\'s so costly. I mean, the amount of tuition is so high, both in the two- year and the four-year schools, but that still doesn\'t help unless we somehow provide incentives for more people, younger and older, to go into these trades, right.Question: Yes, I was just going to, you know, comment on, you know, being as if I had to switch jobs again for some reason, thank God I have  still have decent skills. As a  as a draftsman and designer, you know, I learned how to, you know, use the computer on my own without any education, which if I had more education, I might have been able to do more.But to afford to go back to school, time wise as well as cost, is always hard, especially like say with health care and all that, you know, taking the little bits out of my pay, that there isn\'t any money for me to go back to school to try to get other new skills, to  and need to either enhance what I am doing here or to think about, you know, if I ever decided to move somewhere else.Question: Before I came to Whitney Brothers I had actually looked into a CNC program that\'s offered by the local community college, but it was only going to be in Clermont that next session and of course that was the middle of winter. And it\'s a bit of a hike up there.[crosstalk]Question: Fortunately, I found this place and it worked out very well.Clinton: Now what are your hours of operation?Question: We\'re 7:00 to 3:30 but we\'re always doing overtime. So it goes to 4:30, sometimes 5:00, so it\'s eight or nine hours. And then during the summer occasionally we have skeleton crews on the second shift, because our  the nature of our business is the busy months are June, July and August and September, before school starts.Clinton: I mean, I\'m just thinking that you know, you have this equipment here, if you get some kind of grant or other support from either local government, state government, even the community college or the colleges and you know, you could have a program at night. I mean, it  you know, if somebody were to come in and basically say we are going to designate Whitney Brothers as one of our training facilities and your expert employees would get some kind of wage bump because you would be the instructors.I just think we\'ve got to be imagining outside the old box about what we\'re going to do to get our skills up, how we\'re going to get more people of all ages to have the opportunity to improve those skills. Very hard to do it if you\'re already working during the workday  but maybe there could be some, you know, cooperative approach that might make a difference. I just  from my perspective, I hear it everywhere. I hear we don\'t have enough skilled workers, with technical skills. We don\'t have enough R.N.s and CNAs. We have a whole missing group of workers that could be employed you know, in our existing industries, and so how do we fix that? Because we don\'t fix it, we\'re not going to be able to be competitive. We\'re always going to be, you know, behind the curve in trying to succeed [inaubible].Question: Going back to changing the mindset, I mean, when I was in school and growing up, there was nothing wrong with being an electrician or a plumber or a carpenter. I mean, these were really good jobs and you know, you could make good money doing that. And it seemed to fall off the table. Everybody wants to go right to the top. Well, no, you got to be at the bottom before you can kind of work your way in there.And I think if we work in the high schools, even in the grammar schools in some points, you know, get these kids  a lot of kids just don\'t want to go to school. They don\'t want to go to college. You know, well, fine, you don\'t have to go to college to make a good living. But you have to get it out there, that it\'s OK not to go to college if you don\'t want to, but these are good positions. You can get a good job, you can make a good living, support your family by doing these other things. And I think that kind of got off track. Clinton: I agree with you.Does anybody else feel that way?Question: When I was in high school, we had to have at least a semester or two of shop classes.Clinton: When I was, too. Yes.Question: Everything it seems got computerized and everybody wants either sit with their gadgets or, oh, I\'ll design computer games. That\'s what I\'m good at. I love  I\'d love to do it. And [inaubible] do that. But you know, it is true, you need a nurse. You\'re going to get sick sometime, you know, we all want to live somewhere. We got to have these people building our houses. And we want to be here working at Whitney Brothers, you know.[laughter]Question: You\'ve got to have that Question: Somebody has got to be making the Question:  at night when your [inaubible][crosstalk]Question: Somebody\'s got to fix it. Yes.Question: Yes.Question: That we\'re not all computer geeks. I don\'t think I could be one if I tried.[laughter]Question: You know? You just  you have to find your fit, you know. But I think the generation coming up needs that push to say, well, you know, here are some of these other things to do besides sit in front of a computer your whole entire life.Question: Yes.Clinton: You know, one of the kids that they told me about at this community college, advanced manufacturing program, graduated from high school and got a $40,000 job as a welder because there was such a shortage. And he\'d had a two-year program, passed some kind of national certification. So here he is, like 18 years old and you know, starting off on a really good track. Yes.Question: There was some  you probably know more about it than I do, but I heard it, that there are several high schools in Chicago that are affiliated with like IBM is one of them, one of their companies and it\'s an eight-year program, it\'s not four years and these kids are trained through high school and into this extended high school, as it were, being mentored by IBM. And when they get done, they are guaranteed a job at $40,000 a year in the company. And so, you know, you don\'t have to go to the University of Illinois. You\'re going to get your training right here. And I think five out of the eight schools in the country are in Chicago.Clinton: Well, that\'s exactly the kind of model that we need to look at and try to see where we could implement that. I think we have to try all different kinds of approaches and first it\'s to figure out what\'s already working and do more of that. And then I think you make a very strong point, we have to persuade, particularly young people, that this is an opportunity, that this is part of the economy that really needs them.And yes, some might want to be computer programmers and some might want to be the best welder or the best plumber. But we have to make it once again attractive for young people to feel like that\'s a good route for them.Well, Dave, we will give you the last word because you have been here  how long have you worked here?Question: Thirty-two years.Clinton: Yes.Question: A long time.Question: A long time.Question: But it\'s been great. I mean, it\'s a wonderful industry. And you know, I get to do R&D; work by going to child care centers. And you know, you get little 3- and 4-year olds running around. And you know, it really is quite a  I have an enviable job. And then, but you know, we  I am still a small business owner and as such I have the 3M worries also.So it\'s not all peach and cream. Actually, you know, in 2006 we had a flood and we had  actually there was about two feet of water where we\'re sitting. And the SBA was great to give us a low-interest loan. So kudos to the SBA.But I guess one final question I might ask you is that capital improvements, you know, we like keeping our machines monitored and up to date and historically, I think the last 8-10 years we have been able to write off the capital improvements in the year that they were installed and now in 2015, they\'re talking about reducing that to $25,000.And I know that\'s Congress, but I\'m curious as to your feeling. I mean, if you are president, are you  what can you do to help small businesses like ours to improve the equipment that we have and not make it so onerous that  so that we can  we can spread it out and still do right by the IRS?Clinton: Yes, no, I think that\'s an important question and I can assure you that I don\'t want to make your life any more onerous. I want you to be able to invest in both maintenance and upgrading of existing equipment and, like that new printing machine you showed me, new equipment, if that\'s going to make you competitive.I think what we have to do is we have to look at the whole tax system and try to figure out what is an economic investment as opposed to one without economic purpose, because there are a lot of those, where people are just basically playing games and  you know, not  you know, like capital gains was supposed to be, for example, a way to reward people who made risky investments, you know, starting new business, investing in somebody else\'s business and now it\'s just being churned. And so we have to take a look at the whole tax system.But I can  I can assure you, I would not support anything that makes your business more difficult to run, because you have a real business and you have real economic imperatives. You are in the production of goods and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, you know, which is just trading for the sake of trading. And you know, it\'s just wrong that you know, a hedge fund manager pays lower tax rates than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers.And so I think we have to say, look, if you\'re doing something which is enhancing the economic productivity of your business and the larger economy, we\'ll be open to that, but if it\'s just you know, playing back and forth in the global marketplace to get you know, 0.1 of 1 percent advantage, maybe we should not let that go on. Because that is unfortunately kind of at the root of some of the economic problems that we all remember painfully from \'08.So I think that, from your perspective, I would want to be a president who made it as easy as possible for you to be as productive and profitable as possible because you\'ve got 40-plus people whose lives and families depend upon that.Question: Yes.Clinton: Right?Question: Yes, absolutely.Clinton: Yes.Question: Yes.Well, great. It\'s been great to have you here.Clinton: Yes, thank you.Question: Thank you all for coming.I know the secretary has got a busy schedule, so I think  I\'m not quite sure how this works from here.Clinton: Well, I think what we\'d like to do is a picture with everybody who was in the roundtable. And then, you know, I want to say hello to some of my friends who are here.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"April 29, 2015",b'Address to the David N. Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University in New York City',"b'Thank you so much. I am absolutely delighted to be back here at Columbia. I want to thank President Bollinger, Dean Janow, and everyone at the School of International and Public Affairs. It is a special treat to be here with and on behalf of a great leader of this city and our country, David Dinkins. He has made such an indelible impact on New York, and I had the great privilege of working with him as First Lady and then, of course, as a new senator.When I was just starting out as a senator, David\'s door was always open. He and his wonderful wife Joyce were great friends and supporters and good sounding boards about ideas that we wanted to consider to enhance the quality of life and the opportunities for the people of this city. I was pleased to address the Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum in my first year as a senator, and I so appreciated then as I have in the years since David\'s generosity with his time and most of all his wisdom. So 14 years later, I\'m honored to have this chance, once again, to help celebrate the legacy of one of New York\'s greatest public servants.I\'m pleased too that you will have the opportunity after my remarks to hear from such a distinguished panel, to go into more detail about some of the issues that we face. I also know that Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer is here, along with other local and community leaders.Because surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever. Indeed, it is a time for wisdom.For yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short.Yet again, the streets of an American city are marred by violence. By shattered glass and shouts of anger and shows of force.Yet again a community is reeling, its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed.Yet again, brave police officers have been attacked in the line of duty.What we\'ve seen in Baltimore should, indeed does, tear at our soul. And, from Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.Walter Scott shot in the back in Charleston, South Carolina. Unarmed. In debt. And terrified of spending more time in jail for child support payments he couldn\'t afford.Tamir Rice shot in a park in Cleveland, Ohio. Unarmed and just 12 years old.Eric Garner choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of this city.And now Freddie Gray. His spine nearly severed while in police custody.Not only as a mother and a grandmother but as a citizen, a human being, my heart breaks for these young men and their families. We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.There is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.There is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes. And an estimated 1.5 million black men are ""missing"" from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death.There is something wrong when more than one out of every three young black men in Baltimore can\'t find a job.There is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities.We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance. And these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again.We should begin by heeding the pleas of Freddie Gray\'s family for peace and unity, echoing the families of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others in the past years. Those who are instigating further violence in Baltimore are disrespecting the Gray family and the entire community. They are compounding the tragedy of Freddie Gray\'s death and setting back the cause of justice. So the violence has to stop.But more broadly, let\'s remember that everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone in every community is respected by the law. That is what we have to work towards in Baltimore and across our country.We must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans. Between police and citizens, yes, but also across society.Restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets. Between and among neighbors and even people with whom we disagree politically.This is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we want to achieve together.It truly is about how we treat each other and what we value. Making it possible for every American to reach his or her God-given potentialregardless of who you are, where you were born, or who you love.The inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what America can be and should be.I learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law schoolat one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at Columbia. One of my earliest jobs for the Children\'s Defense Fund, which David had mentionedI was so fortunate to work with Marian Wright Edelman as a young lawyer and then serving on the board of the Children\'s Defense Fundwas studying the problem then of youth, teenagers, sometimes preteens, incarcerated in adult jails. Then, as director of the University of Arkansas School of Law\'s legal aid clinic, I advocated on behalf of prison inmates and poor families. I saw repeatedly how our legal system can be and all too often is stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable. I saw how families could be and were torn apart by excessive incarceration. I saw the toll on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison.So, unfortunately, I know these are not new challenges by any means.In fact they have become even more complex and urgent over time. And today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us.Today there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems. Senators as disparate on the political spectrum as Cory Booker and Rand Paul and Dick Durbin and Mike Lee are reaching across the aisle to find ways to work together. It is rare to see Democrats and Republicans agree on anything today. But we\'re beginning to agreeing on this: We need to restore balance to our criminal justice system.Now of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about itwe actually have to work together to get the job done.We need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses, and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected.Let me touch on two areas in particular where I believe we need to push for more progress.First, we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.There\'s a lot of good work to build on. Across the country, there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives. There are police departments already deploying creative and effective strategies, demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from those examples, build on what works.We can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets.President Obama\'s task force on policing gives us a good place to start. Its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform, from training to technology, guided by more and better data.We should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects. That will improve transparency and accountability, it will help protect good people on both sides of the lens. For every tragedy caught on tape, there surely have been many more that remained invisible. Not every problem can be or will be prevented with cameras, but this is a commonsense step we should take.The President has provided the idea of matching funds to state and local governments investing in body cameras. We should go even further and make this the norm everywhere.And we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions. As your Senator from New York, I supported a greater emphasis on community policing, along with putting more officers on the street to get to know those communities.David Dinkins was an early pioneer of this policy. His leadership helped lay the foundation for dramatic drops in crime in the years that followed.And today smart policing in communities that builds relationships, partnerships, and trust makes more sense than ever. And it shouldn\'t be limited just to officers on the beat. It\'s an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system. To prosecutors and parole officers. To judges and lawmakers.We all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities.We also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country, the inequality that stalks our streets. Because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don\'t talk about what\'s needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children. Today I saw an article on the front page of USA Today that really struck me, written by a journalist who lives in Baltimore. And here\'s what I read three times to make sure I was reading correctly: ""At a conference in 2013 at Johns Hopkins University, Vice Provost Jonathan Bagger pointed out that \'only six miles separate the Baltimore neighborhoods of Roland Park and Hollins Market. But there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy.\'""We have learned in the last few years that life expectancy, which is a measure of the quality of life in communities and countries, manifests the same inequality that we see in so many other parts of our society.Womenwhite women without high school educationare losing life expectancy. Black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country. This may not grab headlines, although I was glad to see it on the front page of USA Today. But it tells us more than I think we can bear about what we are up against. We need to start understanding how important it is to care for every single child as though that child were our own. David and I started our conversation this morning talking about our grandchildren; now his are considerably older than mine. But it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other. It was so clearly sharing what is most important to us, as it is to families everywhere in our country.So I don\'t want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that. The conversation needs to be much broader. Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.The second area where we need to chart a new course is how we approach punishment and prison.It\'s a stark fact that the United States has less than 5 percent of the world\'s population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world\'s total prison population. The numbers today are much higher than they were 30, 40 years ago, despite the fact that crime is at historic lows.Of the more than 2 million Americans incarcerated today, a significant percentage are low-level offenders: people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes, or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts.Keeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime. But it is does a lot to tear apart families and communities.One in every 28 children now has a parent in prison. Think about what that means for those children.When we talk about one and a half million missing African American men, we\'re talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers.They\'re not there to look after their children or bring home a paycheck. And the consequences are profound. Without the mass incarceration that we currently practice, millions fewer people would be living in poverty. And it\'s not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars. Of the 600,000 prisoners who reenter society each year, roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment.And for all this, taxpayers are paying about $80 billion a year to keep so many people in prison.The price of incarcerating a single inmate is often more than $30,000 per yearand up to $60,000 in some states. That\'s the salary of a teacher or police officer.One year in a New Jersey state prison costs $44,000more than the annual tuition at Princeton. If the United States brought our correctional expenditures back in line with where they were several decades ago, we\'d save an estimated $28 billion a year. And I believe we would not be less safe. You can pay a lot of police officers and nurses and others with $28 billion to help us deal with the pipeline issues.It\'s time to change our approach. It\'s time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.I don\'t know all the answers. That\'s why I\'m hereto ask all the smart people in Columbia and New York to start thinking this through with me. I know we should work together to pursue together to pursue alternative punishments for low-level offenders. They do have to be in some way registered in the criminal justice system, but we don\'t want that to be a fast track to long-term criminal activity, we don\'t want to create another ""incarceration generation.""I\'ve been encouraged to see changes that I supported as Senator to reduce the unjust federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine crimes finally become law. And last year, the Sentencing Commission reduced recommended prison terms for some drug crimes. President Obama and former Attorney General Holder have led the way with important additional steps. And I am looking forward to our new Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, carrying this work forward.There are other measures that I and so many others have championed to reform arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences are long overdue.We also need probation and drug diversion programs to deal swiftly with violations, while allowing low-level offenders who stay clean and stay out of trouble to stay out of prison. I\'ve seen the positive effects of specialized drug courts and juvenile programs work to the betterment of individuals and communities. And please, please, let us put mental health back at the top of our national agenda. You and I know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers. Well, we got half of that equationbut not the other half. Our prisons and our jails are now our mental health institutions.I have to tell you I was somewhat surprised in both Iowa and New Hampshire to be asked so many questions about mental health. ""What are we going to do with people who need help for substance abuse or mental illness?"" ""What are we going to do when the remaining facilities are being shut down for budget reasons?"" ""What are we going to do when hospitals don\'t really get reimbursed for providing the kind of emergency care that is needed for mental health patients?""It\'s not just a problem in our cities. There\'s a quiet epidemic of substance abuse sweeping small-town and rural America as well. We have to do more and finally get serious about treatment.I\'ll be talking about all of this in the months to come, offering new solutions to protect and strengthen our families and communities.I know in a time when we\'re afflicted by short-termism, we\'re not looking over the horizon for the investments that we need to make in our fellow citizens, in our children. So I\'m well aware that progress will not be easy, despite the emerging bipartisan consensus for certain reforms. And that we will have to overcome deep divisions and try to begin to replenish our depleted reservoirs of trust.But I am convinced, as the congenital optimist I must be to live my life, that we can rise to this challenge. We can heal our wounds. We can restore balance to our justice system and respect in our communities. And we can make sure that we take actions that are going to make a difference in the lives of those who for too long have been marginalized and forgotten.Let\'s protect the rights of all our people. Let\'s take on the broader inequities in our society. We can\'t separate out the unrest we see in the streets from the cycles of poverty and despair that hollow out those neighborhoods.Despite all the progress we\'ve made in this country lifting people upand it has been extraordinarytoo many of our fellow citizens are still left out.Twenty-five years ago, in his inaugural address as Mayor, David Dinkins warned of leaving ""too many lost amidst the wealth and grandeur that surrounds us.""Today, his words and the emotion behind them ring truer than ever. You don\'t have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools. Families who work hard but can\'t afford the rising prices in their neighborhood.Mothers and fathers who fear for their sons\' safety when they go off to schoolor just to go buy a pack of Skittles.These challenges are all woven together. And they all must be tackled together.Our goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that\'s measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead...How many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison...How many young people can go to college without breaking the bank...How many new immigrants can start small businesses ...How many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family.That\'s how we should measure prosperity. With all due respect, that is a far better measurement than the size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings.Now even in the most painful times like those we are seeing in Baltimore ...When parents fear for their children...When smoke fills the skies above our cities...When police officers are assaulted...Even thenespecially thenlet\'s remember the aspirations and values that unite us all: That every person should have the opportunity to succeed. That no one is disposable. That every life matters.So yes, Mayor Dinkins. This is a time for wisdom.A time for honesty about race and justice in America. And, yes, a time for reform.David Dinkins is a leader we can look to. We know what he stood for. Let us take the challenge and example he presents and think about what we must do to make sure that this country we lovethis city we live inare both good and great.And please join me in saying a prayer for the family of Freddie Gray, and all the men whose names we know and those we don\'t who have lost their lives unnecessarily and tragically. And in particular today, include in that prayer the people of Baltimore and our beloved country.Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 5, 2015","b'Remarks at a Roundtable with Young Nevada Residents in Las Vegas, Nevada'","b'CLINTON: Oh, hello. Hi, how are you? Well, it\'s wonderful to be back in Nevada and here at Rancho. I am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me and all of you about their lives, their stories, and in particular immigration. I want to acknowledge my friend and Congresswoman Dina Titus. Thank you so much for being here. And it is Cinco de Mayo, so that\'s especially appropriate day for us to be having this conversation. I want to begin by thanking everyone at Rancho High School for hosting us today. I\'m looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. I have a lot of wonderful memories from my time here in Nevada. I\'ve gone door to door meeting with families not far from the school. I\'ve met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. I accompany the registered nurse on 12-hour shift at St. Rose Dominican Hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her and her kids. And I know how hard hits Nevadans work by the great recession. This date in particular suffered some very tough blows. There were a much higher than average home for closure rate for example, a lot of people lost their jobs or their hours or cut dramatically which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living. We now see that this state is coming back from those top economic times. Families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. We also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college. Maybe doing some home repairs, maybe putting a little bit aside for retirement. But we\'re not yet back on our feet. We have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we\'ve got to do more than just get by. We have to get ahead and stay ahead. And there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. I think that it\'s important to recognize that even with all of the hard work and sacrifices so many families made, in many ways, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. And I\'m well aware that in Las Vegas there is nothing worse than a stacked deck. I want to reshuffle the deck. I want to be a champion for hard-working Americans. I want to work across party lines. I want to work with the public and the private sector. I want people to get back to the good old-fashioned American style of problem solving and setting us on back the right course. Now, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. They have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. They have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. My dad was a small businessman and when I say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. My mom, my brothers and I, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the United States. He made a good living for our family and I will forever be grateful for that. Because when families are strong, America is strong. And I am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important. Now in this campaign, I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. And that means we\'ve got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. Education is the key. But education in the first years of life is essential. Because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. So, we\'ve got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential. It\'s also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that\'s means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. This is a family issue. It\'s an economic issue, too. But it is at heart a family issue at. And if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it\'s the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. That\'s why we can\'t wait any longer. We can\'t wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship. Now this is where i differ with everybody on the republican side. Make no mistakes, today not a single republican candidate announced or potential is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one. When they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status. And we should never forget who this debate is about and you\'re going to meet some of them in just a minute. People who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and wants nothing more than to build a good future for themselves and their children. We\'re talking about the young people at this table. They are dreamers in much more than name. They are kids that any parents or grandparent would be proud of. And I don\'t understand how anyone can look at these young people and think we should break up more families, or turn away more hard workers with talent to help us build the kind of country we all want to see. So, I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further. There are more people, like many parents have dreamers, and others, with deep ties and contributions to our communities, who deserve a chance to stay and i will fight for them. The law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. But that\'s just the beginning. There\'s much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform. You know, our personal basis, the first time I ever met anyone who was in our country working was when I was about 12 years old, as I recall. And through my church, I was recruited, along with some other girls in our Sunday school class to serve as babysitters on Saturday for the small children, so the older children could join their parents in the fields because believe it or not when I was growing up in the Chicago area, it was farm field as far as the eye could see. And the migrants, immigrant laborer would come up, through the Texas up through Midwest, up to Chicago, then up to Michigan. And we were asked to try to help out. I remember going to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids, while kids at my age were doing really hard work. And what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day there was a long road from in the camp that went out to a kind of dirt road in the middle of the fields. And the bus that had the workers from the field down it that came back around 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, stopped and let off the parents and the older brothers and sisters and all these little kids started running down the path to see their moms and dads and their big brothers and sisters. And they were scooped up by these really, really tired people. And I just watched this and I thought, they\'re just like me and my brothers. You know, when my dad comes home from work, and we go out to see him. After he has come back from his day of doing what he had to do to help support us. I\'ve never gotten that experience to the image out of my mind. And so, for me, this is about what kind of people we are and what kind of country we have. And I am actually convinced this is in our economic interest. It\'s in the interest of our values and it\'s even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation. So, you know, where I stand. And there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can, as president, and during this campaign, to make this case. I know there are people who disagree with me but I want them to have a conversation with me. Because the facts are really clear. You know, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy, both in what they buy and what they pay in Texas. In fact in New York, which I know a little bit about because I representative for eight years and I lived there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in New York. So, I\'m ready to have this discussion with anybody, anywhere, any time. But let me turn to the people who are living this story. I want you to meet them. I want you to hear from them. And I\'m going to start with you, Asther , if you will introduce yourself, and talk about your own life and what brings you to the table today. SILVA: Thank you, secretary. My name is Asther Silva. I am currently a student at the Nevada State College pursuing my degree in history with thesis in pre-law. I arrived in United States when I was four years old. And Nevada has been my home since I was five. I came here with my mom and dad. I had a younger brother here. He is a United States citizen. Fortunately, our family was scammed when I was very young. And because of that my father was given a deportation order. And so know, he\'s in order of deportation. CLINTON: He was scammed because you hired a lawyer to help you? SILVA: Yes. Well, it wasn\'t a lawyer. It was [inaudible] who took advantage of the fact that, you know, there was a lot of different immigration programs in the 1990s and people did not understand the differences. And so because of that, in 2001, my father was given deportation order that was not acted on until 2011. So our family in those 10 years did not know he been had that order deportation. Right now, thankfully, because of prior to your discussion, my dad has state of removal so he will qualify for the different action program once the lawsuit that\'s really an obstacle right now is moved out of the way. And my mom will who is here, she will be able to apply so that we\'re not afraid that she will be deported. CLINTON: And talk to me a little bit about what you have done in school. How you see your future. The contributions you have already made as a young person and what you would like to do further. SILVA: Growing up, I was really dedicated to school. My parents, they put a really big emphasis on me succeeding because of all the sacrifices they had made. They had not seen their family in 25 years. And so when I went to elementary school, middle school, I was reallyI was dedicated. In seventh grade, I was named the gladiator of the year at my middle school because I was the student that showedironically the most citizenship. And so just programs like that, but I could not take advantage of them because when once I turned the age of going to college, I couldn\'t have a way out. I was afraid for many years until finally a counselor at my college, at the college at College of Southern Nevada at that time knew what was happening and helped guide me and I became involved in politics. And knowing that I didn\'t have to be afraid from myself because there was something, and I met other people that we\'re in the same situation as myself, which is something that never happened before. CLINTON: Ericathat his mom. Part of our jobs as mom is to embarrass our children at any possible moment, but also when we\'re proud of them to show that pride. So, I\'m happy that they\'re there. Erica, how did you end up here with us today? ERICA: I\'m here to basically share my story. I came to the United States when I was two years old. My parents and I made the journey here after we lost my little sister. They basically wanted to give me a better future. I now have a 17-year-old brother. He\'s a U.S. citizen. And now with my parents would qualify if the lawsuit was lifted. I\'m currently going to CFS. I want to major in political science and psychology. And I\'m just here wondering what are your plans to help my community and help my family and help us not to live in fear anymore? CLINTON: Yes. Now that\'s why I think it so important that we continue to try to change the laws comprehensively. But as I have said numerous times, I support the president\'s action in the face of in action. I was personally very disappointed that when I was a senator for eight years, we had a few chances to try to do more for dreamers, do more for comprehensive immigration reform, and we were not successful. And then when I was Secretary of State, I was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the Senate for comprehensive immigration reform. And it was such a good signal that Democrats and Republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. And the Senate passed it and the House of Representatives would never take it up. And I think it would have passed if they had taken it up. But I think that theythe leadership in the House decided that politically they didn\'t want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform. But I think we have to keep working on it. And that is why your stories are so important because we can\'t look at it as though it is some kind of abstraction. It\'s real people\'s lives and so many people who have made contributions, who have worked hard in school, who have started businesses, who have raised their children here. And as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a U.S. citizen. So it\'swe have a lot of these blended families and I want to do more to make sure that Doca and Dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. I would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. But the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our Congress and try to resolve all of this. UNKNOWN: I\'m 26 years. And I have been here since I was one year old. I graduated this summer with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. And unfortunately, when I was 15 years old, both my parents and I we received orders for deportation. And since that day we have lived in fear. Thankfully, because of the production I have some relief, but unfortunately, I can\'t do the same thing from my parents. Unless the lawsuit again, stop or is dropped, my parents\' future isn\'t secure here in United States. And as a current documented immigrant here in the United States, I stand for me with the 50,000 undocumented transgender immigrants in this country who lack resources to get any legal representation to file within the one-year Deadline for asylum. So my question, Secretary Clinton, is would you lift the one-year deadline for asylum-seekers? CLINTON: Well, I think there\'s several things about that question that I\'d like to answer of. One is I think that people in the immigration system should be represented. And we have made some progress on that, but not enough. And so I am in favor, particularly for young people, to have representation. I\'d like everyone to have it. But if we have to, you know, try to prioritize, I would like young people, I would like people from vulnerable populations, who would otherwise not have the support that they need. And I don\'t think there\'s anything magic about the one-year. I think that as part of comprehensive reform, we need to look at how we make our entire system more humane. I alsoI\'m very worried about detention and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable, and four children, that I think we could do a better job if we kept detention to people who have a record of violence, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category. And I don\'t think we should put, you know, children and vulnerable people into big detention facilities because I think they are at risk. I think that their physical and mental health are at risk. So, these are issues that we should go as far as we can to get the resources to provide support and particularly representation and change some of our detention processes within the kind of discretion that I think the president has exercised with his executive orders. But it\'s also clear as the president has said many times a lot of these issues can only be resolved once and for all if we have changes in the law. So, I want to protect people. I want more humane treatment. No matter how the law currently is written or how it\'s enforced. And to put the resources behind doing that and then continue to fight for comprehensive reform. Thank you. Wanda UNKNOWN: Thank you, Secretary Clinton for being here and hearing our story and welcome to Nevada. CLINTON: Thank you. UNKNOWN: I arrived to the United States when I was seven months old. Nevada is the only place I call home. And I grew up here. I went to school here. I graduate in University of Nevada [inaudible] with two degrees here, education as you\'ve mentioned earlier is one of our strong points as dreamers. And because of it, I\'m looking at pursuing a law degree. But, again, the system of immigration messes up my family. [inaudible] in our family. I come from a mixed status family. Meaning my sister is a U.S. citizen who petitioned from my father to change the legal status, and he became a legal permanent resident. When we planned to do the same for my mother, unfortunately, she faces the three tenure bar. Because of it, it was either make the decision to have her either separate our family or keep our family together. And a strong message in the immigration community is keeping our families together, and that is the path what we took. CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: Unfortunately, she continues to be undocumented. I haveand what the president executive action, she will qualify for [inaudible], thankfully, but unfortunately with the lawsuit weit\'s another obstacle in the way. CLINTON: Wanda could you explain for people who might not know what the three and 10 rule is because it causes a lot of these issues. UNKNOWN: Of course. For example, my mother and I, we enteredthe termlegal term enter by infection but we use the term the illegally. My father in his case entered with a work permit. So, he entered legally. And because of it, we faced a 3 to 10 year bar because we way we entered to our journey. We took a different way compared to my father. So because of it, we face 3-10 year bar, we would have to leave our country. We tried to do it the right way undocumented community. But we had to leave the country for 3 to 10 years as a pardon for entering illegally into the country. CLINTON: Well, I think your example illustrates the difficulties of these rules that are applied to everybody under every circumstance without looking at the underlying situation. And you have a sister who is a citizen. You have a father who is now a legal permanent resident. You came here at seven months and you have done extremely well with your education, and you\'re obviously a very committed young person. And your mother, who kept the family going as moms do would have to leave for the 3 to 10-year period in order to be able to petition for reentry and therefore be determined as legal. That\'s why I have promoted, ever since, you know, we\'ve been having this debate, going back to when I was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. You\'d probably, you know, we\'d want you to learn English which is not a problem before anybody around this table. And we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you\'d be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in. So, I think there arethere\'s agreement among the people who supported the bipartisan bill in the Senate even thoughI guess some of them are paying a political price for it right now, nevertheless, it was the right thing that they may get it, it is still the right thing. Because we have gained so much from people wholike your families have come here and work hard and made a contribution. So, thank you for explaining that and it shows how difficult it is in so many families to be able to figure out what to do. And Juan, you have an interesting story because you are a one of those small businessmen. You know, I said the other day I wan to be the president for small business because that\'s where most jobs created and that\'s where I think the real engine of economic recovery and growth comes from. So, why don\'t you tell us what you\'ve been doing? UNKNOWN: My name is Juan Salazar. I\'m 22 years old. I came here when I was seven when I was young. I grew up here. This is all I know, the place I called home. And I\'m undocumented. I struggled when I getit hit me when I got out of high school. It was hard to find a job. In high school, I found my friends were getting these jobs or getting their drivers license becoming more independent. You know, I got left behind. Butfortunately, thanks to DACA, I was able to get a work permit and I\'ll tell youand I could tell us pick from all of us undocumented or immigrant. I did not take no opportunity for granted. We don\'t take an opportunities for granted and I feel like we don\'t get those a lot. And right away I went to go get my business license andtoI have my own pool cleaning service. So my own company and me and my [inaudible]. And we started off with three pools. And I got my business license. I went to get certified. And, you know, to promote my name and everything. And you know, two or three years later, now, we have over 50 pools. And, you know, I am growing as to [inaudible]. I make sure that I work hard because when we didn\'t have anything, when my dad lost his job, when the decision hit, we lost our house. We didn\'t have work. We had to sell food to pay the phone bills. And, you know, I was the only going way up from there. And we\'re working hard every day. And, you know, I\'m only learning through the struggles that we\'ve been through, and taking it step-by-step. CLINTON: I\'m very proud to hear your story. Of course, I mean, let\'s face it, you can clean pools all year round in Nevada. We have a shorter season where I live. But the fact that, you know, you and your dad really were determined to recover from losing your home, losing his job, and just doing what you had to do to be as successful as possible, is the American story. I mean that is what is so moving to me about what happened to you. UNKNOWN: Yes. And, you know, I feltat least [inaudible] for once I got the [inaudible]. I got my work\'s permit, but I cannot say the same thing for my parents because they don\'t qualify for that type ofbecause, you know, we are all undocumented. So it was just, you know, I\'m happy for the ones who were able to. But now they have a speed bump because... CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: ... they\'ve got to slow down now. And I just want to make sure my parents are protected [inaudible] any minute. And I would not wish that on anybody. CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: Our family separated that far. So, you know, right here in Nevada, 21 percent of the business are owned by immigrants. So we are making a lot ofwe are moving up here and we\'re making a difference. All we want is work and, you know, provide for our families. And we\'re very unitedme and my family. So... CLINTON: That\'s great. Well, I think that you put an important statistic, which is nationally, not just in Nevada, so many of the new small businesses are started by immigrants. And that\'s something we should be celebrating, not trying to prevent or breakup, because of status differences. And also on the fact that you\'re so worried about your parents. I mean I will certainly try to do everything I can to, you know, avoid family breakup, avoid the kind of terrible experience that too many families have already gone through, because they were split up. And half of their family, or the breadwinner in their family, you know, picked up and gone one day. So that\'s justit\'s not smart and it\'s not right. Do you want to share your story? UNKNOWN: My name is [inaudible]. I am 16 years old. I\'m a junior and went to high school. It\'s either medical minor program. I arrived in this country at the age of two. And since then, I thank the dedication of my parents. I have been able to succeed in school. I have... CLINTON: Yes. UNKNOWN: Currently, as a junior, I continue and start to look towards my future. But once I began to look at what I have in my future, there is not a lot open. I mean, yes, think that guy could go to school, but afterwards, what is there for me? Like, I want to be a doctor. I want to go to Yale. CLINTON: OK. UNKNOWN: But, after Yale, I can\'t really become a doctor since my lack of [inaudible] CLINTON: well, I think should brag on you. You may be a junior but you have the highest grade point average in the whole class, right? And I think one of your counselors told me it was 4.8. I didn\'t even know they went that high. So you are exactly the kind of student that every familythat every community should be proud of. And the idea that you want to be a doctor is something we should be encouraging and trying to clear the path so you can go on and do that. Tell me about your family. What happened with the rest of your family? UNKNOWN: Myboth of my parents also arrived as undocumented. CLINTON: OK. UNKNOWN: So I and they were both depending on DACA. My specifically, he bright future to open up his own mechanic shop which he could be currently a mechanic. And with that, he would be able to expand his business. However, since the delay he really can\'t. CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s important to, you know, put faces behind the stories. Several of you have mentioned how the lawsuit tried to prevent the implementation of President Obama\'s executive order has really stopped the planstopped plans for new businesses, stopped plans for going to school, or what you\'re going to do when you graduate just creating more uncertainty. And that is what you are describing with respect to your father. Yes. You know, I think that certainty is really important, predictability, regularization, if you will. People need to know what\'s going to happen. And it is just unrealistic, and I think, foolish to continue to talk as though we\'re going to deport 11 million or 12 million people. That is not going to happen. And so, when you accept the fact that is not going to happen... UNKNOWN: No. CLINTON: ... right? I once calculated when I was in the Senate how much money it would cost, how many buses would be required. I mean it\'s just, you know, it\'s beyond absurd. That\'s not going to happen. So then, what we have to do is accept the fact we are a nation of immigrants. It always have been. I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who might have said that we started off as a nation of revolutionaries and immigrants. And that has continued throughout our history. So we have to solve the issues that are around this situation that we are faced with. And the facts are really clear about the contributions, the economic consumer contributions, the paying of taxes contributions, and then the young people who work hard and are looking for a place in society. So I know that you each have had very personal experiences. And now is your chance to maybe say what you think should be done and how it should be done so that we have, you know, a debate that is about the realities, not about, you know, the talking points and the arguments. Esther , would you like to start? UNKNOWN: Well, secretary, I think one of the most important things for us is family unification. As you mentioned, 11 million people could not be deported. However, millions have already been deported. We have here with us Victoria. She\'s also a dreamer who received DACA. She hasn\'t seen her mother in four years because they had to go back to Mexico for an emergency. And on the way back, her mother was unfortunatelybroke her leg on the journey back to the United States. And Victoria came here alone. So she\'s been with a guardian for the past four years. And to me, one of the questions is what will happen to those families who\'ve already been separated? Thankfully, I go to bed every night and, you know, I live in the fear that my parents will be deported, but they\'re still here. CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: I can talk to them and I can see them. You know, and I think all of our stories have very complex issues where Juan working and his family\'s also makes status family all tired of it. You know, we all have siblings which two to three to 10 year bar. Our parents would qualify for adjustment. Unfortunately, that\'s still in place. So my question is a little bit expanding on several of those issues. CLINTON: Yes. No, I think that reunification should be one of our goals in Comprehensive Immigration Reform because, you know, we have attempted to deal with this challenge for years now and in the absence of actually finally passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a lot of families have been broken up. And that\'s just really so painful for people who live through it, but even for those of us on the outside looking at it to even imagine what that must be like. And that\'s why I want to do everything we can to defend the president\'s executive orders because I think they were certainly within his authority. Constitutionally, legally, they were based on precedent that I believe is adequate. And then, still try to go further and deal with some of these other issues, like the reunification of families that were here and that have been split up since the last eight, 10, 12 years. Yes. UNKNOWN: For me, if there\'s 276,000 undocumented LGBT immigrants here in the United States, around 15 to 50 of them are trans. So as a lesbian woman, I\'d like to know how we can protect our trans brothers and sisters from being put into institutions where they don\'t identify with their gender identity? CLINTON: Well, that\'s what Rafael was also referring to earlier. And look I think that we have to do more to provide safe environments for vulnerable populations. And that certainly includes the LGBT community, also includes children, and it includes unaccompanied children. There are just athere are groups of people who I think we deserve a higher level of care, because of the situations that they are finding themselves in. I also think that we have to reform our detention system. I\'ve, you know, I\'m not sure a lot of Americans know that a lot of the detention facilities for immigrants are run by private companies and that they have a built in incentive to fill them up, that there is actually a legal requirement that so many beds be filled. So people go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per bed basis. I mean that just makes no sense at all to me. I mean that\'s not the way we should be running any detention facility. So I think there is a lot we have to do to change what is currently happening and to try to put us on a path toward a better, fairer, or more humane system for everybody. Yes. UNKNOWN: I think our court ability is a major factor. Many undocumented immigrants have been exploited. Personally, my parents were actually exploited. When they were atto this country, they had to work for $2 an hour. That was actually in 1990. I also think that since many of thesemany of our parents have actually, you know, had a work in a little wage jobs in order to, you know, to move up. I think it\'s also important to raise the minimum wage throughout the country andbecause I think people deserve to make a living wage. CLINTON: Yes. No, I agree with that completely. I am very much in favor of raising the minimum wage at the federal level. States and some cities are on their own raising the minimum wage. But I think there needs to be a federal floor. And I believe that the Democrats in the Senate are going to introduce legislation to do just that in the week. So I agree with you. Blanca ? UNKNOWN: Secretary Clinton, I think the biggest thing is, as you mentioned, you were going to keep the executiveif elected president, you plan to keep the executive order. But as a down, you mentioned as well that you are going to push Congress. We look forwardwell, personally, and I think all of us at this table look forward to a day where we all become citizens of this country. All of us at the table have knocked doors, phoned banks to get voters out there. And we tell them our stories, because it\'s so important that they\'re vote notit\'s not only voting for themselves, they are voting for us and the future of this country. CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: So if and when elected, do you plan to push Congress as your first initiative, to push for a Comprehensive Immigration Reform? CLINTON: Well, it certainly be among my first initiatives. I can\'tsitting here todaypredict what will be happening. I know that happened to President Obama when he was elected and found out that we were falling into an economic abyss. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for restabilizing our situation and getting us back on the economic upswing. So but among the priorities that I would be advocating forin the beginning would be Comprehensive Immigration Reform. And one of the reasons for that, in addition to everything we\'ve discussed is as secretary of state, I saw what happens to countries that established a second-class status for people. They do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they\'re never fully accepted. That is a recipe for divisiveness and even for disintegration. And there fore, my view strongly is that we are a nation of immigrants. We have assimilated tens and tens of millions of people over the course of our history. UNKNOWN: Yes. CLINTON: We have 11 million, 12 million people right now who are undocumented. The vast majority of whom have proven that they want to be a citizen of this country and we should put them on that path. And those who say, ""Yes, we can do reform, but not a path to citizenship,"" would be fundamentally undermining what has made America uniquethe way we have assimilated people, the way people who come here feel so loyal, the contributions they make. So this is not just in my view the right thing to do for America. If you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it\'s done to them. And I don\'t want to go there. So I very firmly support a path to citizenship in the context of Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Juan? UNKNOWN: I kind of just want to add a little personal story with what Rafael said. When I graduated high school, I realized I couldn\'t find any work. And my dad wasn\'t working as well. And we found a landscaping job, like a labor for a company. And we\'re actually getting paid $6 an hour where they would work us like excessively. And, you know, I was young. And I was just working really, really hard. It\'s been to a point where you felt like that you\'d be humiliated. I remember we\'d been working and that the boss was there. We could not look at him in the eye. We could not look at him, and we could not stop working. We hadn\'t worked harder. And even if it was lunchtime, you had to be working until he left. And, you know, I was justthere\'s lots of stories not just like that. There\'s other stories that we have and I\'m through that. It just felt like that and it\'s really hard. And, you know, me and my dad worked really hard. You know, Timber United so when he would get home from work, and I would see him limping, I don\'t like, you know, I don\'t want this for him which is kind of what motivated me to do something for us. CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: And, you know, he\'s helped me out through all his life and raised me to respect everyone and be honest and, you know, supported me with school. When we didn\'t have money, I\'d still go part-time to see a cent. I don\'t know how I did it but I was going. And, you know, I just looking out for him. And we can\'t [inaudible] united so I\'m really glad he\'s like my business partner. CLINTON: I bet he\'d say the same thing about you. UNKNOWN: Yes. CLINTON: But, you know, Juan, you make a good point. It\'s not only about the minimum wage and decent working conditions for people like you and your dad. Often times when I have conversations with people who are fearful about immigration reform, their fears are rooted in the feeling that they\'re losing jobs that are going to people who are undocumented. And part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you\'re undocumented. Why would they pay somebody who already is a citizen what the minimum wage should be? So my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as thoughand to some extent it\'s trueare losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse. So my argument to people who worry about Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the effect on their jobs, it\'s just the opposite. The sooner we can get to legalization, the better the job market will be for everybody. Then, employers will not be able to violate the lawsthe Wage and Hour Laws for example, because they\'re not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site. So this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad. UNKNOWN: Yes, of course. CLINTON: Yes. UNKNOWN: I\'ll tell you one more question. CLINTON: OK. UNKNOWN: I just wanted to say, what do you planwell, I know here in Nevada and this county our educationwe keep on like lowering the education. A lot of kids aren\'t graduating. And I feel like we need to reach out to these kids and... CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: ... show them that school is very important and so is higher education. A lot of kids don\'t eventhey qualify for collegethere\'s not anmaybe we need to figure out some other way. I think a lot of the reason is because of funding. CLINTON: Yes. UNKNOWN: They can\'t afford it and they feel discouraged and they just go on... CLINTON: Right. UNKNOWN: ... and decide not to go to school. CLINTON: Right. Well, look I think that that\'s a big part of what we have to do to make sure that out economy is competitive and also to make sure that every young person has a chance to continue their education whether it\'s a community college or college or a job training kind of program that will give them a good start. And you make a really strong point because it\'s so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feelingand their parents are feeling it\'s just beyond their reach. So that\'s why I support President Obama\'s proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I\'d like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education. So this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you\'re 100 percent right. Too many young people today feel like, you know, it\'s just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. They don\'t know what to do. They can\'t buy a house, they can\'t get married, they can\'t start a business because the have so much in student debt. And, you know, then, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, you know, the average student in Iowa graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt, and then, the average student in New Hampshire, about $32,000 worth of debt. They\'re at the higher end. Nevada is still at the lower end of debt. But, you know, you also have a lot of people who don\'t have that much in assets and income. So it\'s all, you know, relative to what they can afford. So we have to do more on that. And I want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about Rancho because I learned today that this school uses Title I funds to pay for the A.P. exam fee. This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education. It gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there. But too many kids in the past and still across our country don\'t take the test becauseI don\'t know what it does today$80? UNKNOWN: $85. CLINTON: $85. That\'s a lot of money if, you know, you\'re making minimum wage or less. So I want toI really want toI don\'tI hope that the Rancho administrators are still here becausegood. The principal is still here. I want to give them a big shout out for using Title I funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an A.P. course gets to and gets to take the exam. So I\'m sure, you\'re going to do some of that next year. [crosstalk] Currently. You have them tomorrow? UNKNOWN: I had my Chemistry test Monday and I have my Statistics and English Language next Monday. CLINTON: So you\'re taking three A.P. exams as a junior? UNKNOWN: Yes. CLINTON: Wow. Wow. OK. UNKNOWN: [inaudible] to education topic? CLINTON: Sure. UNKNOWN: Once DACA was brought openestablished, it opened doors for many like myself to school to try Yale, Harvard, et cetera. But oftentimes, the journey ends there and I was wondering if or what was your position or what will you offer in order for us to be able to continue on to our education and become or raised doctors, so on and so forth. CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back. We have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year. And they get a great education in our colleges and universities. And then, a lot of them stay. Well, I want you to be a doctor if that\'s what you want to be. I mean you\'ve come up to our system, you\'ve worked hard, and then you\'ve done exceptionally well. So I think this is the particular fix in addition to the other fixes we\'ve been talking about. You know, I read an article recently about a group of young, undocumented men who were really interested in technology and they entered a contest against kids from the best schools and companies and they won. And so, you have four kids who beat the best of the best. And they couldn\'t do anything because they were undocumented. And I am sitting there thinking, ""What is wrong with this picture?"" We are in a global competition and I intend for us to win it. And I\'m about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away. So from my perspective we need to fix that, we need to remove the fear, and we need to make sure that we give every child a chance to do the best that he or she can. And if that means going to Yale and becoming a doctor I want that to happen. So, as you can tell, I could be here all day because, you know, six exceptional young people, we have some proud parents and grandparents and teachers here. But let me and where I started thanking Rancho for having me here, thanking each of you for being willing and brave enough to sit here and talk about your own lives. I want to reiterate my strong support for the president\'s executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which I think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our Congress or anywhere else. And I\'m so pleased that the congresswoman is here because I know she\'s a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today. And I want to get back to good old-fashioned problem-solving. And this is one of the problems we have to solve together. So I pledge to you I will do everything I possibly can to make this an issue in the campaign but more importantly, when I\'m president, to put it on the top of my priority list. So if you\'ll stay here, we\'re going to do a picture. And maybe we could get the Ranchothe principal and others to come up and join us, you know. Yes. Let\'s get the administrators who invited us all here to come and stand. If you\'ll just stand with us we will get a picture with everybody. Congresswoman, why don\'t you join us?  [crosstalk] Write me a memo about what I need to do differently. Yes, you want to come around? UNKNOWN: What if everybody stand up? CLINTON: OK. We stand up? That\'s good. Excellent. UNKNOWN: OK. Come closer. CLINTON: OK. Come closer. Give me that. And Juan, you\'re going to give me that. That\'s great.  [crosstalk] UNKNOWN: Say cheese. CLINTON: Yes, look at Barb and then we\'ll look at all the very proud parents with their cameras. UNKNOWN: OK. CLINTON: OK. So we\'ll look over here. OK, got some cameras over here. It\'s like when you\'re on the red carpet and they yell at you. ""Look here"". OK. Thank you. Great. You want to come around? OK. Good to meet you, Chris. UNKNOWN: Good to meet you. Thank you so much. CLINTON: I\'m so happy I could. Thank you so much. UNKNOWN: I\'m very grateful. CLINTON: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Is your name Barbara ? UNKNOWN: Barb. Everyone call her Barb. CLINTON: Barb. UNKNOWN: Thank you. And just so you know, my mom write to you like everywhere. [inaudible] friendly. CLINTON: Good. UNKNOWN: [inaudible] go away and you should call it Hillary until [inaudible] Hillary is... CLINTON: I love that. UNKNOWN: Right. It\'s nice. CLINTON: Here you go.  [crosstalk]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 18, 2015","b'Remarks at a Campaign Event in Mason City, Iowa'","b'CLINTON: Thank you. Wow. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And Sarah, that was excellent. I thank you so much. And I hope you\'ll get to know Sarah and spend time with her and help her as she works so hard between now and February 1st. And Dean and Gary, thank you for welcoming us to your beautiful home; what a delight it is to be here with you. [applause] Somebody asked me the other day, well, you know, you\'re going to these events, where you\'re taking time to actually talk and listen to people, is that really what you\'re going to do? And I said, well, yes, it is because not only do I learn a lot but I also feel like it\'s the best way to make those connections that will not only give me a firm foundation in the caucus here in Iowa or in a primary in New Hampshirebecause it really is about people-to-people connections if we\'re really talking about what we want to dobut it will also give me the kind of information I need to be an even better president. And I just had another example about that. You may know that Gary\'s a radiologist and right before we came in, we were talking about his work. He\'s an expert in breast cancer. And I asked him about the mammography recommendations that\'s at least the women in the room I\'m sure have seen over the last several years. And he was giving me some really important insight into the commission that made those recommendations and his expert opinion about them. And I\'m so grateful to you for that because it\'s the kind of discussion that you can\'t have unless you have an opportunity to actually talk and listen with people. I want to thank all of you for coming. I am delighted to have this chance to talk with you. I think what we\'re going to do is I\'ll say a few words about the campaign and what I want to achieve. And then we\'ll have a chance to talk individually and I\'ll be able to hear from each and every one of you. I have been incredibly impressed over the last several years at how hard the American people have worked to pull ourselves out of the Great Recession. People have made a lot of sacrifice. People have lost jobs. They lost houses. They lost the chance to finish or go on with their education. And they did everything that they could think of to do to get back on their feet. And I\'m so relieved that, as I travel around the country and talk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. We\'re not running yet but we are on our feet. And we can see the changes that are happening in people\'s lives and put them in a context as to where we go from here now as a country. I\'m very grateful to President Obama for the hard decisions he made when he inherited the mess that he inherited when he became president in 2009. [applause] And I know that he and I and everyone who was in his administration realizes that, unless the American family and the American worker is strong, everything we want to see happen for our country is going to be much more difficult. And so I come to this campaign committed to being a champion for Americans and American families. That\'s what my work has been throughout my entire adult life, starting with my first job out of law school when I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund, all the way through to the work that I did as secretary of state promoting women\'s rights, promoting the rights of people who would otherwise be marginalized or left on the sidelines. And I know that, although we have toit\'s still hard to imagine exactly how we\'re going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. We know that. And so we have to be especially focused on how we\'re going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it again. So when I look at where we are as a nation and where we need to be, I see four big challenges that we have to take on together. And there are going to be fights, because they\'reif they were easy, they would already be done. So I will posit that right now. Number one, we have to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. It needs to be innovative. It needs to be sustainable. It needs to be producing good jobs with rising wages. We need to get back into the habit of actually rewarding workers with increases in their paychecks for the increases in productivity and profitability that they have helped to bring about. [applause] You know, Warren Buffett has said it, but so have a lot of other people. There\'s something wrong when the average American CEO makes 300 times more than the typical American worker or when hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers. In fact, I heard a statistic the other day that really made a big impact on me, that the top 25 hedge fund managers together made more money than all the kindergarten teachers in America. And when you think about value, what it is that\'s going to get us moving again, I think kindergarten teachers are really important. And so[laughter and applause]and we\'ve got to make a claim on becoming the 21st century clean energy superpower. Iowa has really helped us. The RFS, the renewable fuel standard and a lot of the investments that have made here, has been one of the reasons why we have made some real progress but not near enough. And other countries are going to seize that title unless we do what we have to. It\'s also imperative that we give people the tools through education and job training and skills not just in rhetoric but in reality so that they can make the most out of their own lives. And for me that starts at the very beginning. I have been a child advocate and a child development proponent for my entire adult life because it\'s what I really care about, what I believe in. And I think we have to start before kindergarten. We have to have universal pre-K but we also have to do more to reach out to families so they know the tools they should use to be their children\'s first teachers. Now we\'ve got this new granddaughter who is unbelievable. And we were with her this weekend. You know, we go and just stare at her. I mean, that\'s whatit\'s reallyit\'s wonderful and silly at the same time. But we also read to her. Here she is, 7.5 months old, we\'re reading and reading and reading. And I imagine among her first words werewill be, you know, ""Enough with the reading,"" because between her mom and her dad and Bill and I, we\'re constantly doing that. But we\'re doing it not only because we love to do it and we love to see her begin to reach her hands out and grab onto the books, we\'re doing it because we know that it aids her brain development. That has been one of the great discoveries with brain research in the last couple of decades. We increasingly can see what happens when you are literally feeding the brain as well as the body of these infants and then the babies and the toddlers. That will help them be better prepared when they actually end up in kindergarten and it will begin to close the achievement gap because, you know, we\'re going to do everything we can for our granddaughter. Charlotte will get every opportunity we can possibly imagine. But what kind of country will she grow up in? And what kind of world will she enter? And what will happen to all of the other infants, babies, toddlers and children in our country today? So we have to look at education from the very beginning. Then we have to make sure that we are doing all we can to empower our teachers, to make sure that they have the support of parents so that they can do the job they have been trained to do to help prepare our kids. And then we\'ve got to make sure that college is affordable. And that cannot happen at the rate we\'re going unless we change the way we fund college education for young people who wish to have that experience. Many of us in this room, I bet, as I did, borrowed money to go to college. But then we were able to pay it back because it wasn\'t such an overwhelming burden as it has become now. The average student in Iowa graduates with $30,000 in debt and that then makes it very difficult for them to start a business or buy a new home or even get married, as one young man told me not so long ago. So we have to deal with the indebtedness to try to move toward making college as debt-free as possible. I\'m 100 percent behind President Obama\'s proposal for free community college. We\'ve got to try to get that through. And then we\'ve got to try to do everything we can to make college available and affordable to all of our young people. [applause] You know, when you think about our economy today, it is absolutely linked to education. It is also linked to strong families and strong communities. And that\'s our second challenge, because a lot of families and communities have been under tremendous strain. One of the biggest stresses in anybody\'s life is health care. I will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act and I will work to make the changes that are required. [applause] We are really now in a different world, 16 million people who didn\'t have health insurance who now do. We have to do everything we can to make sure that Medicare is as available and protected and affordable as possible. And we have to be sure that where there are changes that can be made we try to find ways to work across the aisle to make them. I don\'t hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking as much as they used to about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. I think the reason is is because there are a lot of people that they may actually be encountering from time to time who have been helped. And we need to make sure to make the argument over and over again, what will you do if you say to people we\'re going to take away the health care we finally have been able to provide for you? That is just unacceptable. But there are some problems. You know, one of the problemsand I heard about this in Iowais what happens when a 26-year old becomes a 27-year old and is no longer eligible to be on his or her parents\' policy? That was one of the best changes in the Affordable Care Act. And the fact is that a lot of young people aren\'t making the income they need yet to be able to afford their own health care. So we have to look out to see what we\'re going to be able to do to help them. There are two issues that fall into this category that are huge strains on families. And I heard about them firstI heard first in Davenport and I heard about it all the way across the state until I got to Council Bluffs. One is the drug epidemicmeth, pills in Iowa and then I got to New Hampshire. And at my very first coffee shop meeting I heard about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire. In the past year I\'ve been told reliably we had more people die of drug overdoses in America than automobile accidents for the first time in our history. This is tearing families apart but it is below the surface. People aren\'t talking about it because it\'s something that is hard to deal with. I also heard a lot about untreated mental health problems. And so many communities, so many states turning their backs on people with mental health problems. Facilities are being closed. Even though we now require there to be treatment in the Affordable Care Act, there\'s not enough available treatment. Not enough resources. The other day, I was in California at an event. And I just said what I said. I said, you know, mental health is not being treated. We claim we\'re now going to be able to help people with their health care problems, but if we don\'t help with mental health, we\'re leaving out a huge number of people. And a young woman came up to me and asked me a question. She said, ""Did you know that we\'re having all these suicides in my high school?"" I said, ""No, I did not know that before I came."" She goes, ""Well, we\'ve had four young people kill themselves in the last months."" Then I was in New York at an event this past way. Said the same thing that I said to you, and then I was visiting with people. And a woman come upcame up to me and she goes, ""Thank you for mentioning mental health. We have gone in the last six months to four funerals of friends of my children who have killed themselves."" I have to tell you, when I started running, when I started thinking about this campaign, I did not believe I would be standing in your living room talking about the drug abuse problem, the mental health problem and the suicide problem. But I am now convinced I have to talk about it. I have to do everything I can in this campaign to raise it... [applause] ...to end the stigma against talking about it. And we also have a challenge that affects everything we do, and that is to fix our dysfunctional political system. And thatthat underlies everything that we can possibly hope to get done. I\'m very committed to meeting with anybody, going to have any conversation, to try to find common ground. But we also have to stand our ground. And we have to try to figure out how we\'re going to get people to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of people who need a good positive support system, whether it be health care of aid for college, or anything else. We also have to address the unaccountable dark money in politics. I think the supreme court made a grave error with its Citizens United decision. And I will do everything I can do to appoint supreme court justices who will protect the right to vote, and not the right of billionaires to buy elections. [applause] And, you know, I\'ve been consulting with a lot of legal experts. and some of them think there may be a way to get legislation through that will enable us to regulate this kind of use of money in our political system which is so corruptive and corrosive. But others agree with former Justice John Paul Stevens, who recently wrote a book in which he said it\'s going to take a constitutional amendment. I will work for that if that\'s the only way to fix this problem, because we cannot continue with the kind of assault on our democracy, on voting rights, and on the opportunity for us to know where the money is coming from that influences our political system. Now, for us , we have challenges around the world. I was coming through thethe garage, there\'s a TV that Dean and Gary have, and it was talking about ISIS in Iraq. We have threats that we know of. That we can begin to try to figure out how best to address. It\'s not just dictators. Also disease, climate change, whichI think global warming is a threat to us. But we have to be confident and strong in understanding that there are many ways to approach the problems that America will be confronting in the world. And we must do so in cooperation with our friends, our allies, our fellow democracies around the world. I am convinced that the 21st century can once again be a century in which the United States leads and helps to set the values and the standards. But we have to have an agreement, first of all, foremost, with our own country and in our own Congress about how to do that. I was outraged, and said at the time, that when a group of Republican senators sent a letter to the ayatollah of Iran, in aessentially criticizing the actions of the president of the United StatesI don\'t care what party you are. We have one president, and we should stand behind that president when he\'s trying to work out very difficult problems. [applause] So, I know there are a lot of hard choices ahead of us. I wrote a book called ""Hard Choices."" There is it. There is it. I\'ll sign that for you. But I think we\'re more than up to it. You know, I am a confident optimist about where America\'s future lies. That doesn\'t mean I\'m not aware of how difficult it is. I\'m going into this race with my eyes wide open about how hard it is to be the president of the United States. I have a little experience about that. And I have to tell you, I find it, you know, very reassuring because I do have that experience to know what\'s possible and how best to proceed. but I also know that we are living in an incredibly complicated time in American history. It is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines. Those are all great. That\'s part of campaigning. But at the end of the day, we need a president who has both the experience and the understanding to deal with the complexity of the problems that we face. And I appreciate what both Dean and Sarah said about the experiences that I\'ve been privileged to have during the last decades. I really believe that I can go into that office on the very first day and begin to do what is required. So I look forward to visiting with each and every one of you. I look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses. I would be honored to have your support on February 1st. And then I will need your help as we move toward the general election because I don\'t want this election to be about me. I want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country. You know, when I campaigned so hard against then-Senator Obama, I was, you know, working as hard as I could. He was working as hard as he could. And at the end of the day, he won. And then I went to work to make sure he got elected our president. And I was so relieved and happy when that finally happened. The Sunday after the election, Bill and I went for a walk in an area that Sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we\'d been working so hard to elect then-President-Elect Obama. So we\'re wandering through the woods, and Bill\'s phone rings, which is sort of a miracle since we have terrible cell coverage there. And he pulled it out of his pocket and it was the president-elect. And he said, ""You know, I\'d like to talk to you and Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we\'re kind of in the middle of a forest. Can we get home and call you back?"" And so we did. And when he called backwhen Bill called back, he talked to the president-elect and then I talked to him. And he said to me, ""I want you to come see me in Chicago."" And I said, ""Sure. When?"" He goes, ""As soon as you can get here."" And I said, ""Well, OK."" So the following Thursday, I went to Chicago and he asked me if I would serve as secretary of state. And I said, ""You know, Mr. President-elect, I, you know, I really want to go back to the Senate. I\'m very flattered, but there are a lot of other people who could do that."" ""No,"" he said. ""I know what I want and I want you to do this."" I said, ""Well, you know, Mr. President-elect, I really want to go back to the Senate and that\'s where I think I can best work with you and best serve you."" He goes, ""Look,"" he said, ""I don\'t want to hear from you again until you say yes."" [laughter] So, you know, I told him ""no,"" you know, again later. And he just said, ""Don\'tdon\'t call me until you say yes."" And I did tell my husband, I said, ""He\'s so persistent. I\'ve told him no twice and he keeps saying, you know, I\'m waiting for you to say yes."" And Bill said, ""Yeah, well, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes."" [laughter] So I guess there\'s a connection there. So then II stayed up that night and II thought, you know, supposed I\'d been honored to win, and I had wanted this incredibly talented American to be in my cabinet and I\'d asked him, I\'d want him to say yes. And I thought, you know, what\'s what I have to do. So I called him and I said, ""You know, President-elect, I would be honored to serve in your cabinet."" And we immediately got starting to work. A few months later, on my very first trip as secretary of state, I went to Asia. And I went in part because everybody I called, all of the leaders in the countries that I spoke with, were saying, ""You know, we just don\'t know whether the United States cares about us anymore; nobody\'s been paying any attention to us; you know, we\'rewe\'re kind of feeling like we\'re not important to you anymore."" I said, ""Well, you are, and the president feels that way; I feel that way; I will come see you."" So I went out. And one of the countries that I went to was Indonesia, in part because it\'s a very important country, but also President Obama had a personal connection with it. And my idea was not only to talk to the leaders, but to talk to the people, what\'s called public diplomacy. So that as you wereas I was out there talking to presidents and prime ministers and others, I would also find ways of trying to connect to to tell people, ""Look, the United States really does care about the world we\'re trying to create together, and that\'s part of my message from our new president."" So I went on aI agreed to go on a show in Jakarta, which was their morning show. And it was like a combination of MTV and a reality show and all that. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. And so I go onto the set and people are jumping and they\'re singing and they\'re dancing. And it\'s called ""The Awesome Show."" So I\'m on ""The Awesome Show,"" and I\'m talking a little bit to the interviewer. And then they ask people if they have any questions. And somebody in the audience says, ""I want to ask you, we saw you campaigned very hard against President Obama; he campaigned very hard against you. He won. You lost. And then he asked you to be his secretary of state. Why?"" And I realized, you know, in a lot of these new democracies and other places of course, you run against somebody and you lose, you could get exiled or imprisoned, even killed; not asked to be secretary of state. And so this was a very legitimate question. And I thought, ""I have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections,"" at least that\'s what we should be doing. I said, ""Well, you\'re right. We campaigned hard. He won. I lost. I then campaigned to get him elected. He asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes for the same reason: We both love our country."" And at the end of the day to me... [applause] ...that\'s what elections are supposed to be about. We can disagree and we will. We\'ll have all kinds of arguments, even, about the best way to do things. But we should be coming from a place of loveof loving our country and of respecting one another. And we have to rebuild this feeling in our country again. We have too much work to be done. We have too many people who deserve a better shot at a future for themselves and their families. I want to be their champion. And with your help, I will get up every single day doing the best I can to make sure that the country we love is the country we deserve to have. Thank you all. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 19, 2015","b'Remarks in Cedar Falls, Iowa'","b'Well first let me thank all of you in particular our round table participants for being with us today and thanks to Bike Tech for welcoming us to this amazing facility. I\'m delighted to have this chance to talk more about small businesses. But I want to begin with what\'s happening more broadly with America\'s economy and America\'s families. Because I\'ve always believed fundamentally that when our families are strong, our country is strong.And we\'ve come back from very tough economic times. I don\'t need to tell anybody here that. Our economy and our country are in much better shape today, and in large measure because families worked so hard. They took extra jobs, they skipped vacations, they scrimped and they postponed going to college they saved and made it work. But the deck is still stacked for those at the top. People aren\'t getting a fair shake. Something is wrong when CEOs earn more than 300 times than what the typical American worker earns and when hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a truck drivers or nurses.I\'m running for president because everyday Americans and their families need a champion and I want to be that champion. I want families to do more than just get by  I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.Now, small businesses like Bike Tech and the ones you\'ll here about today have to be at the heart of that effort  creating jobs, driving growth, and giving millions of Americans the chance to live up to their God-given potential. Now, I did not learn this from politics  I learned it from my father who was a small business man. He had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them. My mother, my brothers and I and occasionally a few day laborers would help out with the actual printing process. That\'s what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home.Today, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time. Businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future.But the deck is stacked here as well. Ask any small business owner, as I have, and they\'ll tell you: It is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan. It shouldn\'t take longer to start a business in America than it does in Canada and France! But that is the fact.I want to be a small business president. A president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity. We have to level the playing field for our small businesses.First, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out. We should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that\'s where many of the obstacles still lie.Second, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole.Third, we\'ll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it\'s across town, across the state, or across the world. That\'s what I did in partnership with eBay in Upstate New York when I was a Senator. We started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away.Fourth, and I want to emphasize this today, I will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers. And this morning when I was reading the Des Moines Register  big head line: REPORT: Iowa Ranks Last for Women Owned Business. This could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says Iowa has made some progress it says Iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in Iowa and all the states and the District of Columbia. So this is a very important issue for our whole county but I think it is especially important for our friends here in Iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones.And you shouldn\'t have to be a Fortune 500 company to get a loan. For many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties. But today those same local banks are being squeezed by regulations that don\'t make sense for their size and mission. Like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions. And when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans. We can ease these burdens for community banks without harming consumers  and without easing up one bit on the Wall Street. We should not apply the same restrictions on community banks as those needed by the big banks.Let\'s be clear about this: It\'s not the big banks that need relief from Washington  it\'s small banks and small businesses. We should be doing more to rein in risky behavior on Wall Street and ""Too Big to Fail,"" banks not less. I fully support the regulations in Dodd-Frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a Trojan Horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks  as we\'re seeing right now in what Republicans are introducing  we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top.Our goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have. To make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead.So I\'m eager to hear the ideas from everyone around the table. And I see some elected officials in the audience and am eager to hear your ideas. What are the obstacles you\'ve faced and how can you overcome them? What more can we do to help small businesses grow?'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 20, 2015","b'Remarks in Chicago, Illinois'","b'Wow, what a great way to begin and to all of you especially Mary Carmen and LaKeisha thank you for speaking on behalf of providers and parents. We\'re going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today. I want to thank everyone at New Horizons for welcoming us to this facility. And to all my friends at SEIU as well. We\'re here today to talk about childcare. But its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we\'re talking about the economy, we\'re talking about families, we\'re talking about fairness, we\'re talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today. I want to say just a few words about what\'s happening with our economy and more broadly about America\'s families. Because I think when our families are strong America is strong. And if we don\'t have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better.We\'ve come back from really tough economic times. The great recession just really knocked people to the ground. People lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. It really took a lot out of everybody. And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. They took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. So everybody made it work.But the deck is still stacked for those at the top. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and I heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we\'re talking about today, if you take the salaries, the compensation, of the top 25 hedge fund managers in America, those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together. Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families. And I\'m running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.Now, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. I was born in Chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family I was born into. Most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. So that\'s a big different from the way it was when I and others here were growing up. Yet we haven\'t adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o\'clock I\'d see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn\'t know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. And it wasn\'t accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love.So we know that with Moms and Dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you Mary Carmen saying you work 17 hours, it\'s hard to even find time to breathe. And many can\'t count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet.So finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. But it\'s also harder than ever. Federal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it\'s no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. And now the Republican budget that is being worked on by the Congress would cut funding even more. Making it so much more difficult. America cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. Family values are economic values. I\'m going to be putting forth plans to fix this. We should do it now. And Republicans should either get on board or get out of the way.Because it\'s now time for us to face reality. Our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. And I\'m very clear about what I think needs to be done but I want to hear from all of you because what I\'m doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas I have, some of which I have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care.First, to bring down out-of-control family costs, we need to make investments in childcare a national priority. What President Obama has proposed is a good start. I\'ll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it\'s providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers. Whatever its going to take to give both LaKeisha and the providers more opportunities. And you know its embarrassing, I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. And the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. Every other country has something that says, we think it\'s really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it\'s important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing. So we\'ve got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care. And many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. There are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. We have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. Because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. That doesn\'t make any sense to me at all.So to all the childcare workers here today, I want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. You should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that. Now I am a new Grandmother and it\'s really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what I believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change Americans\' future. It makes it harder to retain the best staff. It makes it harder to keep up those high standards. So we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. There is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.That\'s why I so respect the vital work that SEIU is doing, under the leadership of President Mary Kay Henry, is so vital. I think it is absolutely essential.And I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don\'t take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they\'re going to be at a disadvantage. That\'s wrong, it isn\'t right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we\'re reading and we\'re talking and we\'re singing but we\'re not working 17 hour days and we\'re not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we\'re going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances.Ultimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. You see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. You want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that God-given potential. And I\'m here because I want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of America.So for me, this is as important an as anything else that I\'m going to talk about in my campaign for president. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"May 27, 2015","b""Remarks to the Democratic Women's Council in Columbia, South Carolina""","b'Well, this is so exciting, to be here with all of you and to be here for such an important cause, to make sure that the Democratic Party and particularly the Democratic Women\'s Council recruits and trains and fields more women for public office right here in South Carolina. There are a lot of longtime friends here; I won\'t try to mention everybody, but I do want to thank Susan and the entire board for DWC. And I want to thank Gilda, who I think has been in the state legislature since \'92, started in elementary school and worked her way up. Former Governor Jim Hodges, we\'re delighted he is here, thank you. A national Democratic chair, a state Democratic chair, of course Don and Carroll Fowler, so happy to see them. Your candidate for the Senate last time, Joyce Dikerson, thank you Joyce.I was thinking on the way down here that I first came to South Carolina as a young lawyer working for the Children\'s Defense Fund, started by your own South Carolina native Marian Wright Edelman from Bennettsville. I came back many times going to Renaissance weekend, going to Hilton Head, then going to Charleston. Made a lot of friends, had a lot of good times, and am thrilled to be back, and I\'m back because I want to support you.You know, the theme of this day of events is how to build a party and how to build a party that really respects and includes women and gives women in this state a chance to not only be at the table but at the head of the table. Carrying with them their Democratic experiences and their life experiences. And you\'re right, I am running to live again at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But I don\'t want to be there all by myselfI want Democrats elected from the local to the county to the state to the federal level, once again making the case that when Democrats win, Americans win.I want to say just a few words about what\'s happening to America\'s families and what\'s happening with our economy. Because I\'ve always believed fundamentally that when families are strong, America is strong.And we\'ve come through some really tough economic times. I looked at the statistics and South Carolina has pulled itself up and other places have as well. American families have made a lot of sacrifices. People lost jobs, people lost homes, people had to put college on the back burner, retirement on the back burner. But everybody just kept going. It took a lot of determination, and across America we\'re beginning to see the results of all that hard work. And I will say that there does seem to be a pattern, Democratic presidents, and there are two in particular that I\'m thinking of, over the last 35 years, seem to inherit a mess of problems. Have you noticed that? So then they have to dig us out of the ditches they find themselves in and put us back on the right track, and of course I\'m talking about Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama, but of course presidents don\'t do it alonethey do it with the American people. It\'s a partnership.And today we are standing again, but we\'re not yet running. And we face a choice: Are we going to hand over our country once again to people and policies that crashed our economy before and that will shred all the progress we\'ve made?[Crowd shouts NO!]Well that\'s obviously the right answer, but that\'s what this campaign is going to be about. Because we\'re going to have to stand up to the people who want to keep the deck stacked in favor of those at the top. We are going to fight to make sure that the success of our country is shared across the economy and that more families have the chance to get ahead and not just to get by but to stay moving forward with the kind of confidence and optimism that has always marked the best times in America.It\'s time to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again. They should represent a solemn promise that anyone willing to work hard can earn a decent living and a better life, not just get by paycheck to paycheck.That\'s the middle class I grew up in. My dad was a small businessman, and when I say small, it was small. He ran a small drapery printing business. And he literally had a print plant with big long tables that had silk screens, and sometimes my mother, my brothers, and I would help to pour the paint in and take the squeegee and then we\'d walk down the table, print the fabrics, and then he\'d go out and sell them. And it was a good decent middle-class life that he provided to my brothers and me. And I am so grateful, and there was never in my mind in fact that\'s what so many of us believed when we were growing up. The future seemed so unlimitedof course we had to fix a lot of things in the country, starting with civil rights and human rights, but the opportunity ladder always was held out there.I just came from Kiki\'s Chicken and Waffles, which I highly recommend, and I was meeting with a group of African American businesswomen, and they were telling me what they needed to keep growing and build an even better future, it sounded so much like the conversation I remember around my dinner table. That\'s what links us together past all the other differences that sometimes divide us.Being middle class in America should mean you feel in control of your own financial destiny.It should mean you have a little more, so you can worry a little less.It should mean that you can invest in your future and the future of your children, putting aside some for education, putting aside some for retirement.You should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that everything you\'ve worked for won\'t be lost in a flash because of decisions that are made or failed to be made in Washington.So therefore, I want to be a president who makes corporations live up to the basic guarantee that when workers help produce record profits, those workers should get a real share of the rewards instead of it all going to those at the top.And you know the statistic. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than a typical American worker, or here is my latest least favorite statistic, the 25 biggest hedge fund managers earn more than all the kindergarten teachers in America...combined. What does that say about our values and the importance of preparing our children through education to make it in a very competitive global economy?Today, too many politicians who want to return to the same failed top-down economics are mouthing the words ""middle class."" But this is something you have to believe in and something you have to be ready to fight for. If those words are going to have meaning again, they\'ve got to be backed up by real solutions, not empty rhetoric. And those solutions have to speak to the ways that the economy has changed.Today, 40 percent of mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in their household. And more Americans are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Parents are rushing home from work to get their kids home from school and maybe get them off to practice or rehearsal. They are squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day with barely enough time to breathe, let alone relax.I remember when I was a practicing lawyer back in Little Rock, and around 3 o\'clock every afternoon all of the women who worked in the firm were hunched over their phones kind of whispering into them and at first I didn\'t know what was going on, and then I realized they were checking to see if their children got home safely.Many people today can\'t count on relatives to pitch in because so many families now are scattered across the country. Now I happen to be extremely lucky because my amazing 8-month-old granddaughter lives near me, so I get to see her a lot.But nobody expects everything to come easy, that\'s not part of life, we know that, but it shouldn\'t be quite so hard to get ahead and stay ahead.So I do believe that everyday Americans and their families need a champion. A champion who will fight for them every single day. Not for some Americans but for all Americans. And I want to be that champion. I want to get up every single day going to work for you, standing up for you, making a difference for you.Now, take the issue of equal pay. I don\'t think I\'m letting you in on a secret when I say, too many women still earn less than men on the job. And women of color often make even less. And then there\'s the so called, motherhood penalty, with many women taking a pay cut when they have children. All this lost money adds up. For many families, we\'re talking about thousands of dollars every year. That\'s money that could go for rent or groceries or a new car or into the college fund. Now we could fix this. If Republicans would get on board, we in fact could fix this today but they won\'t.One Republican candidate dismissed equal pay as ""a bogus issue."" Another said Congress was ""wasting time"" worrying about it. One even said that efforts to guarantee fair pay reminded him of the Soviet Union.And to that I say what century are they living in?But thankfully the American people know the truth. And the truth is that when any parent is short-changed, the entire family is short-changed. And when families are short-changed, America is short-changed. And therefore this is not a women\'s issue this is a family issue and an American economic issue.And here\'s what we should do instead to close the wage gap. First, we should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which gives women the legal tools we need to fight discrimination at work.I introduced this legislation in the Senate back in 2005 and kept sponsoring it again and again. Well it\'s time to get this done, once and for all.Second, we should promote pay transparency across our economy to ensure women have the information they need to negotiate fairly. You can\'t stand up for equal pay if you don\'t know whether you\'re paid equally. You remember the Lilly Ledbetter case, she didn\'t know for the longest that she wasn\'t being paid the same as her male coworkers doing the same jobs. Postings for new jobs or promotions should come with salary ranges. Large companies should report on how fairly, or not, they\'re compensating workers, male or female.And we should applaud those businesses and communities that are leading the way with best practices and real accountability. I think transparency when it comes to pay is our friend. The more we can bring it out from under the table to put it on top, the more information we can have to advocate for ourselves and advocate for each other.Third, we need to raise wages for the lowest paid jobs in America -- which are, they are disproportionately held by women, especially women of colorwe need to make it easier for more women to enter higher paying fields like science and engineering and technology. But I want to say something that a lot of people may not know even in this room full of activist and well informed democrats.In most states today, waitresses, bartenders, hairstylists, and others who rely on tips are paid even lower than minimum wage.Some are paid as little as two dollars and thirteen cents an hour. And they are also more likely to face exploitation, wage theft, and sexual harassment. Think about somebody you may know, think about the mom trying to succeed at work and give her kids the support they need with a job that pays her $2.13 an hour. And forces her to put up with some pretty awful behavior by clients or customers or bosses to try to get those tips to at least push it up to the federal minimum wage level.And finally, we need workplace policies like paid leave and flexible scheduling that allow parents to take care of their obligations at home without sacrificing pay at work.Now, it\'s no secret that on equal pay and so many other issues, we\'re up against some pretty powerful forces, political and economic, that will do say and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. I\'m here to tell you I\'m not afraid to take them on.You know I\'ve spent my adult life going to bat for children, families, and our country.And I do know how hard this job I\'m seeking is. I have seen it up close and personal. You\'re not going to catch me wondering what it\'s like. Instead I\'m spending my time planning for what I will do for you when I get there.All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. Think about what they look like on inauguration day and then we watch them they grow grayer and grayer, and by the time they leave they\'re as white as the building they live in.Well, let me tell you, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I have one big advantage. I\'ve been coloring my hair for years. So you\'re not going to see me turn white in the White House. And you\'re also not going to see me shrink from a fight. I think by now people know I don\'t quit.So I hope you\'ll join me. I hope you\'ll help me build this campaign, make it your own. Tell your friends to go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer.This election is not about me. It\'s about us. And it has to be about what we will do together to restore faith, confidence and optimism in the future and the country we love.I want to end with a story, some of you might remember we had a pretty vigorous campaign in 2008.I vaguely recall. And both President Obama and I worked really hard and he won and I lost and then I went to work to make sure he\'d win. And I was so relieved, I was just so relieved when finally November 2008 came around and he did.And then a few days after the election, my husband and I were taking a walk in a little forested area near where we live, and his phone went off, and he answered it, and it was the president-elect, who said, ""Bill, I need to talk to you, and I want to talk to Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we\'re in the middle of a forest, but as soon as we get home we\'ll call."" So we did, and the president-elect talked to Bill about the ideas he had and the cabinet and economic problems that he was all of a sudden being confronted with that he hadn\'t even been told about to the extent they were. So Bill talked to him and then hands me the phone, and the president-elect says, ""I want you to come to Chicago to meet with me."" And so I said, ""Certainly, when would you like me to come?"" And he says, ""As soon as you can come."" And I thought he wanted to talk to me about what I would do in the Senate to try to support what he was going to be championing as president.So I went a few days later, go into this big office building and sit down with the president-elect, and he says to me, ""I want you to be my secretary of state."" And I said ""Well, Mr. President-elect, I\'m honored, I\'m flattered, but there are so many other people,"" and I gave him names of people that I thought would have been great secretaries of state. And he says, ""No, no, I have to spend all my time dealing with this economy, it\'s worse than we were even told, and yet we have all these problems around the world and I need somebody who I can send out there to go anywhere to talk to anyone, and I want it to be you."" I said, ""Well, I can\'t tell you how moved I am, but I have to go back to the Senate."" And he said, ""Now, I don\'t want to hear from you until you say yes."" So I go back to the airport and get on the plane. I go back to New York and I\'m thinking, you know, the right thing for me is to stay in the Senate, the people of New York had had a rough time. I became senator, and eight months later we had 9/11, and so I had spent most of my first term trying to help people and rebuild our city and protect it and everything and I just thought I needed to go back.So I called the president-elect and said, ""You know, again I cannot tell you how honored I am, and I will support you in any way I can, but I need to go back to the Senate, and so I must say no, Mr. President elect."" He said, ""I told you I didn\'t want to hear from you until you\'re ready to say yes."" And so I say to my husband, you know, ""Can you believe this? I mean the president-elect has asked me to be secretary of state, I told him no twice, and he says he\'s not going to give up until I say yes."" Bill says, ""Well as I remember it, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes. He said you might stop and think that maybe there is a pattern here."" So I stayed up all night ,and I thought, you know, suppose it had been reversed, and I had been fortunate enough to win, and I wanted somebody to be in my cabinet that I knew I could rely on and I had asked the president-elect. I would have wanted him to say yes, because the country was facing some very serious decisions. So I called him back the next day, and I said ""OK, Mr. President, I am honored, I will be your secretary of state,"" and from that moment on we began to talk and to work together.Fast forward to my first trip I go to Asia in February 2009, and I go because when I started calling presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. They all said we didn\'t know what to expect because nobody\'s been paying a lot of attention to us. And I said well that is going to change, because the president and I see Asia as a very important priority, and I will come, so I was on my way.One of the countries I was going to was Indonesia, and I agreed to do both the private meetings with the leaders and press conferences, the kinds of things you see on TV, and to do a lot of what\'s called public diplomacy, where we would reach out to people, and we would basically say, we care about you we\'re back we want to work with you. Let\'s try to find ways that we can be partners and send a different message.So I agreed to go on this show in Jakarta called the ""Awesome Show."" And it was the early morning show, and it was unlike anything I\'ve even seen on our TV, and you know you see anything on our TV these days, people are jumping up and down, they\'re singing, they\'re dancing, and I\'m sitting here thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope they don\'t ask me to sing or dance"". But thankfully they didn\'t. They did an interview, and then they said the audience, ""Does anybody have any questions?"" So somebody raised a hand and was called on. So this person said, ""I want to ask you something. We followed your election."" I found that people overseas followed our election, in some ways closer than some Americans, really followed it, and so this questioner said, ""We followed your election, it was really a hard, long-fought election"" because as you know our elections last forever compared to most other countries which have elections. And he says, ""We saw you and President Obama going at it, he was saying bad things about you, you were saying back things about him, and then all of a sudden you end up as his secretary of state? How does that work?"" And I thought, you know this is a really serious question, because in lots of places you run against somebody, you can be exiled, imprisoned, or killed, not made Secretary of State, so I thought that there was a moment here that if I could rev my brain up that maybe could reach particularly young people because Indonesia is a relatively young democracy. So I said, ""You\'re right, we ran a very hard campaign against each other. He won, I lost, and then I went to work for him because he and I shared many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency and then he won and then he asked me to be Secretary of State for the same reason, we both love our country.""And no matter how hard this election or any election becomes we should remember that at the core we can have disagreements, and we will, we have different governing philosophies, we have different views about what works, what the evidence shows works about economic policies, that\'s all fair game, but we should show more respect toward each other and we should remember why we\'re doing this, because we love our country, and we want it to be the country of hope and potential for our children and our grandchildren that many of us saw come into being over the last decades so as I run for President we\'re going to have some very difficult challenges. We\'ll have disagreements, we\'ll have debates, but I want you to know that I will be remembering what I think should be at the core of every political campaign, how we treat one another, and how we care for this gift we\'ve been given, the United States of America. Thank you very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 4, 2015",b'Remarks at Texas Southern University in Houston',"b'Wow! Thank you so very much. I cannot tell you how personally honored I am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. Let me start by thanking President Rudley, everyone at Texas Southern university. It\'s a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from Dr. Rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. This institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of Heman Marion Sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in Houston, Texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. I am delighted to be here with my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th District and state and the country.I have to tell you though I thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of Congress. And that is she is finally a member of the grandmother\'s club. And as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, Sheila. I have to tell you I was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to Barbara Jordan and should be important to all of us. But to do so in front of Dr. Freeman is a little daunting. I mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to Barbara Jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. I noticed that both Dr. Rudley and Dr. Sheila both got off before Dr. Freeman came up.I also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in Houston and across Texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. And I am confident that this community will embrace them. I remember very well coming here after Katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama, along and with Sheila and other leaders in the community. We toured the facilities that Houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. And I saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. This is a city that knows how to pull together, and I\'m confident you\'ll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster.And it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that Barbara Jordan was succeeded by Mickey Leland and the 18th District was so well represented for so long, and I am delighted to be here with Alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. So many issues that he was the champion of. And I want to thank Rosemary McGowan and all the friends and loved ones of Barbara Jordan here today. This is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroesa woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.I first met Barbara Jordan when I was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee investigating Richard Nixon, and it was such a profound moment in American history. And there wasn\'t anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than Barbara Jordan.As a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the Thurgood Marshall School here at TSU, I was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable Congresswoman from Texas. I got to talk with her, which was thrilling, I got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly I got to watch and listen to her.At a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.Remember what she said: ""My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total.""It was that passion and moral clarity that took Barbara Jordan from the TSU and the halls of Texas legislature all the ways to the halls of Congress. The first woman and the first African American ever elected to represent Texas in the House of Representatives.And she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her friend and mentor President Lyndon Johnsonand in particular she was a staunch advocate for the Voting Rights Act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.In 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, Barbara Jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the Voting Rights Act to many more Americans, including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans as well.And like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, I stand here on the shoulders of Barbara Jordan and so does our entire country.And boy do we miss her. We miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.I remember talking to her and Ann Richards one time. And between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. And they were telling me about how they would love to go to the University of Texas women\'s basketball games. Right, and Barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and Ann would be holding court right next to her. And Barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. ""Why are you doing that? Jump higher! That\'s not a pass!"" You know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. And so Ann was telling me this, with Barbara right there and I finally turned to her and said, ""Barbara, encourage these young women, don\'t just criticize them."" And Barbara turned around and said, ""When they deserve it, I will.""We sure could use her irresistible voice. I wish we could hear that voice one more time.Hear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out.And I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who\'s turned away from the polls because her driver\'s license expired. For the father who\'s done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn\'t gotten his rights back.Now we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn\'t here to speak up for them and so many others. But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what\'s really going on in our countrybecause what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.Because since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.North Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.Now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.In fact I would say it is a cruel ironybut no coincidencethat Millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much exclusion.And we need look no further than right here in Texas. You all know this far better than I, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a valid form of identificationbut a valid student ID isn\'t good enough?Now, Krystal Watson found out the hard way. She grew up in Louisiana but came to Marshall, Texas, to attend Wiley College. Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College ID, she was turned away.Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar situations.And while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar. Like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. Or scrap language assistance for non-English speakerssomething Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.It\'s not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines.In South Carolina, for example, there\'s supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.Now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.Now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas, of course I learned it from him. ""You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own."" Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. And it is just wrong, it\'s wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans\' rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it\'s the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.This is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.Yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental American principle.Here in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were ""outdated and unnecessary.""But Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.In New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.And in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.Thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.So today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they\'re so scared of letting citizens have their say.Yes, this is about democracy. But it\'s also about dignity. About the ability to stand up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it means a lot.I learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in the valley in 1972.Some of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn\'t speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. That\'s what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we\'re all the worse for it. It doesn\'t just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. It holds back our entire country.That\'s why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back.Well today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.First, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that American voters need and deserve.I was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act after an exhaustive review process.There had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs to do again.Second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama\'s campaign lawyer and by Governor Mitt Romney campaign\'s lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.Third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhereincluding opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.It\'s not just convenientit\'s also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. So let\'s get this done.And I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.And we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it\'s full of errors.We can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voterperiod.Now, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It\'s just a matter of syncing and streamlining.Now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I\'ll be candid here, none of them will come easily.It\'s going to take leadership at many levels.Now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.We need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. But they can\'t do it alone.We need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina to build momentum for reform.We need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\'s right to vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation.But of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.You know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most frequent questions I was asked was, ""How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?""People were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiledeven killednot hired as Secretary of State.And it\'s true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country.So my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America\'s long march toward a more perfect union.We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly. And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.That\'s what Barbara Jordan would do. That\'s what we should do in honor of her.Thank you, and may God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 13, 2015","b'Remarks in a Campaign ""Kickoff"" Speech in New York City'","b'Thank you! Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.It is wonderful to be here with all of you.To be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.To be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.To be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\'s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.And in a place... with absolutely no ceilings.You know, President Roosevelt\'s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\'s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.Two Democrats guided by the  Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.President Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\'s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: ""Equality of opportunity... Jobs for those who can work... Security for those who need it... The ending of special privilege for the few... The preservation of civil liberties for all... a wider and constantly rising standard of living.""That still sounds good to me.It\'s America\'s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.That bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.It\'s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.It\'s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.When President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.When President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.But, it\'s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.We\'re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.Instead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.What happened?Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.Except it wasn\'t the end.As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs... you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again  going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.So we\'re standing again. But, we all know we\'re not yet running the way America should.You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\'s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.So, you have to wonder: ""When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?"" ""When?""I say now.Prosperity can\'t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.Democracy can\'t be just for billionaires and corporations.Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.You brought our country back.Now it\'s time  your time to secure the gains and move ahead.And, you know what?America can\'t succeed unless you succeed.That is why I am running for President of the United States.Here, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.I\'m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.For the successful and the struggling.For the innovators and inventors.For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.For the nurses who work the night shift.For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.For the veterans who served our country.For the small business owners who took a risk.For everyone who\'s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.I\'m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.Our country\'s challenges didn\'t begin with the Great Recession and they won\'t end with the recovery.For decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.Advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.The financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value... too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\'ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.Now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\'ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that  to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.At our best, that\'s what Americans do. We\'re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\'t hide from change, we harness it.But we can\'t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.Americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.Now, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\'re all singing the same old song...A song called ""Yesterday.""You know the one  all our troubles look as though they\'re here to stay... and we need a place to hide away... They believe in yesterday.And you\'re lucky I didn\'t try singing that, too, I\'ll tell you!These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.We\'ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\'ll say: ""I\'m not a scientist."" Well, then, why don\'t they start listening to those who are?They pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.They want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.They shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.They want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.And they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called ""a village"" that has a place for everyone.Now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.I believe that success isn\'t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty...How many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive...How many young people go to college without drowning in debt...How many people find a good job...How many families get ahead and stay ahead.I didn\'t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.Her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.You know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.The 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.And, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.That\'s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.To meet every challenge.To be resilient... no matter what the world throws at you.To solve the toughest problems.I believe we can do all these things because I\'ve seen it happen.As a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.My first job out of law school was for the Children\'s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\'t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.As a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.In Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.As Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.It took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.There are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.Just weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.She doesn\'t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\'t quite so hard for families like hers?I want to be her champion and your champion.If you\'ll give me the chance, I\'ll wage and win Four Fights for you.The first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.To make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.The middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\'t have one without the other.Is this possible in today\'s world?I believe it is or I wouldn\'t be standing here.Do I think it will be easy? Of course not.But, here\'s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\'t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.There are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.Business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.There are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.There are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\'s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.In the coming weeks, I\'ll propose specific policies to:Reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck  because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.I will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.I will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.We will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.And we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.Developing renewable power  wind, solar, advanced biofuels...Building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings...Using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment...And ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.We will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.We will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.Now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.That\'s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.And I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.One thing I\'ve learned is that talent is universal  you can find it anywhere  but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.Our country won\'t be competitive or fair if we don\'t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.So let\'s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.Let\'s make college affordable and available to all ...and lift the crushing burden of student debt.Let\'s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.Now, the second fight is to strengthen America\'s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.And today\'s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.I believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.I believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.I believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.That you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.I believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative. And it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job  and women of color often making even less.This isn\'t a women\'s issue. It\'s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.In America, every family should feel like they belong.So we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.And, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.You know, America\'s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\'s drawn so many to our shores. What\'s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\'ve seen it with my own eyes.And these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.So we have a third fight: to harness all of America\'s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.No other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran  and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.No other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.As your President, I\'ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.And if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.As a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\'s threats and tomorrow\'s.And when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\'ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\'ve earned.I\'ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.But, I know  I know we have to be smart as well as strong.Meeting today\'s global challenges requires every element of America\'s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.There are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\'s a lot of good news out there too.I believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.And we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\'s why we have to win the fourth fight  reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.We have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.We need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\'s right to vote, rather than every corporation\'s right to buy elections.If necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\'s decision in Citizens United.I want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\'s why I\'ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.I\'ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.What part of democracy are they afraid of?No matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.Government is never going to have all the answers  but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.That means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.We need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.There\'s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.To do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.Now, I\'ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\'ll also stand my ground when I must.That\'s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State  whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities  and it\'s something I will always do as your President.We Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\'s back.Like any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.People all over the world have asked me: ""How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?""Now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled  even killed  not hired as Secretary of State.But President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\'s how we do it in America.With that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.We can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.We can strengthen our families.We can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.And we can renew the promise of our democracy.If we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.I want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.Talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.Text ""JOIN"" to 4-7-2-4-6.Go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.It\'s no secret that we\'re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\'ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\'m not stopping now.You know, I know how hard this job is. I\'ve seen it up close and personal.All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!And the first grandmother as well.And one additional advantage: You\'re won\'t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\'ve been coloring it for years!So I\'m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\'m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.And along the way, I\'ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\'t get everything right. Lord knows I\'ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\'s no shortage of people pointing them out!And I certainly haven\'t won every battle I\'ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.I think you know by now that I\'ve been called many things by many people  ""quitter"" is not one of them.Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.When I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\'d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.I can still hear her saying: ""Life\'s not about what happens to you, it\'s about what you do with what happens to you  so get back out there.""She lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century  all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.She was born on June 4, 1919  before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.The story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us  not just some, but all  should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.Not only because we\'re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\'re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.I wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.I wish she could have seen the America we\'re going to build together.An America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.Where we don\'t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.An America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.Thank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 15, 2015","b'Remarks and a Question and Answer Session at a Campaign Event in Rochester, New Hampshire'","b'CLINTON: Thank you so much. [applause] Thank you. Oh, I am thrilled to be here, and to be in such a beautiful facility, having just had the chance to spend a little time with some children, mostly 4-year-olds, but a few 5-year-olds. It was great. And I thank Julie and the entire team here at the Y. I am such a big believer in this kind of partnership, and I was thrilled, as Julie was talking about it, to see the applause break out on behalf of this YMCA and all that it does. This is, for me, a very important place to be to talk about a really critical issue, one that, as Julie has said, I have spent much of my adult life being committed to and concerned about, and I can\'t think of a better place to do this than here in New Hampshire, a state that will always have a special place in my heart. [laughter] [applause] And so, I had a great event Saturday in a perfect place on a perfect day, on Roosevelt Island in New York City at the Four Freedoms park that was constructed in honor of President Roosevelt. And I was able to talk about the four fights that I want to wage and win on behalf of the American people. They, to me, really encapsulate what my campaign is about, but also what our country needs to do together, build an economy for tomorrow, not yesterday; strengthen America\'s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong; harness all of our power, not just the military but diplomatic and economic to use our values to lead the world; and to revitalize our democracy here at home, particularly by focusing on getting dark, unaccountable money out of politics, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. [applause] And I will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come, but I do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them, taking care of their needs, being able to stimulate them, to give them a better chance in life, helping them become successful and good citizens. And, for me, all of this does come back to our kids. And that\'s because my mother, who was with me in New Hampshire in 2008, really taught me that everybody needs a chance and everybody needs a champion. And for... [applause] For her, she knew what it was like not to have either when she was growing up, because she was abandoned very young by her parents and sent to live with grandparents who didn\'t want her, so that by the time she was 14, she was out on her own, working as a house maid and a babysitter, in another family\'s home. And I didn\'t know any of this when I was growing up. When I was the age of the kids we were reading ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" to, I just knew she was my mom. And she was great and she was fun, and she taught me so much. And she made grilled cheese and tomato soup sandwiches. I mean, there was just a wonderful sense of being loved and taken care of, but also being inspired. And I remember asking her when I got old enough to kind of piece together some of the answers to questions I was getting about her childhood, how could she do this? And her answer was very simple, you know, kindness along the way from people that cared about her and showed her she mattered. The first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat for lunch, and without embarrassing here, started bringing extra food, and then would lean over and whisper, ""Dorothy, I brought too much food today. Would you like some? I can\'t eat it all."" Or even the woman whose house she went to work in, she wanted so much to go to high school, but she knew she had to do the chores that were necessary. And so the woman said, ""Well, if you can get your chores done, you can go to high school."" And that was a great gift that my mother was forever grateful for. Because those people believed in her, she believed in me. You know, there is a direct link. If we believe in our children, we instill in them the belief that they are worth something. And then they, in turn, can pass that on. Now, ideally we all hope that families can do that. But in today\'s world, it\'s really hard for many families to do everything they\'re expected to do under the stresses that they face. Because of her, I believe in the potential of every American, and particularly every American child. And when our children succeed, America succeeds. So, I\'ve been a champion for early childhood education for as long as I can remember, really starting when I was in law school and got interested in, as I was studying the law, why do some people follow the law and other people don\'t. What\'swhat\'s in their background? What makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up? And that\'s why I\'m putting this front and center in my campaign, because I think it\'s time we realized once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make. [applause] Now, I think most of us kind of intuitively have known that. But now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact life-long success. So we have to help parents be their children\'s first teachers, from that very first day. And we have to help them get access to quality, affordable childcare and preschool. And for me, it\'s recognizing the reality of today\'s families: 40 percent of the breadwinners, the principle breadwinners in America today are women. We have a lot of single moms heroically trying to raise kids under sometimes very challenging circumstances. We have a lot of two-parent families where people are working night shifts. They\'re overlapping. They are just doing everything they can sometimes with multiple jobs to keep body and soul together and put that food on the table and that roof over their head. Today\'s parents have to juggle so much. They have to squeeze every minute out of every 24-hour day. And that just makes the argument even stronger as to why we have to have their backs. We have to be there to help them do the best job they can possibly do. Yes, they need to do the job that pays them. But at the end of the day, the job raising children, taking care of your family, caring even for your parents as they age, is the most important job any of us will ever do. And we don\'t do it for pay. We do it for love. We do it for a sense of giving back. But let\'s try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier. You know, I met a woman... [applause] You know, I met a woman a few weeksa couple weeks ago who was trying to do everything she could imagine to make it work. She was a single mom. She\'s raising three kids. She was working, and she was going to community college, because she was trying to get ahead so that she could get a better job. She said, ""You know, I don\'t ask for anything, but why does it have to be so hard""? I hear that question all over. ""Why does it have to be so hard""? It\'s hard enough to pay for any preschool or childcare at all, let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish. Funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it\'s no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent the past decade. In many states, it costs more for childcare of quality than it costs for college tuition, and we know what\'s happened at that end of the learning curve. We actually did make a lot of progress expanding preschool attendance for 3-and 4-year-olds during the 1990s. I was honored to hold the first ever White House conference on early childhood development to bring together people, like those you see here. [applause] But starting in 2001, there\'s been almost no progress. Only 55 percent of all of America\'s 3-and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool, and meanwhile, many of our economic competitors are racing ahead. They are making big investments in preschool and early education. I\'ll tell you a little story. You know, I spent a lot of time as secretary of state trying to figure out how we were going to deal with the rise of China. It\'s going to be one of the biggest problems for the next president. And there\'re a lot of aspects to it. But I was not surprised to get a call about two years ago shortly, after I left the State Department, on behalf of the highest-ranking woman in the Chinese government. And she was coming to Washington, and I had worked with her as secretary of state, and she asked if she could see me, and I said, ""Of course. I\'d be happy to see her."" And then she said, ""You know, could you do an event with me about early childhood""? I said, ""Oh, certainly. What is it about early childhood that has you so interested""? Here\'s what she said, and then we did the event. We did the event at the Brookings Institute in Washington. China\'s making a huge commitment to early childhood and to pre-kindergarten. Why? They look at the same brain research. In fact, they have asked the American Nobel Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, hardly a hotbed of radical liberalism... [laughter] ... to be their consultant, among others, because he did the study, which proved that early-childhood investing by a country is one of the best returns on investment that we can make. So the Chinese are using an American expert for that. [applause] Though, if I hadn\'t been excited before, I got really motivated about this. But unfortunately, we\'re hearing something different from Republican leaders in Washington. Republicans aren\'t just missing the boat on early-childhood education; they\'re trying to sink it. Their budget puts at risk on the most effective investments for our youngest children, Early Head Start. Did they cut subsidies to oil companies? No. Did they cut tax loopholes, like carried interest for hedge-fund managers? No. The Republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids. Now I believe getting off to a good start should be our children\'s birthright, part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation. Every child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow\'s economy, especially those kids from our most vulnerable and at-risk communities. And we need to make sure that parents can get good jobs and stay in the workforce. That drives the economic engine. So we have to do more to help them deal with the most difficult of the decisions of parents for young children to stay in the workforce. I believe the time has come to make pre-school and quality child care available to every child in America. If our families are going to be strong and our economy is going to thrive, all our kids need the chance to get off to the best possible start. [applause] I will I will work with states and communities across America to make sure that in the next 10 years, every four-year-old in America has access to high-quality pre-school. Now already governors and state legislatures across the country are discovering the value of pre-school and this is bipartisan. You know, one of the states with a universal pre-K program in America is Oklahomaabout as red a state as you can get. But they have figured it out, the government and business leaders and families alike that this is a smart investment for them. And we have to build on the momentum started by the states. Now look how far here in New Hampshire you\'ve come. Nearly 20 years ago, back when Senator Jeanne Shaheen was Governor Shaheen, she delivered funding for public kindergarten for the first time in the state\'s history. [applause] That then allowed the conversation to move where it is today with Governor Maggie Hassan supporting efforts for full-day kindergarten and innovative pre-K partnerships. So you start and get what you... [applause] ... have achieved on kindergarten. Then you move toward full day and then innovative pre-K. All across the country we need to be doing that. And we also need to invest in child care because, if you only start at four, the brain research shows that 80 percent of your brain has developed by the age of three. Now the good news is that leaves 20 percent to keep working on. [laughter] But it is a fact that, by three, many of our kids have already had most of the brain development that they\'re going to get. And in this campaign, I\'ll offer a comprehensive agenda to ensure that every child in America has access to quality affordable child care. [applause] I will propose a middle-class tax cut to help parents deal with rising child care costs. [applause] And I\'ll lead an effort to expand child care opportunities and to make sure that programs address both the needs of working parents and the needs of children. We shouldn\'t think of child care as just a place to deposit your kids, a warehouse. We should invest in programs that create health environments for early learning and to make sure that parents get the support they need from the time their children are infants. I will double the Early Head Start Child Care Partnership Grant Program, which brings Head Start\'s evidenced-based curriculum into the child care setting to provide comprehensive, full-day, high-quality services to low-income families. And I will double our investment in Early Head Start itself, a program I helped to create when I was first lady. And we know... [applause] We know it\'s making a difference, because we actually have evidence that shows it\'s making a difference. And this is part, as I said, of a long-term commitment of mine, going back to my Methodist Church, where I wasI was raised, and babysitting, you know, children of Mexican migrant farmworkers, through my years at the Children\'s Defense Fund, working to expand opportunities for kids with disabilities, and through my time in the White House with my husband and in the Senate in New York and even as secretary of state, because I have learned that talent is universal, but opportunity is not. And I look sometimes... [applause] I look sometimes in the eyes of kids who\'ve had a really tough set of obstacles to overcome, and they\'re doing the best they can. And we need to do what we can to help them succeed. But every baby comes into this world with so much God-given potential. And when they leave the hospital, some will have great opportunity their family can give them, and others will struggle. Now, as you may have heard, I am a new grandmother. And so, for me... [applause] ... this has become really personal. I remember being in the hospital waiting for Charlotte\'s arrival and talking to the nurses there. And what did they want to talk to me about? They wanted to talk to me about how hard it was for them, plus a lot of their patients, to get childcare. How it was especially hard when they had to work the night shift. How they has to keep juggling everything, all the time. And it was here, at one of the great moments in my life, a reminder that there are so many hardworking, conscientious people, who deserve more help than they\'re getting right now. And it needs to be a partnership, just like this Y is a partnership. You know, a partnership between the public and private interests. A partnership where people feel that they can contribute and participate. I think if we come together and take this on as a true national mission, we can unlock the potential of all our children and further the potential of our country. And our country then will be more inclusive, not leaving people behind and out, and where a father can tell his daughter, ""You can grow up to be anything you want, including president of the United States."" [applause] QUESTION: Well, how do you do? How do you do? I\'m Jackie Cowell , and like many of you I\'m looking around the audience and I\'m seeing many of you that like me have been working on this for 20 or 30 years. So thank you for your perseverance on early childhood education out there, you know. And the children that you met this morning are likely to graduate from high school in 2030. So just think about what 2030 is going to be looking like. When I was in high school, our class took a field trip to see a computer. I don\'t... [laughter] ... I don\'t think they do that anymore, but... [laughter] ... but it\'s really going to bethey\'re likely to retire in the 2080s. So how do you prepare them for this very complex world they\'re going to inherit? And many of them will hold jobs that haven\'t been invented yet. So it\'s really working on these skills, as you talked aboutearly childhood education. And we\'re thrilled that this discourse is now part of the presidential primary; that early childhood education is being talked about; and making sure ever child has the opportunity to reach their full potential. And, you know, here in New Hampshire, things have been tough for families, trying to make ends meet, trying to make sure they can get into childcare that is quality, that really helps them reach their full potential. And there\'s too many families that aren\'t able to do that because of the difference of the cost. So, yeah. CLINTON: Well, you know, Jackie , I think that\'s a great perspective to put on it because when we talk about early childhood, we think about the little kids like the ones that we were with in the classroom. But we ought to have a broader perspective and think about the adults they will become. And what kind of adults do we need? We need people who will have exactly the skills for jobs that haven\'t been invented, and will have the temperament and the character and the attributes to, you know, get along with people, to respect the law, respect each other, to be part of building a stronger, more prosperous America. And I think it\'s a great perspective if you kind of work backwards and you say to yourself, ""OK, what are you going to look for in somebody who wants to be a worker and a citizen in 15, 20, 30 years?"" You know that that really starts so importantly at the beginning. QUESTION: Thank you so much for being here this morning and for this discussion. I\'m Mary Lou Beaver from Rochester. I\'m not here this morning representing an organization, but as someone who was in the field for more than 25 years as a teacher, as a center director, and as a center owner here in Rochester. I also was a mom, who was dependent upon childcare for my children as I suddenly found myself a single mom, and was in school trying to continue my education so that I could do more and provide more for my family. Having quality childcare education, early education for my kids was so important to me because I was in and out so much of the time when I really wanted to be spending time with them, and wanted to give them all that I could. But as so many parents today are facing, you need to work the hours that you have to work in order to support your family. And it\'s very important that we have not only the accessibility and the quality, but the affordability for all families. Do you agree? CLINTON: Oh, I do agree. And I think your story is really important for everybody to hear because that is the reality that is going on right now. II just meet so many working parents, particularly single working moms who are struggling. They\'re really working as hard as they can, as you were, and many of them trying to go to school at the same time because they know they\'ll have a better future if they do. I remember when I was teaching law at the University of Arkansas, oh gosh, back in the early 1970s, I met so many people around the campus who were single parents, trying to go to school. And childcare was their biggest obstacle. And we, you know, we started a fund called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, because it wasn\'t the money that they needed so much for the tuition, although that was a stretch, it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education. And I think you have to look at what young families are going through today in a very comprehensive way and say, OK, what can the extended family do? What can theyou know, houses of worship, our churches, do? What can communities do? What can the Y do? Or you know, the Boys & Girls Club? There\'s so many different ways to kind of piece this together, but there isn\'t any way to get to a universal program, unless our government in Washington sees it as a priority to partner with many of the states and localitieswe have the mayor here; thank you for being here, mayorso that we can provide the backstop and the support that is necessary. And it\'s particularly important for the youngest kids, the zero to three kids, because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention. You know, Bill and I are exhausted every time we take care of Charlotte. [laughter] We love every minute of it, but whew. It reminds you hard it is to raise babies and to keep an eye on them, as they, you know, take off on their own. So I think it is important that we do everything we can to deal with that zero-to-three age group. And that\'s going to take more direction. That\'s why I mentioned Early Head Start Child Care Partnership and the Early Head Start Program. But again, we need more people to help fill that space because that\'s often where parents really are stretched, and we also don\'t have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents And so, just getting everything organized, when you have that new baby is a challenge, don\'t you think? QUESTION: Absolutely. As a grandmother, I can certainly relate to the exhaustion. [laughter] The other concern that I had as a center director was the wages that we were able to pay to our educators. We know that consistent, quality educators are so important to young children, as they are growing and learning. But we can\'t always keep them, because of the wages that are paid. CLINTON: Well, that\'s why I said I\'m going to offer a middle-class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality child care, because you\'ve put your finger on one the biggest problems. A lot of parents cannot afford quality child care. And a lot of the teachers and the child care workers can\'t afford to live on what the parents can pay. So you have a perfect storm where we need quality child care, but how are we going to get the people with the continuity so that the experience is there to be able to deliver that child care. When parents can\'t go any further, they\'re stretched as far as they can get. And I have been meeting with child care workers. And a lot of them just throw up their hands. They\'d rather go be a food server for the money, but not for the, you know, reward that they have gotten from taking care of kids. They justI mean, they\'re making $8, $9, $10 an hour for often 12-hour days. And that is just a huge burden on them and their family. So then, you have a downward spiral. Is that what you\'ve seen, too? QUESTION: It is. There\'s a saying that: Parent\'s can\'t afford to pay; teachers can\'t afford to stay; there\'s got to be a better way. And so... UNKNOWN: That\'s good. QUESTION: Rightit\'s the Worthy Wage Campaign, isthat\'s their saying. And so here in New Hampshire, we\'ve actually with the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services and our governor\'s office applied for two federal grants, hoping to really show what we could do in early childhood education. So the Race to the TopEarly Learning Challenge Grant and the Preschool Development Grant, and we didn\'t get them. And one of the reasons, we\'re the only New England state that didn\'t get the Race to the Top Grant, because we\'ve been divesting instead of investing. And so what we found also, talking with business leaders, that this is not a red or a blue issue, that people really genuinely care about making sure every child has that opportunity. So here in New Hampshire, we\'re really seeing that starting toto comebut we haven\'t gotten those grants, and we\'d like to. CLINTON: Well, I want to throw it open forI know there\'re a lot of people in this audience who care deeply about this issue, have their own experience in doing the issue. And so Julia, I think we should see if somebody else wants to contribute to the conversation. MODERATOR: Do we have any questions from the audience? Right here in the pattern? QUESTION: Hi. CLINTON: There isthere is... MODERATOR: There is a microphone coming. CLINTON: There\'s a roving microphone. [laughter] QUESTION: Oh. Thank you. My daughtermy granddaughter is here. What are you going to do for thethe grandparents that are raising these children? My generation, all of my friends are raising their grandchildren. CLINTON: Can I ask you withoutI don\'t want to impinge on youryour privacy. What are the circumstances under which you\'re raising your grandchildren [inaudible]? QUESTION: It was[inaudible]they\'re going to be turned over to the state because of addiction. CLINTON: So, you know, I have to tell you, this isthank you. Thank you. I\'m so, so sorry. But you are the second grandmother in New Hampshire who\'s said that to me. And that\'s one of the reasons why if you followed my campaignbecause of what I\'ve been hearing, because I have spent two months listening to people, because I do think it\'s important, when you want to represent the entire country, you actually listen to what\'s happening in people\'s lives. And substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country. And I heard it first in Iowa and then as soon as I got to New HampshireI was sitting down in Keene, New Hampshire talking to some people. First thing a retired doctor said, ""What are you going to do about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire""? First of all, I\'m going to talk a lot about it, because we need to drag it out of shadows. We need to hold it up to the light. [applause] Andandand then it\'s heartbreaking, because there has not been an event I\'ve got to, where somebody hasn\'t come up to me, sometimes bravely, like you did in public, and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it. That and mental-health problems that go untreated and... [applause] So I would say three things. First, I think you\'re very brave and very loving to take on this responsibility, and you should know that every time... [applause] ... you think about how hard it is, and you\'re grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said, ""I\'m here for you, and I will take care of you."" [applause] Secondly, we have towe have to extend every program, every taxeverything we do to people taking care of kids, whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe, in some cases, older siblings or aunts or uncles, because of the inability of a child\'s parents to be able to do so. So whatever I propose, you will be eligible for, people who are taking care of their grandchildren. [applause] Yes. Yes. [applause] Right now, you can\'t get any help in most places. And we have to change that. We have to face the reality. I mean, when you\'relook, I just --we were just laughing about, you know, my eight-month old is beginning, you know, heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl. But once she takes off and we\'re chasing her around, and trying to keep her hands out of the outlets and all the things that you have to do with little kids, grandparents who are raising their kids, and there are millions of them, need more help. You know, when I was a senator, I championed a program in New York City to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids, because they needed, in my view, the support of a community. Because it can be really isolating. I mean, most of your friends, you know, they\'re not raising babies, toddlers or school-age kids, so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that, and you need the support that any parent would get, because that\'s what you\'re doing, you\'re parenting. So I can tell you that I will do everything I can, both in any benefit that I think the country should extend to raising children, you will be eligible, but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers, because it\'s predominantly grandmothers. There are some grandfathers, predominantly grandmothers too. QUESTION: [off-mike] CLINTON: It is. QUESTION: [off-mike] CLINTON: You have half-a-dozen friends? QUESTION: Well, yeah. CLINTON: No, no, I mean who are raising their children. [laughter] Yeah. QUESTION: They\'re raising... [crosstalk] CLINTON: And do you support each other? QUESTION: Oh, absolutely. CLINTON: OK. That\'sthat\'s important. You need to support each other because you need to get that, you know, that emotional support and theand theand the hints and the tips, like, you know, somebody finds out something that\'ll work for them, it may work for you. So thank you for raising that and thank you for saying that. Yeah. Julie? MODERATOR: Thank you. Next question. Over here? Sure. QUESTION: Hi. Early childhood education is a great foundation, but I have a 14 year old, so what your plans for education in general? The state of education today is horrendous, especially for children with ADHD. You\'re looking at cookie-cutter classrooms, and these kids don\'t learn that way. So what types of plans do you have for them? CLINTON: Well, this is one of theyou know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently. You know, some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher\'s lessons. Some kids need to move. Some kids need to have practical experience. And I do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning. And I don\'t think that... [applause] I don\'t think that works for every kid. And especially for kids who are hyperactive, kids who, you know, need to be channeled and directed, but also need to be able to, you know, get rid of some of that extra energy that they\'ve got. I mean, I don\'t know how youI don\'t know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extracurricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons you\'re trying to teach. So, the specific issue about ADHD kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids. And I think we have to ask ourselves: Are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated? And the answer is yes, some do, no doubt about it. But are we medicating kids because we\'ve not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs? And that starts in the family, because it, you know, it\'s hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools. So IIpart of what I will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to... [applause] ... help kids. And, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. And I don\'t think a cookie-cutter approach works. I want every kid to do well in school. I want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education. [applause] I think, you know, there arewe\'re going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work. It is work that, you know, they learn to do by doing. And thenI was, you know, I was in a community college, you knew, New Hampshire Technical Institute, talking to the people there. And thethere were students who were taking courses, who were in high school. That\'s one way of doing it, having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if they\'re interested. I went to one in Iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists. They were juniors and seniors in high school. And the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist. Well, we need to make that available for more kids. And, look, I\'m not a scientist. [laughter] But unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side, I actually listen to scientists. [laughter] And one of the things that... [laughter and applause] ... one of the things that I will try to do, with aby partnering, you know, not by mandating and directing, but partnering with our educators, partnering with people who have experience like our folks here, is to figure out: OK, how do we get more hands-on learning? Because I do believe that for kids, especially ADHD kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that\'s their interest. So we\'re going to take a hard look at all of that. But it\'syou know, education is a local and state matter, but I think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have. QUESTION: Thank you. [applause] MODERATOR: Can we get someone in the back? Women in the [inaudible]? Yes. Here comes the mike. QUESTION: Thank you. We spend so much money on the military and we are able to get the money just like this. But nationwide, our schools are not equal and they\'re not of the same standards. So, why are we not making a priority nationwide and per state on education as much as spending on other things? And the military is important, I do realize that. OK. Thank you.CLINTON: Well, you know, education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility. And it really wasn\'t until, you know, 30, 40 years ago, really, I guess back in the 1960s, when the government began to put in a lot more money from the Federal Government into education. And the original idea behind the Federal Government putting money in was to try to equalize spending, so that, you know, kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that, which I think is still very important, so that it was an equity argumentsome of you know, Title 1, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Actwas really designed to do that. Then in the Reagan Administration, I think it was 19I want to remember here\'83 or so. There was a report that came out called ""A Nation at Risk."" And it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly Europeans, some Asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they\'re not performing. And that was really a big change. The Reagan administration began saying, OK, well, the Federal Government has to do more to try to change the way we\'re educating. And that went on. And certainly, President George W. Bush with No Child Left Behind, it was certainly well-motivated. I was in the Senate. I know the arguments that were made. And it was to try to, you know, create a system where, no matter who you were, where you went to school, you\'d have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve. And I say all of this because we\'ve always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who\'s in and who\'s out, greater or lesser amounts. But always the biggest part of the budget, other than Social Security, Medicare, et cetera. So I think that your question is a fair one, like, what are our priorities? We will always have to have theyou know, the strongest, best-equipped military. But even there we have to save money. We have to be smart about it. We have to look for ways to get more done efficiently. And just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don\'t just send money, without getting the results that we need. And there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas aroundyou know, military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up, streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality. So I think that it\'s time in our countryand in my speech on Saturday, I said we have to [inaudible] our government. We have to take a hard look at everything. We have to bring it into the 21st century. Now our military equipment is 22nd century. I mean, it\'s more advanced than anybody, anywhere. But we\'re also fighting wars where a lot of what we\'ve paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable. I mean, we\'re dealing with different kinds of threats. We\'re dealing with cyber threats. We\'re dealing with, you know, irregular warfare and terrorism. So we\'ve got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it. to the extend that we need to get the outcomes we\'re looking for. But on education, we\'ve put more federal dollars in. But to go back to the question about ADHD, we need to take a hard look about what\'s working and what\'s not working. I just want to give you aand I\'m going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. But I want to give you a quick understanding of what I mean. You know, everybody believes, and I\'m guilty of this, that we\'re an expert about education, because we went to school. [laughter] And those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out. We know what worked or didn\'t work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won\'t work for other people. Look, there\'s a lot of truth to that. People\'syour experience matters. And how you experienced school matters. But I think research really counts. So, there\'s a team of researchers I knowyou know, they\'re based at Harvard, but other schools have been involved. And they went through all of the work that\'s been done. They said, OK, what makes for a great school? And they came out with some things that are simple, but hard to do and hard to pay for, you know, things like a longer school year, particularly for disadvantaged kids. We have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences. Maybe they go to the Y camp. I was talking to, you know, one of he people where who runs the camps. Maybe theymaybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums. But for a lot of kids, they actually lose learning over the summer. So here the teachers have worked and worked, and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances, then they lose ground, so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year. So a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense. A longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble. And all kinds of trouble and bad influences. Well, you know, the parents are working. Oftentimes, again, they have no options, so longer day, longer school day. More support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other. Now, that sounds so simple, but it is so critical. Like, OK, what worked in your classroom? You know, I tried this lesson, it didn\'t work, let\'s take another look at it. And what we\'ve done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of them all of these tests and all of these standards. I believe in both, always have, but you can get to a point of diminishing returns. Too many and really all you\'re doing is like running on the hamster wheel, instead of figuring out what does this kid need? What\'s the diagnosis for this kid\'s problem? How do we deal with it? And then finally let\'s not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school. So having more interaction between the school and the home, even if it\'s a phone call, even if it\'s an e-mail exchange, even better if it\'s regular visits. Because if parents don\'t understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don\'t reinforce it, it\'s really hard for teachers to make that case. So I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. And I\'m very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. They don\'t have sports teams anymore. They don\'t have bands. They don\'t have plays. They don\'t have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success. And so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, ""You\'ve got to do well on these tests"" that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well. But if you give them more options, more responsibility and more support for those places that need it, then, I think, we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically. So that\'s what I want to see us do more of, so. [applause] QUESTION: Thank you. MODERATOR: Thank you. We have time for one more question. Lady in the back in the polka dot? QUESTION: Thank you for mentioning that you listen to scientists, because I happen to be one of them. [laughter] CLINTON: Excellent. [laughter] QUESTION: So I\'m a mom, and [inaudible] that way, but also I am a research psychologist, and studying creativity and studying social-emotional learning, especially in schools. And one thing that you mentioned also was that we want to prepare kids, and I completely agree with you, for the jobs of tomorrow that we don\'t know what they\'re going to be. We don\'t know what they are going to be, and the central skill that we need to teach them and enable is creativity. However, we seem to also do one more thing is compare ourselves to places like China. And our education is turning into worksheet-based education. Only we are drilling kids and art is disappearing, music is disappearing, even in [inaudible] rich schools where I live in Portsmouth. Art is once a week. Music is once a week. That\'s it. And it\'s all about tests and it\'s all about [inaudible] even in kindergarten. I have heard stories from kindergartners who come home crying after tests in kindergarten. So, can we try to compare ourselves also to places like Finland that do not start formal education until age seven? [applause] They let them play. [applause] CLINTON: Well, you make a great point. If people are really interested in following up on the points that she made, we don\'t compare ourselves to China, but it is stressing to me when China invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we don\'t. Because if you look at the highest-performing nations, Finland is usually at the top. They have early childhood education. They have paid leave. They have support for families. And yes, they don\'t start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. They\'ve been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively. And if you look at the other countriesthe best comparisons are to what are called the OECD countries, if you\'re interested in googling that and looking. They do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what\'s working and what\'s not working. And I absolutely agree that, you know, creativity, you cannot expect kids to be creative if you don\'t let them play. Now, playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be, in kindergarten it should be. [applause] That doesn\'t mean they can\'t be learning at the same time. And thatand this debate that we\'re having seems to me to be so beside the point. It\'s not like either play or learn. Through play that is supervised in preschool, you will learn if it\'s done right. That\'s why we want quality preschool. Right? And so it\'s a way of unleashing creativity and allowing, you know, little kids\' personalities to develop. I justin the classroom where I just was, I was handed this book of drawings. Each of the kids did a drawing about what they want to be when they grow up. And, you know, they want to be a firefighter. They want to be an artist. They want to be a vet. They want to be a hair stylist. I mean, it was everything you could imagine, but that\'s the beginning of them thinking about envisioning adulthood. So the teachers here, they look at that, and theyand theyyou know, they\'ll talk about what it would mean to be a vet. Or gee, why do you want to be a hair stylist? What does that mean to you? What kind of artist do you want to be? That is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom. And so I think that the reaction against all the testing is coming from people who believe that we have towe have to hold accountable what happens in our school. We can\'t just say it doesn\'t matter whether kids learn anything. That\'s not acceptable. But we have to get back to thinking about the different ways kids learn, and creativitythe best gift you can give a child is a creative, open, learning mind that will enable that child to pursue his or her own dreams to live up to his or her own God-given potential. And that potential may... [applause] ... may not at all be the same by anybody else\'s. So I want toI want to give our two guests, if I can, the chance for the last word, because theythey\'ve been on the front lines. UNKNOWN: Thanks, Secretary. You know, we\'re just delighted again that this is part of a discourse in the presidential campaign, having early childhood education. And it really is in those earliest yearsmore than numeracy and literacy, it\'s those essential life skills, like you mentioned, perseverance, working in teams, ability to problem-solve, creativity that can make all the difference in preparing them for their future. Thank you. Thank you so much for this conversation. [applause] Jackie and I were talking earlier with so many in the room that have been down in the trenches with us for the last 25 or more years that we\'ve been doing this in New Hampshire. And it is so wonderful to have this discussion today that we are having and to have so many people know what early childhood is, know what it means, to have seen that brain development going through from zero to age five and understand the importance of this. And we are so welcome to have this piece. Thank you. [applause] So that concludes our program today, and I just wanted to thank you all very much for coming out to the YMCA of Strafford County and thank Secretary Clinton. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 12, 2015","b'Interview with Brianna Keilar of CNN\'s ""State of the Union""'","b""DANA BASH: Hillary Clinton is campaigning across the country, but she's dropping in this week on some folks you would think she has all locked up, congressional Democrats. But her lunch on Tuesday could be a little bit awkward, thanks to one man, Senator Bernie Sanders, who's been giving Clinton a run for her money on the trail with his huge crowds and his populist message. But when she sat down with CNN's Brianna Keilar for her first national TV interview, Clinton insisted there's no bad blood. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I always thought this would be a competitive race. So, I am happy to have a chance to get out and run my campaign as I see fit and let other candidates do exactly the same. I feel very good about where we are in Iowa. We are signing up thousands of volunteers, people committed to caucus for us. We have a committed supporter in every one of the 1,600 precincts. And one of the things that I learned last time is, it's organize, organize, organize. So I couldn't be happier about my campaign. KEILAR: Senator Sanders has talked about how, if he's president, he would raise taxes. In fact, he said to CNN's Jake Tapper, he would raise them substantially higher than they are today, on big corporations, on wealthy Americans. Would you? CLINTON: Well, I will be laying out my own economic policies. Again, everybody has to run his or her own campaign. And I'm going to be telling the American people what I propose and how I think it will work. And then we'll let voters make up their minds. KEILAR: Areis raising taxes on the table? CLINTON: I'm going to put out my policies, and I'll other people speak to their policies, because I think we have to both grow the economy faster and fairer, so we have to do what will actually work in the short term, the medium term and the long term. I will be making a speech about my economic proposals on Monday. And then I look forward to the debate about them. KEILAR: We see in our recent poll that nearly six in 10 Americans say they don't believe that you're honest and trustworthy. Do you see any role that you've had in the sentiment that we've seen, where people are questioning whether you're trustworthy? CLINTON: I can only tell you, Brianna, that this has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years. And, at the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out. I have great confidence. I trust the American voter. KEILAR: One of the issues that has eroded some trust that we've seen is the issue of your e-mail practices while you were secretary of state. I think there's a lot of people who don't understand what your thought process was on that. So, can you tell me the story of how you decided to delete 33,000 e-mails and how that deletion was executed? CLINTON: Well, let's start from the beginning. Everything I did was permitted. There was no law, there was no regulation, there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate. Previous secretaries of state have said they did the same thing. And people across the government knew that I used one device. Maybe it was because I am not the most technically capable person and wanted to make it as easy as possible. KEILAR: But you said theythat they did the same thing, that they used a personal server and... CLINTON: Well, personal e-mail. KEILAR: ... when facing a subpoena, deleted e-mails from them? CLINTON: You know, you're starting with so many assumptions that areI've never had a subpoena. There is nothingagain, let's take a deep breath here. Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation. I had one device. When I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into the government system. Now, I didn't have to turn over anything. I chose to turn over 55,000 pages, because I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of me, because I knew the vast majority of everything that was official already was in the State Department system. KEILAR: Let's talk now about Republicans. There are so many. [laughter] But, right now, the front-runner... [laughter] CLINTON: It's a big crew. KEILAR: It is a big crew. Right now, the front-runner is Jeb Bush. Can you believe that a quarter-century after your husband was elected, there could be another Bush-Clinton race? CLINTON: Well, we'll see. That's up to, first, the Republicans on his side and the Democrats on my side. What's great about America is anybody can run for president. That is literally true. And you have to go out and you have to do what everybody else does. You have to make your case. You have to have your agenda. You have to raise the money. You have to work really hard. KEILAR: Donald Trump is also creating quite a lot of commotion on the other side. He's a friend of yours, has been over the years. He donated to your Senate campaign, to the Clinton Foundation. What's your reaction to his recent comments that some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals? CLINTON: I'm very disappointed in those comments. And II feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying: Enough. Stop it. But they are all in theyou know, in the same general area on immigration. You know, they don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants. KEILAR: But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that? It's different, certainly, than Donald Trump's and...  [crosstalk] CLINTON: Well, he doesn'the doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does. KEILAR: Have you given any thought to the woman who should be on the $10 bill? [laughter] CLINTON: You know, I am very torn about it. I want a woman on a bill. I don't know why they picked the $10 bill. Some people are now agitating for the $20 bill. KEILAR: The $20. Do you think it should be the $20? CLINTON: You know, I want a woman on the bill. And I think that it might be easier to change the $20 than it is to change the $10. But we'll see. And I don't like the idea that, as a compromise, you would basically have two people on the same bill. One would be a woman. That sounds pretty second-class to me. So, I think a woman should have her own bill. And it may be moremore appropriate to look at the $20 than the $10. I don't know. We'll see. KEILAR: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for talking with us. CLINTON: Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 13, 2015",b'Remarks at the New School for Social Research in New York City',"b'CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, President Van Zant, and thanks to everyone at the New School for welcoming us today. I\'m delighted to be back. You know, over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to listen to Americans\' concerns about an economy that still isn\'t delivering for them. It\'s not delivering the way that it should. It still seems, to most Americans that I have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top. But I\'ve also heard about the hopes that people have for their futuregoing to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they\'ve always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement. Previous generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead. But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again. For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans. Twice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind. [applause] I think the results speak for themselves. Under President ClintonI like the sound of thatAmerica saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history. [applause] Nearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. Eight years later, President Obama and the American people\'s hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. President Obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on Wall Street and provided health care to 16 million Americans. [applause] Now todaytoday, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You can\'t have one without the other. We can\'t create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can\'t build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. We need both. Because while America standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. Corporate profits are at near record highs and Americans are working as hard as ever. But paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. Out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages. I hear this everywhere I go. A single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. She doesn\'t expect anything to come easy. But if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard. The grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people\'s kids. She\'s proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs. The young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. If he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too. Millions of hardworking Americans tell similar stories. Wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. The defining economic challenge of our time clear. We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. And that... [applause] And that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I... [applause] I will get up every day thinking about the families of America, like the family I came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle-class life. I will be thinking about all the people that I represented in New York and the stories that they told me, and that I worked with them to improve. I will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the Recession and will not end with the recovery. You know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of Americans. Today\'s marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation. But it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future. So, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. But they do not determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter. And the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what American life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century. As president, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the American middle class. Because I think at our best, that\'s what Americans do. We are problem solvers, not deniers. We don\'t hide from change; we harness it. The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people\'s lives and livelihoods. [applause] I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. We\'re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can\'t go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes. Today is not 1993. It\'s not 2009. So we need solutions for the big challenges we face now. So today, I\'m proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth. Let me begin with strong growth. More growth means more jobs and more new businesses. More jobs give people choices about where to work. And employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. That\'s why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes. Small businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. I\'ve said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, I\'m going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification. I\'ll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in America, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas. [applause] And I know it\'s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform. [applause] I want you to hear this. Bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years. [applause] Then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs. You know, when we get Americans moving, we get our country moving. So let\'s establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds... [applause] ... channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports. [applause] And let\'s built those faster broadband networks and make sure there\'s a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice. [applause] And really, there\'s no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now. [applause] Our economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make America the clean-energy superpower. I advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change. And let\'s fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and President Obama\'s initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years. I will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead. But today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women. [applause] We are in a global competition, as I\'m sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But that\'s exactly what we\'re doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future. The movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled. The United States used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women\'s labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families. Studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they\'re expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not. We should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they\'re going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick. You know, last year [applause] last year while I was at the hospital here in Manhattan, waiting for little Charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. And we began to talk about it. She sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of. It\'s time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. It\'s a growth strategy. And it\'s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less. [applause] You know, all this lost money adds up. And for some women, it\'s thousands of dollars every year. Now I am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women\'s issues. Well, those days are over. [applause] Fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. And we can do this in a way that doesn\'t impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses. As president, I\'ll fight to put families first, just like I have my entire career. [applause] Now beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes. The evidence is in. Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. So this is the problem we need to tackle. Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers. [applause] Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. They do not need a lecture. They need a raise. [applause] The truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. So, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement President Obama\'s new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further. [applause] I will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis-classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. To make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs. [applause] And to make prescription drugs more affordable. We will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing Social Security and making it easier to save for the future. Now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. We need new ideas, as well, and one I believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. Hard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce. So, I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company\'s success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees\' pockets. It\'s a win-win. Later this week in New Hampshire, I will have more to say about how we do this. Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Senator Rubio\'s would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family. Well, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that\'s the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. I have a different take... [applause] ... guided license principles. First, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. Second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. That\'s why I support the Buffet Rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. I have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate. And let\'s agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that America has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can\'t afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more. [applause] Alongside tax reform, it\'s time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers\' rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. Evidence [applause] evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers. [applause] And let me just say a word here about trade. The Greek crisis as well as the Chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. Trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities. So we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don\'t. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans. I love the saying by Abraham Lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. He talked about giving Americans a fair chance in the race of life. I believe that with all my heart, but I also believe it has to start really early, at birth. High quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. And [applause] and I\'m committed to seeing every 4-year-old in America have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. But I want to do more. I want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group. Eighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. That\'s why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. I\'ve said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing. [laughter] But we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, I\'ll admit, it\'s embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it\'s building her capacity for learning. And the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background. Think of what we are losing because we\'re not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the United States and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start. We also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, I will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help Americans refinance their student debt. And let\'s embrace [applause] let\'s embrace the idea of lifelong learning. In an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs. There are exciting efforts underway and I want to support and scale the ones that show results. As we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow Americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to Indian country. Talent is universal; you find it everywhere. But opportunity is not. There are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in America today who are not in school or at work. The numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering. A quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all Latino youth cannot find a job. We\'ve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class. I firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that\'s hard to say if there aren\'t enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty. That\'s why Ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. When [applause] when all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country\'s prosperity, that\'s fair growth. It\'s what I\'ve always believed in and it\'s what I will fight for as president. Now the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. Too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. Many business leaders see this. They\'ve talked to me about it. One has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. They say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent. Net business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy. In recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn\'t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company\'s future success. These trends need to change. And I believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today\'s share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet. Now I\'m not talking about charity; I\'m talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits. Now it\'s easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but I would argue that\'s bad for business in the long run and it\'s really bad for our country. Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. Training pays off. To help more companies do that, I proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire. And I will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades. [applause] I will also propose reforms to help CEOs and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day. [applause] Making sure stock buybacks aren\'t being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. And nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on Wall Street. As a former senator from New York, I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make America more competitive globally. But as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either could not or would not keep up. I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight. Under President Obama\'s leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on Wall Street. Those rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president. I will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. We can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust. We also have to go beyond Dodd-Frank. Too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. And the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. Serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non-bank finance companies. So many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all. Stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior. [applause] And while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. This is wrong, and on my watch it will change. Over the course... [applause] ... over the course of this campaign, I will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. We will ensure... [applause] We will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. And we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing. [applause] When the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. It could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers. Now, reform is never easy, but we\'ve done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time. And yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us. Two years ago, the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Terry Duffy, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that really caught my attention. He wrote, and I quote, ""I\'m concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. Some Wall Streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the Main Street,"" unquote. I think we should listen to Terry Duffy. Of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well. So it\'s time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. It\'s time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we\'re going to tackle the big stuff together. How do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? Can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? What are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like Silicon Valley? Questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of America perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing. [applause] So government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward of America\'s tax dollars and Americans\' trust. And please, let\'s get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology. [applause] That\'s what I\'ll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality. [laughter] [applause] I want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and I will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits. I will make sure Washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across America. You know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. As president, I will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country. [applause] I confess, maybe it\'s the grandmother in me, but I believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you\'ll never sit, and the vision I\'ve laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. That is the test of our time. And I\'m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. That\'s what great countries do. That\'s what our country always has done. We rise to challenges. It\'s not about left, right or center; it\'s about the future versus the past. I\'m running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday, an America built on growth and fairness, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don\'t leave anyone behind. [applause] Thank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her God-given potential. Please join me in that missionlet\'s do it together. Thank you all so much. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 26, 2015","b'Excerpt of Remarks in Ames, Iowa'","b'I also want to thank Jan [Bauer] for reminding us that today is the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And I am thrilled to see the progress  she talked about some of the barriers that she faced when she came here to go to college, and how a lot of those barriers have been broken down and eliminated. What she didn\'t say is that in addition to the leadership Tom Harkin showed in getting the ADA passed, Jan was a strong voice in favor of that as well and an incredible witness for what it would mean.I think that we should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country. I remember my first job out of law school was with the Children\'s Defense Fund. I didn\'t want to go work for a law firm. I wanted to go to work to be an advocate, and I joined the organization started by Marian Wright Edelman, an incredible woman lawyer, African-American, first ever to pass  and be acknowledged as passing  the Mississippi state bar, and Marian started the Children\'s Defense Fund. When I joined, our first project in the summer of 1973 was to go door to door along with others across our country to gather evidence about why so many American children were not in school. We suspected that one of the biggest reasons was that their disabilities were not accommodated in school, and therefore they could not attend school. But we didn\'t know that for sure, and we wanted to find out. So I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, saying, ""Do you have a school-aged child who\'s not in school?"" And I heard, yes, you know, our daughter dropped out to take care of the younger kids, or our son dropped out to go to work to help support the family. But I heard mostly that, yes, we have a blind child, a deaf child, a child in a wheelchair, a child with some other kind of disability that is not accepted in school. So we gathered up all of our evidence, and we presented it to the Congress, and that first effort resulted in passing Education for All, and all children with disabilities were given the right to go to school. That was a huge step forward for our country.And then the effort began with real conviction to try to expand the rights that people with disabilities should have in our society. Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Tony Coelho, and then the bill was finally passed and signed by George H.W. Bush. It was a great success in showing that bipartisanship  bringing people together to solve a problem that affected millions of our fellow citizens  could actually work.We\'ve come a long way in the last 25 years. We still have work to do. We\'re by no means finished. And when I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I wanted to get passed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We held an event at the White House. We lined up sponsors, both in the Congress and outside, because it required the Congress  the Senate  to pass. And then we worked really hard, and the Republicans would not support it in the numbers needed. They wouldn\'t even listen to the pleas of their former leader, Senator Robert Dole, who as you know lost the use of an arm when he was in the military in World War II.So there\'s a lot of unfinished business  both at home, and around the world. But I personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation  first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue  that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in America.We have our faults and we have our challenges, but there isn\'t any nation that has continually tried to push forward to widen the circle of opportunity the way we have. Despite the continuing problems that we face, we\'re going to keep doing that.So I want to applaud you, Jan, and others who have been at the forefront of this movement. I want to introduce the Todds  Dale, Sara and Adam  who are here. I\'ve turned over my twitter account to Sara to be tweeting about the challenges they face as a family with a young man who\'s got some challenges himself because I think we all have to recognize that as much progress as we\'ve made, we still have work to do. So I want to thank you for being leaders and advocates on behalf of the community.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 9, 2015","b'Remarks and a Question and Answer Session at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC'","b'CLINTON: Thank you so much, Strobe. Thank you so much. [applause] Well let me thank you, Strobe. It\'s great to be back at Brookings and there are a lot of long-time friends and colleagues who perch here at Brookings. Obviously, including Strobe and Martin, who I\'ll speak to in a minute. Also Bob Einhorn and Tammy Wittes. This institution has hosted many important conversation over the years and I appreciate Strobe\'s reference to the event last night and the continuing dialogue about urgent issues facing our nation and the world. That\'s what brings me here today, back to Brookings, to talk about the question we\'re all grappling with: how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and more broadly, how to protect ourselves and our allies from the full range of threats that Iran poses. The stakes are high and there are no simple of perfectly satisfying solutions. So these questions, and in particular the merits of the nuclear deal recently reached with Iran, have divided people of good will and raised hard issues on both sides. Here is how I see it. Either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Iran\'s path to a nuclear weapon or, we turn down a more dangerous path, leading to a far-less certain and riskier future. That\'s why I support this deal. I support it as part of a larger strategy toward Iran. By now, the outcome in Congress is no longer in much doubt. So we\'ve got to start looking made to what comes next, enforcing the deal, deterring Iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies. These will be my goals as president and today I want to talk about how I would achieve them. Let me start by saying I understand the skepticism so many feel about Iran. I too am deeply concerned about Iranian aggression and the need to confront it. It\'s a ruthless, brutal regime that has the blood of Americans, many others and including its own people on its hands. Its political rallies resound with cries of, ""Death to America."" Its leaders talk about wiping Israel off the face of the map, most recently just yesterday, and foment terror against it. There is absolutely no reason to trust Iran. Now, Vice President Cheney may hope that the American people will simply forget, but the truth is, by the time President Obama took office and I became secretary of State, Iran was racing toward a nuclear capability. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, meaning that they had the material, scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons. They had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges, expanded their secret facilities, established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And they haven\'t suffered many consequences. I voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from New York. But they weren\'t having much effect. Most of the world still did business with Iran. We needed to step up our game. So President Obama and I pursued a two-prong strategy: pressure and engagement. We made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if Iran answered the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way. We simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of Iranian defiance. We systematically increased our military capabilities in the region, deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more fire power, an additional aircraft carrier, battleship, strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available. Meanwhile, I traveled the world capital by capital, leader by leader, twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history. With President Obama\'s leadership, we worked with Congress and the European Union to cut Iran off from the world\'s economic and financial system. And one by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of Iranian oil, like India and South Korea, to cut back. Soon, Iran\'s tankers sat rusting in port. Its economy was collapsing. These new measures were effective because we made them global. American sanctions provided the foundation, but Iran didn\'t really feel the heat until we turned this into an international campaign so biting that Iran had no choice but to negotiate. They could no longer play off one country against another; they had no place to hide. So they started looking for a way out. I first visited Oman to speak with the sultan of Oman in January of 2011, went back later that year. The sultan helped set up a secret back channel. I sent one of my closest aids as part of a small team to begin talks with the Iranians in secret. Negotiations began in earnest after the Iranian election in 2013. First, the bilateral talks led by Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan that led to the interim agreement, then the multilateral talks led by Secretary John Kerry, Secretary Ernie Moniz and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman. Now there\'s a comprehensive agreement on Iran\'s nuclear program. Is it perfect? Well, of course not. No agreement like this ever is. But is a strong agreement? Yes, it is. And we absolutely should not turn it down. The merits of the deal have been well-argued, so I won\'t go through them in great detail here. The bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance. Without a deal, Iran\'s breakout time, how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, would shrink to a couple of months. With a deal, that breakout time stretches to a year, which means that if Iran cheats, we\'ll know it, and we\'ll have time to respond decisively. Without a deal, we would have no credible inspections of Iran\'s nuclear facilities. With a deal, we\'ll have unprecedented access; we\'ll be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program. Now, some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after 15 years. And we need to be vigilant about that, which I\'ll talk more about in a moment. But other parts are permanent, including Iran\'s obligations under the Non-proliferation Treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol. Others have expressed concern that it could take up to 24 days to gain access to some of Iran\'s facilities when we suspect cheating. I\'d be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect. Although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. It\'s important to focus on that, because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond. But our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places, this deal does the job. Microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years. They are impossible to hide. That\'s why Secretary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has confidence in this plan. And some are suggested we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better, unspecified deal. I can certainly understand why that may sound appealing, but as someone who started these talks in the first place, and built our global coalition piece by piece, I can assure you it is not realistic. Plus, if we walk away now, our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished. We will be blamed, not the Iranians. So if we were to reject this agreement, Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing. No restrictions on their nuclear program. No real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb. And the International Sanctions regime would fall apart, so no more economic consequences for Iran, either. Those of use who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection; it\'s the balancing of risk. And on balance, the far riskier course right now would be to walk away. Great powers can\'t just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us. We need to be reasonable and consistent, and keep our word, especially when we are trying to lead a coalition. That is how we will make this and future deals work. But it is not enough to say, ""yes,"" to the deal. Of course it isn\'t.We have to say, yes, andyes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. Yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront Iran\'s bad behavior in the region. Yes, and we will begin from day one to set the conditions, so Iran knows it will never get a nuclear weapon, not during the term of the agreement, not after, not ever. We need to be clear. And I think we have to make that very clear to Iran about what we expect from them. This is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldn\'t accept that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior. That shouldn\'t be a promise for proceeding, instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios. First, Iran tries to cheat, something it\'s been quite willing to do in the past. Second, Iran tries to wait us out, perhaps it waits to move for 15 years when some, but not all restrictions expire. And third, Iran ramps up the dangerous behavior in the region, including its support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. I believe the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges. So let me tell you what I would do. My starting point will be one of distrust. You remember President Reagan\'s line about the Soviets: Trust but verify? My approach will be distrust and verify. We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president, they\'ll want to see how far they can bend the rules. That won\'t work if I\'m in the white house. I will hold the line against Iranian noncompliance, that means penalties even for small violations, keeping our allies on board, but being willing to snapback sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to, working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions. Right now members of congress are offering proposals to that affect and I think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken. Finally it means insuring that the IAEA has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold Iran\'s feet to the fire. The most important thing we can do to keep Iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shaped Iranian expectations right from the start. The Iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to. So here is my message to Iran\'s leaders, The United States will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon. As president, I will take whatever action is necessary to protect the united states and our allies, I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and I will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same pledge. We will make clear to Iran that our commitment to prevention will not waver depending on who is in office, it\'s permanent. Should it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force, we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act. And because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first, the world will more likely join us. Then there is the broader issue of countering Iran\'s bad behavior across the region. Taking nuclear-weapons out of the equation is crucial because an Iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous, than an Iran without them. But even without nuclear weapons, we still see Iran\'s fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the Middle East. They support bad actors from Syria, to Lebanon, to Yemen. They vow to destroy Israel. And that\'s worth saying again. They vow to destroy Israel. We can not ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships and advanced missiles to Hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel, or talks about how Israel won\'t exist in 25 years just like he did today. And in addition to the malicious activity they already underwrite, we have got to anticipate that Iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more. So as President I will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board. My strategy will be based on five strong pillars. First, I will deepen America\'s unshakeable commitment to Israel\'s security, including our long standing tradition of guaranteeing Israel\'s qualitative military edge. I\'ll increase support for Israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I\'ll sell Israel the most sophisticated fire aircraft ever developed. The F-35. We\'ll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah\'s attacks for years. Second, I will reaffirm that the Persian Gulf is a region of vital interest to the United States. We do not want any of Iran\'s neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon\'s program either. So we want them to feel and be secure. I will sustain a robust military presence in the region, especially our air and naval forces. We\'ll keep the Strait of Hormuz open. We\'ll increase security cooperation with our Gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against Iranian aggression. Even if that takes the form of cyberattacks or other non-traditional threats. Iran should understand that the United States and I as President, will not stand by as our Gulf allies and partners are threatened. We will act. Third, I will be a coalition to counter Iran\'s proxies, particularly Hezbollah. That means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah. Looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat Hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is. It\'s time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings. If you\'re part of Hezbollah, you\'re part of a terrorist organization, plain and simple. Beyond Hezbollah, I\'ll crack down on the shipment of weapons to Hamas. And push Turkey and Qatar to end their financial support. I\'ll press our partners in the region to prevent aircrafts and ships owned by companies linked to Iran\'s revolutionary guard from entering their territories, and urge our partners to block Iranian plans from entering their airspace on their way to Yemen and Syria. Across the board, I will vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, other American sanctions on Iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities. I\'ll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran to bad actors like Syria, and I\'ll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they\'re in Iran or overseas. This will be a special imperative, as some of the U.N. sanctions lapse, so the U.S. and our partners have to step up. Fourth, I\'ll stand, as I always have, against Iran\'s abuses at home, from its detention of political prisoners, to its crack down on freedom of expression, including online. Its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people. Our quarrel is not and never has been that the Iranian people. They\'d have a bright future, hopeful future if they weren\'t held back by their leaders. As I\'ve said before, I think we were too restrained in our support of the protests in June 2009 and in our condemnation of the government crack down that followed. That won\'t happen again. We will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanction and I will not rest until every single American detained or missing in Iran is home. Fifth, just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader Iran policy. Our broader Iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism. Iran, like ISIS, benefits from chaos and strife. It exploits other countries\' weaknesses and the best defense against Iran are the countries and governments being strong, that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism. Helping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline, but it\'s crucial that the United States leads this effort. I will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that Iran fuels. We have to bring sufficient pressure on Assad to force a political solution in Syria, including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, something I called for early in the conflict, and the United States must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict, especially the millions of Syrian refugees now beseeching the world to help them. As Pope Francis reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response, and the United States must help lead that response. That\'s who we are, and that\'s what we do. So our strategy needs to cover all these bases, Iran\'s nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, its hatred of Israel and its cruelty towards its citizens, its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses. We need to be creative, committed and vigilant, and on every front, we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners. On that note, let me just spend a minute speaking about the serious concerns that Israel\'s leaders have about this deal. Israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction. I would not support this agreement for one second if I thought it put Israel in greater danger. I believe in my core that Israel and America must stand side by side, and II will always stand by Israel\'s right to defend itself, as I always have. I believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes Israel safer. I say that with humility. I\'m not Israeli. I don\'t know what it\'s like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin. I know that my saying this deal makes you safer won\'t alleviate the very real fears of the Israeli people. But I have stood for Israeli security for a very long time. It was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state. It\'s why I supported stronger defense systems, like the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, which proved so effective in protecting Israeli lives during the conflicts of 2012 and last summer, that\'s why I\'ve worked closely with Israel to advance the two-state vision of a Jewish and Democratic Israel with secure and recognized borders, and it\'s why I believe we should expedite negotiations of a long-term military assistance agreement with Israel. Let\'s not wait until 2017 when the current deal expires; let\'s get it done this year. I would invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House during my first month in office to talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of close, frequent consultation right from the start, because we both rely on each other for support as partners, allies and friends. This isn\'t just about policy for me; it is personal. As president, I\'m committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries. We have had honest disagreements about this deal. Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it. And so I know well that the same forces that threaten Israel threaten the United States. And to the people of Israel, let me say, you\'ll never have to question whether we\'re with you. The United States will always be with you. There have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home. Smart, serious people can see issues like these differently, like my friend, Chuck Schumer, who\'s going to be an excellent leader in the Senate. I respect the skepticism that he and others feel, and I respect differences of opinion and people who advocate vigorously for their beliefs. But I have a harder time respecting those who approach an issue as serious as this with unserious talk, especially anyone running to be president of the United States. Several Republican candidates boast they\'ll tear up this agreement in 2017, more than a year after it\'s been implemented. That\'s not leadership; that\'s recklessness. It would set us right down the very dangerous path we have worked so hard to avoid. I\'m looking forward to aa robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign. Where we have disagreements, we should lay them out, like if American ground forces in Iraq should engage in direct combat, as Scott Walker wants, or if we should keep Cuba closed, as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush want. Let\'s debate these issues. But let\'s debate them on the basis of facts, not fear. Let\'s resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us, and let\'s avoid at all costs undermining America\'s credibility abroad. That only makes us weaker, and I am going to call it out whenever I see it. I spent four years representing America abroad as Americasecretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life, and knowing my fellow Americans were counting on the and rooting for me, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, meant to great deal. We are all one team, the American team and that doesn\'t change, no matter how much we may disagree. I can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas, when we are united at home. So we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing. There is a lot Democrats and Republicans can and should agree on. The United States should lead in the Middle East, we can agree on that. We should stand by our friends against Iranian aggression, we can agree on that, too. I believe the plan I have laid out today is one that all Americans could endorse, and I hope they will. The next president will face threats from many quarters, from those we see today like terrorism from ISIS, aggressiveness from Putin, pandemics like Ebola, to all those we can\'t predict yet. We need a leader who has a strong vision for the future, and the skill and determination to get us there. We can\'t stop the world from changing, but we can help to shape those changes, and we can do that by beating with strength, smarts and unyielding commitment to our values. You know, I saw that when I was first lady, senator, secretary of state, that when America leads with principal and purpose, other people and governments are eager to join us. No country comes close to matching our advantages, the strength of our economy, the skill of our work force, tradition of innovation, our unmatched network of alliances and partnership. So, we are poised to remain that world\'s most admired and powerful nation for of long time, if we make this smart choices and practice smart leadership. That is what I will try to do as your president, and I believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us, and that America\'s greatest contributions to the world are yet to come. Thank you all very much. [applause] INDYK: Well, thank you, very much, Madam Secretary. I was wondering what we could call this speech, and it occurred to me at the end it would be, ""From Hard Choices to Smart Choices."" Right? Or the ""Yes, And"" speech. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this second part of the event with Secretary Clinton, which is little a conversation that I will have with her, and then we\'ll take questions from the audience. I wanted to start by saying, number one, it\'s a very clear and very strong speech. And if I had to summarize the basic elements of it, the message to Iran is, we will enforce, we will confront you when you try to destabilize the region, and we will deter you if you try to go for a nuclear weapon some time down the line. And I wonder how you navigate what is a certain, unspoken tension between the fact that you\'re going to be taking a hard line against some of thesome of the destabilizing and nefarious activities of the Iranians, and at the same time, this agreement puts the United States into a partnership with Iran in terms of implementing it. So how do you deal with thatthat tension, the Iranians may feel, ""Hey, we\'re giving up all these things to do with our nuclear program and this is what we\'re going to get in return,"" isis very tough American response? CLINTON: Well, I don\'t see Iran as our partner in implementing the agreement. I believe that Iran is the subject of the agreement, that it now faces obligations that frankly, in many instances, it faced before the agreement and that they have asigned an agreement where they are committing themselves to fulfill the terms of the agreement. The agreement will be enforced not by Iran, the agreement will be enforced by the rest of the negotiators, the other countries plus the IAEA, and it will be and is intended to be quite burdensome and intrusive into Iran. Now, maybe they believe that having signed the agreement, they can somehow avoid the consequences of the inspections and the other requirements, but I think they understand very well they\'re at the starting line, there are these demands that they are supposed to fulfill, there is a sequencing of you know, lifting of sanctions and other kinds of benefits that they receive in return for they\'re having taken the action required. And I think they are, if anything, probably counting on the world led by the United States being distracted, being diverted, getting tired, not having the staying power to consistently enforce the agreement and hold Iran accountable, and I for one, want to make clear to them that that is not going to happen, that we will take seriously every aspect of this agreement and we will expect them to comply and there will be consequences if they do not. INDYK: When you called for aa regional strategy and outlined thethe elements of that, it really seems to come down to when you say this in the speech, Syria and what happens in Syria where Iran is very invested in the Assad regime. Does a regional strategy on your watch mean taking down the Assad regime? CLINTON: Well, you know, Martin, it\'s not only Iran that is invested, we\'reobviously it\'s now becoming public, we are learning much more about Russian investment, Russian troops on the ground. It may very well be opening the door to greater Russian involvement. There is no doubt that Russian hasRussia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode. So we are facing the collapse of Syria, the survival thus far of the Assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from Iran and Russia to propping up Assad. So Iyou know, I was the principal negotiator on the Geneva 2012 agreement, which Russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution. It wasn\'t very long until Russia reneged on what they had signed. But I think it still provides a very credible framework threat from the terrorist groups and that the chaos in Syria can destabilize the region in ways that are bad for Iran. And therefore the higher the pressure is for some kind of reaction to what is going on inside Syria, and certainly the efforts that ISIS is making to take even more and hold territory in Iraq directly against what Iran sees as its interest, the continuing destabilization along the Lebanese border, there\'s all kinds of reasons why Iran is going to have to confront this instability. So I think wemy view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for Iran and for Russia all the time. Now, if Putin were sitting herewhich is hard to imagine, but if he wereI should ask StrobeStrobe is the expert. He would say, ""We\'re fighting terrorism, that\'s what we are doing. There may be a way to begin to join those efforts."" INDYK: SotheI remember well a speech that you gave when you were secretary of state, in which you warned the Gulf leaders about policies that were based on sand. President Obama in talking about the concerns of Iran\'s destabilizing activity in the region said, ""Look, we can help protect our Gulf Arab allies from external threats. the problem is how to protect them from internal threats."" And you have been clear again that you will do that in terms of protecting against those threats, but I wantedI wonder how you deal with that continuing challenge? CLINTON: Well, you know very well it is a difficult one. I apologize for my voice I\'m suffering under massive allergy assault. Yes, Republican histamines are everywhere. [laughter] Soyou know, Martin, this is one of the biggest problems we face, nobody can deny that much of the extremism in the world today is the direct result of policies and funding undertaken by the Saudi government and individuals. We would be foolish not to recognize that, I think increasingly they would be mistaken not to recognize that. You can never be more extreme than the next extremist and I think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes. I am not sure they are convinced of that. I am not sure they believe that they have to figure out different ways of dealing with their own population and cooperating with each other, and cutting off funding, and exporting troublesome imams to elsewhere. But I think you have to be constantly beating that drum with them, and maybe now, given the rise of ISIS and the very clear threat they feel from, you know, Iranian activities in the Gulf that maybe there\'s an openness there. I know that the king was here last week, had a chance to, you know, meet with the president. So perhaps there\'s more of an opportunity for a candid dialogue than we\'ve had in the past. However, having said that, I still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising. INDYK: Israel. Youyou\'ve made a very clear effort in your speech to say that, ""It\'s time for healing, it\'s time to come together."" And when you\'re President that you would have the Prime Minister there in your first month. And that\'s very consistent I think as you said in your speech with your approach which has always been as I know, to put your arm around Prime Minister Netanyahu or rather... CLINTON: Or any Prime Minister. INDYK: Thank you from the Gurney Press. [laughter] Andand, as you know that\'s a policy I support too. But some of my friends in Israel recently have said, ""That\'s not the way to deal with us, we need tough love."" Which is the alternative you know? Instead of rewarding bad behavior which you should be really speaking toughmore toughly to us. Well, how do you respond to that? CLINTON: Well I think there\'s a lot of room for tough love, particularly in private and behind you know, closed doors. As I write in my book, you know, certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had very rigorous conversations that have gone on in person and over the phone. But II just don\'t think it\'s a particularly productive approach for the United States to take because in large measure, it opens the door to everybody else to delegitimize Israel to, you know, pile on in ways that are not good for thethe strength and stability, not just of Israel obviously but of the region. And so, in the absence of you know, some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just don\'t think that is the smartest approach. INDYK: All right. Let\'s go to your questions. I would ask you please to identify yourself and make sure that there\'s a question mark at theat the end of your question. Robin Wright ? CLINTON: Hi, Robin. QUESTION: Thank you. Robin Wright , U.S. Institute of Peace and former Brookings scholar. Madam Secretary, you talked about how you would use American muscle to contain Iran. Can you tell us how you might use the new diplomatic channel to engage Iran on issues whether it\'s support for extremist groups or specifically dealing with the crisis in Syria. Would you be willing to use that diplomatic channel to engage Iran? CLINTON: Yes, I would, Robin. And Iand I would because I think that we have to attempt to do that, you know? When I first went to Oman in January of 2011, we didn\'t know whether any effort at some kind of secret channel would pay off. We still had the P5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the United States did would have to merge into the international approach. But we had to begin to explore it. And we did. And we explored it over that summer. That\'s when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible. It takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who\'s at the table, what the conversation\'s about, how seriously it will be taken, who\'s backing you up. And so, then when thethe talks actually started, just in the Iranian-American channel with Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan and Bob Einhorn was also involved. It wasit was exploratory and it laid down some of thethe ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger P5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in Iran and there was some real seriousness of effort. So with respect to the other issues, III have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the Iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion. They don\'t want to talk about Yemen, they don\'t want to talk about anything other than the nuclear agreement. Now that was a strategic decision we made back then. You know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed. They wanted to talk about everything as a way to get some items on the table to trade off for the nuclear agreement, so that they would not have to make, perhaps, as many concessions as we were expecting them to make. That\'s why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program. We also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the Gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the Iranians, and you can understand why. I mean, theyyou know, if they weren\'t going to be at the table, they didn\'t want the United States talking about Yemen or talking about anything else of interest, of vital interest in their views to them. So if there were a way to construct such aa channel, I would be open to it, but I\'m just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of thethe region\'s vital interests. Andand I think when it comes to Syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to Iran about Syria because we knew Iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of Assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought Iran in. So we have toyou know, we have to readjust this all the time. Just as I said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it\'s also thethe constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn\'t happen before. So I\'m open but I am very sober about how it would have to be constructed and what it would actually cover and who would have to be either at the table or you know, in thein the first chair behind, so that they didn\'t feel that they were being left out or negotiated over. QUESTION: [inaudible] CLINTON: Here comes your microphone. QUESTION: Thanks for the microphone. QUESTION: [off-mike] CLINTON: So I think that\'s a veryit\'s an important questions. I don\'t know if you could hear the question. But it wasit was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on Russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution? And how would we do more toas I understood what you said, you know, work with our European partners on these securities issues that are challenging Europe? And we see that everyday with the refugees because it\'s humanitarian but it\'s also a security challenge as well? Well, you know, II have beenI remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on Russia, and in particular on Putin. I think we have not done enough. I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine. I understand the hesitation, not only in our country but most importantly, in Europe. The sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact. I think the falling oil price has had more impact and we\'ve got to figure out how we you know, combine both in looking at ways to put moreto up the costs, to put more pressure on Putin. I think it\'s one of the long term security challenges that United States, Europe, and especially NATO face. And I don\'t think we can dance around it very much longer. I mean, we all wish it wasn\'t the case. We all wish it would go away. We all wish that Putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting Russian power in places like Syria and elsewhere. But I think the jury is in, I think that he intends to continue to do what he is doing and go as far as he can get away with. And I believe that we\'ve got to regroupwe\'ve got to regroup quickly, because I worry very much about what\'s happening in Syria right now. Troops on the ground to allegedly protect military supplies. What is Russia\'s real objective? You know, the stated objective, the public objective, to fight terrorism, has always been their rationale. Why did they support Assad? Because after Assad there would be terrorism. Now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might\'ve avoided this. We might\'ve actually help to midwife a political transition. So I think we\'ve got to spend a lot more time. All theyou know, all the Russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials and I\'m looking right at Strobe Talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us. Because, I think Russia\'s objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine American power whenever and wherever they can. I don\'t think there\'s muchyou know, I don\'t think there\'s much to be surprised about that.So where we can work with them? You know, that\'s one of theyou know, one of the criticisms that sometimes comes from the right, the Republicans. You know, ""What did the reset ever accomplish?"" Well, Medvedev was president actually quite a lot. We did the New START agreement. We got cooperation on Iran because when we got the Security Council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under Medvedev in June of 2010. We got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to Russia to resupply our troops. We got a lot. Now, that all changed once you know, Putin announced he was going to be president again now. There\'sI don\'t admire very much about Mr. Putin, but the idea you can stand and say, ""I will be your next president."" That does have a certain, you know, attraction to it. [laughter] So, you know, I think we\'ve gotwe\'ve reallywe are not spending thethe time. We\'re not thinking, we\'re not digging deep into what are we going to do. So, to answer the question of theof the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond. And try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don\'t lose sight of the architect because we\'re going to have a lot of issues up there well. So, III was always of that opinion. Expressed it vocally within the administration. And nothing that has happened since has in anyway persuaded me other wise. QUESTION: And I\'ll just do a quick follow up on that which is more generally, you know. Youyou\'ve got to take on the Russians and Putin. You\'ve got to deal with a very comprehensive strategy for a very complicated part of the world called the Middle East. How do you do the rebalancing to Asia on top of all of this? CLINTON: Well, II do think we\'re capable of doing more than one thing although sometimes it appears difficult. Andand I think we\'ve got to be much more global in our thinking and globally present. The rebalancing to Asia, otherwise known as the pivot, was in response to the very real sense of abandonment that Asian leaders expressed to me. My phone calls to them before I ever went to the region in February of 2009, you know, theythey believed that because we were focused in Afghanistan and we were so focused in Iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in Asia. I think we\'ve come along in some ways in trying to rebalance but we have a long to go. And there\'s much at stake in how we deal with all the players in Asia. I\'m hoping that the upcoming trip I have with President Xi Jinping produces some positive outcomes. I thought the climate agreement was quite consequential having been in Copenhagen in \'09 with the President when we literally had to break into a meeting where the Chinese were consolidating India, South Africa and Brazil against any kind of movement toward the non advanced economies taking responsibility. So I think we\'ve got some good stakes in the ground but we don\'t have aa strategy yet that is going to be consistent. And the final thing I\'ll say about this, Martin, and I alluded to it in my remarks, I think one of ourone of our real problems right now is we don\'t have a consistent foreign policy that is bipartisan, let alone non-partisan. And I think that\'s a problem. I mean, I was appalled when those Republican senators wrote to the ayatollah. I thought it was incredibly, you know, short-sighted and you know, wrong-headed. And I don\'t thinkI don\'t know what we rebuild a consistent foreign policy from administration to administration, regardless of Republican or Democrat. You know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the Soviet Union, I understand that, but I think we really have to work at it. And we can\'t work at it if we don\'t have a set of strategic pillars and organizing principles that we can present to our own people and present to the Congress and present to the world. So I think we have work to do. INDYK: Andrea? QUESTION: Madam Secretary, when you talk about the policies with Syria and Putin, was it, in retrospect, a mistake for the administration after you left office to pull back on Labor Day, a couple of years ago, make the deal with Russia on the chemical weapons? Yes, the weapons were disposed of, but that created a different partnership, if you will, on diplomacy. And secondly, with reference to our colleague from Germany, what should America do to step up to the crisis of migration? Even if it\'s not on our front door, it is a moral issue, is it not, for the world? Thank you. CLINTON: As to the first one, you know, it\'s always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done. IF we remember back to that time, prime minister Cameron had lost the vote in the parliament. He wanted to show support for the president\'s policy of taking some limited military action in light of Syria\'s use of chemical weapons. So it became clear that there was going to be a difficult vote in the Congress, not clear at all that it would successful, which would have left the president with authority, certainly, with executive authority to act. But since it had become a public debate, it would have been a much more difficult decision for him to make. I do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us. I am certain of that. That still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home andand people from other countries, but I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without Russian cooperation. I think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the Russians about what needed to be done in Syria and what needed to be done with Assad. They did not reciprocate on that. So you know, I think it\'s like much inin international relations, it\'s ait\'s a mixed picture, some positive, you know, somesome negative. With respect to the refugees, I have said I think that you know, we\'re coming up on the U.N. General Assembly. I think there should be an emergency global gathering where the U.N. literally tries to get commitments. You know, we did that with Haiti. After the Haiti earthquake, we had a huge gathering at the U.N. where literally it was like a pledging conference, where we said, ""What are you going to do?"" Whatyou know, ""What can you contribute?"" And little countries to big countries all stepped up and it was a great show of support in the face of a terrible natural disaster. We need to do something similar, and I\'veI\'ve publicly called on the U.N. to convene such a gathering. I do it again today in front of all of you. The United States has to be at the table, has to be leading it. We were in a strong position to do that on Haiti. I think, even though it\'s not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our European friends, I think this is a global responsibility. And if you\'re too far away or for whatever reason you don\'t think you can take refugees then you have to contribute money. You should be supporting not only those refugees fleeing, but the incredible work that Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey have been doing, and they have not gotten the financial support they need. In fact, the last I checked, the U.N. appeal had only reached 37 percent, so there is both financial work and contributions that need to be forthcoming and countries need to be more open and willing to take refugees. I obviously want the United States to do our part but I also want this to be a global response. So I hope that with all these leaders gathered, with Pope Francis addressing the United Nations General Assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the EU or other organizations as well. INDYK: I think we\'re going to have to close it out, but I see two hands going up. Do you mind taking two together? First is Ivan and then Joe. QUESTION: Madam Secretary, I also want to add my thanks for a very forceful, unequivocal, and clear speech bringing a position that sounds eminently defensible. One of the silver linings potentially of the Iran deal is an alignment of interest in the region between Israel and the moderate Arab countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, et ceterathe gulf states. If you agree with that, how would you see capitalizing on those shared interests, those concerns about Iran going forward? How would you promote the shared interests as a way of bridging more peace to the region? INDYK: Joe, quick question? QUESTION: Joe (Santioni), the pleasure is mine. Thank you for your measured and fact based approach to this. Let me bring you to the politics of the issue. What explains that we don\'t have a single Republic senator in support of this? Is this is ideological divide between the parties? Or raw partisan politics? CLINTON: Well I\'ll restrain myself and answer the first questions first. I think there is an opportunity here to succeed, I really do. I don\'t think it\'s easy. But let\'s just go back a few years. Not so long ago, Israel and Turkey were working very closely together on a number of issues. Then came the flotilla and then came the response by the Israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was anot just a - a working relationship but a real bridge. Similarly, there have been a number of instances where in the past, Israel has worked in common concert with a number of the gulf countries. Israel is now back in a very productive relationship with Egypt, obviously with Jordan. So there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that I think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together. I don\'tI don\'t know that it\'s something the United States can lead, but it\'s certainly something that we can try to catalyze and encourage. And I think there is potential there because as I said in my speech, I will do everything I can to convince Turkey and (Qatar) that supporting Hamas is not in their interest. It\'s not in the region\'s interest. It\'s certainly not in Egypt\'s interest. They both care deeply about, you know, what happens in Egypt for somewhat different reasons than others, but they care. And so I think we have to build the case and I think American diplomats could help build that case. And then look for waysI mean, I spent, you know, literally years trying to get the Israelis to finally apologize to the Turks on the flotilla. And there was a memorable day during one of my vacations where I was literally, you know, talking to the Israelis. I was talking to Henry Kissinger. I was talking to everybody I could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner Israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps. Finally that happened when President Obama went to Israel. And I was very happy that, you know, now we have a different Turkey with a different kind of, set of challenges, but interests remain the same. Turkey\'s interest for stability are not so different than they were, even though some of the leadership attitudes seem to have altered. So I would like to see us do everything we can. I would make a high priority of that. I hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let\'s start seeing what we can do. It kind of goes back to Robin\'s question. You know, you don\'t know what you can achieve until you try to put the pieces together. And I think the more we can try to put those pieces together, the more we\'ll know whether or not something can come up. With respect to the lack of support for the agreement, honestly, I think it\'sit\'sit\'s in some instances genuine. Just as I said in my remarks, there are people who I deeply respect on the Democratic side certainly and I would respect them on the Republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don\'t feel have been answered. But I think the driving force behind it is, you know, to close ranks against the president, against this kind of diplomacy, but without offering an alternative. And that\'s what I find, I mean I don\'t mind debating alternatives. I mean, when we did the New Start Treaty, it was really hard to get the votes for that. I remember, you know, going up and making the case, but we got some Republican votes. But we\'re living in a very partisan atmosphere right now. And I do think we have to do more. Just as we, and I\'ll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won\'t join, because they have been consulted. They have been brought along, they have been briefed. We have to do that with the Congress as well. And it\'s notit\'s not easy if they don\'t even have open minds. But we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, ""We told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven\'t come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us. You\'re just opposing us. So it\'sit\'sit\'s very political, after discounting those who I think areare genuinely skeptical. INDYK: Madame Secretary Hillary, thank you very much forfor a very powerful series andand clear-headed explication of your position on Iran, Middle East and even broader. This is precisely what we expect from you and precisely what we at Brookings want to try to promote in this presidential debate, so we are very grateful to you. Please join me in thanking Hillary.

Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 17, 2015",b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN',"b'BLITZER: When they we\'re not turning on one another, the Republican hopefuls took turns turntargeting Hillary Clinton in last night\'s debate. In a CNN exclusive, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, joins us now live. This is her first live interview from the campaign trail. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. CLINTON: Great to talk to you, Wolf. I\'m in Laconia, New Hampshire. BLITZER: It\'s a lovely place. I\'m sure you\'re going to be spending a lot of the time there, Iowa, among other states. Ifyou tookyou certainly did take a lot of fire from the Republicans at the CNN debate last night. I assume you watched it, especially from the lone female candidate up on the stage, Carly Fiorina. She said if you want to stump a Democrat, she said, ask them about Hillary Clinton\'s accomplishments as secretary of State. If you were on that debate stage with her, what would you say was your number one accomplishment as secretary of State? CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I didn\'t get to see all of their debate, but I saw enough of it to know that this is just the usual back and forth political attacks, the kinds of things you say when you\'re on a debate stage and you really don\'t have much else to say. I didn\'t hear anything from any of them about how they\'re going to make college more affordable or get down student debt, or get equal pay for equal work for women, what they\'re going to do to make sure that we deal with the challenges of raising incomes for hardworking people. So I don\'t really pay a lot of attention to this kind of rhetoric that heats up the debate stage. They\'re all trying to vie for more attention from, obviously, the Republican Party. I\'m going to let them decide how best to do it. But if anybody is interested, you know, there\'s a long list about what I have done and I\'m very proud of it. You can read my book, ""Hard Choices,"" read about how I negotiated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. You can read about how I put together the coalition that led to international sanctions against Iran. You can read about what I did when I was first lady to get the children\'s health insurance program, or as senator, working across the aisle on issues like getting better health care for our veterans. You know, this is just the silly season. I am looking forward to eventually debating on that stage whoever they finally nominate once they get around to doing that. BLITZER: All right, so listen to what Carly Fiorina also said, Madam Secretary, about some controversial videos opposing Planned Parenthood, an organization you support. Listen to this. [begin video clip] CARLY FIORINA, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation. [end video clip] BLITZER: All right, Planned Parenthood... CLINTON: You know, of course not... BLITZER:?says that video doesn\'t depictMadam Secretary, hold on. I just want to explain. CLINTON: That\'s right. BLITZER: Planned Parenthood says the video doesn\'t depict an aborted fetus. They saysthey said that was from a miscarriage, it had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood. This is an organization, though, you support. First of all, have you seen those very, very controversial videos? CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let\'slet\'s break down what\'s happening here, because I think it\'s important. I know that there\'s a move on by some of the Republicans in the Congress to actually shut down the United States government over their demand that we no longer give federal funding to Planned Parenthood to perform the really necessary health services that they do for millions of women. So let\'s put aside for a moment here that there is no debate and there should be absolutely no argument that Planned Parenthood does cancer screenings, it helps provide family planning and contraceptive advice, it works to provide, you know, some of the most difficult kinds of counseling when it comes to giving an HIV test, for example. What this is about is the fact that some of the Planned Parenthood facilities perform abortions, which is legal under the laws of the United States. I understand that the Republican Party and particularly the candidates we heard from last night, wish that were not the case, wish that abortion were illegal and they could turn the clock back. So I think we ought to be very clear that Planned Parenthood has served to provide health care, necessary health care for millions of women. And I think it deserves not only our support, but the continuing funding from the federal government so that these women and girls who are seeking the kinds of services that are provided will be able to achieve that. BLITZER: All right, have youare you confident that Planned Parenthood, Madam Secretary, or any of its affiliated groups, if you will, haven\'t violated any federal laws? CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is there is aa willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there into the public arena. And if the issuethe core issue that some on the stage last night or some in the Congress are trying to promote or trying to raise questions about has to do with the kind of research that is done legally in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example. So II think it\'s important to sort outthere\'s a lot of emotion. There\'s a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it\'s important to sort out and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it\'s the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong and women deserve to be given support to get those services provided. If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they\'ve got a bigger problem, because, obviously, theyPlanned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that. And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that\'s a set of issues that certainly is not only about Planned Parenthood. So II would hope... BLITZER: But a... CLINTON:?that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally politically charged partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down. BLITZER: All right... CLINTON: I think that would be a very, very unfortunate decision. BLITZER: All right, let\'s talk about another source of criticism you received last night, this one from the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. He said at the debate, you can\'t tell the American people the truth. Those are his words about your email, whole controversy. He says you should be prosecuted for having a server in your basement. [laughter] He says with national security secrets running through it. He says Russians, Chinese, even 18-year-olds could have hacked into your server. Youyou think that was possible, that they hacked into your server? CLINTON: There\'s no evidence of that. And, again, this isyou know, this is overheated rhetoric, baseless charges trying to somehow, you know, gain a footing in the debate and in the primary. And it really doesn\'t deserve any comment. BLITZER: It took you a long time to say you\'re sorry about what happened, the mistakes you made in organizing that server to begin with. Why did it take so long? CLINTON: Well, you know, I was trying to explain, uh, what had happened and obviously it was clear that I should have used two different email accounts and I said that that was a mistake, I\'m sorry, I\'ve taken responsibility. But I\'ve also, for more than a year now, been asking to testify before the Congressional committee that is investigating the situation in Benghazi, they would not let me appear. Finallyand I\'m very happy about thisI will be appearing, toward the end of October, and I will look forward to answer all their questions. I\'m trying to be as transparent as possible. That\'s why people are reading the contents of the emails that are being released. It\'s why I\'ve turned over my server. It\'s why I will testify. BLITZER: You\'ve dismissed Donald Trump\'s campaign as entertainment, suggested, in part, he\'s not really serious. But the top Republican candidate right now, Donald Trump, and, for that matter, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, they\'re all political outsiders and your main Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, he\'s pulling ahead in some of these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He\'s running as an outsider, as well. So how do you deal with that? Why is Bernie Sanders, for example, ahead of you in these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa right now? CLINTON: Well, II\'ve said for a long time, polls are going to go up, they\'re going to go down. I\'m very confident and very comfortable about our strategy. I feel that our campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, all the early states, and now we\'re moving on to the states that come after, are really coming together well. I\'m excited by the level and intensity of the support that I have. So I always thought this would be a competitive election. I\'m looking forward to it. This is an important job. This is the most important job not only in our country, but in the world. And people have to fight hard. They have to make their case and they have to earn the votes of the American voters. BLITZER: You sat next to Joe Biden when you were the secretary of State for four years. He\'s been the vice president of the United States now for almost seven years, a heartbeat away from the presidency. If he does decide to run, will you be able to tell the American people that you\'re more qualified to be president than he is? CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I\'m not going to comment on a hypothetical and I\'m certainly not going to comment on my good friend and former colleague. He has to make up his own mind about what\'s best for him and his family, as he wrestles with his choice. But I will tell the American people I believe that my set of experiences, my plans for the future, my vision for what America should be, what I\'ve already told voters I would do on everything from making college affordable to paying down student debt to tackling climate change by making us the clean energy superpower, dealing with substance abuse and addiction, like I did here in New Hampshire today. I have a very comprehensive agenda that I think address the very issues that Americans are talking to me about. And I know that having been around the presidency, both as the first lady in the \'90s and then as a member of President Obama\'s cabinet, working with other presidents, as a senator and even in private life, I feel very confident that I\'m the right person at the right time to lead our country to deal with the growing issues around incomes that are not raising enough money for people to feel they\'ve got a better future, about the kind of jobs we need more of, about how more workers get to share in the productivity by sharing the profits of what they helped produce. I\'m the one out there talking very specifically about what I would do because I want to run a campaign that lays out my agenda, because when I get elected, I\'m going to start working on it immediately. BLITZER: I knowI know your time is limited. A quick question, are you ready to tell Democrats, indeed, the American public today, that you\'re ready to accept more Democratic presidential debates than already scheduled? You\'re under pressure to do so. CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I have said from the very beginning, I look forward to debating. I look forward to the debate, you know, next month, you know, now just a month away. And I will certainly show up anywhere the Democratic National Committee tells us to show up, because I want us to have a good exchange of ideas and to make sure that Democratic voters first, and then general voters to follow, see exactly what we each stand for and what our positions are. So, you know, II am ready and willing, no matter what they decide to show up and be there. BLITZER: Are you ready to ask the DNC to authorize more Democratic presidential debates? CLINTON: That\'s up to them. They can, you know, they made their decision. But I have made it clear that if they want to do more, I\'m happy to do them. BLITZER: Clearly, you\'re influential, though, with the DNC. And if you want more debates, I\'m sure that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, wouldwould go ahead. Let me ask you one final question before I let you go. You\'ve praised your husband as a great president. So let me ask you this. Would you be a better president than Bill Clinton was as president of the United States? [laughter] CLINTON: Oh, Wolf, you know, thatthat\'s one of those questions that I cannot and will not answer. I will say this. I think if you look at the last 35 years, actually, if you go back further, I think it\'s pretty indisputable that having a Democrat in the White House is good for our economy, better for our economy than the alternative. I think my husband understood that and produced. I think President Obama inherited aa really big and dangerous mess and has, you know, been able to get us out of that ditch. So I\'m not running for my husband\'s third term. I\'m certainly not running for President Obama\'s third term. I\'m running for my first term. But I do believe that both of them understood what it would take to try to clean up the messes they inherited from their Republican predecessors and begin to get the economy and the country working again for everybody. And that\'s exactly the kind of president I will be, as well. BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us. Good luck out there on the campaign trail. We\'ll look forward to covering you. We\'ll look forward to covering, obviously, all of those Democratic presidential debates, as well. Thanks very much for joining us. CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf. Good to talk to you. BLITZER: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 20, 2015","b'Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News ""Face the Nation""'","b'DICKERSON: We\'re joined by Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Welcome, Secretary Clinton. We\'re glad to have you. Let\'s start in the news, Syrian refugees. CLINTON: Right. DICKERSON: President Obama has said he will increase the number allowed into 10,000. Is that enough? CLINTON: Now, look, we\'re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II. And I think United States has to do more. And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women. But I also want the United States to lead the world. And I have recommended that, at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly, there be an international meeting called by the secretary-general and literally get people to commit, putting money in, helping the front-line states, like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, who have absorbed a lot of refugees, working with the E.U. and the European countries, but getting everybody to make a contribution. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the underlying condition creating this refugee crisis. You advocated for arming the Syrian rebels. CLINTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. DICKERSON: That was then ultimately put in place. We now hear that that is not going well at all. Out of 12,000 Syrians that have been trained, there are only handful that can actually fight. Was this a bad idea, or was this a bad ideaor was this a good idea poorly executed? CLINTON: Well, John, I did recommend that, at the beginning of this conflict, we do more to help train those who were in the forefront of leading the opposition against Assad, looking to try to bring the moderates together. A lot of these rebels, originally, they werethey were businesspeople, they were professional people, they were students. They had no training in going up against the Syrian army, which Assad clearly was going to use to the ultimate effect. That was not the decision taken at that time. A lot of what I worried about has happened. There are now big ungoverned territories within Syria that are dominated by terrorist groups, ISIS being the best known, but not the only one. You have Iran and Russia increasingly moving in to support Assad and his constant bombardment against his own people. And then you have these millions of refugees. So, where we are today is not where we were. And where we are today is that we have a failed program. You heard the testimony, five people trained for half$500, half-a-billion dollars. But I think we still have to keep working with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with others of our partners. We also have to do more to support the Kurds, something that I have also advocated. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Russia. So, it looks like U.S. policy now is, we\'re not going totrain and equip has failed, so now we\'re going to turn to the Russians for help. These are the same Russians who are busy in Ukraine doing things we don\'t like them to do. The Israelis think that the Russians are involved with Hezbollah. Why are we turning to the Russians? CLINTON: Well, I hope we\'re not turning to the Russians. Let me just quickly say that I wouldn\'t give up on train and equip, but I sure would push the Pentagon to take hard look why what has been done has been such a failure and what more we could do to support, like, Kurdish fighters who are on the front lines. And one of the difficulties we had in the train and equip is that we basically were trying to train people to only take on ISIS and terrorist networks. We were not training and equipping them to take on Assad or his military or his proxies, which include Hezbollah, by the way. I hope we are not turning to the Russians in that way. I hope what we\'re doingand this is what I supportand I heard Secretary Kerry say this is what we will be doing. And I think Secretary Carter has begun these conversations. First of all, we have to figure out what they are doing. Russia has a long interest in Syria. They have had a base ina naval base in Syria for a long time. They have a connection because a lot of Syrians were educated in the Cold War in Moscow and a lot of Russians actually moved to Syria. So, they have not only deep links to Syria and Syrians, but they intend to support Assad for their own reasons. And we need to really unpeel what it is they\'re trying to accomplish and work with others to try to contain them. And I want to just end by saying, if they are providing any equipment to Hezbollah, if they are supporting Hezbollah, which is the main fighting force on behalf of the Iranians to support Assad, but also a deadly threat to Israel, then we have got to take action, whether there are tougher sanctions or other kinds of actions to try to prevent that from happening. DICKERSON: I want to ask you about something that came up in the Republican debate. Jeb Bush said, one thing was true about his brother. He kept America safe. Do you agree with that? CLINTON: I think it\'s a complicated question, because, of course, 9/11 happened. I was a senator from New York. And I was basically consumed by my responsibility to help the people directly affected in my state and in the city. So, it did happen. And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face. I have said the war in Iraq was a mistake. I supported what happened in Afghanistan. So, if you sort it all out, you know, it\'s a mixedit\'s a mixed picture. DICKERSON: Let me take you back to the 2008 campaign, where Iraq was a conversation and U.S. security was a conversation. You ran an ad, the 3:00 a.m. ad... CLINTON: Yes. DICKERSON: ... which became quite famous. Let\'s play that for ourour viewers. CLINTON: My gosh. I haven\'t seen that in a long time. [laughter] DICKERSON: Well, it\'s a throwback Sunday here. [begin video clip] NARRATOR: It\'s 3:00 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone? CLINTON: I\'m Hillary Clinton. And I approve this message. [end video clip] [laughter] DICKERSON: So, the question for you is, now you have been secretary of state. CLINTON: Right. DICKERSON: Benghazi. CLINTON: Right. DICKERSON: Was that your 3:00 a.m. phone call? And how well did you handle that crisis, by the standard you raised in that ad? CLINTON: Well, of course it was a crisis. And we lost four brave Americans, including the person that I asked the president to send as ambassador, Chris Stevens. But we live in a dangerous world. And even our diplomats are at threat. And that goes all the way back to, for goodness\' sake, taking over our embassy in Tehran or the bombings of our embassy in Beirut, when President Reagan was in charge. This is a dangerous world. And I think what we had to do during that period of time, in trying to protect our people after the attack on the consulate, getting them evacuated, not only working on what was going on in Libya, because, remember, we had embassies that were under attack or threatened to attack by terrorist groups across North Africa, indeed, across a much larger swathe of the world. So, I think it was terribly tragic, what happened. I immediately asked for an independent review, just like former secretaries of state did. And I made that public. And the only other person who did that was Secretary Albright after our embassies were bombed in Africa. So, my view on this is, we have to learn things. And we are always learning. We learned after Beirut. We learned after Tanzania and Kenya. We have learned after Benghazi, but we\'re not going to be able to represent the United States working out of hermetically sealed tanks. We are going to have to be out in the world. DICKERSON: One more question on Benghazi. The charge is, in this campaign, that after it happened, there was a report inside the State Department and inside the government that this was a terrorist attack. But in what we heard from the government at the time and from you was an emphasis on this video, that that had created the attack. And so the charge is that there was a political pressure to make the case more about the video than to talk about terrorism. CLINTON: Well, I just don\'t think that\'s fair. And I\'m going to testify about this at the end of October before the committee looking into this. I think it\'s the eighth investigation that the Congress has conducted. There were two things going on simultaneously. I and others said that we were attacked. There was no doubt about that. That video, which was still spinning through the world, was being mentioned on social media. We had people climbing the walls at our embassy in Cairo even before the attack in Benghazi. And we had a lot of other attacks. I had to call the president of one of our neighboring countries, Tunis, to try to getin Tunisto get them to help protect our embassy. So, I was worried about everything that was going on and how people were responding to that from North Africa to Pakistan, all the way to Indonesia. DICKERSON: So, no political pressure to keep the story kind of a little more favorable to the administration? CLINTON: Well, all I can tell you, I never felt any political pressure or did I feel any political reason to do anything other than what we tried to do, which was to immediately deal with the problems that were coming at us. DICKERSON: So, questions about Benghazi have led to discovery of your personal server. If we use this episode as a way to think about the way would you run your presidency, let\'s say there\'s a meeting at Clinton headquarters, and you\'re with your staff. And you\'re saying, looking at the e-mail situation from the day you decided, yes, to have the server, all the way to where we all now... CLINTON: Right. DICKERSON: ... what went well, what didn\'t go so well? CLINTON: Well, look, I have said that I didn\'t make the best choice. I should have used two separate e-mail accounts, one personal, one work-related. What I did was allowed. It was fully above board. People in the government certainly knew that I was using a personal e-mail. But I have tried to be transparent. And that includes releasing 55,000 pages, which is unprecedentednobody else that I\'m aware of has ever done thatplus turning over the server, plus testifying at the end of October. So, I think that people have questions. I want to try to answer them. DICKERSON: Was it a failure in judgment on your part? CLINTON: Well, look, it was permitted. It was allowed. I did it. And I think that people can make their own judgments about that. But I have tried to be as transparent as I can. DICKERSON: You talked a lot about transparency, thatwhen we think about trustand there\'s been a lot of talk about that in your campaign and voters having questions. They have questions maybe related to this. Trust and transparency are related. You have been transparent in the release of these e-mails, but what about before? Because there was a period where you held on to the whole kit and caboodle before any investigators were asking for it, long after you were out of the State Department. CLINTON: Well, it wasn\'t that long. What I did was to send e-mails to people at their government accounts, which I had every reason to believe would be captured on the government systems. And when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I\'m the one who said, OK, great, I will go through them again. And we provided all of them. And more than 90 percent were already in the system. And, in fact, I gave so many that were not work-related, just to be as comprehensive as possible, they are already sending back about 1,200 of them. So, look, I did what was, as I said, allowed. I said it wasn\'t the best choice. And it turned out to be a mistake, in retrospect. But, at the time, and given the fact that most of them were in the government systems, people are going to get a chance to see all kinds of behind-the-scenes conversations, most of which, I\'m embarrassed to say, are kind of boring. [laughter] DICKERSON: Just to button this up here, you have said you were sorry. CLINTON: Yes. DICKERSON: What exactly are you sorry for and to whom? CLINTON: Well, you know, I\'m sorry that I made a choice that has raised all of these questions, because I don\'t like reading that people have questions about what I did and how I did it. I\'m proud of the work we did at the State Department. And I\'m really proud of all the career professionals I worked with. I\'m proud of the people who came in with me. And we got sanctions on Iran, put together that international coalition. We got a new arms treaty with Russia. We did a lot of really important work. And I want that to be the focus of what people know about my tenure at the State Department. DICKERSON: Some people who know you and have worked with you say what this e-mail situation suggests is that there\'s nobody around you who can say, Secretary Clinton, this is a bad idea, don\'t do this. Do you have such a person?  [crosstalk] [laughter] CLINTON: I have too many, actually. Look, thisthis was... DICKERSON: No, before the fact, not after. After, everybody is giving you advice. CLINTON: I know. No, but, John this was done by prior government officials, including... DICKERSON: But not at this level, not solely a server just for you. CLINTON: You know, look, let\'sit was done by others. And let me just say that, yes, when I did it, it was allowed, it was above board. And now I\'m being as transparent as possible, more than anybody else ever has been. DICKERSON: All right. Secretary Clinton, we are going to pause right there. CLINTON: OK. DICKERSON: We will be back in one more minute with more from Secretary Clinton. Stay with us. [commercial break] DICKERSON: We\'re back now with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, Donald Trump had a supporter at one of his rallies suggest the president was Muslim and not an American. Donald Trump stayed mute and continues to say nothing about that. Are politicians on the hook for every crazy thing one of their supporters stands up and says? CLINTON: Well, of course not, because we all have supporters who may say things that we don\'t agree with. But when you are at an event and someone stands up and says something like that in front of you, then I do think you have a responsibility to respond. John McCain did back in the \'08 campaign when somebody in one of his events said something similarly untrue and insulting about the president. And McCain stopped that person. That\'s what Donald Trump should have done. And I said the other day he is fueling a level of paranoia and prejudice against all kinds of people. And when you light those fires, you better recognize that they can get out of control. And he should start dampening them down and putting them out. He wants to talk about what he would do as president. That\'s obviously fair game. But to play into some of the worst impulses that people have these days that are really being lit up by the Internet and other conspiracy-minded theories is just irresponsible. It\'s appalling.  [crosstalk] DICKERSON: Which Republican would you like to run against the most? CLINTON: Oh, John, I have noI have no vote in that. I\'m going to run against whoever they put up against me. DICKERSON: Are you doing anything to prepare for Joe Biden potentially entering the race? Is your campaign doing anything? CLINTON: No, we\'re not, because this is such a personal decision. And the vice president has to sort this out. He\'s been so open in talking about how difficult this time is for him and his family. And he\'s obviously considering what he wants to do, including whether he wants to run. And I just have the greatest respect and affection for him. And I think everybody just ought to give him the space to decide what is best for him and his family. DICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has made quite a point of not attacking you. He said he\'s not going to run any negative ads. Would you pledge to do the same thing with respect to him, not attack him, and also tell your supporters, hey, lay off? CLINTON: Look, I want this to be about ideas and about policies. I know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That\'s what I want this campaign to be about. And I hope people who support me respect that, because this is a serious election. I obviously am running because I think it\'s better for the country if a Democrat who has the kind of approaches and values that my husband had and Barack Obama has follows this presidency. DICKERSON: So, can I mark that down as a yes? CLINTON: Yes. DICKERSON: You will pledge not to? CLINTON: Well, I have nono interest in doing that. DICKERSON: And you\'re going to talk about Obamacare this week, support it. CLINTON: Yes, I am. DICKERSON: What is the big new proposal you\'re going to offer? CLINTON: Well, first, let me say that it\'s time that we say that the debate over the Affordable Care Act is over. The Supreme Court has twice upheld it, yet the Congress has voted more than 50 times to repeal it. Let\'s get beyond that. Enough is enough. And we need to strengthen it, not scrap it. It is the core of how we\'re going to provide health care to Americans going forward, the 16 million. But there are other benefits to it that people who are not on the exchanges are being able to take advantage of. You know, 158 million American women are no longer charged more for health care because of our gender. Young people can stay on their parents\' policies until they\'re 26. If you have a preexisting condition, insurance companies can\'t shut you out. We have a lot of positives. But there are issues that need to be addressed. I\'m going to address them this week, starting with how we\'re going to try to control the cost of skyrocketing prescription drugs. It\'s something that I hear about wherever I go. It\'s part of the plan I will be rolling out in the next few days. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about those Planned Parenthood videos. Have you watched them? CLINTON: I have seen excerpts from them. And I have certainly read about them. And what I am troubled by are the misleading, inaccurate allegations about them that we heard from Republicans at their debate. This is really an attack on Planned Parenthood, which provides a lot of health services, from cancer screenings , to contraceptive services, to so many other of the needs women have. And to shut down the government, which some Republicans are advocating, over funding for Planned Parenthood, which takes care of millions of women\'s health needs, is just the height of irresponsibility. DICKERSON: That\'s the policy debate this has turned into. But what was your reaction just when you watched them? CLINTON: Well, look, as Planned Parenthood has said, these were misleadingly edited. They were intentionally taken out of context. The fact is that, if we want to have a debate in this country about whether we should continue usingor doing fetal research, then it\'s not only Planned Parenthood that should be involved in that debate. All of the experts, all of the scientists, all of the research institutions, everybody who is looking for cures to Parkinson\'s, for example, should be asked, should we continue this? But so far as I am aware, what they did, despite the way it was portrayed, is within the laws that were set up for this. DICKERSON: This week, the Senate is going to vote to impose a federal ban on late-term abortions. Do you support a federal limit on abortion at any stage of pregnancy? CLINTON: This is one of those really painful questions that people raise. And, obviously, it\'s really emotional. I think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity. And, therefore, I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision. I think that, again, this gets back to whether you respect a woman\'s right to choose or not. And I think that is what this whole argument once again is about. DICKERSON: In the politics this year, it looks like everybody wants an outsider. [laughter] Now, that puts you in a fix....[crosstalk]...Does it put you in a fix? Tell us why it doesn\'t put you in a fix. CLINTON: I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president. I mean, really, let\'s think about that. DICKERSON: Now, I agree, but your namewe have not... CLINTON: I mean, if you line upif youall these mothers and fathers bring me the place mats with all the presidents, and they bring their daughters, and they say, my daughter has a question for you. And the daughter says, how come there are no girls on this place mat? DICKERSON: I agree that that is a difference. CLINTON: I think that\'s a pretty big unconventional choice. DICKERSON: Yes. But you know what I\'m asking. CLINTON: Well, I know you\'re asking, do we want people who have never been elected to anything, who have no political experience, who have never made any hard choices in the public arena? Well, voters are going to have to decide that. DICKERSON: But they worry that people who are inside are too inside, that that\'s why the economic situation is tilted against the middle class. It\'s why they always feel like everybody can wiggle around the rules. And that\'s something you have to deal with, right? CLINTON: Of course it is. And that\'s why I have an economic policy that is centered on raising incomes, because I think what we inherited from the Bush administration, what President Obama had to deal with had the potential of becoming a great depression, not just a great recession. We have now recovered 13 million jobs, after losing 800,000 a month when he came into office. So, why would we go back to the same policies? Call them insider. Call them tilted toward the rich. Call them giving corporations a free pass to do whatever they want. I\'m against that. I have always been against that. I want to go back to economic policies where we create millions of new jobs and where people\'s incomes rise not just at the top, but in the middle and at the bottom, like they did under my husband. So, you know, I\'m not running for Bill\'s third term. I\'m not running for President Obama\'s third term. But it would be really foolish of me not to say, you know, that worked better than what the Republicans offer. DICKERSON: What role should Wall Street play in the economy? CLINTON: Look, we need financial markets. But they need to be put on notice that any of their behaviors that impact Main Street, that disrupt the kind of orderly processing of financial transactions because high-frequency trading is now going to be making decisions in nanoseconds, or fooling around, as they did in the \'80s, in packaging mortgage securities in a way that really bombed us into the great resection, I don\'t think any financial institution, not just banks, because I think it\'s important to recognize there are a lot of financial institutions. AIG was a problem. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. They were not banks in the traditional sense. We need to rein in the risks posed by these financial institutions. DICKERSON: Let mea final question. Your friend the late Diane Blair wrote in her diaryquote""On her deathbed, Clinton wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phony makeovers to please others."" So, knowing you don\'t want to engage in phony makeovers, give us three words that is the real Hillary Clinton. [laughter] Just three. CLINTON: Just three? I can\'t possibly do that. I mean, look, I am a real person, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I have been in the public eye for so long that I thinkyou know, it\'s like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes. Real people actually go shopping, you know? DICKERSON: All right. Well, I\'m going to have to really interrupt you. Thank you, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Thanks, John. DICKERSON: Democratic presidentialHillary Clinton, we hope to talk to you again soon. Thanks very much. And we will be back in a moment. CLINTON: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 27, 2015","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC\'s ""Meet the Press""'","b'TODD: Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. CLINTON: Thank you very much. TODD: And a reminder, I know there\'s all conspiracy theories out there, there are no limitations to this interview. CLINTON: As far as I know. That\'s trueabsolutely. TODD: Exactly. So let\'s get that out of the way. Let me start with a piece of sound, it\'s MEET THE PRESS, this is what you said on MEET THE PRESS seven years ago about transparency. [begin video clip] CLINTON: I want to have a much more transparent government and I think we now have the tools to make that happen. I want to have as much information about the way our government operates on the Internet. So the people who pay for it, the taxpayers of America, can see that. [end video clip] TODD: A year later, Clintonemail.com, this serverstarted private server. Had every government agency did what you did at the State Department there would be a lot of information that wasn\'t in the public. Do you see that now as a problem as far as the public is concerned? CLINTON: Well, Chuck, let me make a couple points. First of all, as I have said very often, all of the e-mails that I sent were intended to be in the government systems if they were work related. That\'s why I sent them to people at their work a dresses. And, you know, the vast majority of them ended up there. So I have said also that if I had to do it all over again I would have used a separate e-mail account. I did it for convenience and it turned out not to be that at all. But the bottom line is my e-mails were predominantly in the State Department system or on other government servers and then I said I\'m going to give them all after a very careful review and I did so. TODD: All right. I want to unpack a couple of things there but let me start with just the news of this week. You had said in a written statement under oath that you had turned over everything that you believed you had for the federal records with those 55,000 e-mails but we have now discovered an e-mail chain between then General Petraeus and yourself that took place a couple of months before these records started. Can you explain the discrepancy there? It was the same e-mail address that you used while at state that you were using with General Petraeus just two months before you said everything was out there. CLINTON: Well, everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about the e-mail chain with General Petraeus is because it was on a government server. And so from my perspective we have a very thorough review process that we conducted and my attorneys supervised it, they went through everything and what we had available at the time was turned over. TODD: But I guess what I\'m trying to figure out is if you said in March that the e-mail system began in March of \'09 yet but we have the same e-mail address popping up in January, explain that discrepancy. CLINTON: There was a transition period. I wasn\'t that focused on my e-mail account to be clear here. TODD: Let me stop you there. You say you weren\'t focused on it except this seemed to beto put an e-mail server at your house is not ait\'s a complicated thing. CLINTON: Yes, but it was already there. It had been there for years. It is the system that my husband\'s personal office used when he got out of the White House so it was sitting there in the basement. It was not any trouble at all. I know there are a lot of people who are questioning that. But the fact is that it was there. I added my account to it. It apparently took a little time to do that and so there was about a month where I didn\'t have everything already on the server. We went back and tried to recover whatever we could recover. And I think it\'s also fair to say that there are some things about this that I just can\'t control. I can\'t control the technical aspects of it. I\'m not by any means a technical expert. I relied on people who were and we have done everything we could in response to the State Department asking us to do this review because they asked all the former secretaries. And the reason they asked, Chuck, is because they found gaps in their own recordkeeping. You know, my assumptionbecause this system was there before I became secretaryit was there when I leftmy assumption was anything that I sent to a dot-gov account would be captured. TODD: But, you know, that\'s very difficult to capture all of your e-mails by going to perhaps thousands of people and their dot-gov accounts. It would have been easier if it was sent to your dot-gov account. CLINTON: Well, but when you communicate with people in other parts of the government you\'re not sending it to the State Department dot-gov and that would have been true either way. I think I have done all that I can to take responsibility to be as transparent as possibly in turning over 55,000 pages, in turning over my server and to testify on October 22, which I\'ve been asking to do before the Congress. TODD: You had said just now in one of your explanations that you provided these records because State asked of all secretaries of state. As you know there was a report earlier this week in the ""Washington Post"" that said that isn\'t quite how it happened. In the summer of 2014 they discovered the discrepancy with your records and they wanted to make a request then it became a formal request of the last four secretaries of state. Can you explain that discrepancy? CLINTON: Well, we have explained that. The campaign has explained it. TODD: What is it? CLINTON: Look, when the committeethe eighth or ninth committeeinvestigating Benghazi asked for information from the State Department, they were doing a survey and they found discrepancies in their recordkeeping not in my records per se but in their overall recordkeeping. There were gaps and that\'s why they sent the letter and that\'s why we did the overall comprehensive search for everything. And it got us to the same placewe looked through everything, we gave them everything work-related. In fact, we gave them so much they\'ve already told us they\'re sending back 1,200 because they were clearly personal and not work related. TODD: Can you respond to an alternative explanation that has sort ofCLINTON: Another conspiracy theory? TODD: That perhaps the reason you wanted to have a private server and not a government server is that Republicans have been coming after you for years, you might havemay have been running for president in the future and you wanted to make it a little more difficult for congressional investigators to subpoena your government e-mails and a little more difficult for Freedom of Information Act requests. Is that a fair theory or no? CLINTON: It\'s totally ridiculous. That never crossed my mind. And in fact, since more than 90 percent of my work-related e-mails were on the system they are subject to FOIA or any other request. That\'s how the Benghazi Committee got the e-mails even before we went through our exhaustive process. Now I haveas you\'re rightly pointing outbeen involved from the receiving side in a lot of these accusations. In fact, as you might remember during the 90s, there were a bunch of them and, you know, all of them turned out to be not true. That was the outcome. When I ran for the senate the voters of New York, they overlooked all of that, and they looked at my record, and they looked at what I would do for them and I was elected senator after going through years of this kind of back and forth. And it is regrettable but it\'s part of the system. TODD: You know, one of the things about this over the last six months that I\'ve heard from supporters is that there\'s an allegation about your e-mail server. The campaign provides an explanation, you provide an explanation. There\'s a new allegation, you have to provide a new explanation. There\'s an addendum that had explanationit has the feel of a drip-drip-drip. Can you reassure Democrats that there\'s nothing else here? CLINTON: Well, it is like a drip-drip-drip and that\'s why I said there\'s only so much that I can control. But what I have tried to do in explaining this is to provide more transparency and more information than anybody that I\'m aware of has ever served in the government and I\'m happy to do that because I want these questions to be answered. I can\'t predict to you what the Republicans will come up with, what kind of charges or claims they might make. I have no control over that. I can only do the best I can to try to respond. The Justice Department has the e-mails, they have the server. They\'re conducting a security inquiry. They will take whatever necessary steps are required to get this matter resolved. TODD: Can you say with 100 percent certain that the deleted e-mails that the FBI is not going to find anything in there that\'s going to cause you to have to explain again? CLINTON: All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process I did not participate. TODD: Why? CLINTON: I didn\'t look at them. TODD: I would want to know what e-mails. Why wouldn\'t you want to know? CLINTON: I wanted them to be as clear in their process as possible. I didn\'t want to be looking over their shoulder. If they thought it was work-related it would go to the State Department. If not then it would not. As I just said, over 1,200 of the e-mails that we were overly inclusive in trying to be comprehensive the State Department has said we don\'t want these. These are personal. These aren\'t work related. They\'re sending them back. So when that process finished, you know, my attorney said what do you want us to do with all these personal e-mails? I said I don\'t need to keep them. I don\'t need them or want them. So they then talked to the IT server, the technical people who were responsible for maintaining them and said we don\'t need them anymore. That\'s the limit of my knowledge and I know I was a little sarcastic in one exchange with the press for which II\'m sorry guys. But you know, I\'m not a technical expert. I just said I don\'t need them. Whatever happened to them happened to them and I\'m very sure that my attorneys did the most meticulous job that could have been done. TODD: I\'m just curious. Would anything having to do with the Clinton Foundation, would that have been personal or work? CLINTON: Well, it would depend. I did not communicate with the foundation. Other people in the State Department did in accordance with the rules that have been adopted. TODD: Any of these deleted e-mails are not going to be foundation related at all? CLINTON: Well, there might be, you know, there\'s going to be a meeting or there\'s this but not anything that relates to the work of the State Department. That was handled by, you know, the professionals and others in the State Department. TODD: All right. Let me sort of move on from that a little bit. I say sort of move on because obviously you\'ve taken a hit in the polls. CLINTON: I have. TODD: There\'s the New Hampshire poll. Do you believe you have explained this and that there aren\'t any contradictions here? So is the issue not truthfulness but the issue of how you\'ve handled it? CLINTON: Well, you know, let me say this Chuck. I have tried to the best of my ability to be able to respond and if people are uncertain, if they have concerns about these questions around the e-mails it\'s their choice to say that\'s going to influence, you know, how I think about the election. I understand that, I get it. But I also hope people will look at my life long advocacy for kids and families and women and look at what I\'m proposing, the vision I have for the country to move forward on everything from raising incomes to equal pay for equal work to getting the cost of college down to dealing with high prescription drug coststhat\'s what I hope people focus on and people get to make their minds up. That\'s the beauty of our process. People can decide on whatever basis they choose. TODD: Your distrust deficityour husband did an interview on CNN and he basically put it all on the Republicans and a little bit of us on the press that this whole thing that has driven down your poll numbers. Do you bear any responsibility? CLINTON: Well, first of all, I love my husband and he does get upset when I am attacked. I totally get that. But we also get the fact that, look, this is a contest and it\'s fair game for people to raise whatever they choose to raise. As he said I think in that same interview, they\'re not giving this job away, you have to get out there, you have to earn it. And that\'s what I\'m trying to do. And of course I take responsibility. It was my choice. It was a mistake back when I did it and I\'m trying to do the best I can to answer all of the questions that people have. And as I said during the 90s I was subjected to the same kind of barrage and it wasit seemed to be at the time endless. And then when I ran for the Senate people said, hey, we are more concerned about what you\'re going to do for us. And I trust the voters to make that decision this time around, too. TODD: All right. I want to play a little comp we\'ve put together of some of the positions where your positions have changed a little bit. Take a look. [begin video clip] CLINTON: So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation. I\'ve made it very clear that I made a mistake, plain and simple. I believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman. This morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land. We\'ve not yet signed off on it but we are inclined to do so. We\'re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the gulf or dependent on dirty oil from Canada. I oppose it. I oppose it because I don\'t think it\'s in the best interests of what we need to do to combat climate change. [end video clip] TODD: How do you respond to some critics who say your positions have changed out of political expediency? That you\'re sort of whatever the majority is at that time, that\'s the position you have. CLINTON: Well, I just don\'t think that reflects either my assessment of issues and I don\'t think it reflects how people who are thoughtful actually conduct their lives. I mean if we don\'t learn, if we don\'t, you know, make decisions based on the best information we have available, well, you know, that\'s regrettable. And what I\'ve always tried to do is just say ok, what is the best decision that I can think about making? Now, with those that you did number one on the Iraq war vote, I\'ve written about it, I\'ve talked about it, I said it was a mistake. It certainly became a very clear mistake when you saw the way the Bush administration conducted that war and the decisions that they made. And so I have been very forthright in saying, you know, as I looked at what was happening it was a mistake. On same-sex marriage, like a lot of people, including our president, I did evolve and I was not raised to even imagine this. And I\'m thrilled now that it\'s the law of the land and I have a lot of good friends who are now able to be married because of the changes we\'ve made legally and constitutionally. When it comes to Keystone, you know, I was at the beginning of the process of trying to evaluate what was the best outcome. I did feel that I shouldn\'t jump in before the President and Secretary Kerry and make my views known because they\'re still in the middle of that process. But it was frankly uncomfortable to have so many people asking me and my saying I\'m waiting and waiting and waiting and it still hasn\'t happened. I don\'t know when it will happen. It may have to happen when I\'m president, I hope. So I\'ve said I\'m against it on the total evaluation. When I made that statement years ago we did not have the kind of energy profile we have. We did not have the full understanding of how the particular oil that would have been extracted from those tar sands was of a different degree of dirtiness and polluting in terms of greenhouse gases. So I\'m not going to sit here and tell people that I make up my mindthat\'s the Republicans. They make up their mind, they\'re never bothered by evidence. TODD: But Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues. Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he\'s doing well right now is some progressives think, well, you know what? He was there when it wasn\'t popular. CLINTON: Well he can speak for himself and I certainly respect his views. I can just tell you that I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what\'s happening in the world around me. As I was saying, that\'s where the Republicans are. They\'re still believing in trickle down economics even though it was a disaster not once but twice for our country. So I want peoplebecause I think my experience on these issues is much more reflective of how people talk to me about how they, too, have evolved and moved in their understanding and I feel very comfortable saying that. TODD: Well, I have a lot more questions and the good news is I have a part two interview we\'re going to do for the new show, my new show ""MTP DAILY"". So we will get into some foreign policy, domestic policy, a bunch of stuff. Madam Secretary, thanks for coming back to MEET THE PRESS. CLINTON: Thank you, glad to be here.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 4, 2015","b'Interview with Al Sharpton of MSNBC\'s ""Politics Nation""'","b'SHARPTON: First of all, thank you for joining us. What will distinguish a Hillary Clinton presidency if elected from a Barack Obama president? CLINTON: I think where we are today is due in large measure to the tough decisions that President Obama had to make. I really like to take people back through the history and point out that, when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and we could have literally fallen into a great depression, not just a great recession. And because of the hard work of the American people and the president\'s leadership, we got out of that big ditch. So we are standing again. But now we have to build on what we\'ve accomplished. We have to raise incomes. People are not seeing the results of that recovery in their pockets yet and that\'s something the president and I have talked about a lot. We have to continue and win the fight to raise the minimum wage because it\'s disgraceful the people that work full time in America are still in poverty.? We have to win the fight on equal pay for equal work for women. We have to incentivize more profit sharing so the productivity that leads to profitability doesn\'t just all show up in the paychecks of CEOs but is shared broadly. And then of course we have to continue the fight against climate change, create millions of new jobs from clean renewable energy and have an infrastructure program. I like an infrastructure bank that will put more people to work. So we have a very robust agenda that builds on top of layers on top of the progress that we have made under President Obama. And the worst thing that could happen to our country, in my opinion, is for the Republicans to rip away that progress and to do a big U-turn back to trickle-down economics to slam the door in the face of hard working people, whether it\'s working women or minorities of any sort or the LGBT community, to basically begin to marginalize and you know, dismiss the contributions of so many of our fellow Americans. SHARPTON: In 2008, president, now President Obama then senator Obama got 18 million votes. You did as well. What do you say to the eight million that didn\'t vote for you in 2008, why they should support Hillary Clinton now? CLINTON: Well, they are coming to me. I mean, the amount of support I have from people who supported then senator Obama in my race against him in 2008 and then others who have been supporting him ever since is really very gratifying to me. A lot of people are very appreciative of the work I did as secretary of state. They view the fact that I joined the cabinet as the senior cabinet member for my former opponent which I think is what you\'re supposed to do in our country was a very important statement of values about who we are and our democracy and how we get things done. So I think the number of people both in my campaign and on the ground, around the country who are supporting me who were first and foremost supporters of President Obama speaks very well to their understanding of how hard this job is and how they need to elect somebody, a Democrat, who can build on the successes of the Obama presidency, and that\'s what I am pledged to do. You know, everywhere I go to speak around the country, I talk about the mess that President Obama inherited from his Republican predecessors, not unlike although much worse than what my husband inherited from his Republican predecessors. And what I say is I\'m not running for President Obama\'s third term or for Bill Clinton\'s third term. I\'m running for my first term. But I know what works and I know how important it is to stand up for our values, to stand up for our interests and our security in a way that makes sense which is smart. So people who have supported President Obama are, you know, very enthusiastic and I\'m grateful for that in support of my candidacy. SHARPTON: The debates, the democratic debates s start on the 13th. How do you distinguish yourself from your opponent its, Senator Sanders and Governor O\'Malley without the theatrics we\'ve seen on the Republican side. What is the distinguishing factors that you see between you and your opponent? CLINTON: I don\'t think there\'s any comparison between, we on the Democratic side and the Republicans. All of the Democrats are saying is we want to continue to improve the lives of hard working Americans. And we have different ways of going about it, about how we want to make college affordable, how we\'re going to deal with the affordable care act. We have differences, and that\'s what the debate will be about. But what I want viewers and voters to understand is that the real challenges to the progress we\'ve made are coming from the Republican candidates. So whatever differences we have on the Democratic side, which we will be exploring in the debate to give people a chance to make up their minds among us, it is really not at all the kind of gulf between us and the Republicans. SHARPTON: Any surprises that we can look for in the debate? Just between us. CLINTON: Just between us, well, you know, I don\'t know. You never know. I\'m going to start kind of getting geared up and getting prepared. There are always surprises. You never know what you\'re going to be asked. You know that so well. And sometimes in the heat of the moment you might not know what you\'re going to say, but I\'m looking forward to it. I think it will be terrific for our campaign. SHARPTON: There is always this looming question of whether vice president Biden is going to enter. Do you expect that he enters? And if he does, how will that, if at all, alter your strategy in terms of denomination? CLINTON: You know, I have said repeatedly that this is a very hard time for the vice president for all the obvious reasons any of us can understand. And he has to have the space and time to make up his mind about what he wants to do and I respect that. I don\'t comment on it. I want him to do whatever he thinks is right for him and his family. I\'m going to run my campaign. I\'m going to keep rolling out my policies. I\'m going to keep standing up to the Republicans. I think they have really sort of showed their hand. They\'re really worried about running against me so they want to keep knocking me down. I kind of view that as a badge of respect actually, because they know that I will never give in to their, you know, very poor ideas about the economy or anything else. So I\'m going to run my campaign and make my case to the American people. SHARPTON: The fact that you are running and we are seeing different polls say different things, Iowa, New Hampshire, can you lose Iowa and New Hampshire and still win? Is there a path? CLINTON: Well, that certainly has been the case in the past but I\'m not going to lose. I\'m going to work as hard as I can to make the case in the Iowa caucus and then in the New Hampshire primary. People didn\'t think I could win the New Hampshire primary last time after I didn\'t win the Iowa caucus. It\'s very unpredictable. It is fast moving. But I think at the end of the day when I put forth, you know, my views about what the country should be doing and it is in conjunction with my experience and I think my ability, my determination, my tenacity to get things done, people will respond to that, caucus for me and vote for me. SHARPTON: I\'m going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think? [commercial break]SHARPTON: I\'m going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think? CLINTON: You know, Reverend Al, he has been stalking prejudice and paranoia. He has been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it\'s dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing. SHARPTON: He called you shrill. CLINTON: Well he has called me a lot of things. Now that he\'s running against me. Before he called me a great senator and great secretary of state. That\'s what a demagogue does, right? They say whatever they need to say to try to stir up the passions of people. So I hope that he is certainly, you know, someone who people begin to evaluate more carefully, but I will add this. A lot of what he has said has either been echoed or not repudiated by all of the other Republicans. He may be the flamboyant front-runner, but his views on immigration, his views on women, his views on Muslims, his views on a long list of issues are not that different from the either stated or unstated views of everybody on the Republican side. SHARPTON: Jeb Bush said in addressing an issue about why there weren\'t a lot of blacks at a particular gathering he was addressing, and he, among other things said, they were offered free stuff by Democrats, how do you respond to that? CLINTON: You know, I find that so insulting, so demeaning and condescending, it\'s the kind of language we\'ve heard not only from Jeb Bush, we heard it from Mitt Romney. We\'re hearing it from Donald Trump. It\'s insulting in the most fundamental way because when we as Democrats say, hey, we want equal pay for equal work, we want to raise the minimum wage, we want to make sure people get the best education they can, that college is affordable, that\'s to build people up. That\'s to give everybody a chance to be successful in America. There\'s nothing free about that. That\'s the way we\'re supposed to be working in our country, where we want people to live up to the God-given potential that they have. And for Republicans to keep saying that, driving edges, dismissing the legitimate aspirations, the talent and the hard work of Americans or anybody else in our country shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what America is and should be. It needs to be rejected. I don\'t hear any Republicans rejecting it. But, you know, I had a Facebook Q&A; a few days ago. I was just outraged about it. And I\'m outraged again when you ask me. SHARPTON: Let me bring you back. When you were a U.S. senator, you and I and others worked in New York around the [inaudible] case. And there are a lot of cases that has happened over the last year calling for police reform and calling for criminal justice reform. What would a president Hillary Clinton do to deal with the police reform question and to deal with the question that many of us are raising on how we have these matters looked at fairly and that families understand that they\'re getting a fair shot at justice? CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, first speech I gave in this campaign was at former mayor Dinkins\' Colloquium at Columbia University. And I addressed systemic racism and failures of our justice system, and called for body cameras on every police officer, called for an end to mass incarceration. And I am continuing to talk about the issues. And I think that President Obama\'s policing commission has a good set of recommendations that I would certainly urge that we follow and implement. But it\'s bigger than this, Al. I mean, the real problems go to how we see each other, how we treat each other, whether we\'re going to get back into respecting one another and that\'s especially true when you have police who are warrant to protect certain communities and they don\'t listen to those communities. They don\'t work with those communities. Now, the communities also have to respect the police. We understand that. But the initiative needs to come from changing a lot of the incentives in policing, changing the way police officers are trained, how they work. And I think with the policing commission that President Obama commissioned, we have good ideas on all of that, that shouldn\'t just sit on a shelf, we should be implementing. And I think that to a great extent, the movement for black lives matter has been essential in raising up these issue. A new generation has come to the forefront. I\'ve met with some of them, I\'ve certainly been made aware of all the meetings my staff has been having with a lot of the advocates, because we have to restore fundamental faith in our democracy and equal treatment under the law. And we know that doesn\'t exist right now. And that\'s a rebuke to all of us. And I\'m going to do everything I can to restore trust and confidence and respect by changing behaviors and by holding them accountable, you know. We need to make sure that the civil rights division and the justice department is fully staffed and able to provide a clear look at any issue that needs to be referred to the federal government. SHARPTON: President Clinton, former president Clinton said at the NAACP that when he did the crime bill the Omnibus crime bill that maybe things went too far. And I remember as you know I was active then, a lot of people forget a lot of us wanted something hard because of limp bias and other things that were happening, crack, I was painting crack houses if you remember trying to expose them. How do we deal with violence without adding to the mass incarceration? What would be the Clinton plan? We are seeing these shootings this week in Chicago. CLINTON: Right. SHARPTON: I mean, we\'ve got to deal with this without feeding into where it went ""too far"" in the words of former president Clinton. CLINTON: Well, both you and he are right. You remember what we were facing in the 1980s and the early 1990s. And people of color, poor communities, lots of towns and cities, including this great city of New York, were under tremendous pressure because there was so much crime, gangs were warring in the streets, crack houses were endemic, crack babies were filling, you know, the wards of our hospitals. And so yes, we did have to take action. But let\'s remember some of the things that were done that we no longer do. We had a ban on assault weapons. I want us to get back to sensible, smart gun prevention of violence. I want us to have not just universal background checks, but I want us to really have the country rise up against the special interests lobby of the NRA that believes anybody should have a gun, regardless of their past history, regardless of whether they\'re domestic violence abuser. This is just unsustainable, and we need to stand against it and I\'m willing to take them on. Because I know that guns are at the root of so much of the crime and the danger that stalks our neighborhoods. Secondly, we do have to weed out the most violent offenders, you know, the repeat offenders, the guys who have no regard for human life. But our prisons and jails are filled with people who have mental health challenges, people who have substance abuse challenges. They should not be in jail or prison. I want a much more robust diversionary program. I want us to do more on treatment. I think I may be the first presidential candidate at least in a long time who has a whole policy on substance abuse because this is at the root, you know. And so many people with anxiety, with depression, with other mental health problems, they self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, and oftentimes they get off track. We shouldn\'t punish them. We should help them. I also think that the police have to understand that a lot of what we tried to do back in the day, back in the 1990s and the Clinton administration was to build those relationships between police and community, not to be in two separate camps but to be part of the same effort, to protect citizens, particularly the elderly, particularly the young, to have enough policing that people could feel safe, but not so much that it oppresses people and makes them feel that they are being singled out. This is a hard path to walk, but I know we can do it. We\'ve learned lessons. We have a lot that we now know especially when it comes to imprisoning low level offenders is not necessary to prevent crime on the streets. Let\'s focus on the bad actors that we don\'t want setting up crack houses again that you have to go and try to close or joining gangs that are so deadly people are dying across the streets in the country. SHARPTON: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for being with us this morning. CLINTON: That went by fast. Thanks again. Good to be with you. SHARPTON: Thank you. You and I work together on Sunday mornings usually in church. CLINTON: That\'s right. I\'m glad you\'re doing this early enough so people can watch before they go to church. SHARPTON: That\'s right. Thank you. CLINTON: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 16, 2015",b'Interview with Jake tapper of CNN',"b'TAPPER: So, congratulations on this new poll number in New Hampshire showing that you\'re pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in a state where you have lagged a little. He\'s from neighboring Vermontthe reviews obviously very positive from many pundits. I\'m wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband... [laughter] ... who was in Vegas, I\'m wondering what he said to you after the debate. CLINTON: He thought I did a really good job. And I think that\'s the highest praise that I can ever get, because there\'s nobody whowhose opinion on these kinds of things I respect more. It was great to have him with me. We had just celebrated our 40th anniversary on Sunday last. So, the fact that he could come and keep me company and keep my spirits up and, you know, drill me on some of the things he thought were important meant a great deal to me. TAPPER: As long as you bring it up, 40 years of marriage. CLINTON: Forty years, Jake, 40 years. [laughter] TAPPER: Howhowwhat do you know about him now that you didn\'t know 40 years ago? CLINTON: I am so grateful that we have basically had the opportunity to grow in so many different ways. I\'m not going to sit here and tell you or your viewers that it\'s been a path filled with rose blossoms. It\'s been challenging. But, overall, looking back at those 40 years, I am so grateful that, after he asked me twice, I finally said yes and have spent these years with him. TAPPER: Turning to the debate, you said at the debate that you\'re a progressive, but you\'re a progressive that likes to get things done. Sanders has plans that I think might be fairly called more ambitious than yours, in terms of expanding Medicare for everybody, basically single-payer health care, free college tuition, an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits. Do you think he\'s being unrealistic when he makes these proposals, in terms of what can actually get passed through Congress? CLINTON: Look, I have the highest regard for Senator Sanders. And I think he is raising issues that the electorate, not just Democrats, everybody needs to be thinking about. And he has put forward his plans with passionate intensity. And I have put forth mine. And just think of the difference between us and the Republicans, who have put forth nothing but the same old out-of-touch, out-of-date policies. TAPPER: But why are his plans more ambitious? Is it... CLINTON: Well, hishe has a very ambitious and expansive view about what he thinks should be done with respect to free college and other of the policies that we both are trying to tackle. I believe that my approach, for example, on college, I call it the New College Compact, because I think everybody should have some skin in the game, including students, who I say should work for part of their education. Maybe it\'s because I did and my husband did, but I think it\'s something that you want young people to feel really committed to. It\'s a difference in approach. We will have an opportunity, as these debates go forward, to really dig down. And I\'m hoping that whatever network hosts them, whoever the moderator happens to be, that they will really ask us to explain and contrast. But it\'s a policy difference. I mean, you could see on that stage in Las Vegas how we are maybe approaching these problems with different solutions, but we\'re both seeing the pressures that American families are under and the challenges that they\'re facing that we want to try to address. And the differences between us is nothing like the differences we all have with the Republicans. And I want the American people to be part of the debate, and to hear Senator Sanders\' perspective and what he\'s proposing, to hear mine, to make up their mind, and then to remember that we\'re not peddling the same old failed policies of trickle-down economics and let the corporations do what they want and cut taxes on the wealthy, which is the answer to everything that the Republicans put forth. TAPPER: Speaking of the next debate, you have said in the past that Vice President Biden should haveshould take his time, whatever he needs, to make his decision about whether or not to run. But your campaign is now signaling that it might be time for him to make a decision. Your top adviser John Podesta said this weekquote""I think the time has come for a decision."" Has the time come? CLINTON: Well, that\'s up to Vice President Biden. Obviously, I have... TAPPER: That\'s your top adviser. CLINTON: Well, and I think what John was saying is that, whether you are encouraging or not, there does come a point where a decision has to be made. But, certainly, I\'m not in any way suggesting or recommending that the vice president accept any timetable, other than the one that is clicking inside of him. He has to make this decision. TAPPER: At the debate, you were asked to name the enemy of which you were most proud. [laughter] Among your answers were Republicans. That\'s about half the country, Republicans. CLINTON: Well, it was a little tongue-in-cheek. But it\'s clear, I think, to anybody who\'s been around for a while that, you know, they do seem to enjoy coming after me. But then, once I\'m in office, they have always worked with me. And I expect it will be exactly the same. It\'s funny to me. When I was secretary of state, I had very high support and approval from Republicans, not just the Republican voters, but Republican officeholders. As soon as I got into this presidential election, you know, all of that collapsed again. And I\'m just reminding people that, you know, you can be an adversary in politics, but then you do have to come together and figure out how to solve problems. TAPPER: You\'re talking a lot at the debate and on the stump about further restrictions on gun ownership, gun control. CLINTON: Mm-hmm.?? TAPPER: I remember, in 2008, during the primaries, you were positioningpositioning yourself to the right of President Obama, or then-Senator Obama, on this issue. You talked about respecting how guns are part of the culture, sending out a mailer criticizing then-Senator Obama for pushing tougher gun laws. But now you\'re coming at Bernie Sanders on this issue from the left. Did something change, or is it just about who you\'re running against? CLINTON: No, not at all. In fact, I would characterize what happened in \'08 very differently. I spent a lot of years in Arkansas. I have a lot of experience with and respect for people who own guns, collect guns, use them for hunting, use them for target shooting. I respect the Second Amendment. I was taught to shoot by my dad when I was a girl. I have gone hunting. I get that. And I don\'t in any way want to denigrate those responsible gun owners, who have rights under the Second Amendment and our laws. But I believe we have gone way too far in being intimidated by the NRA. And I have said repeatedly that the majority of Americans and the majority of gun owners support universal background checks. And for the NRA to take these absolute positions on behalf of the most extreme of their members and carrying water for gun manufacturers and dealers is just wrong. So, I don\'t think I have moved at all. I do have more experience perhaps than some in living in places. I represented Upstate New York, which is a big, vast rural area with small towns and cities. So, I get why people who are part of gun ownership are very proud of that. But what I don\'t get is why we can\'t have sensible gun safety measures to keep guns out of the hands of fugitives and stalkers and felons and people with serious mental illness and domestic abusers, the people who should not have them in the first place. TAPPER: ""The New Yorker"" this week published a memo about you, about how to defeat you, by then-Senator Obama\'s campaign, including your current pollster, who I don\'t know if has talked to you about this. [laughter] CLINTON: I haven\'t seen him. [laughter] TAPPER: But, in any case, among other things, the memo said that you are driven by politics, not conviction, and you\'re constantly shifting, dodging and changing positions to satisfy the politics of the moment. That\'s kind of the same rap on you from your opponents now. Do you reject it outright? Or do you see why some people might feel that way? CLINTON: Well, I can see why people try to come up with ways of attacking me. That seems to be part of the landscape. It happened when I ran for the Senate. It happened obviously again when I ran for president. But I have been the same person. I have the same values. I have the same principles. There isn\'t anybody, anybody that I know in politics who hasn\'t changed a position from time to time, except some Republicans who are impervious to evidence and changed circumstances. So, I really don\'t pay much mind to that. I\'m sure we had some memo somewhere pointing out things that we tried to go after. But that\'s politics. I get it. But I think anyone who looks at what I have fought for and stood for my entire adult life, on behalf of kids and families and women and the middle class and economic opportunity, knows that I have been very steady. And, yes, do I look at evidence and try to figure out what\'s the best way forward to achieve the goals that I hold? Yes, I do, do that. TAPPER: Speaking of politics, let\'s talk about the front-runner on the other side of the aisle, Donald Trump. His daughter Ivanka just gave an interview to CNN. She said her dadquote""is not a politician, but he\'s really changing the dialogue and he\'s really disrupting the process in a very positive way."" Do you agree? CLINTON: Well, first of all, I have a really high regard for her. She is a wonderful young woman. TAPPER: And a friend of Chelsea\'s, I think. CLINTON: Yes, she is. And I think what she said is borne out by what\'s been happening. He has brought his oversized personality and his reality television experience to the highest level of American politics, and seems to be getting a very positive response among a large part of the Republican electorate. So, that\'s up to the Republicans. They have to decide if that will be their nominee or not. I have called him out on some of the things that he has said which I thought were uncalled for, some of the insults and the attacks that he\'s made on immigrants, on women. And it\'s just unacceptable, what he let be said about the president. So, I\'m going to continue to criticize him for going beyond the bounds of what I think is appropriate for anybody running for president. [commercial break] TAPPER: President Obama announced this week that he\'s going to go back on his pledge to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, a pledge that you supported at the time. If elected, you would inherit 5,500 U.S. troops still in Afghanistan. Can you pledge that you would get all of them out of Afghanistan by the end of your first or second term? CLINTON: You know, Jake, I think what you\'re seeing with President Obama is a perfect example of a leader who has strong convictions about what he would like to see happen but also pays attention to what\'s going on in the real world. And his decision is one that I agree with. I will not sit here today and say what I would do upon taking office because, again, we want to bring our troops home. We certainly don\'t want them engaged in on the ground combat. We want them to help support and train the Afghan army. And we want them to, you know, continue to work with the government of Afghanistan to try to help strengthen security for them. So, I can\'t predict where things will be in January of 2017. But I support the president\'s decision. TAPPER: You\'re scheduled to testify before the Benghazi Committee in the House of Representatives in a few days. What are you expecting and how are you preparing? CLINTON: I really don\'t know what to expect. I think it\'s pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing, they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on trying to as they admitted drive down my poll numbers. I\'ve already testified about Benghazi. I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House. I don\'t know that I have very much to add. This is after all the eighth investigation. Other committees of the Congress, standing committees with other experienced members of staff have all looked into this and basically just rejected the conspiracy theories that are still floating out there in some circles. So, I really don\'t know. I will do my best to answer their questions. But I don\'t really know what their objective is right now. TAPPER: I covered the Benghazi situation, the Benghazi tragedy when I was a White House correspondent. And there\'s something I just never really understood. And that is, why did the State Department deny all those security requests? The former regional security officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom recalled in testimony asking for 12 new security agents. And he was talking to a regional director who said he was asking for the sun, the moon and the stars. It got so bad, Nordstrom said, that he was fighting members of the State Department. It was like having the Taliban on the inside of the building. CLINTON: Well, the accountability review board that I commissioned went into this in great detail. And they made some recommendations. TAPPER: I know, but I guess the question is why, though? Why weren\'t the security requests, why weren\'t they made? CLINTON: Well, that was left to the security professionals, Jake. And in the reports, the ones that have been done that were nonpolitical and independent in their efforts to try to sort this through, I think concluded that the security professionals in the State Department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions. That\'s why we don\'t inject politics into it. That has to be what the professionals are deciding. And there were a lot of different opinions and that\'s understandable. There\'s tough decisions that have to be made. So, I can only point you to the very thorough review that several committees have done starting with the accountability review board that have gone into this in great detail and made recommendations about how we can better make those assessments. Not at the political level, because I don\'t think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions. But we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are needed can be asked for and deployed to the best extent. TAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails."" [laughter] But there are a lot of people who are not. CLINTON: Well -- [laughter] TAPPER: Including FBI officials looking into whether national security was compromised because of this server. And this is something else that is very confusing to me. With all your experience, why wouldn\'t you anticipate that over the course of four years, handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance, why wouldn\'t you anticipate that something classified, whether about North Korea or Iran or drones or an informant for the CIA, that it wouldn\'t be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn\'t you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk? CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothingand I will underscore, nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified. We have a system in our government, in our State Department, it was there before I came in. TAPPER: Right. CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time. And nothing was marked classified. TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classified. CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems. We had the unclassified system, so anybody on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies in our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something\'s going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there\'s a case and so now, it\'s sensitive information. That\'s what\'s going on here. Different agencies are weighing in saying, yes, it wasn\'t classified, but we think that there is something in it that now we\'re going to say is sensitive. At the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn\'t changed. TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed too. CLINTON: Yes, it was. TAPPER: Who allowed it? CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of State Department. AgainTAPPER: So nobody signed off on it? CLINTON: No, no, it was allowed. You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels, because the rules did change after I left State Department. But at the time and in prior years, the rules allowed it. TAPPER: But it never occurred to you when any of these e-mails coming in from Sid Blumenthal with very sensitive informationCLINTON: Sid Blumenthal was not a government employee or official. It would be like you sending me something, Jake. If I thought it had some interest to it, I might forward it onto somebody. But I would not expect you to be in a position to classify anything because you were not in that classification process. Neither was he. So, he sent me stuff that he heard from people. You know, he\'s an old journalist and thought it was of interest. Some of it I sent on, some I didn\'t. I kind of made the judgment at the time. It was not in the category of anything that could be classified because it came from an outside nongovernment person passing on what somebody told somebody told him. And, look, I\'m somebody who thinks the government and people who work in it should be open to getting information from different sources. I mean, you wrote a book about Afghanistan. If during the course of my being secretary of state, you had sent me an e-mail saying, look, I think the government needs to know this, and I thought, hey, that\'s a good point I\'ll send it on and six years later they say, oh, my gosh, he was reporting sensitive information. Well, you didn\'t know that. And I certainly didn\'t know that. So, I think that this is a complicated issue for even sophisticated folks to understand. And I just keep going back to we have two different systems. I dealt with classified information very carefully and seriously. I usually met with people to discuss it. It was delivered to me in hard copy so marked. And then when I traveled, I had one of those tents because we were afraid of prying eyes from certain governments that I would read classified material in. So, I\'m very familiar with the importance of treating classified information as it should be with great care. TAPPER: Can I get your e-mail address? CLINTON: Sure. You want to send me something that might be interesting? TAPPER: I\'m just wondering for the future. I haven\'t had that kind of relationship with you, but if that was like a hidden offer. CLINTON: Yes, sure. You can give me, you know, what you hear politically. I might make use of it. TAPPER: Sure. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it. CLINTON: Great. Nice to talk to you. TAPPER: Congratulations on the debate. CLINTON: Tank you. Thank you very much.'"

The former regional security officer in Libya Eric Nordstrom recalled in testimony asking for 12 new security agents and he was talking to a regional director who said he was asking for the sun, the moon, and the stars. It got so bad Nordstrom said, that he said that he was fighting members of the State Department. It was like having the Taliban on the inside of the building. CLINTON: Well, the accountability review board that I commissioned went into this in great detail, and they made some recommendations. TAPPER: I know, but I guess the question is why, though? Why didn\'t the security requests, why weren\'t they made? CLINTON: Well, that was left to the security professionals, Jake. And in the reports, the ones that have been done that were nonpolitical and independent in their efforts to try to sort this through I think concluded that the security professionals in the State Department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions. That\'s why we don\'t inject politics into it. That has to be what the professionals are deciding. And there were a lot of different opinions and that\'s understandable. There\'s tough decisions that have to be made. So I can only point you to the very thorough review that several committees have done starting with the accountability review board that have gone into this in great deal and made recommendations about how we can better make those assessments. Not at the political level, because I don\'t think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions, but we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are need can be asked for and deployed to the best extent. TAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails."" But there are a lot of people who are not... CLINTON: WellTAPPER: ... including FBI officials looking into whether national security was comprised because of this server. And this isthis is something else that is very confusing to me with all your experience why wouldn\'t you anticipate that over the course of four years handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance why wouldn\'t you anticipate that something classified whether about North Korea, or Iran, or drones or an informant for the CIA that itthat it wouldn\'t be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn\'t you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk? CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing and I will underscore nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified. We have a system in our government, in our State Department. It was there before I came in. TAPPER: Right. CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time and nothing was marked classified. TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classify. CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems. We had the unclassified systems, so anybody who was on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies and our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something is going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there\'s a case and so now it\'s sensitive information. That\'s what\'s going on here. Different agencies are weighing in and saying, yes, it wasn\'t classified but we think that there is something in it that now we\'re going to say is sensitive. You know, at the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn\'t changed ever sinceTAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed, too. CLINTON: Yes, it was. TAPPER: Who allowed it? CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And againTAPPER: So nobody signed off on it? CLINTON: No, no. It was allowed. You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels because the rules did change after I left the State Department. But at the time and in prior years the rules allowed it.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 22, 2015",b'Opening Statement to House Select Committee on Benghazi',"b'Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.I am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.I knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation\'s most accomplished diplomats. Chris\'s mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.When the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading ""thugs don\'t represent Benghazi or Islam."" ""Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet."" ""Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.""Although I didn\'t have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA\'s outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.As Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.I took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.And make no mistake: the risks are real. Terrorists have killed more than sixty-five American diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.Since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they\'ll tell you they can\'t do their jobs for us from bunkers.It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens\' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.That\'s why Chris was in Benghazi. It\'s why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better  a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country\'s fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day\'s drive from the Libyan border.Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists\' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That\'s what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.Retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn\'t mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America\'s strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a countryour countrybecause they believed  as I do  that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.My second observation is this: We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That\'s what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.It\'s what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans. It\'s what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.Part of America\'s strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.And Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.Finally, there is one more observation I\'d like to share:I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree  far from it  but we do come together when it counts.As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.I know it\'s possible to find common ground, because I have done it.We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.Let\'s be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.That\'s what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State. And it\'s what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 19, 2015",b'Remarks and a Question and Answer Session at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City',"b'CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you, Richard. And thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. It truly is an important resource for us all. Fareed, I look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the council, and Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. I\'m very grateful. I wanted to come here to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week, and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends. When the United States was hit on 9/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now, it\'s our turn to stand in solidarity with France and all of our friends. We cherish the same values. We face the same adversaries. We must share the same determination. After a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world\'s great democracies can\'t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. Therefore, we must choose resolve. And we must lead the world to meet this threat. Now, let\'s be clear about what we\'re facing. Beyond Paris in recent days, we\'ve seen deadly terrorist attacks in Nigeria, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, and a Russian civilian airline destroyed over the Sinai. At the heart of today\'s new landscape of terror is ISIS. They persecute religious and ethnic minorities; kidnap and behead civilians; murder children. They systematically enslave, torture and rape women and girls. ISIS operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in Iraq and Syria; an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond; and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three, and time is of the essence. ISIS is demonstrating new ambition, reach and capabilities. We have to break the group\'s momentum and then its back. Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS. But we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks, only to face metastasizing threats down the road, so we also have to play and win the long game. We should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, one that embeds our mission against ISIS within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it\'s Al Qaida or ISIS or some other network. An immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily torn out. It will require sustained commitment in every pillar of American power. This is a worldwide fight, and American must lead it. Our strategy should have three main elements. One, defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East; two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing arms and propaganda around the world; three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats. Let me start with the campaign to defeat ISIS across the region. The United States and our international coalition has been conducting this fight for more than a year. It\'s time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny ISIS control of territory in Iraq and Syria. That starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes and a broader target set. A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about ISIS and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with Al Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate ISIS\' command and control and its economic lifelines. A more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient, and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS. Like President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart move to make here. If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it\'s that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission. Now, the obstacles to achieving this are significant. On the Iraqi side of the border, Kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to re-take towns from ISIS, but the Iraqi national army has struggled, and it\'s going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. As part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes. Ultimately, however, a ground campaign in Iraq will only succeed if more Iraqi Sunnis join the fight. But that won\'t happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront ISIS. Now, we\'ve been in a similar place before in Iraq. In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out Al Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki\'s rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten. So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard. Baghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against ISIS. But if Baghdad won\'t do that, the coalition should do so directly. On the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS, beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad who, let us remember, has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have. But they are increasingly under threat from ISIS as well. So we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well. To support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force President Obama has already authorized, and be prepared to deploy more as more Syrians get into the fight. And we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable Syrian opposition units. Our increased support should go hand in hand with increased support from our Arab and European partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe. This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing. Of course, we\'ve been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. But we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. We can learn lessons from Lebanon and Bosnia about what it will take. And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability. Right now, I\'m afraid, President Putin is actually making things somewhat worse. Now, to be clear, though, there is an important role for Russia to help in resolving the conflict in Syria. And we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves Syria as a unitary, nonsectarian state, with protections for the rights of all Syrians and to keep key state institutions intact. There is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to end Assad\'s rule. Now, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our Arab and Turkish partners. And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria. Countries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way. This is their fight and they need to act like it. So far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS. And to be fair, Turkey has a long and painful history with Kurdish terrorist groups. But the threat from ISIS cannot wait. As difficult as it may be, we need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling ISIS, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against ISIS. The United States should also work with our Arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against ISIS. At the moment, they\'re focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran. That\'s why the Saudis, for example, shifted attention from Syria to Yemen. So we have to work out a common approach. In September, I laid out a comprehensive plan to counter Iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. We cannot view Iran and ISIS as separate challenges. Regional politics are too interwoven. Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS. And as we work out a broader regional approach, we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. Israel increasingly shares with our Arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and joint efforts as well. Now, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. We have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring along a lot of partners, move on multiple fronts at once. But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS\'s enclave of terror. And to support this campaign, Congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. That will send a message to friend and foe alike that the United States is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done. Now, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of Iraq and Syria, to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online. A terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms and propaganda around the world has allowed ISIS to strike at the heart of Paris last week and an Al Qaida affiliate to do the same at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year. ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans, but even Al Qaida, including the death of Osama bin Laden, they are still posing great threats to so many. Let\'s take one example. We\'ve had a lot of conversation about ISIS in the last week, let\'s not forget Al Qaida. They still have the most sophisticated bombmakers, ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like Yemen and North Africa, so we can\'t just focus on Iraq and Syria, we need to intensify our counterour counterterrorism efforts on a wider scope. Most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the Middle East. Thousandsthousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and, yes, even the United States. Their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle hardened. Stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information-sharing among countries every step of the way. We should not stop pressing until Turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into Syria, finally locks down its border. The United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria. We also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. For example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents and more. When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization. When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with Muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots. Radicalization and recruitment also is happening online. There\'s no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. We must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory. At the State Department, I built up a unit of communication specialists fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Somali and other languages to battle with extremists online. We need more of that, including from the private sector. Social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts, so they\'re not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence. Online or off-line, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate, and we have to win. Let\'s be clear, though, Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilization, or repeating the specific words radical Islamic terrorism isn\'t just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers more standing than they deserve. It actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side. Our priority should be how to fight the enemy. In the end, it didn\'t matter what kind of terrorist we call bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden. But we still can\'t close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread. Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia. Overlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit. Before the Arab Spring, I warned that the region\'s foundations would sink into the sand without immediate reforms. Well, the need has only grown more urgent. We have to join with our partners to do the patient\'s steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists; supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law; creating economic growth that supports stability; working to curb corruption, helping training effective and accountable law enforcement, intelligence and counterterrorism services. As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we\'re trying to defeat. When I became secretary of State, I was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats. So, we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world. It should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats. And let\'s not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons, and keep them out of the hands of terrorists. At the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by U.S. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards when there are any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats. All of thisstopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspaceis vital to the war against ISIS, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that. Now, the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and home-grown threats. After 9/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe. We still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, Europe is way behind. Today, European nations don\'t even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. It seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected. I appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination. European countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant. And here at home, we face a number of our own challenges. The threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs. So our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead. We know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. So they need all the resources and support we can give them. Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans. Now, this should go without saying, but in the current climate, it bears repeating. Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization. Another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy. Now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack. Since Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle Syrian refugees seeking safety in the United States. Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people. So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals, in close coordination with our allies and partners. And Congress need to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations. Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than that. And remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. We should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like Jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing Syria. And we can get this right. America\'s open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism, but I actually believe it\'s one of our strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities. This is not a time for scoring political points. When New York was attacked on 9/11, we had a Republican president, a Republican governor and a Republican mayor, and I worked with all of them. We pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. This is a time for American leadership. No other country can rally the world to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale, and that\'s exactly what we need. The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it. There\'s been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one, but there\'s not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis. I know how hard this is because we\'ve done it before. To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya, to support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of American powermilitary and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values. That is smart power. We have to work with institutions and partners like NATO, the E.U., the Arab League and the U.N., strengthen our alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy, and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did it to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. The United States and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity. This past week, as I watched the tragic scenes from France, I kept thinking back to a young man in the world met in January after the last attack in Paris. His name was Lassana, a Muslim immigrant from Mali who worked at a kosher market. He said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family. When the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, Lassana risked his life to protect his Jewish customers. He moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room, and then slipping out to help the police. ""I didn\'t know or care, he said, if they were Jews or Christians or Muslims. We\'re all in the same boat."" What a rebuke to the extremists\' hatred. The French government announced it would grant Lassana full citizenship. But when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already. That\'s the power of free people. That\'s what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat. And as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together, and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere. Thank you all. [applause] QUESTION: Thank you so much, Madam Secretary, and thanks to Richard Haass again, for organizing this extraordinary opportunity. In the week of the Paris attacks, President Obama said that he thought what was needed now was an intensification of his existing strategy against ISIS. Is what you\'re proposing an intensification of the existing strategy, or a change to it? CLINTON: Well, as I said in the speech, it is, in many ways, an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy. But it has to also intensify and accelerate our efforts in the other arenas. What we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us. What we have done, with the president saying there would be special forces sent, it is right in line with what I think that they need to get there, and we need to take stock of whether we need more, and we need to also empower our trainers in Iraq to have more support to do what they\'re trying to accomplish by getting the Iraqi Army, once again, to be a fighting force. And we needone thing that I believe we haven\'t done yet is make it clear to Baghdad that we are going to be arming Sunni tribes and Kurds if they don\'t, because at some point, they have to be in the fight. The Kurds, as you know, are fighting bravely on both sides of the border, and they need the support that we\'ve given them and some of the special ops work, and the assault and taking back of Sinjar. And then, these other two elements that I mentioned. We have pieces in place, but I think we have to deepen and better coordinate, not only within our own country in Europe, but more broadly. QUESTION: Do you believe that President Obama underestimated ISIS when he called it the J.V. team? CLINTON: Look, I don\'t think it\'s useful to go back in and replow old ground. I think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove Assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution. And there were so many groups fighting. There were so many other factors at work. Now that ISIS has made clear that I think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the Kurds, they\'re now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going. So I think there\'s been, you know, an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it. QUESTION: A couple of days ago, the New York Times had a headline that said, ""Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\'s Alignment With Obama."" Has it? CLINTON: Well, it\'s not the first headline I\'ve disagreed with. [laughter] Look, II have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do. I was very proud to serve as President Obama\'s secretary of state. I think we made a good team. We largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited, and to take on some of the new challenges we faced. But even when I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called ""moderates""and I do think there were some early onthat we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad. But, you know, this is an evolving and fast-moving situation. I think we\'re all, you know, working to, you know, make sure that what we do actually will produce the results we seek. QUESTION: When you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in Syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. This seems to me the major difference right now between what the presidentwhat Obama\'s administration is doing and what you\'re proposing. Do you notwhy do you disagree with Bob Gates on this? CLINTON: Well, II believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an American-only no-fly zone. I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force. And I think we have a chance to do that now. We have a no-fly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds. And it proved to be successful, not easyit never isbut I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans. I also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they\'re going to do. And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now. So I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations. QUESTION: You talked about Arab partners, but it\'s worth noting that after having announced with great fanfare that they would join us in the strikes, Saudi Arabia has essentially dropped out. The UAE has essentially dropped out. What would youwhat couldcan you do particularly to make these key Sunni states that seem more interested in fighting in Yemen, where they are battling a Shiite force, as they see it? What can you do to make them actually take this on as their struggle? CLINTON: Well, that\'swe did build that coalition with respect to Libya. We had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests. And you\'re right, the Saudis were actually involved in Syria and now have put all of their resources against the Houthis and the Iranian backers of the Houthis in Yemen. Now, what does that mean? Well, it means that they see the battle that they want to fight as one against Iran and its proxies. My argument to them would be, left unattended, you could have Iranian reach from Tehran to Baghdad. If you allow Syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically Assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the Iranians, the Russians are interested in their naval base. And so you will find a consolidation of authority with the Iranians and moving into Baghdad even more so. So what you\'re facing in Yemen could be a limited preview of what you could face going forward, unless we get some concerted effort to stop the fighting and to seek a political solution that does give some room to all the different groups within Syria to have a say in the future. QUESTION: Donald Trump says that if you look back, you see that every timeI get a laugh just saying it...[laughter]... Donald Trump says that every time we deposed or encouraged the removal of a dictator in the Middle East, what has followed has been political chaos and a worse humanitarian situation than existed before. And if you look at Iraq, if you look at Libya, if you look Yemen, you look at the fragility of the Assad regime and what it has produced, isn\'t he right? CLINTON: Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named. As I mentioned in the speech, I spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the Arab Spring was breaking. And I did so not knowing about the Arab Spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand. It was going to explode at some point or another. And with the developments in Libya, for example, the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So it\'sI think it\'s too soon to tell and I think it\'s something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely. Now, deposing Milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a dealin fact, my husband\'s in Dayton today speaking about the Dayton Accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together. Is it perfect? No, but has it, you know, kind of going, and do we have some work to do there? Absolutely. So, we have to look at all these different situations, I think, on their own as well as part of bigger trends. QUESTION: Several of the people running against you againstagainst whoever the Democrat is, argue thatargue that we should not be taking in Syrian refugees, but we do, we should prioritize Christian refugees. Jeb Bush has said this, Ted Cruz has said this. And the argument is that they are being persecuted, particularly harshly by ISIS. Why isn\'t that right? CLINTON: Well, I just don\'t think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country. We\'ve hadlast I looked, more than 2 million refugees since 1990. So far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they\'ll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included. Now, this is going to take a long time, I mean, really doing this is hard under any circumstances. Doing it when people are essentially stateless, they don\'t necessarily have documents, it\'s hard to do the vetting, is going to be challenging. Which is, again, why I said in the speech that Congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it. I just don\'t believe that\'s in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn\'t send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world. So, yeah, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant and we have to have a system that does all of that. QUESTION: Let\'s open it up to members of the Council. Let meif somebody wants to put up their hand, identify themselves, and please make sure it is a question, with a question mark at the end, and it be brief. So. QUESTION: Thank you very much for your comments. With respect to TPP, I would like to understand a little bit better why you oppose it, and what changes would perhaps make it acceptable to you? CLINTON: I thinkyou know, there are two problems that I see with it. One the final language of the treaty itself, which I don\'t think went far enough to meet the test that I\'ve always applied to any trade agreementI have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senatordoes it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security? And I think there are enough unanswered questions. It was anit was an extraordinary effort to try to bring these countries together to come up with an agreement, but I think that at the end of the day, for a number of reasons, including that they couldn\'t figure how to get currency into the agreement and it\'s only in a side agreement, I opposed it. The other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so littlebecause of Republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up inagainst their head by globalization. Globalization is real, it\'s happening, it\'s having an impact. We don\'t have a good training program, we don\'t have the kind of support that people need to be able to move into positions where they can acquire new skills. And I see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more Americans to be competitive in the global economy, and I don\'t think we\'ve done that. I want to see that done alongside any trade agreement to a greater extent than the Republicans have been willing to support it. MODERATOR: Ma\'am? QUESTION: Madam Secretary, Amy Bondurant. So importantly, you\'ve recommended that the U.S. lead the air coalition, and I wondered what next steps might be taken to ensure that that would happen. CLINTON: Well Amy, there\'s nothing magic or easy about putting together such a coalition. I know President Hollande will be coming to the United States to see President Obama this week, and I assume that there will be a group of French officials, defense officials, intelligence officials, homeland security officials who will be meeting with their American counterparts. And on the defense side, I think that certainly the United States working with France and then from that, you know, sort of hub beginning to reach out to other countries to seek out support. And I would go back to Arab countries as well. So looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible. You know, going back to Libya, you know, the Europeans were the ones who wanted American support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. And then we reached out and worked with the Arab League so that there would be Arab partners as well, and that took weeks. It wasn\'t something that just happened overnight. But it is definitely doable if we begin, I think, with the French-American position and move out from there. MODERATOR: [off-mike] QUESTION: Terry Whitney, Castle. My understanding was with regard to U.S. support for Syrian rebels over the last year or two, one of the main restraints was that they could not fight Assad directly and that this was a severe limitation and part of the reason the plan didn\'t work. When you recommend supporting additional training for Syrian rebel groups, would you advise them to allow them to fight Assad, or is that a part of the conflict that we don\'t want to get involved in? CLINTON: Well, back in the first term when Leon Panetta and Dave Petraeus and I made our recommendation about vetting and arming Syrian moderate rebels, the target was Assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we\'ve all seen. So that was what we recommended back in the first term. Since then, I know it\'s been a very difficult task for theour government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with. But what happened to some of the few groups that have been trained is that they were quickly overrun by much more hardened fighters who were fighting Assad, so it was ait was a very hard task to do, two or three years later. I think it might have been, but again, I have said many times, I can\'t predict sitting here what would have happened if we moved earlier. It might have worked, it might not have worked. But you can\'t really take Syrians who are rebelling against Assad, and tell them they can\'t use their training and their weapons against the person who, as I said my speech, has killed far more Syrians than ISIS has to date. QUESTION: Let me ask a follow-up on that, Madam Secretary, if the only way you can put together a moderate Syrian force is by having the United States cajole, bribe, arm and train it, we are then looking for this force to defeat ISIS, then defeat Assad, then defeat al-Nusra, then defeat other Al Qaida affiliates, keep at bay the Shiite militias and Hezbollah, take control of Damascus and establish a pluralistic democracy in Syria. Isn\'t that kind of a tall order? [laughter] CLINTON: Well, certainly, described like that. And that\'s why I focused on ISIS. I mean, because I think it\'sI think right now, we have one overriding goal. As I outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between Syria and Turkey. There is not going to be a successful military effort at this point to overturn Assad. That can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on ISIS, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-Nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter. QUESTION: So, no fight against Assad for now? CLINTON: Therewe have to prioritize, and we had an opportunity, perhaps, I won\'t say that it would\'ve worked. But right now, we\'ve got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians and Hezbollah protecting Assad. We need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within Syria will be able to re-create a Syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the Alawites from Damascus the same way it was before the civil war started. QUESTION: There is policy here, but there is also politics. There are, inescapably, people trying to appear tough and tougher. If there were, God forbid, another terrorist attack, God forbid, in the United States, do you think the pressure to send American troops into Syria would be unstoppable? CLINTON: Well, it would certainly grow, but I think it would be a mistake. Look, as I said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in Iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones. We have a lot of work to do to be able to really decimate ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. But we\'ve got to work with the Kurds on both sides of the border, we have got to figure out how to, if possible, have a second Arab Awakening in Anbar Province, get the Sunni tribes to feel that it is their fight again, as they once did. And that requires a lot of political pressure being put on Baghdad. Injecting some large contingent of American forces complicates that, in my opinion. Right now, we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground, and get them to change their priorities and work together.MODERATOR: Final question. QUESTION: Jim Ziren , Madam Secretary. Hi. Back to the no-fly zone. are you advocating a no-fly zone over the entire country or a partial no-fly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven? And in the event of either, do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians? CLINTON: I am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don\'t have to leave Syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians. And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that. You know, the Russians have, as you know, then I primarily focused on Assad\'s enemies and not on ISIS. I think that has changed, and there is an indication that has changed. After Hollande comes here, he\'s going to go to Moscow to see Putin, and Iand as I said earlier, I think getting Russia to play a role in that and getting Assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which Secretary Kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for Syrians so they wouldn\'t have to leave but also for humanitarian relief. And I think that it would give us this extra leverage that I\'m looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria. MODERATOR: We can take one last brief question. Ma\'am? QUESTION: Thank you. (Inaudible.) My question relates to Saudi Arabia. Do you think that the goals that you outlined in the Middle East can be achieved without more cooperation from Saudi Arabia? And if not, how do you think [inaudible] can be convinced to change course? CLINTON: Well, I think that that the Saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the Saudis are now engaged in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is leading, they\'re in the same process as the Iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved. And I think that the Saudis have a multiple level of responsibilities, first and foremost, stopping their own citizens from continuing the financing for extremists. And, you know, Saudi financing is still a major source of revenue for terrorist groups inside Syria, inside Iraq elsewhere. MODERATOR: Includingincluding ISIS, you think? CLINTON: I have no evidence of that, but thereISIS has become quite a self-financing terrorist network with their theft of oil, selling it on the black market with their destruction and seizure of antiquities, selling that on the black market, with their taking over Mosul and raiding the banks. They\'ve got a source of funding, so I don\'t really know. But I know that thethat Saudi individuals have certainly funded other related terrorist groups over time and also exported a lot of Wahhabi radicalism by kicking out or sending out imams and teachers to set up schools and mosques to preach that particularly harsh brand of Islam. So the Saudis have a lot that they can do to both stop and then to help. And that\'s why I said, look, they are legitimately concerned about a takeover in Yemen that butts up against their border. And so, that is why they are expending a lot of money and a lot of military resources, trying to beat back the Houthis, trying to reestablish Hadian government. They have got a lot going on there. But I would hope to draw them into a broader reading of what\'s going on in the region. And you know, for a lot of people, the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide is one of the major reasons for what\'s happening there. It\'s understandable, but the Saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at Iran\'s influence inside Syria, their growing influence in Iraq as well as in Yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least Northern Syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the Civil War. And I hope they will be more willing to be involved. MODERATOR: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for giving us your time. [applause] CLINTON: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 1, 2015",b'Interview with Charlie Rose',"b'ROSE: She is a former first lady, a former senator from New York and a former United States secretary of state. Now Hillary Clinton is running for president. The Democratic frontrunner sat down with me for a wide-ranging conversation at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. She talked about her plans to fight ISIS and remove Syria\'s Bashar al-Assad, the challenges of dealing with Russia, with China and with the problem of climate change and thisthe role of the United States in a rapidly changing world. From a balcony overlooking the White House, she told me how she hoped fix the dysfunction in Washington and what being president is all about. ROSE: There is the seat of power in America, the White HousePennsylvania Avenue down the road. They seem to be in conflict. There seems to be gridlock. Can Hillary Clinton make a difference? Because Barack Obama thought he could. CLINTON: Right. Right. ROSE: And he didn\'t. CLINTON: WellROSE: I know. It\'s not personal with him. CLINTON: Yes. Right no becauseROSE: Because it takes two to tango. CLINTON: He got a lot done, too, despite. LookROSE: How is he going to do it, though? People want to say to you, how can you stop this conflict? CLINTON: I\'m going to get up every day and work at it. ROSE: That\'s not enough. CLINTON: No, it is true. ROSE: It\'s not enough. CLINTON: It starts with thatCharlie. ROSE: OK. CLINTON: It starts with that and it starts with once again, sort of nurturing relationships. You know, when I was first lady, when I was a senator and when I was secretary of state, I worked across the aisle all the time and sometimes there was only one thing that I could find to work with somebody on because everything else we were at odds over. ROSE: So you say to those Republicans and you say to the new Speaker of the HouseCLINTON: Right. ROSE:?Hillary Clinton will be somebody you can deal with? CLINTON: 100 percent. ROSE: I\'m prepared to reach out to you, I\'ll be down there. CLINTON: Yes. Right. And I will do anything to find common ground but I will also stand my ground. There are some things that are not good for the country. I will not give in on those, but there is a lot of room here to find that common ground and we have to do it. ROSE: Yes. But you know a lot of people think the biggest problem for America is Washington. That\'s the problem. And that\'s partly reflected in some of the politics that we\'re seeing. CLINTON: Yes, that\'s true. But look at the way our founders set it up. They set up the separation of powersROSE: Three branches of government. CLINTON: And they made it really difficult to get things done, and some years it\'s really hard, and we\'re in one of these periods where we have a minority within the other party that doesn\'t believe in compromise, doesn\'t believe in reaching consensusROSE: But there you go attacking them. That\'s not the way to do it. CLINTON: No, no. Nobecause part of what you have to do is make it clear to everyone else who is in that party that there is room for negotiation. And those who do not even believe in the legislative process because they think that they arrived with all the answers and there is nothing that they can learn, maybe there is some ground. I worked with Tom DeLay for heaven\'s sakes on reforming the adoption and foster care system because even though he and I were politically opposites, he cared a lot about foster kids and he and his wife had taken them in. I knew that. I cared about them. So we found that common ground. That is just a 24/7 effort and I will put whatever it takes into doing it. ROSE: Waiting for the plane to come down from New York, a very nice lady said to me, where are you going? I said, I\'m going to talk to Hillary Clinton. She said ask her this one question for me. What can I do to make a difference? That was what she said. CLINTON: That\'s a great question. ROSE: And you must be finding that as you go. CLINTON: I do. ROSE: I would think running for president, and you\'ve done this before. As tough as it is, as sleepless as it is, you get a sense to touch base with the width and breadth of this country. And you get a sense from young to old, you know, how they aspire for a better life. CLINTON: Right. And, you know, there is something so intimate and personal about the encounters you have when you\'re running for office. I did when I was running for the Senate. I do now running for president. Sometimes just 30, 60 seconds people will look into your eyes and they\'ll say, ""I need help"", you know. ""My son is a drug addict and I\'m taking care of his daughter, we have to have more help.\' Or the young man I meet who says ""I\'m taking care of my mother with Alzheimer\'s. I can\'t quit my job but I can\'t afford a caregiver so I take her to work."" And I hear these intimate, personal stories. And it gives, you know, not only real texture to what I\'m thinking about and what I\'m proposing, but it makes it all real, you know, that there are real people out there doing the best they can. And what can she do? Well, maybe there is somebody she can help, you know. Maybe there is a child she can tutor. Maybe there\'s a project to raise funds to send kids to college. Maybe there is just something she can do to contribute to the life that will be better for somebody else. I say in my speeches, and I know it sometimes sounds a little corny, I say, you know, you don\'t expect the presidential candidate to say we need more love and kindness in America, but I\'m saying it because I believe it. We\'ve got to stop demonizing each other. We\'ve got to stop with all of the anger and the terrible sense of alienation and division that is stalking our country. We need to be kinder to one another. We need to put ourselves in each other\'s shoes and walk in them, if you can. So, yes, I mean being president is running the executive branch, doing foreign policy, working with the Congress, but it\'s also being a catalyst for people to feel that they can be their best selves and that we need themROSE: And we\'re in this together. CLINTON:?and that\'s what I want to do. We\'re in this together. Absolutely. [ROSE: This was the first major interview Secretary Clinton has granted since the terror attacks in Paris. We began our conversation with that tragedy and with her strategy to defeat the terror group ISIS.] ROSE: Thank you for doing this. It\'s so great to see you. CLINTON: Great to see you. ThanksCharlie. ROSE: This is the first conversation interview you\'ve had since Paris. What\'s new? What did Paris change for all of us? CLINTON: I think it forced a conversation that is taking place not only in our country and in Europe but in many places across the world about what are the opportunities and the dangers in this very complex time that we\'re living in. and specifically with respect to ISIS I think it has really accelerated a discussion about thousand world is going to deal with not only ISIShow to deny it territorybut also with the whole network radical Jihadism which has taken advantage of that arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia. And then I think finally how are we going to protect ourselves, our friends, our partners in a way that is in keeping with our openness, our values? And so I think it\'s really pushed all of these discussions that you have in the situation room, that you have in lots of places; but now it\'s pushed into the open and it\'s a matter of personal and political debate. ROSE: OK. So with respect to the new urgency, what should the United States do and what would you recommend we do? CLINTON: Well, I gave a speech about this. ROSE: You did it at the Council on Foreign Relations. CLINTON: Council on Foreign Relations because I think it\'s important that we look at it from a broader perspective. Number one, we have to deny them territory with a multi-pronged, multi-national effort, and the United States must lead that effort. ROSE: What does that meanlead? CLINTON: Well, what it means is that we have to do the heavy lifting to get people to make the contributions that they have to make, whether it be aircraft to fly airstrikes against ISIS territory to go after leadership and economic infrastructure. Or putting together the troops on the ground, how we get more equipment and support to the Kurds who have been bearing the brunt of the fighting; how we do everything we can to get the Iraqis not only stand up their army but begin to work with the Sunni tribal leaders as was done successfully back in \'07. ROSE: And what incentive would you offer to the Sunni leaders to get them engaged on the ground so with the addition of American airstrikes you might wage an effective campaign both in Iraq and Syria? CLINTON: Well nothing beats what was tried last time which was cash. Let\'s not turn our nose up at it. ROSE: That\'s General Petraeus. CLINTON: That\'s General Petraeus whom you recently talked with and was very straightforward and said, ""Look, we basically paid the tribal sheiks in Anbar"" and now we would probably continue that across the border into Syria to pull together a fighting force, and it works. And it worked, in part, because of revulsion against the predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, the treatment of everybody at their hands, but it also worked because they were promised that they would have the autonomy and authority to make a lot of decisions within Iraq on their own behalf. And unfortunately, Maliki and his views toward sectarianism slowly but surely undermined all of that. And now you\'ve got the Sunni sheiks, the fighters on the sidelines or, even worse, some of them making common cause with ISIS. ROSE:?which raises an interesting question. Did we lose influence with the Baghdad government because we didn\'t have any remaining troops there? Would that have made a difference in terms of the behavior so that the Sunnis would not be so turned off by Baghdad? CLINTON: Well, I certainly thought we should keep troops there. I advocated for that. The real problem was Maliki. He would not give us what\'s called a status of forces agreement that would provide the protections for American troops that we have to expect anywhere in the world. And despite our best efforts, despite trying to negotiate and bargain with him, other members of his government, even the parliament, we were not able to reach that agreement. And the prior administration, the Bush administration had set a date certain for us to withdraw. So in the absence of an agreement with Maliki, we had to withdraw. Now, that is what he wanted. I mean he made all kinds of promises to the administration which he did not fulfill. ROSE: Was the absence of American troops, did it help lead to the strengthening of ISIS? CLINTON: I wouldn\'t go that far. I think it was the collapse of the internal agreements. Our understanding was that we had help them build up a force that would respect Sunnis, that they would have a place in the Iraqi army, that there was going to be a national guard that would be created, that would, in effect, protect the Sunnis and give them some sense of, you know, autonomy, enabling them to protect themselves. And then, of course, the Kurds, with their ongoing arguments with Baghdad over oil distribution and autonomy. So what Maliki did, and he was the driving force, was to begin to purge the army of Sunni officers, begin to take a hard line against the Kurds and their desire for more autonomy. And so, I really place the blame, such as it can be placed, at Maliki\'s feet. ROSE: What should be the limits of our involvement? CLINTON: Well, I think we have to look at this from several different perspectives. Number one, if we are going to lead a multi-national coalition, we\'re going to still have to take the lead in the air. That is our highest and best use. And even with France picking up at airstrikes, we\'re still, you know, carrying out the vast majority of them. We also need to get those Special Forces that the President has authorized into the arena as soon as possible because they will be able to tell us what more is needed. And, in particular, how do we have better targeting on the ground. We want to go after the ISIS leadership, we want to go after their economic infrastructurehow do we really know what we\'re targeting? ROSE: But General Petraeus, as you mentioned the interview, said to me that we should be embedding at the battalion level and not just Special Forces. CLINTON: Well, we don\'t really haveI couldn\'t tell whether he was meaning the Iraqi army, if we ever get it stood up again. That\'s something we could look at. We have over 3,000 American troops in Iraq trying to do just that, working to essentially undo the damage that Maliki did to the army, try to return it to what it was when American troops left. And I think that, you know, their main missions are train, assist and enable and if, down the road, it appears that we do get them up and willing to take the fight to Mosul and Ramadi and the areas that have to be taken back from ISIS inside Iraq, then there will be a role for Americans to perhaps be a part of advising those army units. We\'re a long way from that. We don\'tand from what I\'m toldeven yet have confidence that we could put them back into the fight. And at the same time, let\'s not forget what we were talking about earlier. We need to be building up a Sunni force, and that will have to operate on a parallel track to the army. ROSE: But many people say we have been talking about this for a while, how do we get the Sunnis involved. There is a new urgency nowCLINTON: Right. ROSE:?and a new emergency now. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: I mean tell me how serious the threat of ISIS is and at what level do we decide we\'ll do anything we have to do to stop them? CLINTON: I think we have to have as our objective their defeat, so what is it you have to do to defeat them? And I think you have to fight them in the air, you have to fight them on the ground and you have to fight them in cyberspace. Now it seems to me there are people both currently serving and retired like General Petraeus who know a lot of the players. And we should be utilizing anyone who has that kind of personal contact because it\'s all relationship based. We need people to go over there and look into the eyes of some of those tribal sheiks who will say you betrayed us, and we\'ll say, no, we didn\'t. When we left we had promises about continuing to pay the Sunni troops and continuing to have an integrated army. And we had promises. They were systematically broken. So let\'s do this again right. You stood against al Qaeda in Iraq because you saw the damage they were doing to your way of life, to your peoplethe oppressive, violent approach that they took. Now you\'re facing an even more barbaric enemy which has more money and now controls territory. We need to get back in the game and we need to help you do that. ROSE: Do we need to make coalition with Russia to do this? CLINTON: Well, I think we need, first of all, to build a coalition of Europeans and Arab states. We have to work withROSE: Don\'t we have that now? CLINTON: Well, we have it, but I would sayROSE: And don\'t we see more participation by the British in terms of proposals to their parliament and the French are clearly energized. CLINTON: Well, the French are energized. The Brits are still waiting to see whether they can be. We do have a number of our European allies who are flying sorties. The Arabs have kind of pulled back and we need to get them reengaged. But with respect to Russia, I am not yet sure what exactly Putin\'s objectives are. We know that he has been bombing a lot of the opposition to Assad. We have to operate on two tracks at one time in a lot of what we\'re doing, as I just was saying in another regard. When it comes to Russia, they have to understand that we are going to go forward with our multi-national, multi-pronged approach. I still believe a no-fly zone is important to try to provide some safe haven on the ground, taking back the Syrian-Turkish border is going to require Turkish help. It\'s going to require the Russians to be at least respectful of our efforts. So we need to be engaged. We are engaged on a military to militaryROSE: There is some communication betweenCLINTON: Absolutely. ROSE:?the defense minister and the secretary of defense. CLINTON: Yes. And we have de-conflicted the airspace that we both are in, so we are not making the mistakes. But what they did invading whether intentionally or unintentionally Turkish airspace after having been warned repeatedly by the TurksROSE: So what do you think? CLINTON: Well, what I think is that they did. ROSE: They invaded on purpose? CLINTON: Well, no, I don\'t knowI said intentionally or unintentionally. But they were on notice to stay back. You know it\'s notyou can make a mistake, but they got so close that a mistake was possible or they just didn\'t care. ROSE: so why did they do that? What is Putin trying to say to the world? CLINTON: Yes, well, I think this probably was not something that came down from the Kremlin. You know, they want to go after those forces that are threatening Assad, some of whom are near the Turkish border. But by invading the airspaceand this is not the first time that they came close to doing it. NATO has issued a warning, the Turks have issued warnings. It showed a disregard for the perspective of others, most particularly the Turks, that it\'s troubling. Now, I think they have been pushed back, and I think that we\'ll be able to have a more realistic conversation with them, which I would urge. ROSE: But isn\'t Putin\'s interest pretty clear? He wants to be relevant. He wants to be a player. He wants to be part of the decision-making that takes place about Syria and he wants to say to the world Russia is important in the Middle East againCLINTON: Right. ROSE:?and he\'s accomplished that. CLINTON: Well, he has certainly staked a claim to it. But whether he\'s accomplished or not is not clear. Because here\'s what also what has to happenanother one of these dual tracks there, Charlie. We need to get over the false choice between either going after Assad or going after ISIS. ROSE: Yes. Help us understand that because everybody is talking about that. CLINTON: Yes. ROSE: How do you do both? Well, I think you do both by making it clear and bringing the Russians in. You know, The Russians have now paid a big price because of the bomb in their jet coming from Sharm el-Sheikh. So they\'ve lost people to ISISright. I think you say, look, we need, your if not your active help, your acquiescence in what we\'re going to do going after ISIS. So that means you\'re going to have to pull back from this area while we go after their leadership and their economic infrastructure. But if you want to be part of that, we would welcome you. You have a dog in this hunt now because you\'re worried about what\'s happening in the Caucasus. You\'re worried about ISIS spreading its ideology. At the same time we have to accelerate the political and diplomatic efforts and this is what Secretary Kerry is trying to doin Vienna and everywhere. CLINTON:?in Vienna and everywhere and there has to be more willingness on the part of Russia and Iran to take a hard look at how we prioritize. Right now we\'re not going to see a military defeat of Assad. That\'s not going to happen. It might have been possible a few years ago. It\'s not going to happen now. You\'re going to continue to see Russia from the air, Iran from the ground where Iranian soldiers are dying on behalf of Assad. You\'re going to see them continue to try to hold the territory they have and push back against the opposition. So part of what we have to do is say, look, you\'ve got to help us get to a political and diplomatic solution and you\'ve got to either get out of the way or come on board with respect to ISIS, and we have to be very clear about that. And this should be a full-throated effort. ROSE: And you have to convince Assad, who\'s your client almost, that your time is limited. CLINTON: And that there will be a transition. ROSE: Right. CLINTON: Now, knowing the Russians and the Iranians who have a lot invested in Assad, this is a long process. It\'s not going to won\'t happen overnight. But if they will in their own mind, say quit bombing the people who are helping us fight ISIS, go ahead and put a cordon around the area that Assad still controls, protect him there while we do the diplomatic and political work. ROSE: Someone people would like to ask you this question. I mean we had the 3:00 phone call during a previous campaignwhat would you do. And so the question becomes, if there is a no-fly zone, which you\'re advocating, and the Russians invade that no-fly zone, would President Clinton say shoot it down if you give it warning? CLINTON: Charliethat would not happen because we\'re going to put up a no-fly zone where the Russians are clearly kept informed. I want them at the table. They don\'t have to participate in it but I want them to understand that there have to be safe areas on the ground. If we can stop hundreds of thousands of more Syrians leaving Syria because they get to a place where they can get medical aid and food and the like, that\'s good for Russia. Why does Russia want this incredible burden that is going to be coming up through Europe and, yes, maybe they are happy to see Europe suffering like this but, in the end, it makes no sense for them and makes no sense for all of us. And so I think you\'ve got to have that conversation. Look, it\'s never easy with the Russians and particularly hard with Putin, but if you say, as I think you should and as I think the conversation needs to get to an operational level. And then, at the same time, a conversation with Putin about what our options truly are, I think you can say to him, we\'re going to put up this no fly zone. You will know very well where it is because it\'s going to be the same people who are working now to de-conflict airspaceROSE: Yes. CLINTON: The same Americans you\'re dealing with on a mill to mill level but we have got to figure out how to keep more Syrians in Syria and frankly it\'s good for the fight against ISIS if we\'ve got population that then can be a locus for that. ROSE: A no-fly zone is one wayone place where you and the President disagree on policy with respect to Syria. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: Are there others in which there is a difference? We saw what you said at the Council on Foreign Relations. We saw the interview he did in Turkey. You seemed to be similarly responding to what the situation is. Where else do you differ in addition to no-fly zones? CLINTON: Well, look, I think the President has said that perhaps we should have taken some additional steps earlier. But the real question isROSE: That goes back to the point when you and Petraeus and others were recommending more in 2011. CLINTON: Right, yes. But now the important issue is what do we do now? And I think I\'m arguing for perhaps a greater, quicker intensification of the work that I think needs to be done. I agree with the President\'s point that we\'re not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq. We are not going to do that. ROSE: Under no circumstances would you not do that? CLINTON: Well, at this point, I cannot conceive of any circumstances where I would agree to do that because I think the best way to defeat ISIS is, as I\'ve said, from the air which we lead; on the ground which we enable, empower, train, equip; and in cyberspace where, don\'t forget, they are a formidable adversary online. So what I want to say is, look, we don\'t know yet how many Special Forces might be needed, how many trainers and surveillance and enablers might be needed, but in terms of thousands of combat troops like some on the Republican side are recommending, I think that should be a non-starter. And it should be a non-starter both because I don\'t think it\'s the smartest way to go after ISIS. I think it gives ISIS a new recruitment tool if we get back in the fight. Whereas if we are equipping and supporting the Kurds, if we get the Sunni tribes back in the fight, then we can do a lot to make sure that works. ROSE: Let me take you to another timeLibya. You were a strong if not the strongest proponent of the U.S. and the French and others going to protect Benghazi at a time that it faced almost certain attack by Gadhafi leading to, as he said, massacre in the streets. Was that a mistake when you look at what has happened since in Libya? CLINTON: First of all, it\'s important to remember that the Libyans themselves held two successful free and fair elections. You know how hard that is after conflict, after 42 years when every institution has been hollowed out? The Libyan people rose to the occasion. They voted for moderates. Then, unfortunately, there was a lot going on in the region that was not necessarily in the control of anybody but which had a big impact on Libya. ROSE: So I have two questions about that. First question is I think you were going toI mean is there some lesson we need to learn and that may be applicable to Syria, don\'t get rid of a strong man until you have somebody that can come in there because you do not want chaos and you do not want the kind of circumstance in Libya because what you have in Libya now is an increasing force of ISIS. CLINTON: Well, in one part of Libya. Yes, let me address that because it\'s a totally fair question. Gadhafi had American blood on his hands. Gadhafi was a threat to the broader region. Our European and Arab friends certainly saw him as that and as you say he was promising to track down his own people and kill them like cockroaches. My point was that with his demise, there was a coalition that rose up. They did hold elections. They were prepared to begin forming a government and there was a lot of pressure coming at them from extremists in all directions. And some of the old attitudes like the split between Tripoli and Benghazi; between, you know, east and west began to assert themselves. I believe that right now there is an ongoing effort by the U.N. and others the U.S. is supporting to try to form a unity government, to try to get people once again to get back to working together. The problem, is we see advances by ISISthey\'re not the only terrorist groupROSE: Sure. CLINTON:?but ISIS now claims that they have really taken control of Sirte, which happens to be Gadhafi\'s hometown. I think one of the ways we need to approach this is continue the discussions about national unity but, as a pre-condition, say we need to join together right now before they get a stronghold and work to eliminate ISIS in Sirte, and it is something that is going to require a lot of cooperation. There are armed groups that are fighting for power within Libya that are not in any way identified with or allied with ISIS. They need to form even a loose confederation to try to push ISIS literally into the sea before they get a stronghold. There are a lot of other bad actors, don\'t get me wrong, bad actors who have taken upROSE: But could this also be part of the way the President thinks about things now? I mean we go in with great intentions, we help participate in the Arab Spring. It was their revolt, not ours. And we end up with where it\'s not successful, democracy does not emerge and you end up with, in some cases, failed states or states that seem to be on the verge of becoming failed states. And, so, it\'s just not a place for America to be. CLINTON: Again, I think it\'s dangerous to make these sweeping generalizations. Look at how valiantly the Tunisians are struggling. ROSE: They\'re the big exception. CLINTON: They\'re the big exception because they\'re a relatively small country and they\'ve worked really hard to get everybody under a tent, so to speak, and get them organized. Libya has pockets of functioning government, but they are not united, and it may well be very difficult to unite them because there has been historical rivalry between them. But we\'re talking about four years. You know we have a very quick time tableROSE: I know. We didn\'t create democracy overnight. CLINTON: We did not, no. And nobody that I know relay has. That\'s not to say there is not dangers. And I do think if we could turn the clock back, if there had been a way, and we tried, to convince the Libyans to take more help, not just from Americans but from Europeans with whom they had preexisting relationships or even others that might have come to support themthe Scandinavians, for examplehelp them do more. They were so proud and they were so resistant to having security forces on their territory. They were even resistant to having foreigners come and help them figure out how better to run their oil industry. They had a lot of really smart people who had been expats for decades, they came home and they wanted to do it themselves. If there had been a way that we could have better partnered with them, supported them, maybe it would have made a difference. But this is a long-term prospect that you have to be looking at. ROSE: Speak to this. I mean we\'re looking at a world that\'s changing rapidly. I mean you\'ve got China soon to become the biggest economy in the world and whatever their ambitions are. You have the Middle East which is close to exploding in some cases, some would suggest you have the Russians involved, you\'ve got others involved. How do we make our way in a sort of New World order and what is our role to do that? CLINTON: Well, I think our role is to lead. You know, the absence of American leadership is not somebody else\'s leadership. ROSE: But they saylet me interrupt -- CLINTON: Nothing. ROSE: OK. But some argue that there has been a vacuumthat America has not been leading. CLINTON: Well, then we should get about the business of leading. If that is a perception, we need to rid the perception. ROSE: Who knows better than that than you? I mean there is a perception that we were not prepared to lead. CLINTON: Well, look, I think it is a veryROSE: And a vacuum was created. CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s a very complex set of circumstances, and it\'s important to look short-term, medium-term, long-term, right? I remember in some of the arguments I had in the White House over Mubarak. And you know, there was a lot of excitement about Mubarak falling. I was one of the skeptics, right, because what was going to replace him? Yes, had he been a heavy-handed authoritarian? He had. But what was the alternative? And I remember saying, you know, this may look great in 25 years, but between now and then, there is a lot of trouble for the Egyptians, the region and us. And so I think you have to be constantly balancing what is the best decision you can make today, how do you think about what comes next, what are the consequences you\'re either trying to promote or prevent, and then what are the long-term challenges and how do we get prepared for those? I mean it sounds easy to say. It\'s very difficult to do. And I think, look, when I became Secretary of State, Osama bin laden was alive and with his lieutenants plotting against us. Iran was on a fast track to a nuclear weapon. We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and our alliances were incredibly frayed, Charlie. You know, it\'s important to remember that, in 2009, our big challenges were seemingly as difficult as the ones we\'re talking about now. So all these years laterROSE: Compounded by economic problems. CLINTON:?compounded by a terrible great recession that could have become a great depression. And so we worked our way out of that. I don\'t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for literally saving the economy from a much worse fate. Bin laden is dead. Al Qaeda is still alive. It\'s on, you know, maybe life support, but it\'s still alive. It\'s still kicking. It still is inspirational. We have to keep our eye on it. We can\'t just focus on ISIS. We have to be aware of al Qaeda\'s continue maneuvering. We did reach an agreement that put a lid on Iran\'s nuclear weapon program which could have led to a conflagration in the Persian Gulf. Not maybe started by us but in which we might very well haveROSE: OK, but that did not speak to Iranian behavior. CLINTON: No butit wasn\'t meant to. ROSE: I understand that. I understood that. I am not suggesting it should have been. CLINTON: Yes, right. ROSE: I am suggesting that Iranian behavior is going to be an issue for the next president. CLINTON: Absolutely. And I\'ve been saying thisagain, I gave a big speech about what I will do as president and to deal with enforcing the agreement, because there are a lot of important details, and the Iranians have to know right from the beginning that they will pay a price, that there will be consequences for any misbehavior or breaches. And that we have to now turn our attention to dealing with their other bad behaviorstill exporting terrorism, destabilizing other regimes. So, yes, there is a bucket of problems that we have to deal with that the Iranians are posing. ROSE: But how do we deal with those problems because they are part ofCLINTON: Charlie, I would rather deal with those with the nuclear program. ROSE: I\'m not arguing about the nuclearCLINTON: No, but this is a big deal because what the nuclear program literally under lid, so to speakROSE: Right. CLINTON: Now, it\'s not so, you know, important that we stay as focused. We have to enforce the agreement but we\'re not spending all our time and effort dealing with their nuclear program which they really got under fast track when Bush was president and we had to deal with it. Now we have to look at all their other bad behavior and we have to have the same kind of patient, strategic planning that went in to the agreement. You know, I started putting together the coalition to impose the sanctions within the first month of being in the secretary of state\'s office. It takes time. I had to convince the Russians and the Chinese. I had to convince the Europeans, especially the southern Europeans to give up oil and gas from Iran. This was a long struggle, basically, but it was diplomacy that was day by day which reached results. Now we\'ve got to take a look and say, OK, what is it we have to do? Well, clearly, we\'ve got to keep forces in the Persian Gulf. We\'ve got to do a better job dealing with our Gulf partners who I think are very short-sighted in failing to cooperate with one another, to deal with some of the threats. ROSE: Yes, but I mean for many of our gulf partners, Iran is the biggest enemy there is. I mean it\'s part of the Sunni-Shia split in the region. CLINTON: Of course it is. Of course it is. ROSE: And that\'s why they want to get rid of Assad who is supported by the Iranians as you know. CLINTON: And he\'s an Alawites which is, you know, an off shoot of Shiism. Yes, we get all of that. But the good news out of the Iran agreement, as far as we know, they are not pursuing their own nuclear weapons right now. And that was a very real threat. They understood that the agreement was better than they thought it would be, so they, too, can turn their attention to the rest of this bad behavior because what our big fear was, not only that we\'d get a war over trying to prevent Iran from going forward with this program even if it was only two or three years, but that we would see a wicked race to proliferation in the Gulf. ROSE: And this deal should stop that? CLINTON: At least for the years that it\'s in effect, as long as we enforce it. ROSE: This conversation part is about American leadership. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: You suggested over the weekend I think that America should lead at the climate conference in Paris. CLINTON: Yes. ROSE: How should America lead there and what are your expectations? CLINTON: Well, I give kudos to the President. I think given the hand he was dealt by this congress and the difficulty in trying to come up with a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own country, he has played that hand very well. I mean a lot of the EPA moves, a lot of the Department of Transportation on greater mileage from cars and trucks and vehicles, I think he goes to Paris in a strong position to be able to say, look, we all have to come and agree. ROSE: Right. CLINTON: He also comes with a commitment for the United States to do more on innovation and moving more quickly toward clean energy, and he comes with the great philanthropic commitment of Bill Gates. ROSE: Do you think he\'ll be successful? Yes, $100 million. CLINTON: Yes, yes. ROSE: You think so. You think we\'ll find some progress because there is a sense of almost the urgency that we are talking about with respect to the Middle East? CLINTON: Well, in many ways, Charlie, I mean the Middle East is a terrible, complex human problem. And it drives you crazy because you keep saying to yourself, if these people would only stop this, they could build economies, they could have so much to contribute to the world. So you rack your brain about this. Climate change is such a consequential crisis to everybody in the world. And it is a great shame to the entire human race, but particularly to the advanced economies such as ours, that we haven\'t made common cause to try to reverse or at least stabilize the temperature increase. And I\'m really hoping that we get a good result out of Paris, and I think what the Chinese have done is really smart. You know, when President Obama and I crashed into their meeting in \'09 in Copenhagen, they were not happy to see us. ROSE: Where are the Chinese?? Where are the Chinese? CLINTON: Yes. But they did agree to begin voluntary recording and accountability. Now they\'ve come with I think a 900-page report and they\'ve said look, we have a lot of work to do, because they can\'t breathe the air, their water is polluted. Their land is polluted. They have said, OK, we\'re going to deal with this. But you know what the real trick here is? They\'re going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. ROSE: Unless? CLINTON: Unless we get there first or unless we are partners. ROSE: It takes money as well does it not? CLINTON: It takes money but they\'re going tothey\'re going to make big investmentsROSE: Innovation and creativity. CLINTON:?in solar, in wind, and everything else. And then they\'re going to be exporting and they\'re going to be controlling that market unless we understand there is a huge economic opportunity that goes hand in hand with climate change. ROSE: Let me ask you about trade, too. CLINTON: Yes. ROSE: I mean how importantwe have a vote coming up in Congress. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: Would you encourageI mean trade is an important aspect. You were very strongly in favor of the trade agreement. CLINTON: Well, I was in favor of the high hopes and standards for it. Right. ROSE: That\'s fair enough. You understand the importance of trade. CLINTON: Yes, of course I do. We\'re 5 percent of the world\'s population. If we\'re going to grow, we have to sell to the other 95 percent. I absolutely understand that. But here are two problems. One, I\'ve had the same criteria for judging trade agreements for years. I voted for some and I voted against a big multi-national one when I was in the senate. ROSE: But you were really in favor of this one? CLINTON: No. It hadn\'t even been negotiated. ROSE: That\'s the impression though as you know. CLINTON: Well, I can\'t help what impressions are. What I said from the beginning is it has to produce more good paying jobs for Americans. It has to raise Americans\' wages and it has to be in furtherance of our national security. So when it came out, you know, none of us saw the details until it was actually produced some few months ago. In my opinion, it didn\'t meet those standards. And so I said I\'m against it. Now, I\'m not against all trade, but I am against certain provisions of this, including the failure to integrate currency manipulation into the enforceable body of the agreement. But there is another point I just want to quickly make which is, you know, the Republicans are always for every trade agreement. Trade if it\'s going to be successful for the American worker, the American business, has to be more than just special deals for giant multi-national corporations who have some linkage to America. And the Republicans have blocked every effort to raise the minimum wage, better training, apprenticeship programs, make education more affordable. They have blocked every effort to try to make sure American workers were as prepared as possible to compete and win in the global economy. So, for me, the trade agreement on the merits is not one I can support and the failure to kind of make the other side of the equation fair so that more Americans will get the skills they need to be able to compete, you know, just makes it a decision that I\'m not ready to take now. ROSE: Would you encourage Democratic members of the Congress to vote against it? CLINTON: I have stated my position, you know. If anybody wants to talk to me, they\'re welcome to call me but I have stated my position and I will let the Congress work its will. ROSE: You announced a significant idea about infrastructure. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: Why has it taken this country so long to deal with infrastructure? What\'s the problem? CLINTON: Well, the problem Charlie is that the Republicans don\'t want to pay for anything. You know, when I was in the Senate, I was on the committee that was responsible for writing the bill, the Highway Transportation Bill. It was hard because we had a lot of back and forth, but we came out with a bill, we got it done. There has not been a bill that has actually come out for years now. And, so the congress is in the middle of arguing about whether or not they can get a highway bill. But they don\'t want anybody to pay anything for it. And so, they don\'t want to use user fees. They don\'t want any kind of fee that could be construed as a tax, OK.  [crosstalk] CLINTON: At some point, you know, we are crumbling. I mean every independent assessment says the same thing. We have a failing grade or maybe at the most a D-minusROSE: And putting our citizens at risk. CLINTON: Well, and costing the money. You know, in a lot of places in this country, people pay a lot to fix axles and wheels and other things that are damaged by potted and deteriorating roads. We have a lot of bridges that if you had a choice you wouldn\'t cross because they\'re not in good shape. Our airportswe don\'t have a single airport in the top 20 airports in the entire world. The closest we get is Cincinnati at 30. I mean we have watched over deterioration, to say nothing of what you can\'t see. Under the ground, you know, in New York we have water mains and sewer mains and gas linessome of them are blowing up and some of them are cracking. ROSE: So did we miss an opportunity during the first four years of the Obama administration to do more? CLINTON: Well, we did as much as the Congress would let the administration do. The Recovery Act had ""Build America"" bonds. They had money going in to all kinds of construction. We could have done a lot more and we would be better off if we had. ROSE: This campaign is about middle class economic future. CLINTON: Right, right. ROSE: Do you recommend cutting middle class taxes? CLINTON: Well, not raising them, certainly. ROSE: No, but didn\'t you say you\'re in favor of cutting them? CLINTON: Well, I\'m in favor of giving specific tax credits and breaks so that middle class families can meet some of their obligations. So for example, you know, more help on childcare, more help on care giving like taking care of an elderly relative with Alzheimer\'s. Making sure we keep tax credits for education. So in effect those are cutting taxesnot an across-the-board cut. They are tied to certain activities, you know, activities or services that middle class people need. ROSE: But do you also urge raising income taxes on wealthy individuals? CLINTON: On you and me? Yes. ROSE: Yes. You and I\'m included. True CLINTON: Sorry. ROSE: And I\'m willing. CLINTON: Yes. No, really. I mean it isthe tax system truly is stacked for those on the top, and it is something that breeds so much resentment and grievance on the part of small businesses, on the part of hard-working people and, you know, the wealthy pay too little and middle class people pay too much and we\'ve got to get a better balance. We do need revenues. I\'m not somebody who says we don\'t. I just want to start with the people who actually can contribute more and make the tax system fair in the process. ROSE: And what about corporate tax? CLINTON: We\'re going to have to take a hard look at it because right now we have a very high rate but the effective rate hardly ever reaches that. ROSE: I know. There is over 35 percent. At the same time, I think the average is about 18 or 20 percent. CLINTON: Yes. And some get away with nothing. ROSE: Yes. CLINTON: And solook, I don\'t want to stifle American entrepreneurialism. I don\'t want to stifle American business, but I want to change the incentives. That\'s why when I rolled out my economic plans I said, look, I want strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth. And the long-term growth may be the most important piece. I\'ll tell you just a very quick story. There was a survey done where CEOs of major American corporations were asked this question. If you knew an investment you could make today would pay off down the road by investing in plant and equipment, research and experimentation or worker training, but it would knock a penny off your share price, would you do it? And to a person, they said, no, we can\'t, we can\'t do it. I actually called up someone we both know to say, seriously? Absolutely. It makes me sick to say was the response, but, no, we can\'t, we will get hammered, we will be putting a big target on our chest for the activist shareholders. We can\'t do it. Now, we must change those incentives. We need more patient capital. We need more investments at home. ROSE: How about payroll tax. CLINTON: Well, you know, the payroll taxesROSE: I don\'t knowwhat? CLINTON: I don\'t think it\'s that big a deal. ROSE: Is that right? CLINTON: No because, you know, President Obama suspended it, nobody even noticed because we have to fund social security. That\'s a different issue. ROSE: Wouldn\'t that put money in the pockets right away of the middle class? CLINTON: It did but it wasn\'tit was not something that people really valued if youfrom what IROSE: Politically or economically? CLINTON: Apparently both from the research that I\'ve seen. ROSE: Speaking of corporations. Pfizer, Allerganmerger, move to Ireland, reduce your tax rate. CLINTON: Right. Right. ROSE: They say, meaning they will be able to have more money to spend because they\'re not paying big taxes to develop new drugs. They say it\'s in the interest of the public. CLINTON: I never know what to make of these kinds of comments. Personally, I was deeply distressed by the Pfizer decision. And I know, for instance, that drug companies spend more money on advertising than they do on research in our country. And so when they say, oh, we\'re going to be able to spend more money on research, I would love to know the numbers. I find that hard to buy. I think there is a certain gamesmanship associated with it which I find really regrettable, you know. It\'s, like, OK, if we can beat the systemand Ireland has had this big welcome sign, you know, we\'re going to go down as low as we canROSE: Right. CLINTON:?I mean the rest of Europe is annoyed, the United States is annoyed, but I don\'t think inversions should be legal and I know that the Justice Department and Treasury Department have looked at those. I don\'t think they should be. ROSE: The President said they\'re unpatriotic. CLINTON: Well, they are. I mean truly, when you think about it, I mean Pfizer is a New York company. That\'s where its roots have been. And obviously, as time went by, it employed fewer people but it\'s always been an American flagship company. And for them to say, you know, this is just really a gamebecause if you listen to it, you know, how many executives are actually going to move to Dublin? No, they\'re going to move virtually. They\'re going to move, you know, the button you press on your computer to say this is where intellectual property now lives, you know, apparently in a castle outside of Dublin. ROSE: They\'re not going to pick up their factories and goCLINTON: Well no. They don\'t have that many left and I\'m sure they have a global reach on that. But it\'s really a kick in the teeth. I mean this country has done more to inspire this kind of innovation than any place in the world. ROSE: OK. But you have a lot of companies like Apple, for example, have a lot of money overseas. CLINTON: Right. ROSE: And they say, you know, make it moregive us some amnesty, do something, and we\'ll bring that money home. What would you say? CLINTON: We\'ll have to look at all of that. I mean yes. But let me tell youwe did repatriate when I was in the Senate, OK, under George W. Bush. We repatriated, they said the same thing to us. And I know I had a parade of people coming inCEOs and CFOs saying we really need to do this and when we get the money back, we\'re going to do x, y, z. And what did they do? They bought back shares. They increased the dividendsROSE: And stock pricestock prices were up. CLINTON:?and they put more money into CEO pay and bonus. George W. Bush is on record as saying he would never have supported at the end because they all lied us to. So if we\'re going to do a repatriation, it\'s going to have to be rock solid and very clear about where that money goes and what it\'s used for. Now, I think we have to look at the entire corporate code. I don\'t want to preside over an exodus of American companies. I want people coming here to invest. I want people, you know, building the next generation of whatever it isclean energy, technology, you name it. So I want to be a good president for business, but I also want to be a good president for everybody in America, not just for, you know, CEOs and activist shareholders. ROSE: Have you suffered from the fact that they say you\'re too close to Wall Street? Has that hurt your image, in your judgment, running for president? CLINTON: I don\'t think so. I mean lookROSE: Not in favor of corporate regulations as she should be, says Elizabeth Warren. CLINTON: Well, all I know is that it was in 2007 that I called out Wall Street on the use of securities to, you know, play the mortgage market and called them out on the hedge fund loophole for carried interest. I have been very outspoken on this. And I have stood for a lot of regulation on big banks and on the financial services sector. I also represented New York and represented everybody from the dairy farmers, you know, to the fishermen. ROSE: From Wall Street to the dairy farmers. CLINTON: Yeseverybody. And so yes, do I know people and did I help rebuild after 9/11? Yes, I did but -- ROSE: And did you take money from them, they would say. CLINTON: Yes, but that has nothing to do with my position. Anybody who thinks that they can influence me on that ground doesn\'t know me very well. And these guys know me and they, you knowROSE: Would you say the same thing when you see these reports about the foundation and money from the foundation while you were secretary of state, people were coming in to yourCLINTON: It\'s ludicrous. I mean it\'s ludicrous. I mean there\'s no there, there but the fact is I saw a lot of people when I was secretary of state and I worked really hard to increase exports from American businesses. I saw a lot of business people, I saw a lot of union leaders. I saw as many people as I could fit in the day who needed something from their government. You know, somebody wouldFred Smith would call me up from FedEx and say the Chinese government is taking away our permits. We have been in China for decades doing Federal Express. Or Corning, a company that I knew well from my time in the senatethey\'re trying to put a tariff on us that is going to drive us out of business. You know, I worked really hard to get more jobs for Americans, and that meant representing big business and small business and everybody in between. ROSE: Do we need to regulate Wall Street more thanCLINTON: We do. That\'s why I have probably the toughest, most comprehensive plan and it goes way beyond Glass-Steagall. It is much broader than that. It looks at shadow banking. It looks at all of the parts of the financial markets that influenced what happened in \'08 but are not big banks like AIG, like Lehman Brothers. And Paul Krugman says I have the best plan. And Sherrod Brown who is a very toughROSE: Senator from Ohio. CLINTON:?critic of the banks thinks I have the best plan. ROSE: Right, OK. Why do you want to be president? I mean you have had a remarkable life. CLINTON: Yes, I have. ROSE: You have been in the White House. There it is over there. CLINTON: There it is, right. Well, I\'m not doing it to move back in, although it\'s a wonderful place. ROSE: So why are you doing it? I mean you knowis it about history? Is it about the first woman? CLINTON: No, no. I mean that would all be an extra added part of it. But for me, I really love this country and I think this will be one of those watershed elections where we\'re either going to get the economy to work for everybody or we are going to see increasing inequality and unfairness in a way that we haven\'t seen since, you know, the 1920s. We\'re either going to figure out how to live together despite all of our differences, show respect for people, enforce human rights, civil rights, women\'s rights, gay rights, workers\' rights or we\'re going to really have the balance shift dramatically against the kind of democracy that I believe in that I think works best for America and we\'re either going to lead around the world or we\'re going to take a back seat and pay a big price for it. So there is a lot at stake in this election and, you know, the Republicans are certainly spurring me on because of what they say and how they say it and their values which are so negative and really mean-spirited in lots of ways. So I believe that we\'ve got to wage and win an election about the future and the kind of country we want to have for, you know, my grandchild. ROSE: How is she doing? CLINTON: She\'s great. We had Thanksgiving with her. It was marvelous. ROSE: Thank you for coming. CLINTON: Thank you. ROSE: Pleasure to see you. CLINTON: Good to talk to you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 6, 2015","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b'STEPHANOPOULOS: And we\'ll hear more on that from the president tonight. Let\'s get more on it now from Secretary Hillary Clinton, back on THIS WEEK for the first time this presidential campaign. And a reminder for everyone watching, I worked for President Clinton, made charitable contributions in the past to the Clinton Foundation. Welcome back. CLINTON: Thanks, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it time to declare war on ISIS? CLINTON: Look, we are definitely in conflict with ISIS and I think we need a new update of military authorization. The AUMF, which was passed after the attack on 9/11, should be brought up to... STEPHANOPOULOS: Why not declare war? CLINTON: Well, declare war is a very legal term, as you know so well. I think what we want to do is make sure we have every tool at our disposal to, number one, destroy there would-be caliphate in Syria and in Rain Iraq. Number two, do everything we can to dismantle this very effective virtual jihadist network that they are using on the Internet. And number three, do whatever is necessary to protect us here at home. STEPHANOPOULOS: What are you concerned about in the declaration of war? CLINTON: Well, I think that the legal experts say that if wethere are a lot who say that we already have the authority we need to go after ISIS or any international terrorist network, including al Qaeda and anybody else in the AUMF. I think it is important, though, for the Congress to vote on behalf of the American people and to make sure that we are updating it to take into account the new authorities that that risks. STEPHANOPOULOS: You putyou\'ve also been reluctant to say we\'re fighting radical Islam. And I wonder why not. Isn\'t it a mistake not to say it plain, that the violence is being pushed by radical elements in that faith? CLINTON: Well, that\'s a different thing. Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions, I\'m fine with that. I say it all the time and I go after Islamic, too. STEPHANOPOULOS: So what\'s the problem with radical Islam? CLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion. And that, to me, is, number one, wrong but... STEPHANOPOULOS: Even though the qualifier radical is there? CLINTON: No, because, look, thatyou know enough about religion, you\'ve studied it. And there are radicals, people who believe all kinds of things in every religion in the world. I don\'t want to do that because, number one, it doesn\'t do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people. Number two, it helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying we\'re in a war against the West. You must join us. If you are a Muslim, you must join us. No. If you\'re a law-abiding, peace-loving Muslim, you need to be with us against those who are distorting Islam. STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you say today that we\'re winning the fight against ISIS? CLINTON: I could say today that we have a new set of threats. You know, ifif you go back and look where we were with al Qaeda in 9/11, there\'s no doubt bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning to carry out additional attacks, if they possibly could. And they did in places like Madrid and London, etc. So we have dealt with that threat. It doesn\'t go away. We haven\'t eliminated it, but we\'ve dealt with it. Now, we have to turn our attention to the very sophisticated propagation of this new threat from ISIS. STEPHANOPOULOS: So we\'re not winning that battle yet? CLINTON: Well, we\'re not winning but it\'s too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do. And I\'ve outlined very clearlySTEPHANOPOULOS:so if youCLINTON:we have to fight them in the air. We have to fight them on ground and we have to fight on the Internet. And we have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world to protect ourselves. STEPHANOPOULOS: If you were in the Oval Office tonight, would you be announcing a new strategy? CLINTON: Well, I think whatthat\'s what we\'ll hear from the president, an intensification of the existing strategy and I think there\'s some additional steps we have to take. If you look at the story about this woman and maybe the man, too, who got radicalized, self-radicalized, we\'re going to need help from Facebook and from YouTube and from Twitter. They cannot permit the recruitment and the actual direction of attacks or the celebration of violence by this sophisticated Internet user. They\'re going to have to help us take down these announcements and these appeals[crosstalk]they get up. STEPHANOPOULOS: How about Apple? No more encryption? CLINTON: This is something I\'ve said for a long time, George. I have to believe that the best minds in the private sector, in the public sector could come together to help us deal with this evolving threat. And you know, I know what the argument is from our friends in the industry. I respect that. Nobody wants to be feeling like their privacy is invaded. But I also know what the argument is on the other side from law enforcement and security professionals. So, please, let\'s get together and try to figure out the best way forward. STEPHANOPOULOS: Some of your potential rivals on the Republican side say we have to do more overseas as well. Ted Cruz says we have to carpet bomb ISIS. CLINTON: Well, that\'s an easy thing to say, you know. He\'s never had any responsibility for trying to figure out who the bad guys are and who innocent civilians are. Clearly we have to have a much more robust air campaign against ISIS targets, against the oil infrastructure, against their leadership. I think you\'ll hear that from the president. And part of what I have been arguing for, for quite some time now, is that we\'ve got to do a better job of getting back the Sunnis on the ground, along with the Kurds, who can be the fighters who will actually take back territory with air cover and with targeted attacks on ISIS infrastructure. We still are going to have to have people fighting. Now I do not believe those should be American combat troops[crosstalk] STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not; is that an absoluteCLINTON: Where I sit right now, I think it would make things worse not better; I do believe we have to up our special ops numbers. The 50 that have been authorized need to get there. And then we need to take stock of what else we need. I think the more than 3,000 Americans that we have on the ground in Iraq, who are advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi military have to be given the flexibility and support they need. And I believe strongly we should perhaps ask some of our current and retired military officers, who dealt with the Sunni sheikhs in Anbar and elsewhere to once again reconstitute the fighting force that they put into the fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq. And that was one of my biggest complaints about Maliki, because what he did was to basically not only destroy the military because of his sectarianism but also he went after those Sunni leaders in Anbar and we know from reporting that some of them are supportive of ISIS, some of the former Ba\'ath military officers under Saddam Hussein. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, some of your Republican rivals have also criticized you for focusing on gun control after the San Bernardino attacks. Marco Rubio points out that France has some of the strictest gun control in the world. That didn\'t stop the Paris attacks. California has some of the strictest gun control laws here. It didn\'t stop those attacks, either. So what law would have stopped this? CLINTON: Well, first of all, what happened in San Bernardino was a terrorist act. Nobody is arguing with that. The law enforcement, FBI have come to that conclusion. And let\'s not forget, though, a week before we had an American assault on Planned Parenthood and some weeks before that we had an assault at a community college. So I don\'t see these two as in anyway contradictory. We have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home and we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns by people who shouldn\'t get them, mentally ill people, fugitives, felons and the Congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the no-fly list from getting guns, which include a lot of domestic and international terrorists, these are two parts of the same approach that I\'m taking to make us safe. And, yes, the NRA\'s position always is, you know, if you can\'t stop everything, why try to stop anything? That\'s not the way law works. I mean, we have laws that are going to govern our speed limits on roads, knowing some people are going to violate it or people are going to drive drunk. But we still have laws. We need to have comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole, go after what\'s call the Charleston loophole and end the liability for gun sellers. STEPHANOPOULOS: On this no-fly list, the critics of that vote say that you know, you look back at this; it\'s indiscriminate and they go back 10 years and say 2,000 people on the watch list actually did buy guns; government hasn\'t found any of them committing a crime with a gun. CLINTON: Well, again, that\'s like proving the negative. We have a list; if you are on that list and you believe you should not be on that list, we have a process to actually raise your objections about being on that list. You get on the list because there is some credible evidence you belong on the list. Now obviously, thatSTEPHANOPOULOS: Some mistakes sometimes. CLINTON:some mistakes, of course. That\'s why there\'s a process for people to be able to raise their concerns about being on the list and then to have a process that could even lead to a legal action to remove yourself from the list. But I, for one, am a lotI took the shuttle from New York. I\'m a lot happier having a list that keeps people off planes that there\'s any question about their intent or their potential behavior. So I\'m notI can\'t take anybody seriously who\'s going to begin to chip away at the no-fly list. STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump and yesterday Jerry Falwell Jr. say the answer is for more good people to have guns. Mr. Falwell urged his students at Liberty University to actually arm themselves, get concealed carry permits. Your response? CLINTON: Well, he also went onand don\'t forget he said this, George. He said, that way, we can take out the Muslims. He said that, OK? This is the kind of deplorable, not only hateful response to a legitimate security issue but it is giving aid and comfort to ISIS and other radical jihadists. With respect to the gun issue, it\' s legal to buy guns in America if you are eligible to buy a gun, you can go buy a gun and hundreds of thousands of people apparently are in the aftermath of what happened in San Bernardino. I just want people to understand some of the threats we now face, whether it\'s the guy in Charleston, who should have never have been given a gun but the universal background check was not fast enough, didn\'t find the fact he was prohibited, went into the church and killed nine innocent people, we should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of guns. STEPHANOPOULOS: We have to take a quick break. Stand by. Much more from Secretary Clinton later. Another live exclusive, one of the men by the taker on from a Florida governor, Jeb Bush. [commercial break] [begin video clip] JEB BUSH: I think you\'re looking at the next Republican nominee. And here\'sand here\'s what I promised to you, should I win this nomination I will take it to Hillary Clinton and I will whoop her. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Jeb Bush there. Hillary Clinton here right now. And as he\'s hoping, he\'s going to come up live in just a little bit hoping to take you on in the general election if you get the nomination. I want to get into some of the issues that may come up in a general election. One of the things you\'re seeing Republicans really take aim at is your spending and investment programs. CLINTON: Right. STEPHANOPOULOS: On the show right here, proposed about $1 trillion... CLINTON: Over 10 years. STEPHANOPOULOS: Over 10 years in spending proposals that a lot of questions on whether you can actually pay for it by focusing tax increases only on the top 3 percent. Here\'s a Washington Post editorial. They say there is simply no way that the federal government can meet its current fiscal commitments plus the increased demands of an aging population and provide the new forms of middle class relief and business tax relief Mrs. Clinton promises while tapping only the top 3 percent of earners. Your response? CLINTON: Well, I just respectfully disagree. And that\'s why I\'ve laid out very specific plans about the kind of investments that I think Middle Class families particularly need that we have to have to, you know, grow our economy. And I\'ve been very specific about how I will pay for each of those. And that is part of the, you know, underlying principle of presenting the...[crosstalk] But I think it\'s a little bit amusing that the Republican National Committee would go after me, since all of their candidates and their party philosophy is massive spending cuts and massive tax decreases for those at the very top with no thought to how to pay for it or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt, you know. I do come from the Clinton school of economics. And when my husband ended, we had a balanced budget and a surplus. Then President Obama inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I don\'t think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out. So, we\'re standing. And now we\'ve got to start moving into the future again. It is going to take good fiscal responsibility, that\'s what I\'m promising. But I\'m also promising that the wealthy are going to start paying more of their fair share and help to fund some of the investments that I\'m paying for. STEPHANOPOULOS: They\'re also saying no tax increases at all anyone earning under $250,000. Is that a rock solid ""read my lips"" promise? CLINTON: Well, it certainly is my goal. And I\'ve laid it out in this campaign. And it\'s something that President Obama promised. It\'s something my husband certainly tried to achieve, because I want Americans to know that I get it, that a lot of the losses that they experienced because of the great recession are still really pulling them down. You know, $13 trillion in family wealth was destroyed by the great recession. People lost their homes, their 401(k)s and IRAs, their college funds. So, we\'ve got to rebuild the middle class. If we expect to have broad based prosperity, that doesn\'t come from... STEPHANOPOULOS: So, it\'s your goal, but what if you can\'t get the revenue in other ways. What if the spending comes in more than it is. Will you then raise taxes? CLINTON: You know, George, I\'m going to tell you what I\'m going to do. And I\'m going to continue to stick with what I\'m going to do. $100 billion a year in these new investments all paid for I think is a responsible approach to getting our economy creating good jobs again. You know, I have an infrastructure plan that\'s on top of what the congress just passed. So, I\'m going to go out there and I\'m going to defend what I\'m doing. And I\'m also really going to defend the Middle Class, because a lot of these proposals would have a very bad effect. Either it would raise taxes on the Middle Class or it would undermine the kind of growth and structure that we need for the Middle Class to take off again. STEPHANOPOULOS: Another challenge you could face in this campaign, a majority of Americans question your honesty. Some GOP rivals and family members of the Benghazi victims are saying you lied to them in that hearing. They point to emails that you sent the night of the attack, one to your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, sayingI\'m going to have to put my glasses on here to actually read this. ""We were silent...two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group."" Another one to the Egyptian prime minister, ""we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest."" But the family members, as you know, say you told them it was by a filmmaker, you\'d go after the filmmaker. Here\'s what they said. [begin video clip] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She lied. She absolutely lied. Her daughter was able to be told differently that it was not the video, it was something else. Now if her daughter could be told, why can\'t I? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Either she was lying to the prime minister, or she was lying to me and to the American public. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was not the film? And what\'s your response? CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can\'tI can\'t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group that had taken responsibility on Facebook between the time that Iyou know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information. We were giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn\'t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast moving series of events in the fog of war. And I think most Americans understand. STEPHANOPOULOS: How about more generally. Do you think there\'s something you can do to get a majority of Americans to believe you\'re trustworthy? CLINTON: Well, you know, obviously I don\'t like hearing that, George. But I think people who have worked with me, people who voted for me twice in New York, people who I\'ve had a very long relationship with and working on their behalf are going to know what I do and when I say I will do it I will move everything I can to get it done. And I believe the American people who are looking for somebody who is a fighter, who will stand up there, just as I did, tell you what I will do, tell you I will do everything to make it happen. And I think my values have been consistent over the years. And the results that I\'ve gotten are ones that I\'m going to take to the American public. STEPHANOPOULOS: Immigration going to be a big issue in this campaign? In the past, you\'ve said that undocumented immigrants would not be covered by your health care proposals. Here\'s an exchange we had in 2007. [begin video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Would illegal immigrants be covered under your plan? CLINTON: Illegal immigrants would not be covered. No. They would not be covered. I will continue to have a safety net, which I think is in the best traditions of our country and also for public health reasons absolutely necessary. But we did not cover them in \'93, \'94 and my plan does not cover them now. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Now you say that undocumented immigrants should be able to buy into the exchanges. So why the shift? CLINTON: Well, because number one the kind of plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act gives you a market-based way of getting into the insurance market. So, if you can afford to buy a policy, you can. You don\'t get, however, any of the subsidies that American citizens get. STEPHANOPOULOS: Martin O\'Malley says they should. Why not? CLINTON: Well, I disagree with him. I think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues. But as things stand right now, under the Affordable Care Act, if you have the money and you are undocumented, you can buy into it, but without the subsidies. That\'s why it\'s important we continue to support community health centers, we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go. STEPHANOPOULOS: And what\'s the reason for not going further? CLINTON: Because I don\'t think legally you can. I mean, that is not something that we can legally support. The law is very clear about that. STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump. Last few days he\'s opened upyou\'re laughing again. CLINTON: I\'m sorry. I can\'t help it. STEPHANOPOULOS: He\'s opening up a new line of attack on you. Here it is. CLINTON: Oh, dear. A new one, huh? [begin video clip] TRUMP: She\'ll do a couple of minutes in Iowa, meaning a short period of time, and then she goes home and you don\'t see her for five, six days, she goes home, she goes to sleep. I\'m telling you. She...[laughter]...she doesn\'t have the strength, she doesn\'t have the stamina. [end video clip] CLINTON: Oh, goodness gracious. [laughter] You know... STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess you don\'t agree. CLINTON: Well, who can agree with anything he says that is, you know, subject to one second of fact checking? Look, if he gets the nomination, I will be more than happy to campaign against him. STEPHANOPOULOS: Is he the one you want to run against? CLINTON: I don\'t really think about it that way. I don\'t have any influence over who they nominate over there and, in fact, he\'s not the only one saying things that are deeply distressing. A lot of the others are kind of Trump 2, you know? Oh, whatever Trump says, maybe we won\'t go quite as far, but we\'ll get as close as we can. So the Republicans, in their presidential nominating process, have a lot to answer for. STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you explain why he\'s doing so well? CLINTON: I don\'t know, because he\'s ahe\'s a reality TV star. I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he is part of the celebrity and he will stay whatever he wants to say and if he\'s held account, thatit\'s not true, he just brushes it off and he goes on. And I think that, you know, there\'s a certain attractiveness to people that here\'s a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is. STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you said you\'re getting better at learning from your critics. They tell you things that your friends won\'t. So what have you learned from your critics in this campaign? CLINTON: You know, I\'ve said for a long time, George, that I tryI try to take criticism seriously but not personally. And by that I mean, look, if somebody says, hey, you know, you didn\'t door she didn\'t do a good job answering this or, you know, I don\'t think that that, you know, adds up, whatever they might say, I will take that seriously. But I really try not to take it personally and I think that\'s a big distinction that you have to begin to draw when you\'re in the public arena. You know, one of my favorite Americans, Eleanor Roosevelt, said for any woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros and, you know, I try to put lotion on it, but I have...[laughter]...I\'ve had to grow a lot of thick skin over the years. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks for joining us today. CLINTON: Thanks, George.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 15, 2015",b'Remarks at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis',"b'Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.I\'m delighted to be here at this great university, one of the premier public institutions of higher education in our entire country. Yes, indeed. Just, you know, one of those statements of fact that deserves a response.I want to thank my longtime friend, Vice President Mondale, for his kind words. His support in this campaign means a great deal to me personally, because I admire so much his service to our country. He is a great Minnesotan and a great American, and we\'re so privileged to have him with us today.I also want to acknowledge a few of the other elected officials who are here. I am, of course absolutely delighted to be joined by former colleagues and friends, your senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, who are quite the dynamic duo for your state. And I am grateful to them for everything they\'re doing and for their help and support of my campaign.I also want to thank Tina Smith, your lieutenant governor, and Steve Simon, your secretary of state.And I understand that Betsy Hodges is here, Mayor of Minneapolis.And I also want to acknowledge the dean of the Humphries School, Eric Schwartz. Eric was my top advisor on refugee issues at the State Department. I also had the great privilege of working with him when he was on the National Security Council during my husband\'s administration. You know, he brings a mix of expertise and empathy that has been conspicuously missing from much of our public debate.And I am grateful he is here today, but I\'m also a little jealous that all of you here at the university get to have the benefit of his experience.You know, over the past several months, I have listened to the problems that keep American families up at night. Now, most people don\'t expect life to be easy, but they do want more security, a good-paying job that lets you afford a middle class lifestyle, health care you can count on, a little bit put away for your retirement.Being secure also means being safe, safe at home, at school, at work. And today, I want to talk about how we keep our country safe from a threat that\'s on everyone\'s minds, the threat of terrorism.But I want to begin by saying, we cannot give in to fear. We can\'t let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe, and doing it in way that is consistent with our values.We cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe. Americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity.Now, as we all know, on December 2nd, two shooters killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.Sadly, in America in 2015, turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual. But this one turned out to be different, because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by ISIS.Americans have experienced terrorism before. On 9/11, we learned that terrorists in Afghanistan could strike our homeland. From Fort Hood to Chattanooga to the Boston Marathon, we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks.But San Bernardino felt different. Maybe it was the timing, coming so soon after Paris. Maybe it was how random it seemed, a terrorist attack in a suburban office park, not a high-profile target or symbol of American power. It made us all feel it could have been anywhere, at any time.The phrase ""active shooter"" should not be one we have to teach our children. But it is.And now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future, for our safety, our sense of well-being, and our trust and connections with our neighbors. We want to be open-hearted, and we want to celebrate America\'s diversity, not fear it.And while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate ISIS and love peace, we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks.Just yesterday, a man in Maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from ISIS for use in planning an attack. And here in Minnesota, authorities have charged ten men with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.But in the Twin Cities, you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization: local imams condemning terrorist violence, local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda.I just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with.As the first Somali-American police sergeant in Minnesota, and probably in the country, said recently, ""Safety is a shared responsibility, so we have to work together.""The threat we face is daunting. But America has overcome big challenges many times before. Throughout our history, we\'ve stared into the face of evil and refused to blink. We beat Fascism, won the Cold War, brought Osama bin Laden to justice.So no one should ever underestimate the determination of the American people. And I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear. And we will defeat these new enemies, just as we\'ve defeated those who\'ve threatened us in the past.Because it is not enough to contain ISIS, we must defeat ISIS, break its momentum and then its back. And not just ISIS, but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al Qaeda and offshoots like al Shabaab in Somalia.Now, waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership. But unfortunately, our political debate has been anything but serious.We can\'t afford another major ground war in the Middle East. That\'s exactly what ISIS wants from us. Shallow slogans don\'t add up to a strategy. Promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn\'t make you sound strong, it makes you sound like you\'re in over your head. Bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming Commander-in-Chief.And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.Every day that\'s wasted on partisan gridlock could put Americans in danger. So, yes, we need a serious discussion. And that\'s why in a speech last month before the Council on Foreign Relations I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS and the broader extremist movement.One, defeat ISIS in the Middle East by smashing its stronghold, hitting its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure from the air, and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground.Second, defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money, arms, propaganda, and fighters.And third, defeat them here at home by foiling plots, disrupting radicalization, and hardening our defenses.Now, these three lines of effort reinforce one another. So we need to pursue all of them at once, using every pillar of American power.It will require skillful diplomacy to continue Secretary Kerry\'s efforts to encourage political reconciliation in Iraq and political transition in Syria, enabling more Sunni Arabs and Kurdish fighters to take on ISIS on both sides of the border, and to get our Arab and Turkish partners to actually step up and do their part.It will require more U.S. and allied airpower, and a broader target set for strikes by planes and drones, with proper safeguards.It will require Special Operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism missions.What it will not require is tens of thousands of American combat troops. That is not the right action for us to take in this situation.So there is a lot to do, and today, I want to focus on the third part of my plan, how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home.We need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in San Bernardino.First, we have to shut down ISIS recruitment in the United States, especially online.Second, stop would-be jihadists from getting training overseas, and stop foreign terrorists from coming here.Third, discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out.Fourth, support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks.And fifth, empower our Muslim-American communities, who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization.This is a 360-degree strategy to keep America safe, and I want to walk through each of the elements, from recruitment to training to planning to execution.First, shutting down recruitment. We have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in-person and through social media, chat rooms, and what\'s called the ""Dark Web.""To do that, we need stronger relationships between Washington, Silicon Valley, and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs. American innovation is a powerful force, and we have to put it to work defeating ISIS.That starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens. Our security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze ISIS\'s social media posts and map jihadist networks, and they need help from the tech community.Companies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreements and other necessary policies to police their networks, identifying extremist content and removing it.Now, many are already doing this, and sharing those best practices more widely is important.At the State Department, I started an interagency center to combat violent jihadist messages, to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values, and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative.We recruited specialists fluent in Arabic, Urdu, and Somali to wage online battles with extremists to counter their propaganda.Now, those efforts have not kept pace with the threat, so we need to step up our game, in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government.But that\'s just some of what we have to do. Experts from the FBI, the intelligence community, Homeland Security, DOD, the State Department, and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat ISIS in cyberspace, using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory, just as we work to deny them actual territory.And at the same time, we also have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization, whatever form it takes.It\'s imperative that the Saudis, the Qataris, the Kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools, madrassas and mosques around the world, once and for all, and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries.Now, second, we have to prevent ISIS recruits from training abroad, and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here.Most urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from Europe and America to Iraq and Syria, and then back home again.The United States and our allies need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip, and then share information with each other in real time.Right now, European nations don\'t always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen. They have to dramatically improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation. And we\'re ready to help them do that.We also need to take down the network of enablers who help jihadists finance and facilitate their travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And the United States and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join ISIS or other groups, and bring the full force of law against them.As I\'ve said before, the United States has to take a close look at our visa programs. And I am glad the administration and Congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of San Bernardino. And that should include scrutinizing applicants\' social media postings. We also should dispatch more Homeland Security agents to high-risk countries to better investigate visa applicants.For many years, America has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures, including key allies in Europe and Asia. That makes sense. But we also have to be smart. Except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers, anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation, no matter where they\'re from.We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals. Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it\'s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.But Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process.And just as important, we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations.Turning away orphans, applying a religious test that discriminates against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee; that is not who we are. We are better than that.It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones. So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria just as the Twin Cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees, exiles, and immigrants.Of course, the key is to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security. But we can do this. And I think we must.Third, we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out. This is going to take better intelligence collection, analysis, and sharing. I\'ve proposed an ""intelligence surge"" against ISIS that includes more operations officers and linguists, enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets, intercepting terrorist communications, flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorists\' movements, and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services.President Obama recently signed the USA Freedom Act, which was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress. It protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe. However, the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right. Some would strip away crucial counterterrorism tools, even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight. Others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past.I don\'t think we can afford to let either view prevail. Now, encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties. Law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. On the other hand, there are very legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit.I know there\'s no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns. But we can\'t just throw up our hands. The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists. And even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it\'s essential that we also make sure jihadists don\'t get the tools they need to carry out attacks.It defies common sense that Republicans in Congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns. If you\'re too dangerous to fly, you\'re too dangerous to buy a gun, period. And we should insist on comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows. And I think it\'s time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.I know this will drive some of our Republican friends a little crazy. You\'ll probably hear it tonight. They will say that guns are a totally separate issue, nothing to do with terrorism. Well, I have news for them, terrorists use guns to kill Americans. And I think we should make it a lot harder for them from to do that ever again.And there\'s a question, a question they should be asked: Why don\'t the Republican candidates want to do that? You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I\'m not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that\'s not the right path for us to go down.Now, the fourth element in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.In San Bernardino, city, county, state, and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life. Like Detective Jorge Lozano, a 15-year police veteran, who assured terrified civilians, ""I\'ll take a bullet before you do."" There is no limit to the gratitude we owe to law enforcement professionals like that Detective Lozano who run toward danger to try to save lives. And not just in the immediate wake of an attack. Our police, firefighters, and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on.It\'s disgraceful that Congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of 9/11. Many of them were men and women I was so proud to represent as a Senator from New York. The Zadroga 9/11 Health Act never should have been allowed to lapse. It looks like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have finally dropped his opposition. And I hope the American people will hold him to that. And we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history.We have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe. And they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts, including with better use of ""fusion centers"" that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination.And we need to strengthen our defenses and our resilience wherever we\'re vulnerable, whether it\'s ""soft targets"" like shopping malls or higher-profile targets like airports, railways, or power plants. We have to build on the progress of the Obama Administration in locking down loose nuclear materials, and other WMD, so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world.So we should be providing the Department of Homeland Security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead, not trying to privatize key functions, like TSA, as some Republicans have proposed.And it\'s important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement, we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities, but that was an issue I tackled after 9/11, and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be.Finally, the fifth element in the strategy is empowering Muslim-American communities who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization. There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in our country. These Americans may be our first, last, and best defense against home grown radicalization and terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it\'s too late, intervene to help set a young person straight. They are the best positioned to block anything going forward.That\'s why law enforcement has worked so hard since 9/11 to build up trust and strong relationships within Muslim-American communities. Here in the Twin Cities, you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community with law enforcement, non-profits, local businesses, mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk.It\'s called the Building Community Resilience Pilot Program, and it deserves increased support. It has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do. And we\'ve got to do a better job of supporting it.Now I know that like many places across the country, there\'s more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement. Just last month, I know here a young African American man was fatally shot by a police officer. And I understand an investigation is underway. Whatever the outcome, tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in America and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism.When people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they\'re more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement. One of the mothers of the 10 men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said, ""We have to stop the denial,"" she told other parents that. ""We have to talk to our kids and work with the FBI."" That\'s a message we need to hear from leaders within Muslim-American communities across our country.But we also want to highlight the successes in Muslim American communities, and there are so many of them. I just met with the first Somali-American council member of the City Council here. And he was proudly telling me how much change Somali immigrants, now Muslim-Americans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out. Let\'s look at the successes.If we\'re going to full integrate everyone into America, then we need to be seeing all their contributions, too. And that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric. You know, not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as Americans, they are also dangerous.As the Director of the FBI told Congress recently, anything that erodes trust with Muslim-Americans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult. We need every community invested in this fight, not alienated and sitting on the sidelines.One of the community leaders I met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school. They\'re not only afraid of being perceived as a threat, they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are. This is such a open-hearted and generous community, I hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly Governor Dayton and others, to bring people together to reassure members of the community, particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome, invited and valued here in this city and state.Now Donald Trump\'s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world. Even some of the other Republican candidates are saying he\'s gone too far. But the truth is, many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about Muslims. And this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists. It alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS.You know, you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one. But there\'s not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work. I know how hard this is because I\'ve done it. And I can tell you, insulting potential allies doesn\'t make it any easier.And demonizing Muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world, that the United States is at war with Islam. As both the Pentagon and the FBI have said in the past week, we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea. This is not a clash of civilizations. It\'s a clash between civilization and barbarism and that\'s how it must be seen and fought.Some will tell you that our open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. I disagree. I believe our tolerance and diversity are at the core of our strength. At a Naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in Washington, President Obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger. It is, he said, about the meaning of America, what kind of country do we want to be? And it\'s about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding, E Pluribus Unum. Out of many we are one.President Obama is right, and it matters. It\'s no coincidence that American Muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than Muslims in less welcoming countries. We can\'t give in to demagogues who play on our basest instincts. We must instead rely on the principles written into our American DNA. Freedom. Equality. Opportunity.America is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future, no matter where they\'re from, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love. Our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. As George Washington put it, the United States gives ""to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance."" So to all our Muslim-American brothers and sisters, this is your country too. And I am proud to be your fellow American.And I want to remind us, particularly our Republican friends, that George W. Bush was right. Six days after 9/11 he went to a Muslim community center and here\'s what he said, those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don\'t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of human kind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.So if you want to see the best of America, you need look no further than Army Captain Humayun Khan. He was born in the United Arab Emirates. He moved to Maryland as a small child, and later graduated from the University of Virginia, before enlisting in the U.S. Army.In June 2004, he was serving in Iraq. One day, while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base, a suspicious vehicle appeared. Captain Khan told his troops to get back, but he went forward. He took ten steps toward the car before it exploded. Captain Khan was killed, but his unit was saved by his courageous acts. Captain Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He was just 27 years old.""We still wonder what made him take those 10 steps,"" Khan\'s father said in a recent interview.""Maybe that\'s the point,"" he went on, ""where all the values, all the service to country, all the things he learned in this country kicked in. It was those values that made him take those 10 steps. Those 10 steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country,"" his father finished.As hard as this is, it\'s time to move from fear to resolve. It\'s time to stand up and say,""We are Americans."" We are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we\'ve faced, but because of them. Americans will not buckle or break. We will not turn on each other or turn on our principles. We will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose. We will crush their would-be caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root. We\'re in it for the long haul. And we\'ll stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine.That\'s what we do here. It\'s who we are. That\'s how we\'ll win, by looking at one another with respect, with concern, with commitment. That\'s the America that I know makes us all so proud to be a part of.Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"December 29, 2015","b'Remarks at a Town Hall Meeting in Portsmouth, New Hampshire'","b'CLINTON: Wow. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I am really delighted to be here on the first winter day of this season. [laughter] To be here in this beautiful city and church that has been the site of a lot of occasions. And especially to be introduced by Brenda, who, as she said, I first met in a town hall in Dover all those months ago. And you know, when you call on people in town halls, as you\'ll see in a minute, you have no idea what they\'re going to say or what they are going to ask. And when I called on her, she basically said I have a husband with early onset Alzheimer\'s, I have a mother with Alzheimer\'s. I\'m taking care of them. What are you going to do about Alzheimer\'s? And it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president I want to be. Obviously, I want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs. And I want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face. But I also want to be a president who works for families, like Brenda\'s. Who understands that the problems we keep you up at night are ones that we also have to take seriously. So, it means the world to me to have her support in this campaign. And as I\'ve said to her and to others who have raised issues with me during the course of my time here in New Hampshire, I will do everything I can to try and find answers. You know, in Alzheimer\'s, as she said, we have got five million people currently suffering. The projection is for many millions more. It is the sixth leading cause of death in America. But unlike the other causes in the top ten, there is no real path to prevention or effective treatment, or a cure, as there is with other diseases that take so many lives. So, my proposal is that we tackle all three of those. What can we do to try and prevent it? What can we do to try to more effectively treat it? And what would it take to invest in finding a cure? And after talking to experts, the leading experts in our countrynot just in Alzheimer\'s, but in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson\'s, the overwhelming response was, if we invested just $2 billion more a year, we would make tremendous progress. And we would have a real shot at understanding more about this disease and trying to cure it. And the heavens support what we are going to do on behalf of Alzheimer\'s, and the patients, the families and the caregivers. [applause] So, I want to thank my friend Terry Narelli , who I see here, for her great service and leadership over so many years, and for her friendship. And I want to just make a few other quick acknowledgments. And then we will move on to be ready for the questions. The mayor. I want to thank the mayor. Where is Mayor Lister? I saw him earlier. He\'s here somewhere. There he is. There he is. Thank you so much, Mayor. Wonderful to see you, thank you for your support. And to the South Church, thank you for letting us be here today. [applause] And to the overflow, which I stopped by to see on my way here. It was packed. We thank you for your patience. They have got a big screen, they are having a good time watching. And we are delighted they are here as well. As Brenda said, on January 20, 2017, someone will raise a hand and take the oath of office, and become our 45th president. That person will, after being sworn in, and the celebrations that go with an inauguration, go into the White House, go into the oval office, and face the challenges that await. This will be a consequential election in so many ways. Because we have work to do. I\'m excited about the work. I\'m confident and optimistic about the work we can do together. [applause] But I need all of you to be part of this campaign, to be part of the first in the nation primary, because in many ways, you are the firstor depending on how you define it, the last line of defense. The decision that New Hampshire makes is so important. And I\'ve had a great time traveling across the state, meeting, by now, thousands and thousands of people. Having a chance to set forth my ideas and answer questions on whatever might be on someone\'s mind. And I know that we are going to make the right decisionnot because my name will be on the ballot, but because all of us know what the stakes are, and how high they happen to be. So I\'m excited and very much looking forward to the sprint towards the primary and to have a chance to hear even more for more folks here in the granite state about what is on your mind, about the big economic challenges, the security issues, and all those problems they keep you up at night. I have learned a lot listening to folks here in New Hampshire. I learned a lot about the struggles, the opportunities, the disappointments. As you know, I have had two full town hall meetings just on the issue of substance abuse. When I made a list of what I was going to talk about in this campaign, it wasn\'t on that list. But on my first trip here to New Hampshire in Keene, that was what was raised with me. And then on visit after visit, I was given mass cards showing the pictures of beautiful young people no longer with us because of overdoses. I met those in recovery, who thankfully, were able to get help when they needed it. I met grandmothers like myself, raising children because their children couldn\'t, lost to opioid addiction, heroin addiction. So that\'s why taking the big issue to me. I will never stop leading with the values that I was raised with about who we are as Americans, what we\'re capable of doing. I will never stop listening, learning about what\'s on people\'s minds. I think you actually learn more when you listen. And I will never stop trying to work with you to solve problems. That\'s the America that I was raised in, that\'s the America that I think we all cherish and that\'s the America that I\'m going to do everything I can as your president to make sure it\'s stronger and better and fairer for everybody going forward. [applause] So let me now turn to all of you and if you raise your hand, I think we have some microphones somewhere that we will try to get to you and give you a chance. This youngthis woman right there. Yes, right there. Yes. Please stand up. Great. QUESTION: Hi. Hi. This is such an honor. You look stunning and I\'ve always wanted to talk with you. [applause] I have been on your bandwagon since you were first lady. We are nine days apart, but I know why you look so much better, because you\'re younger. [laughter] But it\'s a dream come true to have this interaction. As a cancer survivor, three years ago and going through surgery, chemo, radiation, and having a job I loved, I was let go from my job in the private sector. However, I did come to redo myself as a justice of the peace in Massachusetts and I work now with elderly through Brookline Council on aging. And I have seen people up close and personal that are delights, as well as being able to hear them. And one of the issues I have heard lately is the hearing is a problem and that they cannot afford to buy hearing aids because they are thousands of dollars. As a senior myself now, the affordable health care for getting the supplements to Medicare is an issue as well, because if you\'re notif you\'re too far above $100, $200 above the guidelines for Medicaid or mass health, then you cannotyou have to pay full prices to supplements, but the seniors are saying they need help in hearing. CLINTON: Have any of you heard this before, that seniors who need help with hearing can\'t afford to get the hearing aids because the hearing aids are so expensive? This is something that... [applause] I think a lot of people thought we would figure out a way to solve in the Affordable Care Act, but we haven\'t yet, and it\'s something that I take really seriously because if you can\'t hear well, very often, people kind of withdrawal and they become more isolated, and in fact, some of the recent research shows that, you know, that can be a trigger for other kinds of conditions and diseases. So I don\'t think hearing aids when you can\'t hear are a luxury, I think they\'re a necessity. And I\'m going to do everything I can... [applause] ... to moveto move them from what would be the elective list to a supported list so that people who have financial problems will be able to get help to afford them because you\'re 100 percent right. It\'s a growing concern, in part because we have a lot more people living longer and part because we have a lot more people losing their hearing earlier. Some people say it\'s because of loud music that some of us remember listening to, but for whatever reason it might be, there are a lot of issues around it. So I\'m going to do what I can to make sure we make hearing aids financially available on a sliding scale so more people who need them can actually get them. [applause] Yeah, this gentleman right there. Yeah, right there in the yellow tie. Here comes the microphone. QUESTION: Good afternoon. My name is Mr. Rogers. I happen to be in your neighborhood. [laughter] I have a message for you; I\'m from Liberia. Liberia, we elected the first female president in the continent of Africa. You already talked about... [applause] ... your hand is raised up to take that oath. I\'m here on behalf of the Republic of Liberia, from Johnson-Sirleaf the president of Liberia, to say hi to you. Since 5 o\'clock this morningI don\'t know where I was goingI have to find my way here. But do me one favor. I want to take a picture with you and send it to her that I was here as I promised. [laughter] If you don\'t mind please. If you don\'t mind. CLINTON: We will do that when we finish. Don\'t let me forget, and I have a feeling you won\'t. [laughter] But the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who has been elected twiceas you rightly say, the first woman president anywhere on the continent of Africahas been... [applause] ... has been an extraordinary leader. I mean, she inherited an economy and a government that was bankrupt. They had had this terrible long civil war that had just destroyed so much of the productive capacity in addition to taking so many lives and leaving so many maimed and injured people behind, and a lot of Liberians left Liberia because of the lack of safety. She has been, I think, incredibly focused on trying to improve the government, improve the economy. Then she was dealt the terrible blow of Ebola and all that it meant to her country. And I want to tell you just a quick story because it\'s good to remember how important it is to keep trying to work with people even if you have serious disagreements with them. I went to visit President Sirleaf when I was secretary of State and got a big briefing from all of her top officials about what was happening in her government and what they were trying to accomplish, and then I was supposed to go speak to the parliament, their Congress. And she took me aside and she said I want you to go and speak about how hard democracy is, how hard we must work together, how we have to move past the past and then said to me some of the very people who are now in the parliament were people who were very much involved in the civil war and some of the terrible things that happened there. The leaders went to war crimes tribunal, but others for whom there wasn\'t evidence or they played minor roles were actually elected. Well, you can imagine. So I go to the parliament and I speak about democracy and all the rest of it and take some pictures and do some visits afterwards, and I thought boy, we think we have it hard, here she is trying to work with a Congress that includes people who were mortal enemies with one another against her, against others, and she\'s working so hard to make this democracy what it should be against tremendous odds. So when we complain about our problems here in this country, we need to put them into some perspective and we need to figure out how we\'re going to work together even with people we disagree with... [applause] ... going into the future. So thank you. We\'ll take a picture, I promise. OK, we\'ve got this young lady in the red. Yeah. And then I\'ll go further back to... QUESTION: Thank you so much for being here and taking my question. I am the mother of a 16-year-old boy who is smart and beautiful, but he also really struggles with mental illness and he\'s currently in an in-patient program right now. And I think my family, I think anyone would agree that my family has incredibly great health insurance. And I know that mental health parity is the law. But we still have to fight for every single admission, every single bit of treatment that we have asked for himthat the experts, his doctors who know him well all agree that this is what he needs to get better. And the health insurance company constantly tries to whittle it down and only provide the minimum amount. And, you know, as a parent with a sick child, I only have so much energy to fight this fight and something just really needs to be done. CLINTON: How many of you know somebody with mental health problems? [applause] How many of you know how difficult it is to get the medical care you need to help somebody with mental health problems? Whatwhat you\'re describing is exactly the case. We passed a lawI remember voting for it back in the dayand then there was another law passed and it was incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, for what they call parity for mental health. In other words, if you have a physical illness, whatever it might be, you\'re supposed to get treated for it. If you have a mental health illness, you need to get treated for that, too. Number one, we need finally to remove the stigma from mental health, because... [applause] ... too often I hear from parents who say, ""I no longer even tell people that my son has schizophrenia; my daughter is bipolar; my child has got, you know, chronic depression, because I feel like I\'m judged."" No. We\'re learning more about how the brain operates. That\'s one of the things we want to do. That\'s part of what my goal is for Alzheimer\'s research. We have to understand the brain. We have to unlock its secrets. I really applaud President Obama for the investment in the brain project that his administration has made. So we need to remove the stigma and we need to enforce the law so you get the quality and the number of treatments you need, whether it\'s out-patient or in-patient. And I\'m going to work with the mental health community, which has laid out an agenda about how we get this right once and for all, because it\'s not fair. It\'s not fair to the person suffering and it\'s certainly not fair to the families who are trying to cope with that suffering and get the medical care that is needed. So I\'ll do everything I can to make it somewhat easier for you and your son going forward. [applause] Yes, this young man right here. QUESTION: When you become president... [crosstalk] QUESTION: When you become president, what is your plan to connect mental health problems and guns to make sure that me, my brothers and my friends are safe from violence at school? CLINTON: Oh, wow. [applause] I\'m going to do everything I can do. And I\'m never going to stop trying. Because right now, we lose 90 people a day to gun violencehomicides, suicides and tragic avoidable accidents. That\'s 33,000 people a year. I think we need to pass the laws that I have been advocating for. We need comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. [applause] And we need to make sure that the information that is needed to make the judgment about whether someone is qualified to buy a gun is in the record. And very often, we don\'t have real-time information because we also have to close what\'s called the Charleston loophole, where the killer in Charleston went to buy a gun. He filled out the form. Under the loophole, he could come back and get it after three business days. The information that he wasn\'t eligible because he had a felony conviction didn\'t come through until after he wentused that gun and murdered nine people in a church like this in Charleston. So we have work to do. And the mental health piece of this is especially troubling, because you don\'t want to unfairly stigmatize people, but you want to protect the community, so you\'ve got to have information. The killer at Virginia Tech, you might remember, had been committed. But that information was not in the records. We need to prohibit people who are drastic abusers with restraining orders against them from getting guns. And we certainly should get the Congress to prohibit anyone who is on the no-fly list, the would-be terrorists, from buying guns in America. And... [applause] CLINTON: ... and we need to repeal the immunity from liability that was given to gun makers and sellers by the Congress... [applause] ... so that we can do as good a job as possible trying to prevent people who shouldn\'t have guns in the first place from getting them. And I know we can do this in a constitutionally consistent way. So I\'m going to reach out. I\'ll work with anybody, but I will also continue to advocate for this, because we are in a whole different era, where these mass shootings, these 33,000 people killed every year, has become a rebuke to us, that we can\'t figurefigure out how to deal with this. And I, personally, am asking gun owners to support these changes. Because right now, what I just outlinedcomprehensive background checks and the likeis supported by 92 percent of Americans and 85 percent of gun owners. But the gun lobby lives off of fear and misinformation and is willing to say and do whatever it takes... [applause] CLINTON: And it is really time for gun owners to form a different organization that will do more on gun safety, do more on gun responsibility, and stand up for the safety of our children and our communities. [applause] CLINTON: OK. This gentleman with the cap on has been standing up. So whywhy don\'t you ask the next question, sir? QUESTION: Thank you so much, Hillary. First and foremost, I want to say that I love you. [laughter] And I really mean it. And somy name is James Mackey , I\'m a community organizer for a non-profit organization called Teen Empowerment. And what we do is we hire young people to talk about issues, and we create initiatives around those issues to build relationships with young people in the community. And so, I work in Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, all theall the... [applause] ... thank you. All the communities that are underserved. And so my question to you is, is thatso we just lost one of our youth organizers, two days ago, from a tragic accident. And there are 5.6 million young people around our nation who are 16 to 24, who are disconnected from school as well as from work. And when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? Andand plus, they\'re in underserved communities. And so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? And what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? Yeah. [applause] CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you. And first of all, thank you for being an organizer and reaching out to young people. That is so important. And... [applause] ... I hope you heard what he said, because think about this number: 5.6 million young people between 16 and 24, who are neither in school nor at work. That is a recipe for unemployment, for incarceration, for all kinds of behavior that has bad consequences for themselves and for their families. And it\'s something I care deeply about, because if you look at where we are, underserved communities have had a resurgence of poverty. Inner-cities, old suburbs, small towns and rural areas, Native American reservations, coal country, this is across America where we have disconnected young people from a path to a productive life. And I think we\'ve got to figure out how we rebuild that. So I am absolutely committed and I am going to say quickly three things. I want to support programs like what you described you do, because we\'ve got to get people in the communitiesit\'s literally a one on one project in many cases. What is it that can be done for John or Mary or whomever? So we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. But secondly, we have to take a hard look. And one of the ideas that I have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems. And we really have to figure out what works. People have tried a whole bunch of different things, and a lot of it doesn\'t work. Throwing money at it doesn\'t necessarily work. Building relationships is the work that has to be done. How do we do that? I don\'t think the answer lies in Washington, although as president, I can be a convener, a coordinator, a catalyst. I think we have to do this in communities. And I want to provide support and resources, where possible, to give more people a chance to do that relationship building. We are going to need more GED programs very we need more community college programs. We are going to need more apprenticeship programs. We\'re going to need more pathways out. And we are going to have to also take a hard look at the living conditions and the schooling conditions that a lot of these kids face. I used to have what I would call the Chelsea test, when I would go into the school. And as the first lady in Arkansas, the first lady in the United States or the Senator in New York, I would walk into a school and I would spend some time, I would look around. I would look at the physical facilities, I\'d talk to the staff area and I would say, would I want my daughter to go to the school? A lot of times the answer was yes, absolutely. A lot of time the answer was no. Some of the conditions, the physical conditions in these schools was deplorable. And then you have to look at the housing that a lot of people are living in. A lot of this housing is really substandard but in dangerous ways. and I will just end with this. Lead paint poisoning effects many, many children in the northeast, the mid-atlantic, and the midwest, where we had a lot of old housing. Where we have old pipes on water supplies. Lead poisoning is an academic and behavioral deficits inducement. People end up being worse off. And we are not doing enough to notice it, to deal with it, to eradicate it. So there\'s a lot I think we have to take a hard look at. And I will do that. But it will be in partnership with young people like you and the groups you recognize and represent. Thank you. [applause] CLINTON: I see a hand way back there. Yes, yes. Black and white, yes. Right there. Yes. QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. It is an honor. I\'m from Alabama and I know it is important for candidates to focus on undecided voters in swing states. But for liberals and conservatives states, we sometimes feel left out of the fray. And I would hope that the Democratic Party and your campaign will go into those conservative states and really push and give us hope and encouragement that your platforms will be heard there. And I ask you, please don\'t leave us to the Republicans. [laughter] [applause] CLINTON: Well, I have been down to Alabama twice already in this campaign. And I will do my best to help rebuild the Democratic Party in places where it hasn\'t been particularly successful in recent years. Because I think there is a lot we can recommend. I really do. I think that our view about what we need to do to get the economy going again, and fix all the problems that we see with the Affordable Care Act, and get early childhood educationyou know, there is a very inconvenient fact that my Republican friends hate when I mention. But it is true. Our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House. [applause] And that is true in Alabama, just like it\'s true anywhere. And we are going to make that case, do the very best we can to kind of get people to recognize that we are all in this together. And getting the economy to work better, getting our government to be more effective and productive in producing results, building on the progress that President Obama made itremember, he inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession. And then he had to make sure it didn\'t fall into a Great Depression. I don\'t think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure that did not happen. [applause] So, we are going to make that case. We are going to make that case throughout the country. I hope, effectively. At least, I\'m counting on that. Yes, the man in the blue vest. Yeah, yeah. QUESTION: This is an honor. I\'m a retired teacher from Massachusetts. I\'ve never been involved in any political aspects. I\'vewe are about the same age, actually, Hillary. So, it\'s onlyI respect one woman in my life, which is my wife. You are the No. 2 woman I respect more than any woman on this planet. I have watched you since youryou know, your early political days. We are both grandparents of very young grandchildren. I\'m a little bit nervous here. But I just wanted to tell you that there is one thing that hasin the minds of most peoplewe have doubt. We have doubt about so many things that we\'ve hoped for, and we\'ve seen evolve. You eliminate doubt for someone like me. You eliminate doubt. I haveyour knowledge and your grasp of what\'s happening, and what you\'ve been through, and what you seeand things that you know that we don\'t know are what make me feel confident that you were going to be the next president. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. There is a little hand right there, that little girl right there. I like having all of these young people here. QUESTION: Hi. Hi, I\'m Ella. I think that there is a lot of people who don\'t have enough money for college, and schools and that kind of stuff. So, how can we help that? CLINTON: It\'s a very good question, Ella. [applause] That is a great question. How many people have student debt, or ever had student debt? Guess that\'s nearly everybody here, practically. Look, I think there are two things, two big things we have to do. First, I want to make college debt-free, so that you don\'t have to borrow money for tuition to go to a four-year public college or university. [applause] And it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. Because I do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on. [applause] So, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. I think states have dis-invested in higher education. A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it. So, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. I think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. I think that\'s only fair. And I want students to work 10 hours a week. Because I want students to know they are working for their education. And that it\'s something they really value. [applause] And I want to do more on national service so more students get big discounts because they will have done national service. Military service, civilian service. [applause] And we\'ve got a good G.I. bill now coming after 9/11a new G.I. bill for the new generation of vets, but I want to make sure they don\'t get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don\'t really serve them well. So we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right. And then I want to help you pay down your debt by refinancing your debt. Just like you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you ought to be able to refinance your college debt. [applause] And it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostlywe\'ve had really low interest rates. And yet, when I ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. Some of it private, some of it to the government. And I do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education. [applause] So we\'re going towe\'re going to make a lot of changes, Ella. So certainly by the time you get there, but hopefully sooner, we will have a lot of good changes that you\'ll be able to take advantage of. Yes. There\'s a lady right here and maybelet\'s see. Here comes the microphone. Right there. QUESTION: Thank you for coming to Portsmouth. I was very disappointed in the last debate that the international agreement on climate that was agreed upon in Paris was not even mentioned. So could you comment on that and tell us as president, what you would do? CLINTON: Yes. I happen to think the... [applause] The Paris agreement was a historic achievement and I give a lot of credit to President Obama\'s leadership because if the United States had not led, it would not have happened, and I know how hard it was, because President Obama and I went to the big international climate meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. And literally, we could not even get a meeting with the Chinese, the Indians, the South Africans and the Brazilians. Led by the Chinese, who did not want to have a meeting with us where they might make a commitment to actually doing anything. And so we had to chase them around this big convention center in Copenhagen, and we finally found them. Chinese guards were preventing the entry in and the president is a lot taller than I am, and so he just kind of pushed through in the hands went up so I ducked under and we got in the room. [laughter] And then, you know, the president says, ""We\'ve been looking all over for you."" We pulled up chairs and we sat down and we said, ""You know, look, we have to begin this process."" And their argument was the typical argument. ""We didn\'t cause the problem. It was the developed countries."" We said, ""Look, that\'s fine, but you are now the biggest emitters and you are going to have to help solve the problems,"" and they began to agree to do some internal accounting and public reporting. Fast forward from \'09, we had a series of climate meetings in Cancun and Durban, and we made progress. So the agreement coming out of Paris does, for the first time, include every nation, regardless of level of development or need or threat from climate change. And now, we have to enforce it. So as president, I would do everything I can, using every tool that I had to hold other nations accountable, including our own, about what we need to do both to try desperately to move more quickly away from fossil fuels towards clean, renewable energy, to try to at least put a cap on temperature rise and emissions and try the best we can at the same time to do more on resilience and adaptation to try and help countries and parts of countries that are particularly at risk. Portsmouth is the seacoast city. You allI know the mayor and everybody, you\'re working hard on resilience and you\'re really taking a hard look, but you need a partner in Washington and in the Congress, as well as the president. There are a lot of places in our countryAlaska has already been hit hard. They\'ve had to relocate some villages from the coastline. I know that Miami is really facing some big challenges. So we\'ve got to get serious about this because it\'s happening. We are seeing the results of this drastic increase in temperature that human activity has not just contributed to, but caused. So, it\'s time for us to... [applause] ... deal with the problem, but I believe it\'s also a great opportunity. And this is what I have a hard time understanding from my Republican counterparts. You know, they all are into denial and when asked about climate change typically will say well I don\'t know, I\'m not a scientist. You know, the answer to that is go talk to one... [laughter] ... and listen to what the scientists tell you, and... [applause] ... so from my perspective, we have economic opportunities here that we\'re leaving on the table. We can do so much more, putting people to work in wind, in solar, in advanced biofuels. We can make a difference in the economy with new, good-paying jobs. And I will say this. You know, when I\'m not in New Hampshire, I\'m often in Iowa. Iowa now produces one-third of its electricity from renewables, predominantly wind. Seven thousand people now work in the wind industry. They are now assembling turbines in old, abandoned factories, they are educating young people in the community colleges to actually work on these turbines. So they have gone the whole supply chain, and good for them. Every state should be doing the same. Every state has that same economic potential here... [applause] ... and when wewhen we let politics, really politics that are under the thumb of the fossil fuel industryand in particular, the Koch Brothersdecide the future of our country, shame on us. We\'re better than that, we\'re smarter than that, and we allRepublican, Democrat, Independent, whateverwe all need to say we are taking on this challenge and we\'re going to make jobs and incomes rise because of it. That to me is the right approach for us to be taking. [applause] Oh my goodness. So many hands, so little time. Well, you\'re standing right there. Why don\'t we go with that lady right there. Yeah. QUESTION: Hi, thank you. I\'ve spent a lot of time teaching art in women\'s prisons, and the majority of the women I\'ve worked with are from minority, low-income families and the majority of them are in their second, third, fourth visits to prison, and they say it\'s easier to just live in that cycle than try to break out of it. How would you approach helping end that cycle? [applause] CLINTON: First of all, thank you for working in our prisons. You know, we are still in the midst of the holiday season, and for those of us who celebrate Christmas, it\'s good to remember that we are called upon to care for the homeless and the stranger and the prisoner, the refugee. Those are important reminders at a time when there\'s so much political dispute about all of this, and I think we have incarcerated too many people. We have 5 percent of the world\'s population... [applause] ... but 25 percent of the prison population, and we actually have one-third of women who are imprisoned anywhere in the world imprisoned in the Untied States. So we have to begin in a thoughtful way to deal with the effects of incarceration. Obviously, from my perspective, we need to take a hard look at the low-level, non-violent offenses for which people end up incarcerated. We have to take a hard look at our bail system because we have too many people in jail and prison who haven\'t even been tried yet. We don\'t know if they\'re guilty of anything other than poverty because they can\'t meet the bail that has been set for them. And we need to do a careful analysis of who can and should be released from prison while we try to deal with people who don\'t pose a threat to the community, particularly the numbers of people with low-level drug offenses who need treatment, not imprisonment. And so we\'ve got to look at all of this and... [applause] ... yet, I don\'t think that\'s enough, and it goes back to the gentleman\'s question over there in the hat. The issue is, OK, if we\'re going to divert people from prison, what are the things we\'re going to do? Well, I\'m a big believer in drug courts, I think drug courts are a much better option than imprisoning people. They should be given recovery, they should be held accountable. I believe that there are more programs that are cheaper and better. And I want to just quickly tell you about a program I visited in Reno, Nevada. And it was a program originally started for alcoholicspeople that were found on the street and were picked up, taken to jail. A month later, they\'d be on the street again, taken to jail, or maybe they\'d end up being put into an ambulance, taken to the emergency room, maybe admitted. A month or two later, back on the street. So, a really great partnership between the county sheriff\'s office and Catholic charities said, ""there\'s gotta be a better way. First of all, it\'s really expensive to jail and imprison people."" So they built a facility that had small bedrooms, that had work to be done, that offered this option to people they were picking up, saying, ""you can either go back to jail, back toyou know, the life you\'ve had, or you can try this."" And they got enough people to try it. They tested them three times a day to make sure they weren\'t cheating. And the sheriff said to mehe said, ""you knowwant to know the best thing about this?"" He said, ""because I canI can justify this anywhere."" He said the first year, the sheriff\'s office and the hospital and the jail saved $4 million, because they were no longer putting people in high, intensive places like jails and emergency rooms. Now they\'re moving on to drug addiction, because we\'ve got to think differently about how to help people overcome the problems that they confront. And I just don\'t think jail is a place for people with substance abuse or mental health problems. And therefore, we need different approaches... [applause] ... that will be actually better and cheaper. So let\'slet\'s try to figure out how we\'re gonna do that, too. This young man. QUESTION: Hi. I have a dad that works for people with developmental disabilities. And I have an uncle with autism. And I was wondering, what are some of the ways that you can help people with disabilities and people with special needs that need help? CLINTON: Great question. You know, thanks. [applause] Thank you dad for us, too, OK? Is your dad here? Thanks, Dad. Yeah. People with disabilitiesyou know, I was very proud that the United States became the first nation in the world to open schools to people with disabilities. And it was theI worked on that, when I was with the Children\'s Defense Fund. And we went door to door, asking people, ""do you have a school-age child who\'s not in school?"" And we found a blind kids and kids in wheelchairs and kids with behavioral problems, and then gave all that data to the Congress, and the Congress acted, and schools were opened. And then thethe Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, another great accomplishment. A bipartisan accomplishment that really made a huge difference. [applause] So now we have to do more to make sure that we provide supportive housing, that we support families. The biggest concern people talk to me about when they have children with disabilities, and particularly with autism, is what happens when they are no longer there to take care of their children, and how will that work out. I\'m actually rolling out a plan about autism in about a week, where I talk about all the different things... [applause] ... that we need to do to try to support families and people who are diagnosed as on the autism-spectrum disorders. How many of you know somebody with autism? Wow. Wow. Well, you know, the latest data from the Centers on Disease Control is that -you know, 1 out of 68 children have some feature that would place them on the autism spectrum. So that\'s something we need to deal with. So we\'rewe\'ll be addressing that. But I guess my bottom line would be wewe, as communities, need to support families and need to support people with disabilities so that they can go as far as their talent, their hard work, their skills will take them. And I think there are a lot of opportunities that we\'re just learning about that we can apply, and that I will talk about when I roll this out. I\'ve just been told this is my last question. And sooh, my goodness. This is totallyI should not have said that. This is totally, totally unfair. Oh my gosh. II ... QUESTION: Here! Here! [laughter] CLINTON: YouOK. So you\'ve got promoters right here. This young man, right there? OK. You got a whole team here that isis giving you a chance. Go ahead. Because I really do love to call on kids, because that\'s what this election is actually all about, is their future. [applause] QUESTION: My name is Relic Riley. I\'m from Massachusetts, and my mother over there is complaining that she does not get much more money than my father. My mother is an... [laughter] [applause] My mother is an engineer. I meant teacher. My father\'s the engineer. And II think that my mother is working more harder than my... [laughter] [applause] I don\'t know my grammar. I just don\'t know my grammar. I think my mother isn\'t working much harderis working more harder than my father, and she deserves to have more money. [laughter] Like, get more money than my father. [laughter] Because she\'s taking care of children, andI just don\'t think it\'s fair. CLINTON: That is really so sweet. [applause] CLINTON: Iyou have a great future as an advocate, andlook, II do think equal pay for equal work is still a problem. And I think the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I supported every year it came up when I was in the Senate, is really important to try to open up thethe pay arena to more transparency. Because right now, if you are doing a job, and you ask how much somebody else makes, you can be fired or retaliated against. And how are we ever gonna know that we get fair pay foryou know, not just women, although that\'s the biggest discrepancy, but particularly people who are inyou know, positions where it\'s hard to ask for more, because of theiryou know, their working conditions. I had a young man here in New Hampshire tell me the reason he was supporting me is because I was in favor of equal pay. And when I asked him why, he said because he got his first grown-up adult job when he was 17, and he went to work in the same store where his mother had workedthat\'s how he got the joband, his first pay period, brought his paycheck home, he showed his mother, and he watched her face fall. And he asked her why, and she said, ""you\'re making more now than I am making after four years on the same job."" And I said to himI said, so what was the reason? I mean, howhow did this add up? He said, ""you know, I tried to find out,"" and he said, ""basically the manager said, \'well, we like to identify young men who can go far in the company, and so we want to give you the incentive to stay and maybe get into one of our training programs.\'"" And I reallythis young man was very touching. He said, ""but they never asked my mom, and she\'s much more organized than I am."" [laughter] So I think that we still have problems, and if you deny those problems, you are denying the fastest way to increase incomes in America. And that is to make sure women are paid what they deserve in the job that they do. [applause] Thank you all, very much. Thank you. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 5, 2016",b'Interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC',"b'MATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary. This is a big interview for us. Twenty-two years we\'ve been doing this, and this is one of our big ones. I want to tell youwant to ask you about 12 questions tonight... CLINTON: OK. MATTHEWS: ... in two segments. I hope we get through them all. CLINTON: Thanks, Chris. MATTHEWS: Back in 2001, when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York, there was a different spirit in this country, including the Republican Party. You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East. It\'s not about Muslims. It\'s about terrorism. And he did it so effectively. And now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims, saying they\'re not allowed in the country, the whole works. What do you make of this? CLINTON: Well, it\'s deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9/11. And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that. And now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism. I view it as a threat. I believe ISIS cannot be contained. It has to be defeated. But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I\'m hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it\'s dangerous, counterproductive. And of course, we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism. And I\'ve laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done, and it does include an American-led air alliance, and we\'re doing that. And we\'re supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans, special forces, but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support, but not American combat troops. And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet. But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home. We have to work with our friends and allies around the world. And I know you just got back from Israel. We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other. And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere. And that\'s what I\'m advocating. MATTHEWS: That\'s why I\'m concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation, the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people, rather than the terroriststhis startedremember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore, Donald TrumpI mean, the fact is, Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant, he was probably a Muslim, he had ahe almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate, a phony birth announcement, and he was somehowin fact, he used to say thingsTrump would say things like, Nobody knew him in school, like he\'s some phantom impersonator, usurper. The Republican Party, every time he did that, said nothing. CLINTON: Right. MATTHEWS: Boehner, the speaker of the House, who was pretty much respected, wouldn\'tisn\'t this a Republican Party problem, that started with Trump\'s first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician, that it\'s ethnic with them? The president of the United States is one of the bad guys, one of theif not the terrorists, one of the sneaker-in-ers who snuck into the country and assumed an identity. It\'s pretty sick. CLINTON: Well, it\'s very divisive and I think counterproductive. It undermines our values, who we are as a people. We are a nation of immigrants, which you know so well. And when I hear what\'s coming from the other sideand it\'s not just one person. There\'s an echo chamber there. And it\'s very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand. We need to be united. And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it\'s about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be. That is not a sign of leadership. That\'s a sign of, you know, showmanship, of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people. MATTHEWS: By the way, you know, my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up. I had an Irish accent in the house. CLINTON: Yes? MATTHEWS: Let me ask you about guns... CLINTON: I would have guessed that. MATTHEWS: Yes. Well, let\'s talk about guns because you\'ve shown a lot of guts out there. And we know all the politics of guns. You know it. You ran with your husband. You ran before for president. There are states that have a real gun culture, including the state I grew up in, Pennsylvania. And you come from that part of the world, in a way. And you do come from [inaudible] Scranton... CLINTON: My father comes from, right. MATTHEWS: So you know there\'s a gun culture. How do you deal with that in Electoral College situations, where you\'ve got to beat a Republican come next November, hopefully, for you? How do youhow do you make sure that the gun people don\'t emotionally say, Oh, she\'s an enemy of guns? CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s important to be focused on what we can do together, and that\'s why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and what\'s called the Charleston loophole... MATTHEWS: Right. CLINTON: ... and to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from getting guns. And in fact, what I am proposing is supported by a great majority of the American people and a significant majority of gun owners. Just today at Osageyou were here when I was speaking to the crowdand then afterwards, I always take time so people can come up to me. Sometimes I do it publicly, a lot of times I do it privately, what\'s on their minds. And a man came up. He had a veterans cap on. And he said, you know, I\'m a gun owner, he said, but I don\'t see any reason why we can\'t do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: And he asked me, What can I do? I said, Well, please stand up against the NRA and the gun lobby. And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights. But I agree with you, Chris, it\'s going to be part of theyou know, the political debate, and frankly, the battle in a lot of parts of our country going forward. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: But it is so important, when we lose 90 people a day, 33,000 Americans every year, and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have, when you\'ve sat there and you\'ve listened to their stories about losing a child, losing a husband, losing a parentand I\'ve met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands, by, you know, more likely, gun and gangdeadly combination. I\'ve just so many people, from Columbine to Sandy Hook. I just can\'t remain silent. And I think we are at a turning point. And what I said to the man here is, you know, There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners, who know that their hunting rights... MATTHEWS: Moms Demand Action. CLINTON: ... their collecting rights, all of that is not going to be affected. So I\'m going to keep beating the drum, and I\'m delighted that the president announced the actions he did today. MATTHEWS: Well, you\'re back in this fight. CLINTON: I am. MATTHEWS: You know, you were here eight years ago. Here you are again. CLINTON: I am. I am. MATTHEWS: And I do wonder sometimes at you sometimes, your abilityyour... [laughter] To use the word ""stamina,"" that hasn\'t been used correctly lately. You know, I\'m a student of history, like you are, and I remember Nixon back in 1950 ran against Helen Gehagen Douglas. And she was one of the first women, liberal, to go out there... CLINTON: She is. MATTHEWS: ... progressives, to try to win a big seat. Right. And he used tohe said things like, You know, it\'s awfully hard on a woman. [laughter] He used these little shots at her. CLINTON: Yes. MATTHEWS: Here we are, two thirds of a century later... CLINTON: Right. MATTHEWS: ... and the leading Republican candidate is out saying that you don\'t have the stamina, the strengthis this sexism? Is it what it is? CLINTON: Well, you know, I have a new year\'s resolution... MATTHEWS: I know. I\'ve heard this... [crosstalk] CLINTON: I will not respond to his, you know... MATTHEWS: What does it say about the Republican... CLINTON: ... personal attacks. MATTHEWS: Well, let me try to phrase itI feel like a lawyer now. How do I rephrase? [laughter] How does the Republican Party deal with the fact they\'re voting for this guy, that 35 percent of people are supporting him, and even though he\'s making these charges, which a lot of people would say arewhy would he go after your stamina, rather than Bill\'s stamina or George McGovern\'s stamina or anybody else\'s, except you\'re a woman? CLINTON: Well, look... MATTHEWS: He\'s older than you. CLINTON: That\'s true. MATTHEWS: I\'m older than you. CLINTON: That\'s true! MATTHEWS: My stamina\'s all right. CLINTON: That\'s true. MATTHEWS: So why is he doing this? CLINTON: Well, why does he do whatever he does? I can only tell you what I hear from people, and what I hear from people is really about their lives and their future. I mean, lot of this back and forth that goes on... MATTHEWS: I know, but... CLINTON: ... in the political... MATTHEWS: ... he\'s winning. CLINTON: ... universewell, we\'ll see. We\'ll see. We haven\'t had a single caucus. We haven\'t had a single primary. The Republicans will have to choose whoever they decide to be their nominee, and I\'m looking forward, if I am so fortunate to be the nominee, to run against whoever they put up. I\'m just going to keep working really hard, like right out there today, you know, getting people to caucus for me, connecting them up with my great organizers. I have an amazing team here... MATTHEWS: OK... CLINTON: ... and we\'re just going to work as hard as we can to make my case. MATTHEWS: He ain\'t going to stop. He did an interview with my colleague, Joe Scarborough, this morning. It\'s going to air tomorrow morning. He\'s out there again saying he\'s going after your family. He said it\'s fair to go after them. CLINTON: Well, I just... MATTHEWS: He\'s just going to keep doing it. CLINTON: Well... MATTHEWS: He says you\'re an enabler. He\'s making it personal with you. CLINTON: Well, he can say whatever he wants to say. I\'m going to keep talking about what people talk to me about... MATTHEWS: OK. CLINTON: ... and what they talk to me about is, What will you do about prescription drug prices? MATTHEWS: By the way, you\'re good on that one. That\'s so true. CLINTON: Well, it\'s unbelievable what\'s happening to people! MATTHEWS: Everybody\'s taking drugs now, and you needif you have diabetes, like me, or somebody, everybody needs itif your parents died of Alzheimer\'syou talked about that out here. CLINTON: Yes. MATTHEWS: These are real things. CLINTON: These are real things that people talk to me about. MATTHEWS: OK... CLINTON: And I\'m going to be a president who does the big stuff that gets in the headlines, that, you know, you and other analysts and reporters talk about, and I\'m going to do the stuff that keeps people awake at night... MATTHEWS: OK... CLINTON: ... like, you know, making sure they can afford their prescription drugs. MATTHEWS: I want to say something nice about you. CLINTON: Oh, please! [laughter] MATTHEWS: No, I have to. I\'m personally responsible. Back when you had all the difficulty in the second administration of President Clinton, your husband, and you had a difficult situation you had to go throughand you went through it, and I think you were completely stunned by it initially, and then you had to deal with it as you became aware of what was going on. And what did you do? You didn\'t cry. You didn\'t go away and say, Gee, whiz, this is terrible, why am I going through this? What you did is you went out and you acted like a champion for Democrats. You went around the country campaigning like mad. You were the real banner carrier for the Democratic Party in \'98. And something interesting happened. An epiphany happened. Somehow, out there campaigning in New York for Chuck Schumer and other people, you said something to yourself. You said, You know what? Something good can come out of this for me. I can become a hero to people. And you ran for the Senate from New York, when a lot of people were critics of you, would have loved you to have fallen on your face. They would have eaten it up if you\'d gone down in a ditch up in New York and lostbecause at the time, you were running against Rudy... CLINTON: That\'s right. MATTHEWS: ... who looked unbeatable. CLINTON: That\'s right. MATTHEWS: And you had the guts to go out there. What made you do it? Because there\'s a lot of women watching right now. Half my viewers are women. And they want to hear what\'s it take for a woman to just rise out of a situation which is pretty bad and come out of it and say, You know what? I can rise to this occasion. How did you do it? CLINTON: Well, you know, that\'s a great question because I... MATTHEWS: Do you know the answer? CLINTON: I didn\'t have any sense that all of this would happen. I really didn\'t. MATTHEWS: Well, New York came and fell in love with you and said, We like you. CLINTON: Andand... MATTHEWS: Come up here, live up here, be our senator. CLINTON: They did, and Please run. And I said, no, no, no. I said no, no... MATTHEWS: Charlie Rangel...[crosstalk] CLINTON: Yes, and so many others. And I absolutely said no. And I\'ll tell you what changed my mind, and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news, like, Would she or wouldn\'t she, and I kept saying, I\'m not going to. And I was first lady going up to do an event in New York City to promote women in athletics, and Billie Jean King and great athletes were there. MATTHEWS: She\'s great. CLINTON: And so I was introduced by this young woman. I think she was, like, the volleyball or basketball captain. And I came up and shook her hand, and you know, I said, Great job. She leaned over to me and she said, Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton, dare to compete. And I thought, Wow. You know, I have encouraged so many women and girls to compete on the athletic fields, in academics... MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: ... in politics, in business, and I\'m being asked to compete. And it... MATTHEWS: And stick your neck out. CLINTON: And stick my neck out. And it is scary! It is. MATTHEWS: It\'s different than supporting your spouse, isn\'t it. CLINTON: Totally different. ?I mean, I had the hardest time when I started saying, I am me. I\'m happy to say, you know, my husband this, or candidate X or Y, but to stand up there and be the person out there... MATTHEWS: Wow. CLINTON: And it is a big challenge. And I think because, you know, we\'re coming into our own as women in all walks of life, but still, there\'s something a little bit daunting about... MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: ... holding yourself out, asking people to support you, to give you money, to vote for you. It\'s hard. MATTHEWS: And you know who went through that? Another New York senator, Bobby Kennedy. CLINTON: Yes.  [crosstalk] MATTHEWS: ... his brother\'s brother. CLINTON: I remember reading about that. MATTHEWS: And then all of a sudden, he had to be the guy and stuck his neck out. Anyway, we\'re going to come back and talk about... CLINTON: OK. MATTHEWS: ... you because Ithe way I look at politicsand you called me an analyst. I like that. I\'m an analyst. And I look at this race for president, 2016, which we\'re now in, and really, that list is closing. And a guy at Georgetown, a professor, once said, there\'s a difference between free will and free choice. Free choice means there\'s a limit number of choices. And it looks like there\'s a limited number of choices for the president of the United States coming in 2016, and you\'re one of them. We\'ll be right back and talk about Hillary Clinton as the possibly the nextin fact, the first-ever woman commander-in-chief of the United States. [commercial break] MATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, you may have a new title if this campaign is successful. You have to win the primary. You got to beat Bernie. You got to beat Martin O\'Malley. But if all that happens, then you have to beat whoever on the Republican side, you could be the first woman commander-in-chief. And this is all happening, perhaps coincidentally, or maybe culturally, when Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense, has just made it clear now that all combat roles are open to women. This is something unique in our history. Now, maybe every woman doesn\'t want these jobs. CLINTON: Right. MATTHEWS: But these jobs are now open. You can go out there and be infantry. You can go out there, you know, with a knife in your teeth and you can go swinging on ropes into whatever valley you got to go kill people in. Women are going to be doing that, just like in Israel, where I just was. How\'s our country going to adapt to that? And is it important culturally for us to have women in this combat role? CLINTON: I think it\'s important to open up all roles to women, but I also agree with Secretary Carter that you have to have standards. And women and men have to meet those standards because we\'re talking literally life or death. So I am... MATTHEWS: You mean like climbing ropes and things like that. CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your, you know, fellow soldiers will need that one day. And so I am a huge supporter of women being able to break whatever glass ceilings are holding them back... MATTHEWS: If they can physically handle it. CLINTON: They\'ve got to be ableand mentally. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: You know, itphysically, mentally, you have to be prepared. You have to be ready. And I think that you\'re right, not every woman\'s going to want to do that, and some of the women who want to do it are not going to qualify. But we just had a few women pass Ranger school, which is an enormously... MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: ... competitive, grueling experience. It was just less than a handful, but they proved they could do it. And from everything I know, nobody cut any slack for them. They did it. And in fact, after it was over, they interviewed some of the, you know, male competitors... MATTHEWS: Right. CLINTON: ... to go through Ranger school, and these guys said, You know, after a while, I didn\'t even notice. I mean, yes, you\'re right, she was a woman. She carried her weight. She pulled her own. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: That\'s what you want because I think about the job that I\'m applying for, and it really is a job interview that I\'m doing all over America. MATTHEWS: Commander-in-chief. CLINTON: President and commander-in-chief. And I feel ready to fulfill both roles. I think it\'s important that the next president get the economy working for everybody so that we don\'t keep having the deck stacked for those on the top. We\'ve got to stay safe at home and strong in the world. And we\'ve got to deal with these problems that keep people up at night, I like to say. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: I feel particularly well prepared to do every part of the job. And when it comes to being commander-in-chief, my eight years as a senator from New York after 9/11, my four years as secretary of state, my many, many hours in the Situation Room, I know how hard these choices are. MATTHEWS: You were there when Osama was killed. CLINTON: I was. You know, I was one of the very few people that was brought in to advise the president. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: And it was the most... MATTHEWS: You said, Go for it. CLINTON: I did. I did, you know, after, as I say, sitting through hours of meetings, listening to the intelligence being presented, listening to Admiral McRaven, who was then the head of special forces, talk about, you know, what special forces could do, looking at other options... MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: ... like a cruise missile or a Predatorarmed predator, and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option, and then being there that day, watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room, just holding my breath literally through the whole thing. I know how hard these choices are. And I know what a cool, deliberative head needs to be finally making them. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: I have learned so much, Chris, over the last years. I feel very ready. MATTHEWS: You have theyou know who said you had the temperament for it? Bill Clinton, which I thought was interesting, because he would know your temperament. CLINTON: Yes. Yes. MATTHEWS: Let me ask about your sort of position on this. You voted for the Iraq War authorization, if not the war. Bernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one. Of course, he\'s coming from the left on you. You have got Rand Paul out there, who is a libertarian and a bit of aI would say a bit of a dove, saying that you would be more for regime change, that you would start the next war. CLINTON: Yes. Well, he\'s wrong. He is wrong. MATTHEWS: They\'re positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama. CLINTON: Yes. Right. MATTHEWS: Howwhere would youyou read Fred Hiatt of ""The Washington Post"" the other day... CLINTON: Yes. MATTHEWS: ... position you as someone, I thought, a notch to the hawkish side, because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria. You were for ground troops, but not necessarily our troops, but some... CLINTON: Right. MATTHEWS: Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where toto tell them where to drop the bombs. CLINTON: Right. Exactly. Right. MATTHEWS: Does that make you more hawkish than the president? CLINTON: Well, I think most of what I have been advocating, the president is now doing. MATTHEWS: But not that. CLINTON: Well, we have special forces on the ground. He sent them. MATTHEWS: But no-fly zone? CLINTON: But the no-fly zone, for me, was an idea that I developed with some advisers. MATTHEWS: Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there? CLINTON: Well, of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: And we were making progress. I don\'t know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, you know, for the last four years, we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going. And I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room. I saw the no-fly zone as leverage. Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have toand I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones. If we\'re going to be operating on the ground, advising the Kurds, the Arabs, we need safe zones. We also need safe places for civilians, so that they\'re not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria. And it can be done. It can be done in a way that doesn\'t create more problems. But now I\'mI\'m very supportive of what the president\'s doing. We\'re making some progress. And I have been calling for that, calling for reconstituting the approach toward the sheiks, the Sunni sheiks in Anbar Province, getting them back into the fight, so to speak. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: They are. Rebuilding the Iraqi army. MATTHEWS: Yes. That\'s what we need. CLINTON: We need that. MATTHEWS: We need the Sunnis to retake their land, because the Shia can\'t do it. CLINTON: We need thewell, the still largely Shia Iraqi army took Ramadi, but with Sunni troops. MATTHEWS: Army. They have to turn it over to Sunnis. CLINTON: And then turn it over. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: This makes all the sense in the world to me. So, I view myself as being a realist, being practical, and in accordance with our values, because I think it\'s very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security. If the United States doesn\'t do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East, no one will. So this is not a choice. It\'s not a luxury. It\'s a necessity. MATTHEWS: OK. Last question. We\'re running out of time. I want to try to help you for this audience tonight, our audience, locate yourself politically in this country. [laughter] Now, we have Trump out there and we have Bernie out here. Now, Bernie calls himself a socialist. Nobody uses a derogatory term anymore. It\'she loves to have that label. He\'s never ran as a Democrat. He runs against Democrats up there in Vermont. You\'re a Democrat. I would say you\'re a pretty typical Democrat in the tradition of the Democratic Party, and Humphrey, the rest of them, Scoopnot even Scoop. I would say Mondale. You\'re somewhere in there. What\'s the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? CLINTON: Well, you have to... MATTHEWS: Is that a question you want to answer, or would you rather not?  [crosstalk] CLINTON: Well, you would have to ask...  [crosstalk] MATTHEWS: Well, see, I\'m asking you. You\'re a Democrat. He\'s a socialist. Would you like somebody to call you a socialist? I wouldn\'t like somebody calling me a socialist. CLINTON: Well, but I\'m not one. I\'m not one. MATTHEWS: OK. Well, what\'s the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? Last question. CLINTON: Well, I can tell you what I am. I am a progressive Democrat. I am a progressive Democrat... MATTHEWS: How is that different than a socialist? CLINTON: ... who likes to get things done and who believes that we\'re better off in this country when we\'re trying to solve problems together, getting people to work together. There will always be strong feelings, and I respect that, from, you know, the far right, the far left, libertarians, whateverwhoever it might be. We need to get people working together. We have got to get the economy fixed. We have got to get all of our problems, you know, really tackled. And that\'s what I want to do. MATTHEWS: I know. Yes, I think the difference isand Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn\'t answer the question either I asked her, because I know, politically, you have to keep together. The center-left and the left has to work together. I know all that. Let me ask you about working together. You gave a nice speech here today in Osage about the need to workI wrote a book about Tip and Reagan. When it comes to an urgent issue, they can find a solution. CLINTON: Right. MATTHEWS: ObamaI have always supported the president on his philosophy, on his general approach to a lot of things. But he doesn\'t seem to like the company of fellow politicians. He just doesn\'t. He doesn\'t want to hang out with them, play cards with them at midnight. Maybe he did it in Springfield. For some reason, he doesn\'t want to do it in Washington. You seem to like the company of people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. And you can find a way, go on CODELs with them and getting along with them. And it seems to me that is an important part of life, that you have to findyou were talking about Tom DeLay here. And I get along with Tom DeLay. Even though you disagree 180 on something, you have got to findCongress means coming together. CLINTON: Yes. Well, your book is a perfect example of... MATTHEWS: ""Tip and the Gipper."" CLINTON: Exactly. And, look, there may be... MATTHEWS: You read it? CLINTON: I did. MATTHEWS: Thank you. CLINTON: I don\'tI don\'t want you to know that, but I did. MATTHEWS: But you have just told me that. I like this. You\'re throwing me an encomium here. [laughter] CLINTON: No, because Ibecause I am always looking for ways that we work together. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: And it used to be easier in the past. MATTHEWS: It did. CLINTON: I think that the polarization has gotten so acute now, and so you have to work even harder. But relationships are the beginning of everything. MATTHEWS: So, you could imagine, if you\'re fortunate to become the next president of the United States, having people over to the White House, not going to the Jefferson Hotel for an hour-and-a-half, but actually having people come over and talk it over? CLINTON: Yes, well... MATTHEWS: By the way, you\'re an empty nester, so it\'s easier for you. CLINTON: It is easier. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: It is much easier. And, look, everybody has strengths that they bring to this position. And, obviously... MATTHEWS: Is schmoozing one of yours? CLINTON: Well, I think that I like it, because I am looking for that common ground somewhere. MATTHEWS: Yes. Yes. CLINTON: And I don\'t think that you get it just on the first try. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: You have got to listen to people. You got to get to know people. You got to look for ways that you can reach across the aisle. MATTHEWS: Yes. CLINTON: I\'m not saying it\'s going to be magic, because part of what\'s happenedand it is different from when Tip O\'Neill and President Reagan were working togetherit is so much more gerrymandered. It\'s so much more influenced... MATTHEWS: I know. You don\'t have any Republicans in a Democratic district. CLINTON: Not anymore. MATTHEWS: You don\'t have any Democrats in a Republican district. CLINTON: And so people don\'t feel like they have to make deals. MATTHEWS: OK. I have been telling people for years that, when they\'re with you personally, you\'re very different and you\'re very easy to talk to. [laughter] I think, watching you the last 20 minutes, they get the point. CLINTON: Thank you. MATTHEWS: I think this has been a great interview. And I appreciate you for coming on and giving us the time. CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. Great to see you. MATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 10, 2016","b'Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News ""Face the Nation""'","b'DICKERSON: We\'re going to get right to our lead guest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Chappaqua, New York, this morning. Good morning, Secretary Clinton. I want to start with politics. We\'re going to talk about a lot today, but let\'s start with politics. A new NBC/""Wall Street Journal""/Marist poll says in Iowa it\'s 48-45, you over Sanders. You were once way ahead. So, what\'s happening? CLINTON: Oh, John, you know these polls go up, they go down. I stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further. And that\'s why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can. And those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents, and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running. DICKERSON: This week, another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department. One of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that won\'t come through. And you directed him to -- quote -- ""turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure."" Aren\'t you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there? CLINTON: No, not at all. And as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen. And it never would have happened, because that\'s just not the way I treated classified information. Headings are not classification notices. And so, oftentimes, we\'re trying to get the best information we can. And, obviously, what I\'m asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn\'t come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system. So, no, there is nothing to that, like so much else that has been talked about in the last year. DICKERSON: So, in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this, this process. You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information. So you\'re saying there was never an instance, any other instance in which you did that? CLINTON: No. And it wasn\'t sent. So, I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely, look, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture. But, oftentimes, there\'s a lot of information that isn\'t at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That\'s true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government. But the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn\'t appropriate. And, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it\'s another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there\'s no there there. DICKERSON: Well, this one is a little different, since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with. Let me ask you about another e-mail in this batch, which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail, which is what you were doing. Why was that a surprise to you? CLINTON: Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system. And, indeed, the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system. So, that\'s how I conducted the business. I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts. DICKERSON: On gun control this week, you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders, specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers. He has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly. So, isn\'t that what you want? CLINTON: No, that\'s not what I want. And that\'s not what the country wants. And that\'s not what President Obama called for. And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability. It\'s the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences. You know, President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time. Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby. Senator Sanders voted with them, and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed. That has to be the effort that we all are behind. And he often says, well, look, I\'m from Vermont and it\'s different. It\'s not like being in New York City. Well, in fact, the other senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, voted with President Obama and myself. So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference. And it\'s a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people\'s lives a day? I\'m pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating. DICKERSON: On Senator Sanders\' response, this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners, you were a senator. You -- aren\'t you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street, and that\'s what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy. And you have suggested that, as president, you would be different than you did as senator, when you were representing a state with a constituency. CLINTON: Well... DICKERSON: So, why isn\'t it fair for Bernie Sanders to say, as president, I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners? CLINTON: Well, you know, I think you have really mixed up two important issues here. I have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions. In fact, I supported the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted against it five times. So, there is a very clear difference. And when it comes to Wall Street, yes, I represented New York. And I was proud to do so. And I took on Wall Street. I\'m the person who came out against derivatives. I\'m the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay, which, thankfully, got into the Dodd- Frank bill. I\'m the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007. I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market. So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street. And I will continue to do so as president. And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street, so we never again face what we did in 2008, has been judged as being more comprehensive, tougher, more effective by Barney Frank, by Sherrod Brown, my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate, and by Paul Krugman. So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry. DICKERSON: Right. CLINTON: And I think I\'m well-prepared. I know what needs to be done. It\'s kind of like Nixon going to China, John. DICKERSON: All right, Senator, let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face. That is Donald Trump. You got into a pretty ugly exchange. You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism, and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Your reaction to that? CLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that\'s his prerogative. You know, so be it. I\'m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman\'s right to make the most personal health care decisions. That\'s why I\'m so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I\'m going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports. So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It\'s been too hard-fought-for. And I\'m going to stand up and make it clear there\'s a huge difference between us. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, what do you say, though, to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husband\'s career is fair game to talk about in an election? CLINTON: Well, it\'s been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to. That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign. Didn\'t work before. It won\'t work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future. What are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend women\'s rights, who will defend marriage equality, who will defend voter rights? So, I can\'t run anybody else\'s campaign. They can say whatever they want. More power to them. I think it\'s a dead end, blind alley for them, but let them go. I\'m going to talk about the differences between us, because I think that\'s what Americans care about. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, I\'m afraid we\'re at a dead end ourselves and out of time. [laughter] DICKERSON: Thanks so much for being with us. CLINTON: Thanks. Let\'s continue the conversation, John. DICKERSON: See you out there.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 13, 2016",b'Interview with Alisyn Camerota of CNN',"b'CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa. CLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: We are in Ames, Iowa -- CLINTON: Yes. CAMEROTA:where the temperature as we speak is one degree. CLINTON: Uh-hm. CAMEROTA: And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and I\'m wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices? CLINTON: Absolutely, no. You know, I grew up in Chicago. I\'m used to cold weather. It doesn\'t bother me. In fact, I\'m somewhat reassured that there is a real winter, that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures. But I get up every day whether I\'m in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time. CAMEROTA: So, let\'s talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa. And he said that your campaign is in, quote, ""serious trouble."" Is that how you feel? CLINTON: Not at all. In fact, I have always known that if you are going to run to be president, particularly in the Democratic Party, it\'s a long, hard, challenging road. And so I\'ve been in these elections before. They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds, as they look at the candidates, totally predictable. I feel really, really good about the campaign organization that I have. A caucus is different from a primary. It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I\'m asking Iowans if they\'ll stand up for me on caucus night. I will be standing up for them all through my presidency. CAMEROTA: There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa. It is 49 percent to 44 percent. It is the first time that this has happened that he\'s been beating you in Iowa since September. We are 20 days out. Does he have more momentum than you? CLINTON: Well, the funny thing Alisyn is, after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up. I don\'t pay any attention to this. I don\'t feel that it\'s a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night. I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building. That\'s my experience. So I\'ll let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up. I\'m looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me. CAMEROTA: Why don\'t you feel that the polls are good reflection of what\'s going to happen in the caucus? CLINTON: Because they are so unpredictable. And it\'s gotten increasingly difficult to poll. And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus. So, that\'s been my experience. I\'ve watched this a long time. I\'ve had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa. So, I just put that aside. I\'ll let pundits and others worry about who\'s up and who\'s down. I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences. And we need a spirited debate. Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention. And now I know it\'s, you know, the make or break time, people make up their minds. CAMEROTA: Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire. Not surprising. He is from a neighboring state. Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is? CLINTON: I don\'t think about that. I\'m going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary. But this is a national campaign. We\'ve been organizing in South Carolina, in Nevada, a lot of the March 1st states, the March 15th states. Remember, I campaigned all the way into June last time. And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people\'s concerns going into this election, that we wouldn\'t know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses. So, I\'m going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me. And even though as you say, Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire, I\'m going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me, as well. CAMEROTA: Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating. He said that he thinks it\'s about Senator Sanders\' positions on income inequality. And the Vice President said, quote, ""It\'s relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. That\'s been Bernie\'s. No one questions Bernie\'s authenticity on those issues."" What\'s your reaction? CLINTON: Well, the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend, went on to say as I recall. But, you know, Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on. Look, I have been working toward closing the gaps between people, poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life. I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas. I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people. I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband\'s administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured. I have been on this issue in many different ways. How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course that\'s tied to income equality, but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing. And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay. A lot of the abuses that I thought were there. I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession. I stood up to Wall Street. I called them out. So I have a very long record. I have a broader agenda. It\'s not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that\'s what I tried to do. CAMEROTA: And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this, why do you think the Vice President would say, it\'s more in Bernie\'s wheelhouse and it\'s about his authenticity? CLINTON: Oh, I don\'t know. But you know, I have a lot of regard for the vice president. And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State. Well, when I was Secretary of State, I couldn\'t talk about domestic policy. There is an unwritten rule, you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter, secretary of defense. So yes, for four years, despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues, there were four years when I did not. I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, how we\'re going to, you know, deal with a rising China, what we\'re going to do about women\'s rights, something that goes to the heart of inequality. So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job. CAMEROTA: So, you didn\'t take Biden\'s comments as a slight? CLINTON: No. Not at all. CAMEROTA: OK. You are introducing your tax plan. One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million. And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years. Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality? CLINTON: Well, we\'ve got a variety of proposals. Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge. The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million, limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception. Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future. So I have put forth plans, paid family leave, tuition, debt-free tuition for public colleges. Capping prescription drug costs and much more. And it would cost about $100 billion a year, all of which I pay for. In contrast, Senator Sanders has some very big ideas, but he hasn\'t yet told anybody how he would pay for them. And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st. Well, if you wait too long, nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them. And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it. CAMEROTA: Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy. CLINTON: Uh-hm. CAMEROTA: We just watched this very emotional event this morning. CLINTON: Yes. CAMEROTA: That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children -- CLINTON: Right -- CAMEROTA:to gun violence got up and spoke. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her. It sounds like she lost her children to criminals. CLINTON: Yes. CAMEROTA: So, how would you stop that? CLINTON: This is a very big difference in this campaign. Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members. It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence. And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now. We lose on an average 90 people a day. It has to stop, Alisyn. I\'ve been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what\'s called the Charleston loophole. You know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not. The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record. We have saved a lot of lives. I can\'t put an exact number on it. But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns. So, we are talking about violent criminals. We are talking about domestic abusers. We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill. We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won\'t close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns. I feel passionately about this. And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon, the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years, I think it certainly motivated the President, and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign. [break] CAMEROTA: I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign, that isare allegations from your husband\'s past. He is going further actually than that. He is making it about you. He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault. What\'s your response to Donald Trump? CLINTON: I have no response. I\'m going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes. I\'m going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th, 2017. I have deep disagreements with what he\'s proposing. His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations. He doesn\'t believe in equal pay. He thinks that American workers are already making too much. So, I\'m going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing. CAMEROTA: But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault, don\'t you need to respond to it? I mean, particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail. Can\'t this sexual assaultyou say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard. So, when he\'s accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about, don\'t you need to address it? CLINTON: I\'m going to let the American voters decide what\'s relevant and what\'s not relevant in their decision as to who they\'re going to support. CAMEROTA: I have a few more questions. Donald Trump was on ""The Tonight Show"" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other, if that\'s how this all plays out in November. He said that would be, quote, ""an amazing thing."" [laughter] CLINTON: Yes, it would be amazing. I would look forward to it. Look, I think this is serious business. Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters. That\'s part of the political process. This is really serious business, who the next president is. We are either going to build on the progress that we\'ve made or we\'re going to see it ripped away. We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and women\'s rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers\' rights and all the rest that is at stake, or we are going to turn the clock back. And that\'s why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high. And if I\'m fortunate enough to get the nomination, I will run hard against whomever the Republicans\' nominee, because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country. I don\'t want to see that happen. CAMEROTA: Let\'s say you get the nomination. Let\'s say you win the presidency. CLINTON: Yes, let\'s say that. CAMEROTA: Let\'s say it. And on day one, you walk into the Oval Office, what\'s the first phone call you make? CLINTON: Well, I think the very first phone call would be to whoever I\'ve asked to be the chief of staff of the White House. Let\'s get a meeting together, let\'s get our agenda together. There\'s a lot we have to get going. The earlier we start, the better we\'ll be off and we\'ll get more accomplished. Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet. What\'s the legislative agenda? You know, the time between an election and inauguration is short. You can\'t wait. I mean, you can\'t take anything for granted. You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can, but I think it\'s important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made. You lose time. And you\'re not doing the work that the American people elected you to do. CAMEROTA: Before I let you go, I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter. You talk about her on the campaign trail. Today is I believe or recently, Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail. CLINTON: Yes. CAMEROTA: She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign. How so? CLINTON: Well, she\'s right, because I feel very fortunate. I like to point out I\'m the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant. Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania. So, here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president. And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer. And so, I think a lot about the future, but I think not just about her future because we\'re going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer, but I think about what kind of country she\'ll become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her. I want to make sureit\'s not just our grandchild, but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible. And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make. It\'s not, you know, you have to have family support, you have to have community support. I wrote a book called ""It Takes A Village."" I understand that. Do you kids have health care? That\'s why I created the children\'s health care insurance program, because too many didn\'t. Your kids have good education, that\'s why I\'m for early childhood, because too many kids come to school unprepared. How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they can\'t afford to start or stay. I go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now. And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again. CAMEROTA: And when you think about your grandchildren\'s future, are you worried or hopeful? CLINTON: I\'m always hopeful, Alisyn. I\'m always hopeful. I think this is the greatest country. When I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans, I mean, look at what we\'ve come back from. It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession. That is just a fact. President Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don\'t think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again. So, I know that choices really matter in politics, but I am absolutely committed to the belief, the conviction that I have that our country is resilient, we\'re strong, we\'re smart. Given the right leadership, we can do anything. That\'s why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future. CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much. CLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Great to talk to you. CLINTON: It\'s great to see you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 17, 2016","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News ""This Week""'","b""STEPHANOPOULOS: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses. Secretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of tonight's big debate. Good morning, Madam Secretary. CLINTON: Good morning, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that back and forth between you and Bernie Sanders, but first the news that the American hostages from Iran are heading home this morning. Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says it's going to create incentives for other U.S. adversaries to take hostages. Does he have a point? CLINTON: Well, look, I'm pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran. They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home. So I applaud the fact that that's happened. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still. But I think this is a part of what we're going to be pursuingpersistent, patient diplomacy. Today's also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement. They have shipped out the vast majority, I think it's up to 98 percent, of their enriched uranium. They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat. They have destroyed centrifuges. So this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Irantheir aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else. But the fact that we've put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the campaign right now. A strange series of events yesterday. The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that they'd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders' health records. Sanders campaign struck back, calling that vile. Your campaign disavowed it. It appeared to go away. So what is relevant here and what's not? Should age and health be an issue in this campaign? CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, I put out my medical records. I think you've been around long enough to know, George, this is all part of the expectation. But I think it's fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country. But we have differences. And that's what I'm focusing on now. We're going to have a spirited debate, I expect, tonight in Charleston. Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences. And one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns. You know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position. And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers. Now, I was happy when - STEPHANOPOULOS: He now supports taking that away. CLINTON: Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability. And I'm delighted that he has had a change of heart. I think that's all for the good. Now I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole. That's a provision he also voted for, that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed. And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited. And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study. So I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence. And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on. I hope he will continue to move. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we're going to ask him about that in a few minutes. Another big difference on health care. He wants to replace Obamacare with a single payer system, Medicare for all. So are you against that because it's a bad idea or because it's not practical? Would a single payer system be better if you could get it passed? CLINTON: Well, first, I share the goal of universal health care. You know very well that I threw myself into that back in '93 and '94 and still have the scars to show for it. So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality, affordable health care. But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it. The Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs. Let's deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs. That, I think, is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what I'm advocating. STEPHANOPOULOS: You also have your differences over Wall Street. We've heard a little bit of that going into this. And I was struck this morning, American Crossroads, a super PAC founded by Karl Rove, who, of course, worked for President George W. Bush, has just launched this online ad in Iowa. [begin video clip] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton's gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa. Hillary rewarded Wall Street with the $700 billion bailout. Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire. CLINTON: I represented Wall Street. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh, you sure did, Hillary. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, that echoes the points being made by Bernie Sanders in his campaign. Are you worried that your ties to Wall Street are weighing you down? CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think it shows how desperate the Republicans are to prevent me from becoming the nominee. I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans. I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them. And I will win. So I think this just proves my point, that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican. With the back and forth on Wall Street, I think it's, you know, look, I have stood up to Wall Street even though I did represent New York. I have advocated for changes. But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry. That would include President Obama, who took more anyone ever had in 2008. That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s. The same with Barney Frank, who has actually written about this. You know, that is just a false charge. But in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans. In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us. And I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities. I've gotten so much more from students and teachers. Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women. So I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me. STEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning. CLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you, George."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 17, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""'","b'TODD: But we start with the Democrats and a Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders race that has turned out to be much closer than the experts thought especially the Clinton campaign. In fact, we have some brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll numbers out this morning and it does have some good news for the Clinton campaign. Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent. But in Iowa the story has been very different. Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the ""Des Moines Register"" had Clinton up by just 2. Bottom line, it\'s too close to call. So as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina. Good morningSecretary Clinton. CLINTON: Good morning, Chuck. TODD: Let me start with the Iran deal. Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N. Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions, designations and firm results. So I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran, they\'re still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange. Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program? CLINTON: Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I\'m very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran\'s nuclear weapons program but I\'ve also said that the way we\'re going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles. So I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That\'s a good sign. We still don\'t see Bob Levinson coming home, there\'s more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we\'re going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk. And when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we\'re going to continue to be focused on. TODD: Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States? CLINTON: Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I\'ve said for some time now is I\'d rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us. TODD: All right. Let me move to the campaign. To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa, why your lead has shrunk in Iowa, we spoke to a number of voters. I want to play three sound bites from Iowa voters about some potential pause they have regarding your candidacy. I\'m going to play it and get you to respond on the other side. [begin video clip] JAY HELTON, O\'MALLEY SUPPORTER: You get the impression from her that she believes maybe the rules don\'t apply to her. Or the same rules don\'t apply to her that apply to everybody else. NATASHA NEWCOMB, SANDERS SUPPORTER: She\'s worked really hard and done some amazing things I just feel that Bernie Sanders is kind ofhas a little bit more fire lit up in people. SALLY WILSON, CLINTON SUPPORTER: Well, I hear people talking about questioning her honesty. And I don\'t necessarily do that but I think that\'s one thing people are kind of not sure and they\'ve felt that way about Bill Clinton, too. So I think some of that rubs off. [end video clip] TODD: Madam Secretary, how do you answer that pause. This is from Democratssome pause that they have. CLINTON: Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can\'t speak for anybody else but I\'ve worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1. And I\'ve also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I\'m going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that\'s why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we\'re going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1. TODD: You know, another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you don\'t ideologically fit. This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week. 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist. Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist. You, in the last debate, said you were a capitalist. Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist. If you don\'t win Iowa, do you think that\'s the reason? CLINTON: Oh, I don\'t know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it\'s not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead. That\'s why I\'ve got a very vigorous jobs agenda. That\'s why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing, through infrastructure, through clean energy, through the kinds of plans that I\'ve been putting out. Look, when we have a Democrat in the White Housea Democratwe do that better economically. We saw that when my husband was president, we\'ve watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I\'m very confident that I know what will work if we have athe right commitment as a nation and that\'s what I want to do as president. TODD: Let me ask you about whethergoing with Chicagoright now, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident. Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement? CLINTON: Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald. I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department. This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we\'ve got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard. TODD: But do you think he still has the credibility to do that? CLINTON: Well, that\'s going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove. TODD: Very quickly, the movie ""13 Hours"" about the incident in Benghazi. I know there\'s a lot of chatter about the movie itself. But let me ask youthe controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens. Looking back, do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life? CLINTON: Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything. And I can\'t speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm\'s waymilitary or civilian, diplomats or our soldierswe take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it. TODD: All right. Secretary Clinton, I have to leave it there. We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate. CLINTON: Great. TODD: That\'s right here on NBC. Thank you. CLINTON: Thanks a lot. TODD: You got it. END LOAD-DATE: January 17, 2016 LANGUAGE: ENGLISH PUBLICATION-TYPE: Transcript Copyright 2016 Federal News Service, Inc. All Rights Reserved '"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 17, 2016","b'Interview with Jake tapper of CNN\'s ""State of the Union""'","b'TAPPER: We\'re joined right off the bat by Democratic candidate for president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us. On Saturday, you called for new sanctions against Iran for its ballistic missile program. That prompted a response from another American who was once held prisoner in Iran, Shane Bauer, one of the hikers released in 2011. He had some tough words for you on Twitter, writingquote""Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions now? As far as we know, four of the Americans are still in Iran. Totally irresponsible""unquote. He also said, whenever he was in Iran, whenever he heard your voice, his heart would sink, becausequote""All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions."" I want to give you awe chance to respond. CLINTON: Well, look, I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison. And we were very happy that we were able to get him and the two other hikers back home. But we have a very clear path we are pursuing with Iran. I am pleased that we do have an agreement that is being implemented. And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with. But we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction. That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran, and that I support. So, when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N. supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn\'t mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon. So, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I\'m proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it. And there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community. TAPPER: Let\'s turn to politics, obviously a big night tonight, a Democratic debate. You will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new, more contentious phase of the election, with just a week and atwo weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses. One of your top allies, David Brock, is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records. The Sanders campaigncampaign manager, Jeff Weaver, he called thisquote""one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable."" Who\'s right there, David Brock or Jeff Weaver? [laughter] CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know anything about it, but I have released my medical records. And I remember being asked frequently for me to do so. And, so, obviously that\'s, you know, something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign. But this is a spirited debate, because, although we share some very similar goals for our country, we have differences. And Senator Sanders has been pointing them out. One of my biggest differences has been on guns. And I\'m very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation. Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole, and join legislation to close that, because it\'s been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats, in fact, Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer. And that\'s what I intend to do. TAPPER: One of your major lines of attack against Bernie Sanders, in addition to the gun one that you just leveled, has been on his proposal for single-payer health care. Back in 1994, you said a single-payer system administrated by the states would actually lower health care costs. Take a listen. [begin video clip from 1994]CLINTON (in 1994): Single-payer would have lower costs. And one of the reasons that the president has a provision in his approach that guarantees states can go single-payer is to permit states that are able to do that to start down the single-payer road. [end video clip] TAPPER: Now, I know that was a long time ago, but you said in the Q&A; single-payer would not be politically feasible. In a perfect world, do you believe that single-payer would ultimately lower health care costs? CLINTON: Well, I believe in universal health care. And I think we have now, finally, after many decades of efforts, thanks to President Obama, a plan that will get us to universal health care. It\'s the Affordable Care Act. So, I\'m not interested in what the Republicans are trying to do, which is to repeal it, as they consistently vote to do. And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how we\'re going to provide quality, affordable health care to everybody. So, I\'m... TAPPER: Right, but just on the merits. CLINTON: ... very focused onwell, the merits are we need to get to universal health care. That is the merit. The merit is, how do we get to universal health care, where everybody\'s covered, where everybody can afford it? We have had some experimentation with states. Actually, Vermont tried to do single-payer. They found that the cost and the taxes that were required were prohibitive. Colorado now has a referendum on its ballot, so it\'s going to also pursue it. I\'m a big believer in letting states experiment. But when it comes to where we are right now, in 2016, I\'m going to defend, protect, and improve the Affordable Care Act. TAPPER: For years, you have been very protective of your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, especially when she was a child, of course, and now she\'s a grown woman. This week, she surprised a lot of people when she unleashed one of the most scathing attacks of the cycle, accusing Bernie Sanders of wanting to empower Republican governors who might then cut people\'s health care. PolitiFact called Chelsea\'s remarks mostly false. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said it was not an honest attack. And liberal columnist Mark Shields said the attack turned your daughter into aquote""political hack."" Do you think it was a mistake to muddy up Chelsea like that? CLINTON: Look, she was asked a question. I love my daughter. And she answered a question. And all I can say, Jake, is that the only health plan we know of from Senator Sanders is what\'s described in the legislation that he has introduced nine times in the Congress, in the Senate. And it does turn all of the programs we know of that provide health care over to the states. The federal government would provide a big portion of the cost, but states would be mandated to also pay considerably, about 14 percent of the cost. That\'s what\'s in his bill. So, I think anyone who wants to compare and contrast, since we don\'t have any more current plan from Senator Sanders, has to look at the legislation that he introduced. And, yes, if it were going to be state-run, then governors, Republican and Democrat alike, would bear responsibility for appropriating the funds and administrating it, according to Senator Sanders\' own legislative proposals. TAPPER: So, no regrets about using Chelsea that way? CLINTON: Oh, I didn\'t use her. She answered a question. And, you know, she gave a factual answer, based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing, because he introduced it nine times in the Congress. TAPPER: OK. PolitiFact said it was mostly false, but let\'s move on. A new movie opened this weekend. It\'s called ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" It\'s a cinematic version of a book, a nonfiction book, telling the story of the six private security contractors who defended the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, from an attack by Islamic militants. Are you planning to see it at all? CLINTON: I\'m just too busy campaigning. I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can, as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testified to over 11 hours, to make sure that nothing like that happens again, insofar as we are able to prevent it. And that\'s my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harm\'s way. TAPPER: Let\'s talk about ISIS. It\'s a big concern among many Americans. I know that you\'re very reluctant to criticize President Obama, and I understand that. But I want to ask you about the situation in Syria on the ground, because Anne-Marie Slaughter, who is the former director of policy planning at the State Department under you, she told me on my show ""THE LEAD that, if President Obama had listened to you about arming the Syrian moderates years ago, there\'s aquote""very good chance that we would not be facing ISIS like we are now."" Do you agree? CLINTON: Well, we will never know the answer to that question. Obviously, I thought, at the time, it was the right approach. And I advocated for it, along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus, because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war, when, on one side, you had Assad\'s army backed by Iran, and now we know also backed by Russia, against a group of people who wanted more freedom, wanted to live in dignity, not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime, that it would be a pretty uneven match, to be understating that, and it could open territory for terrorist groups, foreign fighters, and others to come in. So, let\'s talk about where we are now. And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now, with more nations joining the United States, which is in the lead, to try to go after ISIS leadership, infrastructure, other assets, also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS, and what else we need to do to build up those forces, the Iraqi army, which has had some success taking back Ramadi, Sunni tribal fighters, which we have to get back into the fight, and that is beginning to happen, and supporting the Kurdish fighters, who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border, by helping to equip and support them. So, we have a clear mission to deprive ISIS of territory. And there is some movement, positive movement on that. And then we have to cut off their foreign fighters, their foreign funding, and take them onlinetake them on online, so that they are no longer able to recruit and propagandize, which keeps their flow of fighters and money coming. TAPPER: I\'m told we\'re out of time. I just have one last question for you. In terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private e-mail server, have you been interviewed by the FBI yet? CLINTON: No. TAPPER: You haven\'t. All right, Secretary Clinton, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time. Good luck with the debate tonight. CLINTON: Thanks. Thanks, Jake.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 24, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""'","b'TODD: This morning, there is some good news though for Clinton. She won the endorsement of the ""Des Moines Register"". By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the ""Des Moines Register"" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers. So joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretarywelcome back. CLINTON: Thank youChuck. It\'s good to talk to you this morning. TODD: You got it. Let me just start with this. Your opponent 74 years old, calls himself a socialist, started this campaign with next to zero name recognition. You have 38 of 44 U.S. senators endorsing, 12 of 18 Democratic governors. He has zero. What happened? What\'s gone wrong? Save me the ""we always knew this was going to be a close race"" answer. CLINTON: Well Chucklook, I think it\'s actually good for the debate that we\'re having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his. We have a big choice to make. And it\'s exciting. I had a great couple of events yesterday. I\'m enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we\'re going to see what happens. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we\'ll find out a week from tomorrow. But if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don\'t think we can\'t wait. We can\'t wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think we\'re going to be facing in the next administration. I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach. And that\'s what voters are trying to determine, which they prefer. TODD: Look, as you know, the caucuses sometimes are about passion, enthusiasm. Let me read you something that was in the ""New York Times"" from Gayle Collins. ""Nevertheless, you can\'t ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run but it\'s not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth."" By the way, she wrote that in 2008. By the way, she wrote that in 2008, Madam Secretary. Is there a deja vu happening here? CLINTON: No, there isn\'t. I just have to tell you, can only react to what I\'m doing, feeling, getting responses from people. And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it\'s not just here today, gone tomorrow. But people are involved. They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they\'re going to come caucus. So, you know, the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining, I admit that. But we\'re just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st. TODD: Are you worried that experience, your long resume, is not an asset in this wild year? CLINTON: No, I\'m really not. Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously. They know they\'re voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn\'t happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there. I can only tell you they see people nodding. I know people are signing up as they leave my events. That\'s what matters here. It\'s very personal, and people look and they think, can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that\'s something that people really take into account. TODD: What are you willing toyou know, it\'s interesting, your husband used a lot of political capitalyou and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care. President Obama, arguably, used all of his political capital to get health care passed. What is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue. What is it that you\'re willing to use all your political capital to do with? CLINTON: Well, Chuck, first of all, I don\'t agree with you on that. I think that there are several really important issues, health care being one of them. We\'ve got to get costs down. I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication. I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug. That really hits my heart. I know what people are going through. I\'m going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on. But I\'m also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn\'t in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they\'re not going to feel they\'re getting ahead and they\'re going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy. TODD: As you know, your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks. Let me ask you thiswhy do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200,000 for a speech? CLINTON: Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds. A lot of interest in the bin laden raid, how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President. You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world. I actually think it\'s a good conversation for people to be having. TODD: You don\'t think they expect anything in return? CLINTON: Absolutely not. You know, first of all, I was a senator from New York. I took them on when I was senator. I took on the carried interest loophole. I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets. I was talking about that in 2006. They know exactly where I stand. And I\'ll tell you, Chuck, it\'s really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me. Why? Ask yourself why. Because he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008. TODD: All right. Two more quick questions. The ""Des Moines Register"" editorial, in praising you and your experience, did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that they\'re frustrated with how you responded to it. Let me just ask you this question. Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation. Are you concerned? You said you haven\'t been contacted by them. Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That it\'s putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you, you\'re sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why he\'s thinking about running. CLINTON: No, I\'m not concerned because I know what the facts are. I never sent or received any material marked classified. I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending. And I said it was interesting, Chuckyou\'ll as a political observer understand why. You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new. And now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa. He\'s the chairman of the judiciary committee who hasand his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he\'s there for the simple reason, to defeat me. I can\'t control what the Republicans are doing. But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there. This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point. But I can\'t control what the Republicans and their allies do. But I think it\'s important voters know what they\'re doing. TODD: And Michael Bloomberg? Your reaction to his potential candidacy? CLINTON: He\'s a good friend of mine, and I\'m going to do the best I can to make sure that I get the nomination, and we\'ll go from there. TODD: So you\'re not worried about him getting in? CLINTON: Well, the way I read what he said is if I didn\'t get the nomination he might consider it. Well, I\'m going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesn\'t have to. TODD: All right. Madam Secretarystay safe on the trail. We\'ll catch up with you soon. CLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you. TODD: Nice to talk with you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 26, 2016","b'Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Marshalltown, Iowa'","b'CLINTON: Oh, thank you all so much. Thank you. Oh, you are great. Thank you. Oh, my goodness. I\'ll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. You have been so generous with your time. And I\'m just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night. But it\'s just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you. I\'ve learned a lot in the last months, and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president. So I thank you for everything you\'ve done to make that possible. [applause] And I really want to thank Mark Smith for his endorsement. I\'m thrilled. Thank you so very much, Representative. And I have aI have a plan that I hope will come to pass when itthat affects Mark. And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature. [applause] Think of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across Iowa. Well, it\'s getting close. And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday, you\'re going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country. And I know how seriously Iowans take this because I\'ve been talking with you and listening to you. But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what\'s at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we\'ve had in quite some time. When you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. Well, I will tell you where I stand. I believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we\'ve made, and undermine our future. And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. Let\'s take the economy. You heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. We have tried that, it does not work. And it\'s important to know the facts. And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans. [applause] And the last two Democratic presidents we\'ve had, both of whom I know, which I kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors. You know, in my husband\'s case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. So when he got to Washington, people said, ""OK. So, what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?"" He said, ""Well, I guess I bring arithmetic. We\'re going to make it add up again for the American people."" And at the end of eight years, we did. Twenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. We were on the right track. Well, back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics. George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face. Now we know what happened, don\'t we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and when Barack Obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don\'t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration. [applause] And it was not easy. I know; I talked to him about it. When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, ""We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world."" And what did he do? Well, we\'re back on track with 14 million new jobs. The Affordable Care Act was passed. We\'re now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time. [applause] He passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that\'s where we\'ll end up again. In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House. So the economy is going to be at the core of this election. So you should ask everybody who\'s running what they\'re going to do about it. And I got to tell you, I\'m proud of what we\'ve been doing on the Democratic side. We have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that\'s what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the Republicans. So I\'ve put out a plan. Here is what I think we need to do. We need more infrastructure jobs. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can\'t be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive. And then we\'re going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. We\'re going to reverse that so we start investing in America again, advance manufacturing. I know it can be done because I\'ve been to some of your community colleges. I have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on. I also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we\'re going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs. And that will be a huge economic opportunity[applause]that is directly linked to what Iowa has been doing. You know, the Republicans, when you ask them about climate change, they all say the same thing. ""Well, I don\'t know, I\'m not a scientist."" You know, there\'s an easy way to remedy that. Go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what\'s going on. And, you know, that\'s bad enough that they\'re into denial. What really is troubling is they\'re missing this huge economic opportunity. And when I tell people that, I see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here\'s what I tell them. I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done. And I want you to thank Representative Smith. Thank you. And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment. Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind. You have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes. So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It\'s either going to be China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we\'re going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world. [applause] We also need to be focusing on small business because that\'s where most of the jobs come from in America. And I want to be the small business president. My dad was a small businessman, so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again. And especially young people. S lot of young people tell me they\'d love to go into business, but they can\'t get credit. Part of it is they have such student debts they can\'t get credit; we\'ve got to fix that. So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business. Now, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. One, we\'ve got to raise the minimum wage. People who work full time should not still be in poverty. [applause] There should be a ladder of opportunity. And the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work, and that will raise incomes and families will be better off, the economy will be. [applause] Now, everything I\'ve just said to you the Republicans don\'t agree with it, every bit of it. They don\'t believe in any of it. They don\'t really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want. Well, that\'s not going to work. We know it won\'t, and we can\'t be sold that bill of goods again. The other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer. And I\'m am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge. I will raise your incomes, I will not raise middle-class taxes. I do not think it is right[applause]to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. I want you to take advantage of them, but I want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that\'s where we need to be shifting our tax system. So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the ""carried interest loophole"" that I\'ve been against for years. We also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested. I was really very happy that he endorsed me, and I went to Omaha with him. And we were standing there and he[applause]he said, you know, I\'m not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country. And he has something he calls the Buffett rule. Anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate. So I\'ve adopted the Buffett rule and we\'re going to go right at it and try to get that done. [applause] And then I want to go further, I want to impose what I call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more. Now, there aren\'t very many of those, but there\'s a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable. I want to use that money to invest in clean energy. I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it. Now, people say to me, ""Well, how are we ever going to get that done?"" Well, I do have a political strategy. I\'ve seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America, and I think we can make a very clear case. Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we\'re going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district? We\'re going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer. You know, you can talk about it, but I have a plan to do it. Not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you. And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment. I also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. Now, I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, Senator Sanders and Governor O\'Malley, that we\'ve got to keep our eyes on the big banks. And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. But we already have the authority to go after them. That was in the Dodd-Frank bill. We don\'t have to do that, we just have to implement it. And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law. But here\'s where I differ with my two friendsthat is not enough. And this is what we\'ve been arguing about on the debate stage. You see it wasn\'t just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers. It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG. It was a mortgage company called Countrywide. It was another bank, not one of the big five, called Wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector. So what I\'ve is we\'re going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. And Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said I have the best plan. Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I\'m trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future. And you know, the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. You know, it started a few weeks ago. These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me. And then along came Karl Rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he\'s now running an ad against me. And now another billionaire has jumped in, and he\'s now running an ad against me. Now you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from[applause]pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy. Now, another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care. You know, I believe in universal health care coverage. Every American should have it. You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in \'93 and \'94 when I was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. And that was really disappointing. I mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. So we didn\'t succeed. And then I got to thinking, well, what can I do now? Because, you know, my view is when you\'re knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. The real question is whether you get back up. So I started thinking, what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives. And I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn\'t afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn\'t give it to them. And I met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. And I remember I was at the Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland. I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. And one man said to me, he said, ""You know, I\'ve gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. I have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me."" I said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no. He said, I\'ll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited. He said, we don\'t insure burning houses. This man said, they called my little girls burning houses. And that stuck with me, that and the stories I heard. So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get[applause]you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you\'ve got to keep going. You can\'t ever stop if you\'re trying to accomplish something that will help other people. And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We\'ve been trying to get thatthe Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman. And now, I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. I want to build on it and I want to improve it. You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that\'s what they\'ll do if they get the White House back. We can\'t let that happen. Here is what I want to do. I want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs. [applause] I want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. I want to take away their tax benefits. They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we neverI can\'t understand what they\'re talking about. They have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. They have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. I mean, it[laughter]drives you crazy. And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research. So we\'re going to go right at them. We\'re going to take them on on this. But I don\'t want to start over, my friends. That\'s the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders. I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans. I don\'t want to start at zero and have to[applause]fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. So I\'m determined that we\'re going to make this work for everybody, and I know it\'s the right thing to do. And I hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again. I also will defend Social Security against privatization. The Republicans still want to privatize it. They\'re still talking about that. It\'s a terrible idea. And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street. That\'s what this is all about. Take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street. I will never let that happen. That is the worst[applause]idea that is imaginable. I will also not let them voucherize Medicare, something else they want to do, and I will not let them privatize the VA. We have to fix the VA, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. That\'s not going to happen. [applause] And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I\'ve been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State. It\'s imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where they\'re quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq. [applause] That will not happen. It\'s notit\'s not going to happen on my watch. And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks. When I was a senator after 9/11, I\'d be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI, and it really provided kind of thethe eyes-on help that we needed. And people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. We foiled attacks. Well, the reason I mention that is because of this. The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right? You\'ve heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world. That\'s not only shameful, it\'s dangerous. We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks. [applause] And we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they\'re being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. And certainly, if we\'re going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations. Now, I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran. I know a little bit about how you do this. You don\'t start by insulting people\'s religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary. [applause] That\'s not the way it works in the real world. So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority. I also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy. [applause] And I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support. I am for a woman\'s righta woman\'s right to make her own health decisions, and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood. [applause] I am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community. I am against Citizens United, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others. And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision. I also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep [applause] Americans safe without infringing on gun owners\' rights. We are a smartwe are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don\'t understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can\'t stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody\'s rights. And 92 percent of the American people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country. [applause] So we have a lot of work to do, my friends. And you have been really patient. The children who are still here have been especially patient, and I don\'t want to keep you any longer. I just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions. But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday. [applause] And, you know, I am all aboutI am all about making progress against the odds. I am all about working with people. I worked with Republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of State. I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country. I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. And I know how to find common ground because I\'ve done it. I don\'t think thatI think II do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. Actually, when I\'m not running for something, they say nice things about me. [laughter] Even in the case of Mr. Trump, they give me money because they think I\'m so good as a candidate and a senator. So, you know, this is politics. This is all that that goes on. But once the election is over, I will work as hard as I can to find that common ground, to get good things to happen for you, for your families, for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like I felt, that, you know, really the American Dream was available. You had to work for it, but if you did, you could get ahead and stay ahead. That\'s what I think about when it comes to my granddaughter. You know, I am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. I think it shouldn\'t matter. The grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country. [applause] And that\'s what I am going to stand up for and fight for. And with your help, starting at the caucus next Monday night, that\'s what we will do together. Thank you all so much. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 27, 2016",b'Interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC',"b'MATTHEWS: You know, we\'re getting near closing time and closing arguments in the big fight in Iowa, and then in New Hampshire coming on quickly. Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night. Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up? CLINTON [via telephone]: Look, Chris, what I\'ve said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate. I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there. And so let\'s try to make it happen. MATTHEWS: Well, someone has to lead from the front. Will you be there, no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin O\'Malley? Would you, in other words, lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that? CLINTON: Look, I\'m ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us. And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out. I\'ve said for  you know, for a long time that I\'d be happy to have more debates, and I hope we can get this done. MATTHEWS: Well, if he doesn\'t show up, will you? CLINTON: Well, let\'s hope that we can get it worked out. I don\'t want to  you know, I don\'t want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary. MATTHEWS: So you won\'t be there  just a last question on this. You won\'t be there unless Bernie\'s there. CLINTON: Well, I\'m not committing to that, either, Chris. I think we should have another debate. I think people want it. They have called for it. Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up. We\'ve got, you know  look, 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity. MATTHEWS: Right. CLINTON: We\'ve got a little time to try to get everybody on board, which would certainly be my preference. MATTHEWS: OK, you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the  before the caucuses, in other words. You think you should be there and he should be there. CLINTON: I do. I think that  you know, I agreed, we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up. And you know, I\'ve been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates, I will be there. And now we\'ve got a real, live possibility, and I  I personally think it would be great for the  you know, the primary. We\'re moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday. MATTHEWS: OK... CLINTON: And then once we come out of there, whatever happens, we should agree to debate in New Hampshire. MATTHEWS: In other words, you\'re sticking to your commitment, I will be there. CLINTON: I will  I will debate. Now, as I say, I\'d want  I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree. That is my preference. MATTHEWS: OK. CLINTON: That\'s what we\'ve tried to, you know, do in our side of the ledger here. MATTHEWS: OK. CLINTON: And I\'m pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary. MATTHEWS: Well, this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses. The word in ""The New York Times"" this morning, Madam Secretary, is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you. We don\'t know whether he\'s going to use it, but the language is basically that you\'re in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees you\'ve taken from Goldman Sachs. How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that? CLINTON: Well, first, it\'s really disappointing, Chris. You know, Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks. He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week, which, you know, is kind of a low blow. So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative. One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults. And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that\'s the case I\'ve been focused on making. So you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders. And you know, the other part of this, is anybody who knows me knows you can\'t buy me. I mean, honestly, I\'ve been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years, trying to get things done that I think would improve people\'s lives. And I\'m not going to stop, and that includes anybody trying to, you know, mess with our financial system. MATTHEWS: Well, when he uses phrases like  dark phrases like, You can draw your own conclusions, as to whether you\'re in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone  is that  is that a low blow, You can draw your own conclusions? CLINTON: Well, I think he\'s trying to go to the line without going over it. And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very  you know, very positive and energized by what I\'m seeing happening here in Iowa. And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn\'t ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that\'s the case because I don\'t just go after the big banks. You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we\'ve got to go after the shadow banking sector. You know, let\'s not forget Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Rapovia. And let\'s also remind people, Chris, that, clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say  the billionaires have chosen sides. They\'re running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they\'ve seen me in action. So whether it\'s, you know, Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC, or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was, you know, going against Bernie, when the real point was to, you know, stir opposition to me. I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply. MATTHEWS: Well, you\'re giving us a real rogue\'s gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove. [laughter] \nAnyway, let me ask you about the slogans. You used a phrase the other day, these shouting slogans. Now, I know what you mean  I\'m going to build a wall across the Rio Grande  across  along the Rio Grande River. I\'m going to make the Mexicans pay for it. But on the Democratic side, Senator Sanders says things like free health care, or rather, government-paid health care for life, as a right. He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison, Wisconsin. Free! Free! Is that what you mean, this  we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders, and he  I went through this list of free things and I said, Where\'s the money come from? And he says, Well, we put a man on the moon. We can do this. And that kind of fantastic  what do you call it  appeal. And then I heard from Sanders the other day that they\'re going to stay left, right to the general, they\'re not going to make any appeal to the middle. How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left, right to November, and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old, 22 years old, and they don\'t have to pay much taxes now, but you say, Look, you\'re going to get free  no more tuition bills, no more bills! You\'re going to have no health care the rest of your life, so forget having to buy insurance. It\'s a pretty good offer. Is that what you mean by shouting slogans? CLINTON: Well, I was really more referring to the Republicans, as you pointed out initially. And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it\'s more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock. And let\'s take health care as an example. You know, we\'ve been trying, as Democrats, since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage. Before it was called ""Obama care,"" it was called ""Hillary care,"" and I have the scars to prove it. And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We are now at 90 percent coverage. I sure think we ought to improve it. I\'ve got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs. But I think it\'s a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care. Where\'s the money going to come from? Who\'s going to be paying it? If you have health care you like, if you\'re under a private plan, do you have to give it up? If you\'re on Medicare and you work, do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and we\'d have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent. I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress. Now, some people, you know, say, Oh my gosh, that\'s so pragmatic. It\'s not, you know, soaring, or whatever they say. Well, I\'m out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14,000. I\'m talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times. That\'s not a new drug. That doesn\'t have any new research in it. I\'m talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted. And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I\'m so grateful because I\'ve got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition. These people can\'t wait, Chris. We can\'t wait for another big debate that promises, you know, the sky when we know we\'ve got to deliver on the ground. We\'ve got to help people deal with the problems, the issues, the challenges they\'re facing right now. We have to restore faith that our government can work. And that is what I intend to do as president, and I\'m going to keep fighting for that. And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal coverage. I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of. MATTHEWS: Last question, and it\'s so important to this campaign. I think so. I know you think so. It has to do with history. And it\'s not the only issue in the campaign, obviously, but if you look at the American Constitution  and you\'ve studied constitutional law  and the fact is that it wasn\'t until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment. And then women didn\'t get it until after the First World War. There\'s a long lag there. Obama was elected president. You might get elected president. You may well get elected president. Do you think it\'s  you think young American women  say, young women in college, 18 to 22, 23  do they get it, how long this struggle has been and the fact that it\'s a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice, to equality at workplace, where they do get it, all were fought for? Do they get it? That\'s my simple question. I don\'t know if they do. Do you think they get it? CLINTON: Look, I think that a lot of young people  and I wouldn\'t limit it to women. I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them. And of course, you know, if you haven\'t been through a lot of these struggles, it\'s easy either not to know about them or to think they didn\'t go far enough or that, you know, everything is taken care of. So we\'ve got the two extremes of the argument. But here\'s what I\'m hearing, at least from the young women who come to see me. They say, Hey, OK, you\'re for equal pay. What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say, I want to go to law school. How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job, I\'m going to get equal pay? And I said, OK, that\'s the right question because we\'ve been fighting for this. We\'ve made progress, but not near enough. Here\'s exactly what I think we need to do to get it. Or young women who say, you know, I can\'t balance family and work. I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said, you know, I can\'t go back to work until I get my baby stabilized. I need paid family leave. What are you going to do about it? So I think what\'s happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people  and let\'s focus on young women  are moving from the sort of general, either we haven\'t gone far enough or those fights are over and I don\'t have to worry about it, to being much more specific. And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I\'m so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we\'ve got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it\'s racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it  we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn\'t even want to admit they exist. So I think we\'re going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between, you know, the big deniers on the Republican side, and you know, Let\'s make progress, get things done, on my side. MATTHEWS: Thank you so much. One last  just to clarify what you said about the debate. Would you like the chairman  the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week? CLINTON: I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week. MATTHEWS: OK. CLINTON: That is what I\'m hoping will happen. MATTHEWS: OK. Thank you so much. It\'s been an honor to have you on, Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa. Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight. CLINTON: Thanks, Chris. Good to talk to you again.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"January 31, 2016","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News ""This Week""'","b'STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you for joining us, Madam Secretary. [crosstalk] Let\'s talk about that ""Des Moines Register""  that ""Des Moines Register"" poll that has you in the lead  eight years ago, your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama. Are you confident that won\'t happen again? CLINTON: Well, George, here\'s what I\'m confident about. We\'ve run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up. I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign. And we\'re going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night. Of course, it\'s close. It\'s competitive. That\'s why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night. STEPHANOPOULOS: You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret. You want them released. Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we don\'t? CLINTON: Well, here\'s what I know. I know that this is, I think, a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who\'s had a chance to review them, has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings. So I do want them released and of course I can\'t be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government, as part of this interagency dispute, to make this request not to make them public. But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can. It should be disclosed  [crosstalk] STEPHANOPOULOS: Your supporters  CLINTON:  that I\'m told about them. STEPHANOPOULOS:  your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa, and Senator Feinstein herself, has suggested it\'s political. Is that what you think? CLINTON: Well, it\'s  I\'m going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on. I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning. And I just want this matter resolved. The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago, release these, let the public see them and let\'s move on. STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you\'ve said many times that the emails were not marked classified. No evidence that that\'s not true. But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant. It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference. CLINTON: Well, of course. And that\'s exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can\'t get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that and you  when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case. The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I\'m told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report. That seems a little hard to understand, that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article. So let\'s just get it out. Let\'s see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions. This is very much like Benghazi, George. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me. I understand that. That\'s the way they are. But after 11 hours of testimony, answering every single question, in public, which I have requested for many months, I think it\'s pretty clear they\'re grasping at straws and this will turn out  [crosstalk] STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally on this matter, you know, a few months back, you told my colleague, David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server. Yet just this Monday, you said there was no error in judgment. How do you square those two statements? CLINTON: Well, look, as I\'ve said many times, it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice. I wouldn\'t be here talking to you about it. I\'d be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds. And be, you know, really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months. STEPHANOPOULOS: You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now. And here was  he was on the stump there yesterday, saying this about your attack. [begin video clip] SANDERS: Don\'t tell me that I\'m defending or protecting the gun lobby. Don\'t tell me I\'m attacking Planned Parenthood. Those are inaccuracies. And we can do better than that. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: He\'s calling you on this, says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood. CLINTON: Well, let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said. They say I\'m the leader. I\'m the leader who has taken on tough issues. I\'ve taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood, the gun lobby, for many years. And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I was very honored to have that. That\'s not saying that others haven\'t voted with them. But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me. I\'ve been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I\'m the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign. They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community. Now that is just the facts. People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me. And I\'m very proud of that. STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you just mentioned [inaudible] hitting you with the email issue. They\'re clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that he\'s a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination. Some of your supporters concerned about that, Senator Claire McCaskill, are saying they can\'t wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle. Steny Hoyer, Congressman Steny Hoyer, saying he calls himself a socialist. I don\'t think that\'s a good title to be running for President of the United States. Is that what you think? Will the fact that he\'s a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November? CLINTON: Well, that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying. And I take them at their word. They know their states. They know the country. They know we have to take back the Senate. They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country. Here\'s what I think. I think I\'ve been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I\'m still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that. And it\'s a very tough gantlet to run. And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they\'re going to use it. I feel vetted. I feel ready. I feel strong and I think I\'m the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November. STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend, Robert Rice, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. He said you\'re the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have. How do you respond to that? CLINTON: Well, look, I\'m a progressive who thinks it\'s important to actually make progress. That\'s what I\'ve done my entire life. That\'s what I will do as president. Obviously I have big goals. I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. Get incomes rising, get women equal pay, raise the minimum wage, have a renaissance in manufacturing, move toward clean, renewable energy  I have big goals. And I tell you how I\'m going to get there and how I\'m going to pay for them. And I think that is what the Americans want. I\'m not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver. I\'m going to tell you what I know we can achieve, and that\'s going to take the political system we have right now, and then I intend to bring in more people, as always have, George. When I ran for Senate the first time, you remember, you know, people didn\'t give me much of a chance. I won and then when I was reelected, I won with a bigger percentage. And then when I was Secretary of State, even the Republicans said I was doing a good job. So I understand politics. I understand a campaign. I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they\'ve been left out and left behind. I think I know how to do that, and I think the voters know that I know how to do that. STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Clinton, thanks for joining us this morning. CLINTON: Great to talk to you, George. Thank you. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 1, 2016",b'Remarks in Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucus',"b""Wow! What a night. An unbelievable night. What a great campaign. This has been an incredible honor to campaign across Iowa, with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want.For the Democratic Party and for the United States of America. There is so much at stake in this election, I don't need to tell you. Every single one of you who came out for me, who worked so many hours  from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state  I am deeply grateful.I love all of you. Here's what I want you to know. It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now, to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.I am a progressive who gets things done for people. I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough. That standing still is not an option. And that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of Americans. I look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job I had at the Children's Defense Fund. And I know. I know what we are capable of doing, I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again. I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can make our education system work for every one of our children, especially those who come with disadvantages. I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people. And I know we can protect our rights, women's rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrant rights, workers rights. I know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures.And how do we do that? We do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans.I congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; I wish Governor O'Malley the very best. He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America. In the last few weeks, we finally began to have what I think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the Democratic party could have. And I am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that.I know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals. But I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic Party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united. When it is all said and done, we have to be united.A Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us. That is not who we are, my friends. I follow their candidates very closely, I understand what they're appealing to, and I intend to stand against it. I will not  I will not let their decisiveness, their efforts to rip away the progress that we've made, be successful. Because we can't afford that. As I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, Iowa. I want you to know, I will keep doing what I have done my entire life.I will keep standing up for you. I will keep fighting for you. I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades, but inspires generations to come. Join me, let's go win the nomination. Thank you all and God bless you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 1, 2016","b'Interview with Robin Roberts and Jonathan Karl of ABC\'s ""Good Morning America""'","b""ROBERTS: Well, what do you say we talk to Hillary Clinton, who's good enough to join us this morning on a very important and busy day. Thank you so much for doing that. And so do you have the victory party all set for tonight? CLINTON: Well, this is a very tight race, Robin. It's really going down to the wire. But we feel very good, we've worked so hard. I've had a great operation here. So many young people, organizers who fanned out across the state, the thousands of volunteers. We did knock on 125,000 doors this past weekend. So we're very committed, very energized and enthusiastic, but it all depends upon who shows up tonight, who comes out to caucus in Iowa. And I'm urging everyone who is interested in, committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight, 6:30. I will be there in spirit, because if you stand up for me, I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House. ROBERTS: You know, there are so many similarities between what is going on right now and eight years ago. You again are affected  unexpected challenge that you are facing. What are the differences and similarities between what you're experiencing now and what happened eight years ago here in Iowa? CLINTON: Well, I think that I have a much better organization, to be just really clear about it. I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned, and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics. I think I'm a better candidate. I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night. My experience as secretary of State really deepened and intensified my understanding about what the next president will have to face. So all in all, I feel like it's a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and, indeed, across the country who know what's at stake in this election, understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress. We wouldn't be able to, in my view, get the economy going for everybody, get incomes rising, get affordable college, take care of the rising prescription drug costs, everything I'm talking about, which is really in response to the concerns and the worries that I hear from people as I criss-cross this state. ROBERTS: All 99 counties you have criss-crossed, and we have seen you and we've seen your husband and we've seen your daughter as well. [laughter] CLINTON: Well, I haven't gotten to all 99. ROBERTS: A third of  CLINTON: I had to  let's just say that. I don't want anybody to think that my silence is affirmation. But I've covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much. You know, that's the best part of this. It's obviously exhausting, it takes a lot of concentration. But what keeps me going are the stories that people tell me. There's something so intimate, at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear what's on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldn't have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act, or when a young woman says she's just drowning in student debt and needs a way out, that sticks with me. And I think that the months I've spent here listening to Iowans has really made me a better candidate and I think it will make me a better president. ROBERTS: Well, speaking of listening to Iowans, we have John Karl. He is out and about, and he is with some voters. And, you know, a third of voters here are undecided, and let's hear what one voter has to ask you. John? JONATHAN KARL: Hello, Robin, hello Secretary Clinton. We're with Rob here from Dennison, Iowa. Incredible thing about this. Rob, you were undecided between Hillary Clinton and John Kasich. So you don't even know which party  what's your question for Secretary Clinton? QUESTION: Good morning, Secretary Clinton. My question for you is as a liberal Republican  it seems to be a dying breed anymore  I want to know how you're going to work bipartisanly with a very partisan Congress and a  and a seemingly polarized nation. KARL: Good question. CLINTON: That's a  that's a really great question, and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot. You know, I have a record of working with Republicans. When I'm actually in a position to do so  when, you know, there's a campaign, it's a little bit different  but when I was first lady, I worked to achieve the Children's Health Insurance Program, working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats, even reformed our foster care and adoption system, teaming up with Tom DeLay, a very partisan Republican in the House. And when I got to the Senate, I worked hard to get health care for the National Guard and Reserves, I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in that case. And I  I don't know that there was a single Republican who didn't co-sponsor one of the bills that I worked on. And as secretary of State, I had similar efforts to reach common ground that proved successful. I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do, and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth. But I am confident that I'm going to work really hard to find that common ground across the aisle, and we will make progress together. ROBERTS: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much. We appreciate you joining us on this very busy and important day. Thank you. CLINTON: Thanks so much. Great to talk to you. ROBERTS: You as all  as always."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 1, 2016","b'Interview with Alisyn Camerota of CNN\'s ""New Day""'","b'[begin video clip] CLINTON: I hope you will fight for me. And I promise you this, I will stand up and fight for you every single day of this campaign. And then when we win I will fight for you in the White House. Thank you and god bless you. [end video clip] CAMEROTA: A powerful close to Hillary Clinton\'s last campaign event of the night Sunday. Former secretary of state spent most of the day making her way through Iowa in a last ditch effort to rally caucusgoers ahead of tonight\'s vote. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joins us now. Secretary Clinton, good morning. CLINTON: Good morning, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Okay. How are you feeling and how do you plan to spend the next 12 hours? CLINTON: I am feeling great. I am so proud of the campaign we have run here in Iowa. I\'ve got the most dedicated campaign team, the organizers who have been on the ground, the thousands of volunteers. We actually knocked on 125,000 doors this weekend. So there is just a lot of excitement and energy. I\'m urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process. I hope they will come out and caucus for me. CAMEROTA: So, Secretary, let\'s talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign. That, of course, is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails. On Friday, the State Department withheld 22 e-mails. They didn\'t release them. Because of material deemed top secret. I know you have been asked this six ways to Sunday along the campaign trail and I know that you\'ve always said there is nothing there, but your opponents have said that this is big. It\'s is a big deal. How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this? CLINTON: Well, Alisyn, there is nothing new. And I think the facts are quite helpful here. It\'s a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi. Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks. I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up. Most voters have made up their minds. And I\'m grateful for that. The same here. And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what\'s going on here. I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again. I take classified information seriously. I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released. This is a dispute about retroactive classification, quite a mouthful. So what people talk to me about is how I\'m going to get incomes up, how I\'m going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt. That\'s what\'s on voters\' minds. And that\'s what I\'m talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight. CAMEROTA: Um but Secretary Clinton, something does seem to be happening with this investigation, or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more, because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say, quote, ""something\'s going to happen."" What does that mean to you? CLINTON: It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything I\'m aware of. And, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved. But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks. And I\'m glad it isn\'t. Because the facts are the facts. No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families. And I\'ve been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response I\'ve been getting, the crowds that we had. That last event last night was just overwhelming. I\'m looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November. CAMEROTA: Yesterday ""The New York Times"" endorsed you. They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision. I\'m sure that was music to your ears. Do you think ""The New York Times"" endorsement plays in Iowa? CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know. But I know ""The Des Moines Register"" does and they endorsed me. I know ""The Boston Globe"" matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because, yeah, there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down. They don\'t know me very well. Because I don\'t quit when I\'m fighting for what I believe in. And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people. And I\'m just going to stick with it. And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like ""The Register"" or ""The Times"" or ""The Boston Globe"" and others look at all the candidates, interview us, ask us really hard questions and conclude that I\'m their choice for president, I find that incredibly validating. And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because it\'s a pretty tough vetting process they go through. CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, that\'s talk about the Republicans and what\'s going on in terms of how the electorate feels. I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country. Some people say we have never seen anything like it. You\'ve made a point during the campaign of talking about how you don\'t really like how the Republicans do become in many ways. So how would you bring the country together, including Republicans? CLINTON: Well, the same way I always have. When I\'m not actually running for office, I work closely with everybody, including Republicans, to find common ground. That\'s what I did when I helped to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids. I worked with Democrats and Republicans. It\'s what I did when I got to the Senate and, you know, worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they weren\'t being deployed. I worked on responding to 9/11. I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like. As secretary of state, the same thing. So, Alisyn, I think that you\'ve got to work at it every single day. There is no shortcut. You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over. That\'s the way politics works in America. That\'s the way our system is set up to work. Now we can get frustrated by it. We can wish that it were smoother. But I\'m very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled. You know, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street, getting our economy out of the ditch. The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran, the effort I led. And so much more. So I know how you get things done. I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in people\'s lives. That\'s what I\'m offering. I\'m not overpromising. I\'m laying out the plans that I have. I\'m asking people to look at them and I\'m asking people to hold me accountable. Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them. That\'s what I intend to do. CAMEROTA: Let\'s talk about how this differs for you than 2008. Once again, you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement. So why isn\'t this deja vu all over again for you today? CLINTON: Well, look, I always thought we\'d have a close contest and I think that is good. It\'s good for the Democratic Party. But I\'m thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons. We have applied those lessons. We have got a great team working literally around the clock. I think I\'m a better candidate. I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that, frankly, nobody else running on either side could have. And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration. Yeah, people are angry. People are disappointed. People are worried. You know, what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow. I mean, 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out. People haven\'t gotten a raise. They have been working but they don\'t feel like they are getting ahead. So they deserve  the American people deserve to be worried. But what I\'m offering is a way forward. You know, once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it, people have to ask themselves, who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and I\'m ready. I\'m experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president. CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, we will be watching, of course, with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours. Thanks so much for taking time to be on NEW DAY. CLINTON: Thank you. Hope you feel better. Take care. CAMEROTA: Thank you. Thank you. That\'s so nice. I\'m drinking tea and honey right now. Thanks so much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 2, 2016",b'Interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC',"b'MATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. It was quite a night last night and I was taken with your moment of candor there before the cameras when you said, you had a sigh of relief. Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you.CLINTON: Right. Oh, Chris, it meant the world to me. As we all remember, I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is. So proud of our organization, our volunteers, all my supporters. Everybody said if there were a big turnout, that would advantage Senator Sanders. There was a big turnout, and we won. And now I\'m in New Hampshire looking forward to the primary next Tuesday and continuing to make my case in this contest of ideas between me and the senator. MATTHEWS: Well, you know, ""The New York Times"" ran this story this morning that you were disappointed, and I think it\'s possible to be both disappointed and relieved. You could have been disappointed at 9:00 but very relieved at 11:00. I mean, the times change during the course as the results come in. Are both those possible? You thought you could have done better with your field operation but you\'re also glad you came out ahead? CLINTON: Look, Chris, I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus, I could feel the energy building. It\'s a tough process and what I was seeing on the ground as people were telling me they were changing their minds, that they were supporting me, what my organizers were reporting, was all consistent that it was going to be close, but if we did our work, and we did, we would win. So I was thrilled by winning and getting that boost out of Iowa here in New Hampshire where I am in Senator Sanders\' backyard, as you know, as a political expert of your many years, that New Hampshire votes for neighbors. And so I have to really get out there, make my case, which I intend to do this week. MATTHEWS: I just love the way you snuck that in. It\'s his backyard, therefore he has an advantage geographically and we shouldn\'t put too much stock into it. But let me ask you about this, because I\'m looking at these polls. There\'s a range in the polling over the last couple weeks in New Hampshire and it is his back yard. Look at the map, it\'s Vermont and New Hampshire right next to each other, twin there. Between 6 and 33 points he\'s got a lead on you up there, and I wonder how much ground you can make in a week, because we only have a week now. CLINTON: I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win, and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary. And the work that was done on my behalf, the people who came out to support me, the incredible excitement  I saw that today in Nashua. I got here, it was amazing, Chris. The level of enthusiasm, people who were with me before, people who were with President Obama in \'08, everybody working so hard to support me, to get to that primary, to do everything we possibly can. We\'re not leaving anything on the ground. We\'re moving forward. And I think we\'ll do well. MATTHEWS: I think everybody should have been impressed. Maybe I wasn\'t as impressed as I should have been, but everybody should have been, about the way you handled New Hampshire last time around. You came off the loss in Iowa. You went out there and you would stand there  it was like Bill Clinton staying there until the last dog died. You were out there on that arena, I remember you standing in a, I think it was a field house, and you went on and on and on. It went on for five hours. It was incredible. It was a marathon, answering every single question of everyone in that room. It really was a physical  a marathon. Are you going to try to match that performance this time, that kind of ""I can do this"" thing? CLINTON: I\'m going to do everything I can to get out there, to meet with folks here, to answer their questions. I\'m really happy we\'ve got a forum on CNN tomorrow night. We\'ve got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night, which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience. But I\'m going to be there day after day between now and Tuesday. I respect this primary process. I know how seriously people take it. And I just want them to understand what I\'m offering, what I believe we can do. You know, ideas that sound good on paper but can\'t create results for people are just that, good ideas on paper. I have a track record of producing results. I know how to do all parts of this job. Because we\'re going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief. And in New Hampshire, those two sides of this incredibly difficult job are really joined together. And I feel good about the opportunity I\'ll have to get out, meet with granite staters, make my case, and I\'m going to do everything possible to get them to support me next Tuesday. MATTHEWS: I know you\'ve been saying nice things about your only opponent now. It\'s really a battle since Martin O\'Malley, Governor O\'Malley has withdrawn. It\'s a two-person race. The only person, and I\'m going to say this bluntly  the only person between a confirmed socialist who\'s calling for political revolution in this country, winning the nomination of the Democratic party, which has always been more moderate than that, is you. So when you saw that rally last night, the young people all around Senator Sanders, when he yelled revolution out there and they all applauded like mad, do you think that\'s something that is going to help in a general election, or are we looking at, what we used to call in the 60s, an NDC campaign  November doesn\'t count. We just want to win the party, we don\'t care about the general. You seem to be focused on the general. How do you beat a person who\'s coming along in the primaries, however, who\'s saying, I\'m going to give you all the things you want, free tuition, more social security benefits without an increase in your taxes, healthcare from birth to death, all government paid. How do you compete with a revolution of promises, really? CLINTON: Well first, let me say, I am thrilled, too, that we\'ve got young people getting active in the campaign on the Democratic side. I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire, I\'m just so impressed with. So that\'s a net good no matter what. I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what\'s at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris. We can\'t let the Republicans rip away the progress we\'ve made. We can\'t let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the affordable care act, we can\'t let them stack the supreme court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need. We\'ve got to get back to the middle, we\'ve got to get back to the big center, we\'ve got to get back to solving problems. That\'s how we make progress in America. I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the affordable care act, something we\'ve been fighting for since Harry Truman. I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas. But I want folks to stop and think, no matter what age you are, OK, we agree on getting the economy going. We agree on raising incomes, we agree on combating climate change, we agree on universal coverage. Who has the track record? Who\'s gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So I\'m very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas. That\'s what politics should be about. We\'re going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side, they\'re going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side, but the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November. Do not turn the supreme court further over to their nominees. We can\'t let that happen. MATTHEWS: Well, of course, I think you\'re offering a lesson in civics and I wonder if we can do that in a couple weeks now. Look, the history of the Democratic party, your party, not Bernie Sanders, he\'s not a Democratic party member  your party has produced The New Deal. It produced, the progressive income tax came from the Democrats, from Wilson. Social security, the greatest anti-poverty program ever, came from Roosevelt. And Harry Truman started to fight for health care and civil rights and all these good things that led to the affordable care act. But in every case, you had to battle Republicans who voted against it to the last person. And it\'s always been a tough fight. You need 60 votes in the senate, you need, what is it, 218 in the house, and if you don\'t have it, nothing gets done. The Bernie people need to be taught, not him, he won\'t be taught  the kids behind him need to be told, this is how it works in our system. You can call for revolution, but it ain\'t going to happen. There isn\'t going to be a revolution. There\'s going to be an election, an inauguration, and then there\'s going to be a congress sitting with you you\'ve got to do business with, no matter who gets elected. You don\'t have to worry about logic anymore, just, I\'m going to have a revolution and pay for everything. CLINTON: Well, where I come out on this is, I don\'t think our country or the American people can wait. I don\'t think they can wait for better jobs with rising incomes, getting prescription drug costs down. I think people want to vote for somebody who is going to get in there on the first day, knows how to do the job, is prepared to do the job, and gets to work. And I will give everything I\'ve got to make sure that we preserve the progress we\'ve made, because you\'re right, it is hard fought. Our system is set up to make it difficult. Checks and balances, separation of powers  our founders knew that if we were going to survive as a great democracy that they were creating, we had to have a system that kept the passions at bay. We had to have people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and compromise. We couldn\'t have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth. We had to actually produce results. That hasn\'t changed since George Washington. We\'ve got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism, Chris. People have to believe they have a stake in it, that their voices count, that their votes count. But then they\'ve got to see results from their investment in our democracy. Our democracy has to work better, our economy has to work better, our politics has to work better. That\'s what I know how to do and that\'s what we have to get done in this election. MATTHEWS: Madame secretary, unofficially, not on behalf of MSNBC or NBC, congratulations on last night and your much deserved relief and break a leg on Thursday night even if you\'re the only one in the chair. Thank you for joining us today. CLINTON: I\'m going to be there. MATTHEWS: You said it, I believe you. Thank you. CLINTON: I\'ll be there. Bye-bye. MATTHEWS: Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 2, 2016",b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN',"b""BLITZER: The breaking news this hour. It's now official. Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses. She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0.2 of a percentage point. Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results. They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses. And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua, New Hampshire. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. What's your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses? CLINTON: I am so thrilled, Wolf. I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground, to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered, knocked on doors, came out and caucused last night. And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus. I was out there, making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs, rising incomes, build on the Affordable Care Act, deal with climate change, clean energy, defend our rights, all the things I feel passionate about. And I could just watch and, in fact, in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better. It was a great, great night. BLITZER: You said last night you breathed a big sigh of relief, your words  a big sigh of relief. What did you mean by that? CLINTON: Well, as you recall, my luck was not that good last time around. And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work, the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did. Now we're here in New Hampshire and we are going to have a contest of ideas. I'm looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night, here in New Hampshire, because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent, Senator Sanders. And I want to get that information out there. I think it's important people understand that good ideas are one thing but you got to know how to implement. You've got to have a record of getting results. And I'm taking my ideas and my record to the people of New Hampshire this week. BLITZER: The Sanders campaign says they won't have this debate Thursday night with you unless you agree to a subsequent debate before the New York primary in New York City. Are you willing to agree to that? CLINTON: Well, you know, Wolf, this is really hard to follow because, when we said we would do the debate, they came back with conditions. We met the conditions. Then they said they want different conditions. And we've tried to be very accommodating but, you know, we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do. And I sure hope  we're in Bernie Sanders' backyard here in New Hampshire. I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage. BLITZER: Well, just to press the point, the debate in New York City that they want, are you accepting that? CLINTON: No. We've accepted all of their conditions. We did that last week. And they keep trying to add new conditions, which, you know, raises questions about how ready or willing they are to debate here in New Hampshire. We met their conditions. We agreed to more debates, something that I wanted to do because I think it's great to debate and we're ready. I'm going to be there Thursday night. BLITZER: All right. Let's move on. The senator's campaign  they want to do not necessarily a recount but they want to check the voting in Iowa. Is that OK with you? CLINTON: You know, look, I  they  I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me. There was an enormous turnout, which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders. If there are legitimate issues, both sides, I don't think the Democratic Party has any problems with that. But from everything we have learned and know, I won and I'm very proud of that. BLITZER: Back in 2008, as you well remember, you lost Iowa but then you came back to win New Hampshire. This time you won Iowa. Can you win New Hampshire one week from today? CLINTON: Well, I think it's certainly what I'm aiming for. I care a lot about this state. I view it as being the first-in-the-nation primary for a reason. I know that they tend to favor their neighbors. That's the pattern, the history of the primary. And Senator Sanders is a neighbor. But I think we will have a good contest, talking about what results we can produce, what our records have been, both in domestic policy, foreign policy, national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us. And I feel good about my prospects. BLITZER: You described yourself in your speech last night as a progressive that gets things done. Are you suggesting Bernie Sanders  he may be a progressive but he can't get things done? CLINTON: I'm talking about my record. I'm talking about the Children's Health Insurance Program for 8 million kids. I'm talking about getting health care for National Guard members. I'm talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state. I'm talking about building the coalition against Iran to bring them to the negotiating table and so many other issues. I have a very long record of getting results for people. That's what I care about. You know, I am all for laying out our ideology, talking about our ideas. I think that's great and it gives you the direction that you want to head. But at the end of the day, what matters to me is that we move our country forward. We actually get more good jobs with rising incomes. We get equal pay for women. We actually begin to move toward early childhood education and paid family leave. And we are ready to really go into the rest of the 21st century with the kind of confidence and optimism that I think our country should be having. So I'm going to lay out my record, lay out my ideas and Senator Sanders can certainly lay out his own and we'll leave it up to the people of New Hampshire to decide what they think is the best choice for them and their families and the results they want to see for themselves in our country. BLITZER: As you know, according to the entrance polls in Iowa, Bernie Sanders did a lot better than you did with younger voters, younger men and even younger women. Why do you think is he doing so well with younger voters out there? CLINTON: I'm thrilled to see so many young people get into the political process and I was very proud of all the young people who worked for me, volunteered for me, supported me. That's all to the good and it's great for the Democratic Party. But I'm going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision as they evaluate who should be our president, our commander in chief, and I intend to do that, laying out my case, where we contrast on the issues, what I think can be done to get college to be affordable. I think my plan is going to really help the people who need it most without ballooning costs. I'm going to set forth my plan to refinance student debt, a problem I hear throughout New Hampshire and the country and why I think my plan will help more young people really get started with their lives. The emphasis I want to make on small business, my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. And let's defend our rights. I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others, because they know me and they know what I have done. They know the kind of leader I am. And I want young people to know that as well. BLITZER: As you know, Marco Rubio did rather well, coming in at an impressive third place in the Iowa Republican caucuses just behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won Iowa. What do you think about the possibility, if you do get the Democratic nomination, of running against Senator Rubio in a general election? CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I'm not thinking that far ahead. My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then I'll go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead. I'm going let the Republicans, you know, decide who their nominee will be. I will be prepared to run against and win, no matter who they nominate. I think, as everybody is well aware, I am pretty battle tested. It's important to have gone through this, to know what the Republicans will do. They're already running $6 million of ads against me along with their, you know, Wall Street buddies. And so they know who they don't want to be the Democratic nominee. And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and I'll do what I have said, to make sure that they don't ever wreck our economy again. So I'm going take them on as I have over the years and then, when I win, I will certainly reach out, work with them and find common ground wherever we can. BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. Congratulations on your win in Iowa. CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf. Great to talk to you again. BLITZER: Thank you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 3, 2016","b'Remarks at the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall in Derry, New Hampshire'","b'COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. Thanks very much for being with us. You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. Please welcome the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. [applause] Please. CLINTON: Hello. COOPER: Welcome. CLINTON: Thank you very much. COOPER: So you\'ve obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days. Congratulations on winning in Iowa. New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons. How does it feel out there? CLINTON: It feels great. I\'ve had just an amazing time. We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. And I\'m seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people. I have an uphill climb and I\'m going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire. As you said, they\'re people that I feel very close to. They\'ve been good to my husband, to me, my family. But what\'s most important is the first in the nation primary. It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire. COOPER: Bernie Sanders, just a short time ago, said he is the underdog here. Your campaign has said, you know, he comes from neighboring Vermont, you guys are down in the polls. Do you feel you do better when you\'re fighting from behind? CLINTON: You know, I don\'t know. I... COOPER: Does it bring out something in you? CLINTON: Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what\'s at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama. [applause] And so I  I\'m very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running. I mean, we really have focused on issues. We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them. We bring different experiences. But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults. And I think it\'s a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds. COOPER: You\'ve talked about progressive values. Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive. He said some days. Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate. CLINTON: Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right? COOPER: I did. And it\'s coming up again today. CLINTON: And I said that I\'m a progressive who likes to get things done. And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive. So I\'m not going to let that bother me. I know where I stand. I know who stands with me. I know what I\'ve done. But I don\'t think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. And I don\'t think it\'s appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they\'re thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. That\'s just not anything we need to do. Let\'s have a good contest of ideas. Let\'s contrast where we stand. And that\'s what I intend to do for the next couple of days. COOPER: It would obviously be historic if you were elected president, first female president. CLINTON: You think so? [laughter] [applause] COOPER: I\'ve studied a little bit of history. But it seems like young women aren\'t rallying to this potentially historic moment. And I say this in Iowa, among women under 30, Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points. Why do you think that is? CLINTON: That\'s amazing. Yes. Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me. But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I\'ve accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country. COOPER: Why do you think it is? That they\'re... CLINTON: But I  well, you know, I don\'t really know, Anderson. I think  here\'s what I want young people to know. They don\'t have to be for me, I\'m going to be for them. It doesn\'t really matter. [applause] If they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve. As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity. And I understand that. I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get. But at the same time I\'m so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. So I\'m impressed with them. And I\'m going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important. But you\'ve got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. I have a lot experience doing that. I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country. And I hope to have the chance to win their support. COOPER: What\'s wrong with a revolution? CLINTON: Well, that\'s for Sen. Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people. I have a different take on it. I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act. It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman. [applause] The Republicans are... [applause] You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it. And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. Sen. Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal health care coverage. Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember. COOPER: I remember. CLINTON: I fought really hard. The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. I know what it\'s like to go up against the status quo and special interests. So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled. I don\'t agree with Sen. Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again. We\'re at 90 percent coverage. I\'m going to fix what needs to be fixed. We\'re going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. So we have a difference. And I think that... [applause] ... is the difference. COOPER: I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience. CLINTON: Sure. COOPER: This is Dave Skinell. He\'s a high school English teacher from Manchester. He says he\'s undecided. David? CLINTON: Hi, David. QUESTION: Hi, Sec. Clinton. You  the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make. CLINTON: Right. QUESTION: I\'m wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test. And if your answer is no, aren\'t certain critical issues like marriage equality, campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination? CLINTON: Well, I\'ll tell you what, Dave. I do have a litmus test. I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you. The next president could get as many as three appointments. You know one of the many reasons why we can\'t turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court. I\'m looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don\'t have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act. I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate. It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research. Supreme Court comes along. They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W. Bush. That is one of our problems. They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. So they have given way too much power to corporations. They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don\'t share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. We have to preserve marriage equality. We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community... [applause] We\'ve got to make sure... [applause] We\'ve got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed. We\'ve got work to do... [applause] And here\'s how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices. I\'m looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power. If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. So I have very strong feelings about what I\'ll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court. [applause] COOPER: OK. [applause] I want you to meet Mr. Jim Kinhan. He\'s a Democrat who says he is supporting you. JIM KINHAN: Hello, Madam Secretary. CLINTON: Thank you. KINHAN: I\'m very pleased to see you. This may come a little bit from right field, this may seem, but it\'s very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues. The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer. And I\'m walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary, comfortably and spiritually. But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and  their end of life with dignity. CLINTON: Well, first of all, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support. And I really appreciate your asking the question. And I have to tell you, this is the first time I\'ve been asked that question. KINHAN: I  I figured that. CLINTON: Yes. I  I really  I really... KINHAN: Maybe any candidate. CLINTON: And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country. There are states, as you know... KINHAN: Yes. CLINTON:  that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals. But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. So here\'s how I think about it. I want  I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I  I believe you\'re right, this is going to become an issue more and more... KINHAN: Exactly. CLINTON:  often. We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don\'t want to continue with the challenges that poses. So I don\'t have any easy or glib answer for you. I think I would want to really immerse myself in the  the  the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings. I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach. I\'d like to know what their experience has been. Because we  we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress. And that is a difficult line to draw. So I thank you  I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we\'re all going to have to do some thinking about. KINHAN: Thank you [inaudible]. [applause] COOPER: I think this is Michael Feel. Michael is a married father of one. He says he\'s undecided. He\'s learning  leaning toward Senator Sanders. Michael? CLINTON: Hi, Michael. MICHAEL FEEL: Hi, Secretary Clinton. As senator and as secretary of State, you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters, including myself. As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the world\'s policeman, can you assure me that as president, you would not expand our military involvement abroad? CLINTON: No, I can\'t, Michael. I mean I  I\'d like to be able to say I could, but here\'s what I can say. I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice. That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans. I worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict. That\'s why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place. I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict. I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts. But I can\'t in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America\'s best vital national security interest. So I want to be honest with you. I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions. I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria. That is off the table. That would be a terrible mistake. We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face. You know, the network of terrorist organizations  not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia  pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves. And we\'ve got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat. So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what\'s at stake. And I know you can understand why there can\'t be from me anyway a blanket statement. But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners. COOPER: I want to follow up the  yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks, and I quote, all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft, talking about Selective Service. Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service, like men? CLINTON: You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here\'s the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts. That, if we\'re going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military. I, I have to think about whether I think it\'s necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending. You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country. The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that\'s going to come out. Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if  if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it. I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system. So I just have to be better informed about why they\'re making this recommendation. COOPER: I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson. She\'s a former State Representative in New Hampshire. She says she\'s undecided and she\'s got a question for you. CLINTON: Hi, Rebecca. REBECCA HUTCHINSON: Thank you. I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question. You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience, and I\'ve heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State. But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war, which you now say was a mistake. What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn\'t make a mistake of that magnitude again? CLINTON: Oh, I think that\'s a very fair question. You know, I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake. And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration\'s approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq. The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. And he made that comment. And the U.N. Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out. Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD. And the Bush administration didn\'t give them the time. And that was a breach of faith, in my view. But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion. Turned out not to be. And I really regret that that\'s the way President Bush proceeded. That would not be something you would have to worry about with me. If I tell you we\'re going to do diplomacy, we\'re going to hang tough, we\'re going to get answers, that\'s exactly what we will do. COOPER: I want you to meet Sean Burke. He\'s a Democrat from Derry, says he is a supporter of yours. Sean? CLINTON: Hi, Sean. QUESTION: Hey. Once you become the nominee and got elected, how are you going to defend yourself against right-wing attacks? CLINTON: Well, Sean, I had a lot of practice. [laughter and applause] So I could laugh up here, but it\'s not easy. It is a brutal experience. And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care. And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself. What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying. I was just stunned. I could not understand how they got away with it. And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally. And by that I mean this. The very fair question from Rebecca. People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously. There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don\'t agree with you. But don\'t take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. And so now that I\'ve been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed. They play to keep. They play to destroy. They are constantly doing whatever they can to win. And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can\'t otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me. Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me. I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say. And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. So I know I have to keep defending against them. But I\'m the one who has the experience to do that. It\'s unlike anything you\'ve ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. And now the Koch brothers say they\'re going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee. I\'m still standing, and I will be standing. So don\'t worry about that. [applause] COOPER: Let me just simply follow up. You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s. CLINTON: Right. COOPER: Do you still believe there\'s a vast right-wing conspiracy? CLINTON: Don\'t you? [laughter] COOPER: I\'m asking you. CLINTON: Yes. It\'s gotten even better funded. You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in. And look, these guys play for keeps. They want to control our country. Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely. They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions. They want to go after any economic interests that they don\'t believe they can control. They want to destroy our balance of power. They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. I said today in Dover, you know, I don\'t think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don\'t know because they\'re not scientists. They\'re just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers. They\'re told don\'t you dare say climate change is real because we\'re in the fossil fuel business. So this is exactly what they are up to. And, yes... [applause] ... it is probably  look, at this point it\'s probably not correct to say it\'s a conspiracy because it\'s out in the open. You know, there is no doubt about what they\'re doing and who the players are and what they\'re trying to achieve. And they\'re shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding. So just know what we\'re up against because it\'s real and we\'re going to beat it. But it\'s going to take everybody working together. [applause] COOPER: I want you to meet Alison Pyott. She\'s an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders. CLINTON: Hi, Alison. ALISON PYOTT: I\'m sensing a theme here. First, thank you so much for all you\'ve done for our country and for women. CLINTON: Thank you. PYOTT: My question is the number of factors, some you have just described, have eroded trust in you. What will you do to regain that trust, engender trust in Americans and me? CLINTON: Well, thank you for starting by saying it\'s related to what I just said. And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it\'s just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there\'s nothing to Benghazi, they don\'t give it up, they keep coming after it. So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I\'ve always done. I\'ve always been guided by the same values. I have always listened to people. And I\'ve always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people. So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that. And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here\'s who I am, here\'s what I do, I want to do this with you. And I won. And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage. And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama. We saw each other very up close and personal. And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it\'s on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. And I trust the American people. I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you. And that\'s what I hope you will understand. [applause] COOPER: I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett. He\'s an independent, says he\'s undecided about his vote. Rabbi? CLINTON: Hello, Rabbi. RABBI JONATHAN SPIRA-SAVETT: Hello. Another rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note. And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me. And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes. And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets. How do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you must have, a person must have to be the leader of the free world, and also the humility to recognize that we know that you can\'t be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for? CLINTON: Another absolutely wonderful question. Thank you, Rabbi. I think about this a lot. Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it\'s incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible. This is hard for me. You know, I never thought I\'d be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president. I always wanted to be of service. I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do. I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children\'s Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. I never thought I would do this. And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who  whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable. And that  that can grip me and make me feel like there\'s something I can do about that. So I\'m constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. And I don\'t know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can\'t do it, it\'s just overwhelming, I have to retreat. It\'s that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country. And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a  you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with. And, you know, it just gets me grounded. He gets up really early to send it to me. So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services. So I really appreciate all that incoming. And the final thing I would say, because again, it\'s not anything I\'ve ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I  I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years. And so I\'ve had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues. And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns. And I  I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me. And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful. Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. But at the end, be grateful. Practice the discipline of gratitude. And that has helped me enormously. [applause] COOPER: We\'re going to have more questions from the audience for Secretary Clinton when we come back. We\'ll take a short break. [commercial break] COOPER: Welcome back to CNN\'s Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. We are here with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I want to play a piece of video... CLINTON: OK. COOPER: ...from Senator Sanders the other night in Iowa after the votes came in, and get you to respond. CLINTON: OK. [begin video clip] SANDERS: We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class, Wall Street, or corporate America. We don\'t want their money. We will... And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a Super PAC. And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa, the reason I believe we\'re going to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the other states that follow, the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy. [end video clip] COOPER: We got a number of questions, even from people who support your policies, who say they do believe that you represent the interests of Wall Street and corporate America. How do you respond? CLINTON: Well, look, that\'s just not the case. And I did represent New York, obviously. There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in CEO pay. But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what\'s happening in this campaign sees the same thing. The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me. So I just find it kind of a strange argument. I happen to agree with Sen. Sanders. I\'m not just going after Wall Street though. I think that\'s too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe. It\'s a perversion. It should be stopped. I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again... [applause] And but I just have to  I have to respectfully say, I think Sen. Sanders\' target is too small, I really do. You know I respect him going after the big banks. I agree with him. No bank is too big to fail. No executive to powerful to jail. But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank. So let\'s know the next president has to implement, but doesn\'t have to achieve that. Here\'s what I want to do. I want to go after all the other culprits. It wasn\'t just the big banks. It was the insurance company AIG. It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers. It was Countrywide Mortgage. It was Wachovia. There were a lot of bad actors. And if all you do is look over here, I\'m telling you, they\'re going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. So I\'ve got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests. I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals... [applause] ... insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy. And frankly they are undermining our democracy. This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me. We bailed them out. The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail. They didn\'t care about the millions of jobs. Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout. It turned out to be a good deal. All of us paid for it. They paid back the Treasury. So we didn\'t lose any money and we saved millions of jobs. And the auto industry just had a great year. Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout. And now they\'re not going to pay their taxes? We\'re going to go right after that. That is absolutely wrong. [applause] And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that. [applause] COOPER: One of the things... [applause] One of the things that Sen. Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs. You were paid $675,000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake? I mean was that a bad error in judgment? CLINTON: Look. I made speeches to lots of groups. I told them what I thought. I answered questions. COOPER: But did you have to be paid $675,000? CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know. That\'s what they offered, so...[laughter] You know every secretary of State that I know has done that. COOPER: But [inaudible] for office they\'re not running for an office... CLINTON: Well, I didn\'t know... COOPER: ... have known. CLINTON: To be honest I wasn\'t  I wasn\'t committed to running. I didn\'t know whether I would or not. COOPER: You didn\'t think you were going to run for president again? CLINTON: I didn\'t. You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I\'m done. And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody. I did not want to see that happen again. I want to defend President Obama\'s accomplishments and the progress we\'ve made. I want to go further. So yes, I was convinced. But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they\'ve influenced me on. Just name one thing. I\'m out here every day saying I\'m going to shut them down, I\'m going after them. I\'m going to jail them if they should be jailed. I\'m going to break them up. I mean they\'re not giving me very much money now. I can tell you that much. [laughter] Fine with me. I\'m proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I\'m really, really glad about. [applause] COOPER: So just to be clear, that\'s not something you regret, those three speeches, that money? CLINTON: No, I don\'t, because, you know, I don\'t feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they\'re on notice. COOPER: I want to see if Chris Lopez is here. Chris, there you are. Chris is an independent with a question for Secretary Clinton. She says she\'s undecided, I should point out. Chris? CLINTON: Hi, Chris. CHRIS LOPEZ: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I see a lot of hypocrisy in this country when I have a really hard time getting the medicine I need and yet it\'s really easy to get alcohol. What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people  so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need? CLINTON: I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you\'ve just briefly described. I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research. The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out. Because I want you to know what we know from science. But I also want you to be able to use it while we\'re doing the research. And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. I support that. I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy. We should be learning about what works, what doesn\'t work. Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for. Are they right? We don\'t know. That\'s why we have got to do the research. I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you\'re taking. I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana. I just want to make sure it\'s the right amount and the right kind. That\'s why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. But you said something else which I think is really important. We can\'t be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire. Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they\'ve lost their children. I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose. So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs. There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people. So we\'ve got to work on law enforcement. We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin. We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire. We\'ve got to put more money into this. So all of this to me fits together. You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges. So that\'s what I would like to do. [applause] COOPER: I want you to meet  this is Julie Carnigan, she\'s from Windham. Julie? CLINTON: Hi. JULIE CARNIGAN: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I\'m the proud mother of five girls, two of my own, three step- daughters. And unfortunately they are all ""feeling the Bern."" And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you. CLINTON: How old are they? CARNIGAN: They\'re in their  21, 22, and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old. [laughter] CLINTON: Well, first of all, tell them I\'m glad they\'re interested in politics, and I really mean that. I want them to be involved. I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time. I also want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children\'s Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South. I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people\'s rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady. Getting healthcare for our National Guard. Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. A long list. And the reason I say that is I think it\'s very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done. And as I\'ve said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders. But as the ""Concord Monitor"" said today in its writing about this, you know, it\'s, it\'s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So I don\'t want to over promise. We\'ve got too much of that. I want to tell people what I will do. I want to be specific because I do want to  to go back to the question I was asked earlier  recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America. We need to set big goals again. I am all for that. I have big, ambitious goals. Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. But I also want them to hold me accountable. I want them to say, OK, how\'s that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? We\'ve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate. Nancy Pelosi has said, we\'re not going to revisit healthcare. We\'re going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. That\'s exactly where I am. We\'re going to improve it. Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people\'s lives. I am a progressive who gets results. And I will be a progressive President who gets results. And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women\'s ambitions. And I\'m going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically. But in their lives, their profession, how they\'re treated. I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment. That\'s what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that\'s what I want for your daughters. COOPER: [inaudible]. Just as we did with Senator Sanders, we\'ve talked about a lot of important policy issues. I just want to ask kind of a couple of personal questions just for voters to get... CLINTON: You don\'t think they know everything? COOPER: Well, I don\'t know. We\'ll see about that. It\'s interesting to me, I mean you have  as you said, you have been one of the most famous women in the world now for, for decades. You have no anonymity. If you could be anonymous for just one day, what would you do? CLINTON: I used to do this in the White House and, you know, I would, I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and I would go walk. And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists. I had the best time, you know. I would, I would end up over on the Mall sometimes, walking around. And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House. I\'d be happy to. Here, why don\'t you... So, you know, there\'s nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve. So I would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore. You know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don\'t tell anybody but meet me, you know, there. That\'s what I, that\'s what I want to do, and it\'s what I get the great joy out of. I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life. And they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other. [laughter] So any time I get to spend time with them. And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that\'s the creme de le resistance... COOPER: What does she call you? CLINTON: She calls me grandma. Grandma. Yes. She\'s working really hard on words. And it was so thrilling. They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren\'t going to leave. And so they got in late the night, Saturday night. And Sunday morning I\'m getting ready. And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything. So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me. She goes ""grandma"". And honest to goodness, the caucus could\'ve ended right there. I would\'ve been perfectly happy... [applause] ... saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa. So that\'s where I\'d end my day. COOPER: You talked about the circle of friends you have. Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away. CLINTON: Right. COOPER: In 2008 she was part of your campaign. CLINTON: She was. COOPER: And you wrote about how at the end of the day you would, you know, sit around the kitchen table with her, kick off your shoes and just talk about everything that had happened. CLINTON: Right. COOPER: What do you think  what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year? CLINTON: You know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid. And her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life. And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl. You know you get knocked down. Everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get up. And when you get up, what do you do? How do you behave? Are you going to be bitter? Angry? Upset? Are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else? And I\'m sure that\'s exactly what she\'d be saying now. She\'d be encouraging me. She\'d be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it\'s a brutal business being in politics. And people say things about those you love, whether it\'s your daughter or someone else. So she was very supportive. But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time. And so I would sit with her and I would say don\'t listen to that stuff, mom. And she\'d say, well I have to know what they\'re saying about you. And I\'d say you know don\'t put yourself through that. And so that would be what she\'d be doing now I think too. Yes. COOPER: I want you to be able to make your closing argument... CLINTON: Oh. COOPER: ... to the people in New Hampshire. CLINTON: Well, thank you. Well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary. You know I said earlier today some people said well you know Sen. Sanders is ahead. And I respect that. And so maybe you know I should go onto the next state. And I said absolutely not. New Hampshire has been so good to me and my family. And I love campaigning in New Hampshire. I love this process. So, you\'re going to have to put up with me. I\'m going to be going around the state, going to as many events as I can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what I am offering. I really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we\'ve made and to get results for people. To get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that\'s my goal. I will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn\'t even yet recovered from the Great Recession. We\'re going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. We\'re going to make it work. We\'re going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people. And we\'re going to defend our rights. We\'re going to defend a woman\'s right to make her own health care decisions. [applause] We\'re going to defend Planned Parenthood. We\'re going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against LGBT Americans. And we\'re going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have... [applause] ... 33,000 people a year die from gun violence. [applause] So please, join me in this campaign. I hope you will come out and vote for me on Tuesday. And I will fight for you every single day in the White House. Thank you all very much. [cheers and applause] COOPER: I want to thank both candidates for coming tonight, the voters for being here and asking such amazing questions... [applause] And the viewers at home. I also want to thank everybody with the Derry Opera House for their hospitality...[cheers] With the New Hampshire primaries now just days away, a reminder we\'ll be here for it all with [inaudible] expert analysis... [applause] Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this. [cheers] Thanks again. CLINTON: Thank you all. [applause] Thank you, guys. [applause]'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 7, 2016","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News ""This Week""'","b'STEPHANOPOULOS: We\'re joined now by his [Sanders] opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She joins us now from Manchester, as well. Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning. So you have had your own turn on ""Saturday Night Live."" How did he do? CLINTON: Well, I didn\'t get to see it, but it\'s always a fun experience. I\'m sure he did great. You know, it\'s a wonderful forum. It\'s a crash course in trying to figure out how to do live TV. And I had a great time doing it. STEPHANOPOULOS: We also had, of course, the Republican debate last night here at St. Anselm\'s. And Marco Rubio called you out on the issue of abortion. Take a look. [begin video clip] MARCO RUBIO: Why doesn\'t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child? Why don\'t they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that\'s a fundamental right. They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can\'t wait to expose them in a general election. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you going to get exposed in a general election? CLINTON: You know, George, I  it\'s really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. You know, I\'ve been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that I\'ve had for a very long time. But what\'s really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn ""Roe v. Wade,"" to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme... STEPHANOPOULOS: But are there any... CLINTON:  and I  I think the Amer... STEPHANOPOULOS:  restrictions you would accept on late-term abortions? CLINTON: Well, you know, I\'ve been on the record on this for a long time. You know, I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account. And, you know, when he raises the, you know, very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons. I\'ve met women who have had to face this excruciating choice. This is not something that anyone that I\'ve ever met with enters into without the deepest thought, the most careful consideration. And I remember at an event back in the \'90s, where, you know, we sat and talked with some of the women who had to make a very hard decision. You know, it\'s  it\'s just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of very difficult concerns. STEPHANOPOULOS: You... CLINTON: And I don\'t think he should be allowed to get away with that. STEPHANOPOULOS: You had your own debate with Bernie Sanders this week, as well. And he challenged  you challenged him to come up with evidence that contributions from Wall Street ever influenced your positions. He and his team have circulated the charge from Elizabeth Warren, who said you changed your position on the bankruptcy bill back in 2001 because of contributions. Here\'s what Senator Warren had to say. [begin video clip] ELIZABETH WARREN: One of the first bills that came up after she was Senator Clinton was the bankruptcy bill. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And? WARREN: She voted in favor of it. She has taken money from the groups. And more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency. [end video clip] STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you respond to that charge? CLINTON: Well, I\'m glad you asked me about it, because this is one of these, you know, innuendo insinuation charges that the Sanders campaign is engaging in. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that was Senator Warren, though. CLINTON: If you  no, but  but I know. But if you had played the entire quote, you know, what you would have heard her say, she and I worked together in 2000 to stop a bankruptcy bill that we both believed was very harmful. When I got to the Senate in 2001, one of the first big votes there was on a version of the bankruptcy bill and I was deluged by women\'s groups and children\'s advocates groups to do everything I could to make sure that child support and women\'s precarious financial situation in case of divorce or not being able to get the kind of funding they needed from a partner or a spouse in bankruptcy would not be endangered. And it was. The current  that bill was making it a very low priority. So I did go to work on behalf of all these women\'s groups and children\'s groups because they needed a champion. And I got that bill changed. And in return, it had nothing to do with any money whatsoever  and I resent deeply any effort by the Sanders campaign to so imply... STEPHANOPOULOS: But... CLINTON: It had to do with trying to get a deal... STEPHANOPOULOS: But that\'s not what... CLINTON:  that would protect women. But now let me finish, George, because this has been bandied about and I just want to set the record straight. And so then three years later, part of the  part of what Senator  Senator Warren said, you played. You didn\'t play the whole thing, because we\'ve been allies. I faced a tough decision and I stood up for women and children. I went to the Senate floor, said that was exactly what I was doing. Then the bill did not pass. It never became law. And then when the next bill came up, 2005, women\'s issues were taken care of because I had made that a point back in 2001. And so then I was against that bill. I didn\'t get a chance to actually vote against it because Bill was in the hospital having a heart procedure. But I put a statement out. I was against it. So I\'m happy to set this record straight. And I really want to, once again, call out the Sanders campaign, which claims they like to run a positive campaign. But they have been quite artful in raising questions and trying to cast doubts about my record. And I really am not going to sit and take it anymore  STEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator  CLINTON: I have a public record. I have never, ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of money. So I\'m just going to keep setting the record straight. STEPHANOPOULOS: But in her book, Senator Warren said the bill was essentially the same but Hillary Clinton  Hillary Rodham Clinton was not. Big banks were now part of Secretary Clinton\'s consistency. She wanted their support. They wanted hers, including  CLINTON: George, look, I  look, I have the greatest  I have the greatest respect for Senator Warren. As I said, we did work together. I faced a choice. I could have said to the women who have been my advocates for 30 years, I\'m sorry; I\'m now in the Senate. But you know, I can\'t help you. Nobody else is helping them. They were desperate to get help. They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt, that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged. I could have said, you know, I can\'t do that because somebody in 10 years might say that, you know, something else is going on. That\'s not the way I work. So they came to me; I said this is outrageous. I went to the floor. I lobbied to get a change. And as part of getting that change from both Democrats and Republicans, who were leading that legislation, they said if we change this bill at the last minute to take account of these issues you\'re raising about women and children, which they had not clearly made a priority before I showed up, then you know, you have to say you\'ll vote for it. It was  you know, look, that\'s what you have to do. I swallowed hard; I said OK. But it was also the case it didn\'t get passed. So I got what I needed into the bill. It stayed in the bill, even in the bad version that I posed in 2005. So thanks for the opportunity to set the record straight. STEPHANOPOULOS: In the debate the other night, you said you\'d look into whether or not to release the transcripts of your speeches to financial groups. Have you made up your mind? CLINTON: Yes, you know, here\'s another thing I want to say. Let everybody who\'s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them. We\'ll all release them at the same time. You know, I don\'t mind being the subject in Republican debates, the subject in the Democratic primary. That kind of goes with the territory. I\'ve been around long enough. But at some point, you know, these rules need to apply to everybody. And there are a bunch of folks, including, you know, my opponent, who\'s given, you know, speeches to groups and people on the other side who\'ve given speeches to groups. Let  if this is now going to be a new standard so then it should apply to everybody and then I\'ll be happy to look into it further. STEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning. CLINTON: Great to talk to you, George, thanks.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 7, 2016","b'Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News ""Face the Nation""'","b'DICKERSON: We begin with campaign 2016 and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is fighting to close a double-digit gap in the polls behind Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. She joins us from Manchester. Secretary Clinton, your name came up, not surprisingly, in the Republican debate. [laughter] Senator Marco Rubio claimed that on the question of abortion that you support abortion on baby\'s due date. What do you say to that? CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s pretty pathetic, John. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has been just going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I have been on record for years about where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate, that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. And to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season, to try to raise the false charges and look like he\'s going to try to make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried-and-true tactic by those on the right. DICKERSON: His charge here, though, is in terms of late-term abortions, that you talk about medical issues, but there are nonmedical abortions, he would say, and others who share his view would say, and that you\'re not having any restrictions on those who would choose to have an abortion for nonmedical reasons puts you on the extreme side of this. CLINTON: Well, it\'s just not true. People should go back read Roe v. Wade. Reasonable kinds of restrictions can be imposed as long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account, and that is what the law is today. And I remember very well having a lot of incredibly difficult conversations listening to women who were told something devastating toward the end of their pregnancy, who were facing horrible kinds of consequences to their health and even potentially to their life. That\'s why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman, by her physician and her family. But, of course, under Roe v. Wade, there are certain guidelines. And Senator Rubio should know that, or I hope he does now. DICKERSON: In the town hall the other night, you said that the financial interests  quote  ""are not giving me very much money now."" But according to ""The Washington Post"" analysis, donors of hedge funds, banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms have given you at least $21.4 million. That\'s about 10 percent of what you have raised. That seems like a lot of money. CLINTON: Well, that\'s just not the calculation that we have done. But that\'s somebody\'s analysis. I\'m not going to argue with it. What\'s really going on here, John, is disturbing to me. I will be really frank with you. What the Sanders campaign is trying to do is link donations to my political campaign or really donations to anyone\'s political campaign with undue influence, with changing people\'s views and votes. I have never, ever done that. And I really do resent the implication, or, as I said the other night, the insinuation. It would be like saying that President Obama, who took probably more money from Wall Street than any Democrat certainly had in 2008 with his successful campaign, was therefore automatically disqualified. Well, in fact, we know that was not true. He signed the toughest financial regulations since the 1930s with the Dodd-Frank bill. This is a very artful smear. And I\'m just not going to sit and take it anymore. DICKERSON: Are you saying, though, on these questions that people from the financial services industry have no greater access to you than anybody else? CLINTON: I\'m saying that I am available to and open to listening to people from all walks of life. I always have been. I always will be. But talk to the  if people want to donate to me from whatever industry, they know where I stand. They know that I called them out on the mortgage market mess back in  before the great crash happened. And I always like to remind people, it was not me, it was Senator Sanders who voted to deregulate slots and derivatives, which gave Lehman Brothers a lot of extra leverage, which was one of the contributing factors to their collapse, which obviously contributed to what happened in the great recession. So, we can take these step by step and try to unwind them, but it doesn\'t change the basic facts. People know where I stand. I rolled out the toughest, most effective effort to rein in financial abuse of anybody in this campaign. And it goes much further than Dodd-Frank. It goes much further than restoring Glass-Steagall, a 1930s efforts. It goes into shadow banking. It goes after hedge funds. It goes after carried interest loophole. Now, that is full disclosure. I am on the record. If somebody in one of these firms wants to give me money, I hope they know they\'re giving money to someone who is going to make sure they never wreck the economy again. DICKERSON: In the debate, you also said  quote  ""Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment."" CLINTON: Right. DICKERSON: But isn\'t the experience you\'re  the experience you\'re running on gained through years of working in Democratic politics, doesn\'t that put you in the establishment, all that experience? CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know. Senator Sanders has lot more time in elective office than I do. And I find that sort of an amusing contrast. He\'s been elected official for 25 years, far longer than I was. I think I bring a great mix of experience. And I think being a woman is a big part of how I see problems, how I think about solving problems, what I believe is absolutely foundational, starting with children and their lives and their opportunities. On my way to Flint today to go and meet with the mayor, who asked me to come because she wants to keep the national spotlight on what happened to the children in her community. And I commend her for it. So, I think that the experiences I have had starting when I was in an advocate taking on the establishment, going on to be first lady, taking on the drug companies and the pharmacy companies, taking on the financial system, taking on a lot of big lobbies like the gun lobby, I think that I have shown that I have got a lot of experience taking on the establishment. And I\'m proud of what I bring to the table to actually be able to solve problems and get results for people. DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Clinton, we will have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. CLINTON: Great to talk to you, John. Thanks.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 7, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""'","b'TODD: We\'ll have my interview this morning with Donald Trump in just a few minutes. But we\'re going to begin with the Democrats and former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. You liked that ""graveyard of pollsters"" line, didn\'t you? CLINTON: Well, I\'ve lived through this twice  TODD: You\'ve lived through this. CLINTON:  in \'92 and 2008. And look, I know I\'m behind. And I\'m going to keep fighting until the very last vote is counted because I care about this primary. TODD: Why do you think you started with such a big deficit this time, considering  look, this has been a big state to both your husband and yourself, very important. CLINTON: Yes. TODD: They\'ve always helped you. CLINTON: Well, look, I can\'t sit here and analyze all the reasons. Obviously, one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years. So there\'s a familiarity with him. I totally respect that. And I just think that what\'s great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first, second, third, fourth, fifth look. I mean, yesterday, as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other, talking to voters, I literally had people come up, say you changed my mind, you know, who knows. I mean, this is what\'s so exciting about the primary, Chuck. I came in in 2008, as I recall, like 16 points behind. I remember the night before the primary in \'92, Bill\'s pollster saying, you know, you\'re in single digits. It\'s over. Who knows. I love this excitement. And you know, I\'m going to fight as hard as I can. But I\'m having a great time whatever happens. TODD: All right. Let\'s  I want to go to the debate a little bit because I would say the foreign policy section is one that you guys wanted to highlight because you felt as if he didn\'t do so well. You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it. But some of the things that you said about Senator Obama\'s readiness on foreign policy, they are very similar to what you\'ve said about Bernie Sanders. In \'08, you said, ""I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House. I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House."" Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002; it sounds very similar to what you said when you\'re like, OK, you had one vote on the Iraq war  CLINTON: Well, you know what  TODD: What\'s the difference between what you said about then- Senator Obama and what you\'re saying about Senator Sanders? CLINTON: There\'s a very big difference. In 2008, Senator Obama had really done his homework in the Senate. He\'d been there by that time a few years. He had developed a network of advisors on national security and foreign policy issues. They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready, that he had as broad a set of views as possible. And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me. That\'s not happening in this campaign. There really isn\'t any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders. I\'ll let him speak for himself. I think that what\'s important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day. And we know we got a particularly complex world right now. And the president\'s not going to have the time. Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of, you know, the way the world functioned. But now it\'s North Korea with its missile tests, it\'s Russian aggression, it\'s enforcing the Iran agreement. You have to do it all at once. TODD: Do you think the Iraq vote should still matter to voters? CLINTON: Look, I think that voters are perfectly free to take into account anything they want to take. But I also hope they\'ll take the rest of the record. You know, I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden. I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table. I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief. TODD: I\'m curious, do you believe if it wasn\'t for the Iraq War we wouldn\'t have ISIS today? CLINTON: Well, I think that\'s a hard conclusion to draw because, remember, we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS. Al Qaeda attacked us in New York. Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa  [crosstalk] TODD: The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we  that if Saddam Hussein were still there, we wouldn\'t have ISIS. CLINTON: Well, I think that\'s a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesn\'t really add up. The Iraq War, there\'s no doubt, contributed to instability. I\'m not going to in any way deny that. But you cannot draw a direct line. What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda  TODD: Right. CLINTON:  and moving onto its latest incarnations, most particularly ISIS, is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East. And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how it\'s going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it  so, yes, we\'ve got a much bigger set of problems. TODD: All right. Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate. Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud. We didn\'t get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique. I\'d like to ask you to respond to it now. CLINTON: Well, I think it\'s the kind of extreme statement that, once you really take a hard look at it, it\'s hard to understand. You know, when you talk about Wall Street, are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? That\'s never really clarified. What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy. The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity, from amassing too much power and influence. But we live in a complex global economy where we\'ve got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy. And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks. We have to have a much more robust community banking system, regional banking system, other forms of credit access. And that\'s what I am advocating for. And I still do not understand why I\'m having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there, the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector. TODD: Do you  can you have a Treasury Secretary who isn\'t familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think there\'s so much distrust right now. CLINTON: Yes. There is. There is. TODD: On Wall Street. Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after. I think there certainly right now isn\'t an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary. And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they don\'t understand Wall Street? CLINTON: Well, you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy, the American economy and the global economy. I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary  [crosstalk] TODD: Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background? CLINTON: You know, I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving, to get more good jobs created, to get incomes rising, to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there. We\'ve got to figure out what we\'re going to do with China. China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope. So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding. But we\'ve got to put the needs of the American economy first. And that\'s going to be my commitment. TODD: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  a comment that I\'ve heard her say before. But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people. She said, there\'s a special place in hell for women who don\'t help women. But the implication is that somehow, if you\'re a Democratic woman and you\'re not supporting you, what\'s wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that? CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, as you remember, Madeleine has been saying this for many, many years. TODD: Starbucks cups, I think, centers on that. I get that. CLINTON: She believes it firmly and., in part, because she knows what a struggle it has been. And she understands the struggle is not over. So I don\'t want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very  TODD: You can understand why some might have been offended by it? CLINTON: Well, good grief, we\'re getting offended about everything these days. Honest to goodness, I mean, people can\'t say anything without offending somebody. She has a life experience that I respect. I admire her greatly. And I think what she was trying to do, which she\'s done in every setting I\'ve ever seen her, in going back 20-plus years, was to remind young women particularly that this struggle, which many of us have been part of is, not over. And don\'t be in any way lulled by the progress we\'ve made. And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark, which people can take however they choose. TODD: All right. What do you got in the Super Bowl? CLINTON: I don\'t have anybody right now. TODD: You don\'t have anybody? CLINTON: I\'m going to Flint, Michigan, I\'m worrying about the kids in Flint, Michigan, trying to figure out what we\'re going to do to make sure they\'re not damaged irreparably by this  TODD: So you\'re going today, you could have gone Wednesday. That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire? CLINTON: I love New Hampshire. And you know, the mayor asked me to come. This was as early as we could get it done. I want to lend my support. I\'m very hopeful the Congress, which is trying to work in a bipartisan way, will come up with some funding to deal with these problems that have afflicted the community. And I\'m going to keep doing everything I can to help them. TODD: Secretary Clinton, I know you got a plane to catch. CLINTON: Thanks. Great to talk to you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 7, 2016","b'Interview with Jake Tapper of CNN\'s ""State of the Union""'","b""TAPPER: Some breaking news now: CNN will host a Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, on March 6, just two days before that state's primary. Hillary Clinton is actually going to leave the campaign trail here in New Hampshire to visit Flint, Michigan, today. But, first, she's right here... [laughter] ... right next to me, live. Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for being here. CLINTON: Well, Jake, congratulations on doing the debate in Flint. It's really important we keep the spotlight on this problem. And you're right. I'm leaving here. I'm going to Flint. The mayor asked me to come. They're trying to, you know, really have a lot of support, because we hope that there will be some good news coming out of Congress in the next few days. And it's just  it's an issue that I don't want people to forget about. Because it's not the only Flint in our country. TAPPER: Right. CLINTON: There are other places where these kinds of toxins, lead, other sorts of pollutants are really affecting people's lives. And I'm just not going to give up on this. TAPPER: Can I ask you a question? Just a clarification of what you think needs to be done in term of the people there... CLINTON: Yes. TAPPER: ... who need water and need infrastructure built. CLINTON: Right. TAPPER: You have called for the citizens of Michigan, the State of Michigan to be billed, but you're also supporting this bill from senators Stabenow and Peters from Michigan that would make it a federal payment. CLINTON: Right. TAPPER: Do you think that it should be a state issue in terms of the money paying for Flint, or should it be a federal issue? CLINTON: It should be both and partly because there's a broad set of needs that have to be addressed. Yes, the infrastructure must be repaired and modernized. Yes, we do have to get emergency means in to get water, get the kind of nutritional support. You know, I know something about lead poisoning because of work I've done in the past and  TAPPER: With the Children's Defense Fund? CLINTON: Well, and as a senator from New York. We had a lot of, you know, old housing with lead paint in it. A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning. And part of the challenge is you've got to intervene early. We need comprehensive health screenings. Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins. You've got to begin to work to counteract the lead. Then we've got to get the educational, additional help that kids need. This is a big deal, because it's not only about fixing the infrastructure, but it's also about the future. How we're going to take care of these kids going forward. So there's a lot of work to be done. And I think it has to be both the state and a federal responsibility. TAPPER: You know, what's really so upsetting is as you know, just a little bit of lead can cause permanent damage. CLINTON: There is no  there is no acceptable level of lead for kids. TAPPER: Yes. Exactly. CLINTON: None. TAPPER: So according to what we know now, the state knew, at least in February  and the federal EPA knew at least in April, and yet it wasn't until months, months later. So obviously, this is a failing on the local level. But do you also think it's a failing by the EPA? CLINTON: Well, I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened. Why wasn't this sounding alarms everywhere? And I don't want to prejudge it. I don't know what the answer to that question is. I'm focused on OK, what do we do now? The damage has been done. How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical, lasting consequences that children face when they've been poisoned by lead? So I'm trying to look at the future. I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and that's really important, because we do have to, you know, open this inquiry more broadly. You know, I've said that we've got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher, killing, you know, young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what they're exposed to. You know, our children's health should be the highest priority for our country, and so anything I can do, and I'll keep doing it to really beat the drums on this but to ask people hey, let's look everywhere. You know, Flint  we've got to help flint. It's a terrible, horrible set of circumstances. TAPPER: Mm-hmm. CLINTON: But we also have to be looking at other places to try to make sure that this doesn't happen to other kids. TAPPER: So I can't help but notice it's also the New Hampshire primaries coming up in two day. CLINTON: Oh, it is? [laughter] TAPPER: So just to move to politics for one second. Your family has a long history here. You obviously won here in 2008. Your husband staged his comeback here in 1992. Can you win here? Is it possible that you can win here? CLINTON: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just going to work as hard as I can. I love the New Hampshire primary. I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding, and voters in this state take a first, second, third, fourth look at you. They're constantly evaluating. I have been telling voters across the state, this is the biggest job interview in the world. You've got to really think hard about what the job is, who can be president, who can be commander in chief, and then you have to really judge us. And I don't know what's going to happen. I know I'm behind. I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process. TAPPER: So you said the other night at the  I forget if it was the debate or the town hall, they all run together in my mind, but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group... CLINTON: Right. TAPPER: ... and changed your vote. The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140,000.00 from the banking interests, and as a result, according to Warren, not me, changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill. CLINTON: Right. Right. TAPPER: Now I want  I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation. And also the fact that Sanders' campaign sent it out, but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself. CLINTON: Well. that's their  that's their typical, you know, artistic smear. You know, the campaign sends out something, gets people riled up, and then they say oh no, we're running a positive campaign. Enough. OK, I'm glad you raised this, because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all. I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard, in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill. And then when I got to the Senate in 2001, early on, there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill. I was deluged  now as a senator, not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill, I was deluged by women's groups and children's groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support, did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner, their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations. And, you know, literally, people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this. You've got to help us. We've got to change that provision. I took that on. And I went to the floor. And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill. I said, you can't do this. You've got to change that provision. And they did. But they also put it to me. They said, if we change this provision, you have to vote for the bill. Now, that's what happens sometimes. I didn't like the bill any more than I had liked it before. It still had very bad provision. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So OK, I held my nose. I voted for it. It never became law. When it came back in 2005, I was against it. I didn't actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure, but I put out a statement on the floor. You can look at what I said in 2001. You can look at what I said in 2005. And so I'm glad to set this record straight. You know, but this kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation is really getting old. You know, hey can't point to anything. They are grabbing at straws to make this case. But let's ask Senator Sanders' campaign, why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged, collapsing and helping to bring down the economy. You know, this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand. I have the toughest, most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry. I don't understand why he doesn't join me. Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing. We have to look at the shadow banking industry. Everybody knows where I stand on this. So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans. TAPPER: A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter. Now, I would observe  I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesn't exactly talk in a whisper. But that said, do you think that  do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that, they have a different standard for you? CLINTON: And I don't want to single anybody out, Jake. Look, we are still living with a double standard and I know it. Every woman I know knows it. Whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics. And I don't know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena. You know, sometimes I talk soft. Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited. I don't know any man who doesn't do the same thing. And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me, once again. I'm so used to this. I'm going to keep making my case. I'm going to keep talking about what I will do as president. I'm going to keep laying out my record. Because I think it's really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017. TAPPER: Last question, madam secretary. How has this experience of running for president changed you, if it has? CLINTON: You know, I think the most amazing learning experience. And having gone through this now twice, I think I am a different person than I was back in '08. I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job. But you run at different points in a country's, you know, thinking. And right now we're at a time when people are on both sides, Republicans, Democrats, right, left, people are really worried that our economy isn't working for them, that our government isn't working for them. And that's causing a lot of the anger and the frustration. I totally get that. I feel it. You know, things have been going on that are just wrong. These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights, Citizens United  those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country. The great recession, for which there were a number of causes, but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets. People deserve to be upset. But what I'm saying  and maybe it's not the most popular theme these days. You know, get angry, vent, but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy, and we have work to do. And I'm confident we can do that work. But we're going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK, we've got to make sure the economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. Here's my plan for jobs and raising incomes. We've got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down, but gets coverage to 100 percent. Here's what I can do about that. Let's have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview. OK, I've got the experience, I've got the passion. And here's what I'm going to do with it. And that's what I think the country needs, because people are just whipping them up. I mean, on the Republican side, all of this rhetoric, this demagoguery, which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel. And I just think that's not who we are. We are the premier problem-solvers of human history. We've got to get back to doing that together. TAPPER: All right, Madam Secretary. We'll see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday. CLINTON: I'll be there. Thank you. TAPPER: Thanks so much for stopping by. Appreciate it. CLINTON: Nice to talk to you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"February 8, 2016",b'Interview with Rachel Maddow of MSNBC',"b'MADDOW: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for this time.CLINTON: My pleasure to see you again. MADDOW: So, we\'re very close to voting in New Hampshire. CLINTON: We are. MADDOW: The polls show Senator Sanders still significantly ahead. If you do not win in New Hampshire, does that imply that there\'s going to be  or in your mind, does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this? CLINTON: You know, Rachel, I\'ve always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have. I always knew Iowa was going to be really, really hard. And we won, narrow, but a win is a win. MADDOW: One quarter of one percent. CLINTON: Yes, I\'m always happy about that. I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years, he\'s on the Congress for that long, he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area. So, I always knew this was going to be hard. I feel good about the campaign we waged here. I think we have an uphill battle. We\'re going to battle it until the last votes are counted and we\'re going to turn around and head off for the next contest. MADDOW: Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that there\'s changes in the works. There\'s always these sort of campaign gossip stories. But they are say  they say they\'re citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. Their lead is, ""Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaign\'s messaging and digital operations, they\'re considering staffing and strategy changes after what\'s expected to be a loss in Tuesday\'s primary."" Are you planning some sort of shake up like that? CLINTON: Yes, somebody showed that to me. I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to. We\'re going to take stock. But it\'s going to be the campaign I\'ve got. I\'m confident in the people I have. I\'m very committed to them. They\'re committed to doing the best we can. We\'re going to take stock. What works, what doesn\'t work? We\'re moving into a different phase of the campaign. We\'re moving into different geographic areas. So, of course, it would be malpractice not to say, OK, what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out? MADDOW: President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter. President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines, when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign, essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical, dishonest, calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters. Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it. Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that he\'s been dishonest and hypocritical? CLINTON: Well, here\'s my view, and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online, they\'re being harassed at our events. They are being really treated badly. Look, I\'m all for people who are for my opponent. I think it\'s great to bring in as many new, young people as possible. I want people treated respectfully. I think that\'s part of what he was talking about. I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks. We were running I thought a good campaign on issues. We\'re getting to the point we have to draw contrasts. That\'s natural. You know, I have a health care approach. He has a health care approach. We may have the same goal, but we have a different view about how we get there. That is fair game, as it should be. But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week, was a kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation, kind of artful smears. And I just said enough is enough. You know, if you have something to say to my face, say it. If you can point to any event, any vote, any view that you think has been influenced by any donation I\'ve ever made, call it out, you know? Then, they put up the bankruptcy bill. I answered that yesterday on the morning shows. And so, I want this innuendo to stop. You know, let\'s just be honest with each other. Look, Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street. He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. That\'s what we do. That doesn\'t mean his views are compromised. It doesn\'t mean my views and it doesn\'t mean that President Obama\'s views when he was running for the presidency  he took a lot of money from Wall Street  in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules. So, it\'s a  you know, he gets his supporters  he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages. And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and they\'re going off on tangents. They can attack me, that\'s fine. I\'m in the arena. But to go after journalists who say something nice about me, to go after supporters who post things, to go after elected officials who are for me, because, you know, I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both. And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what I\'m saying. MADDOW: As a journalist, and who is an out and proud liberal, I get attacked 50/50 by people who say I\'m a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said, it said I\'m dyed in the wool partisan for you. And people really have decided one way or the other, about 50/50, that I\'m completely in the tank. I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders. If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters, could you? I mean, he said he doesn\'t want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters, can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do? CLINTON: I think we should do what we can. But I\'m also focused on what he says. You know, his argument basically is this. Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised. They\'re vote has been bought. They can\'t be trusted. That is just not true. If it is true, now it includes him we know because he\'s taken contributions from Wall Street. MADDOW: He said yesterday that no politician, there\'s never been a politician in history who says, yes, the money that I took influences me. So, therefore, essentially implying like the defense that there isn\'t, that you don\'t claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense. CLINTON: But let\'s put out the proof, Rachel. Don\'t listen to what people say. I find it deeply offensive. You know, I have worked really hard. I\'ve taken on many more powerful groups than he has. I\'ve taken on the drug companies, the insurance companies. I\'ve got big oil going after me. I\'ve got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me, which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie, why are they trying to defeat me? I\'ve taken onto gun lobby, something that, you know, he never has done. So, I\'ve got the scars to prove my bona fides and what I\'m willing to take on and how I\'ve stood firm against an onslaught of attacks, you know, turning me into the political pinata sometimes. So, point to the evidence. Otherwise, stop it. Let\'s talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act. You want to start over with single payer. Let the people decide what\'s the best way to do this. So, that\'s what this should be about. MADDOW: On the  staying for a moment on that, that line of attack. You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches, that you would look into it. We\'ve had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts. What\'s the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches? CLINTON: Well, you know what I said the other day  you know, look, I\'m getting a little bit weary of the double standard. There\'s a lot of people on both sides. If we\'re going to start saying what you did when you\'re out of public office, when you\'re in the private sector, what you did, fair game. Release it all. I\'m all for that. MADDOW: You mean all presidential candidates? CLINTON: Yes, everybody, release everything. But again, I\'ve been asking to do something for which there\'s no basis, just the attempt to cast suspicion. So, I said I will look into it. We will look into it. But, you know, what\'s good for the gander should be good for the goose. [laughter] MADDOW: So, you wouldn\'t do it unilaterally, but if everybody\'s going to do it, you would do it? CLINTON: Well, this is  I\'m really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire, to be honest. I want to get through tomorrow, and then, you know, it\'s going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances. MADDOW: Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night? CLINTON: I was at my own event in Portsmouth. So, I  I did not see. MADDOW: Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again? CLINTON: I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around. MADDOW: Do you have  I mean, he\'s seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party. Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him? CLINTON: I\'m going to leave my opinions to myself because I don\'t want to in any way influence their process, because they have to make their decision and clearly, the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is, the better it will be for us. MADDOW: I went to some Republican candidate events since I\'ve been up here and  CLINTON: They let you in? MADDOW: They let me in. I wear a baseball hat. Incognito situation. But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events. And I found a number of different women to talk to. Some are dyed this wool Republicans, but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat. I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008. But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year. And 2-1, the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest. They have issue with your trustworthiness. I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates. I\'m sure you disagree with that assessment from them. I understand that. But how do you make the case to people, to women in particular for whom that\'s the objection. That\'s why they can\'t pull the lever for you. CLINTON: You know, obviously, this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me, who know me, work with me and count on me know who I am. But I thought a lot about it, Rachel, because when you think back, I emerged on the national scene in 1992. I have been under relentless attack ever since. Now, just read behavioral science, read psychology, even when the attacks proved to be unfounded, untrue, it leaves a residue, right? People say, well, why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there. So, I get through the \'90s. I run for the Senate. Same thing happen. I worked, I gained the trust of the people of New York. When I run again, I get a larger percentage of the vote. So, people who see me in action, people who count on me, people who know that if I tell you something intend to do, I will do everything in my power to make that happen. Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around, say I trust you, I want you to be my secretary of state. When I\'m holding office, I get along well with Republicans. I will always have the, you know, right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out. They view me as a threat. And I accept that. But when I get to work with people, we get things done. And that\'s been my pattern. So, when I get that question and I ask people, I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they don\'t know. Then a lot of them will say, well, Benghazi. I said, OK, Benghazi. You know, did you know there were nine separate investigations, eight of them independent, one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically. And they all reach the same conclusions. There were things we could have and should have done better. I immediately said we would. I testified for 11 hours. I answered every question, but it\'s still on the TV. I hear people talking about it. I can\'t stop them from talking about it. I can only tell you what the facts are. I can tell you that in the last, what, 36, 37 years, we\'ve had terrorist problems in Iran, in Lebanon, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in New York and, yes, in Benghazi  none of them were every politicized. We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut. The Democrats didn\'t stand up and go after the secretary of state. We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania, 12 Americans, hundreds of Africans. Madeleine Albright was secretary of state, she forthrightly asked for a report. She made it public. People didn\'t turn it into a partisan attack. So, I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick, it will cloud people\'s judgment of me. So, that\'s a burden I carry. But when you stop and think, you know, the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me. I have the governor of Vermont supporting me. I have Pat Leahy, the senator from Vermont supporting me, the two former governors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me. They clearly know us both. They clearly prefer to support me. I have the senator here, the governor in New Hampshire. They know me. They trust me. They\'re not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason. I have all my friends from the Senate, Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar, they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me, and they trust me. So, I can\'t stop the barrage of attacks. I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves, why does the right and particularly the Republicans, spend so much time, money and effort through the media, through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other, accusing me of being this and that, all kinds of accusations. Why? I\'ll tell you why, because they are afraid of me. They know that I will be a president who, yes, I will listen to people, I will seek common ground, but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done. And that\'s the last thing these guys want to see again. MADDOW: What did you learn by going there that you didn\'t need before? CLINTON: Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families. A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning, a year ago April, pregnant with twins, started seeing rashes, lost her twins. Just sitting there like I\'m sitting with you just hearing that story, you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in. And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor, getting into the real detail about what they could and couldn\'t do and how they literally couldn\'t get phone calls returned, letters answered, talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention, talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need. It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry. I have no argument with the anger, the insecurity, the fear, the worry that people have when your government fails you, when the economy fails you, when politics fails you, anger is a natural and frankly expected result. But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said, OK, we are so distraught, our hearts are broken. Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next, but we need a plan. So I came to try to get them more support, working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves, and I got a long list of, you know, follow up I will be doing over the next weeks. MADDOW: You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through  CLINTON: Yes. MADDOW:  to the end. I will say just my opinion being there, my felling when I was there was that I couldn\'t believe, the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to. What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint. So, there\'s a lot love people, average, poor American city, people don\'t have transportation or people could be house bound, elderly people, right now, still, to this day, today the day before the New Hampshire primary, the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day  is there a sense in which the emergency, not just fixing it for the long haul, but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isn\'t being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now? CLINTON: Yes. Yes. Look, as I said yesterday, we\'ve got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed. Congress is working on that, my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge. We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met. You mentioned one of them, clean water. We still don\'t have all the testing set up to be done. MADDOW: Right. CLINTON: We don\'t have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools. We don\'t know whether we can get not just clean water, but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues, muscles, et cetera. So, we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust, and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way, not just to empower, but to hire people in the community, to be the outreach workers, to do the water delivery, to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods. So, we\'re putting together under the mayor\'s leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them, what they need to be able to do them. A lot of them don\'t need training. Some of them might. And so, how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council, county commissioners and others, there\'s roles for everybody to play, but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed. MADDOW: And quick. CLINTON: Yes, and very quick.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"March 21, 2016","b'Remarks at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC'","b'Thank you so much. It is wonderful to be here and see so many friends. I\'ve spoken at a lot of AIPAC conferences in the past, but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here, thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country. I think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause.You will keep the U.S.-Israel relationship going strong. You know, as a senator from New York and secretary of state I\'ve had the privilege of working closely with AIPAC members to strengthen and deepen America\'s ties with Israel. Now, we may not have always agreed on every detail, but we\'ve always shared an unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to Israel\'s future as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people.And your support helped us expand security and intelligence, cooperation, develop the Iron Dome missile defense system, build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on Iran and so much more. Since my first visit to Israel 35 years ago, I\'ve returned many times and made many friends. I\'ve worked with and learned from some of Israel\'s great leaders, although, I don\'t think Yitzhak Rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the White House balcony when he wanted to smoke.Now I\'m here as a candidate for president and I know that all of you understand what\'s at stake in this election. Our next president will walk into the Oval Office next January and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on. The next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every American and the security of our friends around the world.So we have to get this right. As AIPAC members, you understand that while the turmoil of the Middle East presents enormous challenge and complexity, walking away is not an option.Candidates for president who think the United States can outsource Middle East security to dictators or that America no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong. It would be a serious mistake for the United States to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else.As we gather here, three evolving threats, Iran\'s continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize Israel on the world stage are converging to make the U.S.-Israel alliance more indispensable than ever.We have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation. United States and Israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.This is especially true at a time when Israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. Parents worry about letting their children walk down the street, families live in fear. Just a few weeks ago, a young American veteran and West Point graduate named Taylor Force was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist near the Jaffa Port. These attacks must end immediately and Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.Because we understand the threats Israel faces, we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts. Today, Americans and Israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations. The first choice is this, are we prepared to take the U.S.-Israel alliance to the next level? This relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe. Our work together to develop the Iron Dome saved many Israeli lives when Hamas rockets began to fly.I saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012, when I worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in Gaza and if I\'m fortunate enough to be elected president, the United States will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in Israel\'s security. And we will never allow Israel\'s adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us.When we have differences, as any friends do, we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully. We will also be clear that the United States has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful, more stable, more secure Middle East and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome. Indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace.That\'s why I believe we must take our alliance to the next level. I hope a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet Israel\'s security needs far into the future. That will also send a clear message to Israel\'s enemies that the United States and Israel stand together united. It\'s also why, as president, I will make a firm commitment to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge.The United States should provide Israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat. That includes bolstering Israeli missile defenses with new systems, like the Arrow 3 and David\'s Sling, and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.One of the first things I\'ll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House and I will send a delegation from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs to Israel forearly consultations. Let\'s also expand our collaboration beyond security. Together we can build an even more vibrant culture of innovation that tightens the links between Silicon Valley and Israeli tech companies and entrepreneurs.There is much Americans can learn from Israel from cybersecurity to energy security to water security and just on an everyday people to people level. And it\'s especially important to continue fostering relationships between American and Israeli young people who may not always remember our shared past. They are the future of our relationship and we have to do more to promote that. Many of the young people here today are on the front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as BDS.Particularly at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the world, especially in Europe, we must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine Israel and the Jewish people.I\'ve been sounding the alarm for a while now. As I wrote last year to the heads of major American-Jewish organizations, we have to be united in fighting back against BDS. Many of its proponents have demonized Israeli scientists and intellectuals, even students. To all the college students who may have encountered this on campus, I hope you stay strong, keep speaking out, don\'t let anyone silence you, bully you or try to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.Anti-Semitism has no place in any civilized society. Not in America, not in Europe, not anywhere.Now, all of this work defending Israel\'s legitimacy, expanding security and economic ties, taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep, personal commitment to Israel\'s future as a secure, democratic Jewish state and to America\'s responsibilities as a global leader. Tonight, you\'ll hear from candidates with very different visions of American leadership in the region and around the world. You\'ll get a glimpse of a potential U.S. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them.For the security of Israel and the world, we need America to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order, an America able to block efforts to isolate or attack Israel. The alternative is unthinkable.Yes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he\'s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything\'s negotiable. Well, my friends, Israel\'s security is non-negotiable.I have sat in Israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs. I\'ve listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg, an arm or even a head. That\'s why I feel so strongly that America can\'t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel\'s security or survival. We can\'t be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target theinnocent. Some things aren\'t negotiable and anyone who doesn\'t understand that has no business being our president.The second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us, especially Iran. For many years, we\'ve all been rightly focused on the existential danger of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. After all, this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate Israel.That\'s why I led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force Iran to the negotiating table and why I ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program. Today, Iran\'s enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran\'s potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating.I really believe the United States, Israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as I laid out in a speech at the Brookings Institution last year, it\'s not good enough to trust and verify. Our approach must be distrust and verify.This deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront Iran\'s aggression across the region. We cannot forget that Tehran\'s fingerprints are on every conflict across the Middle East from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the Golan from which to threaten Israel and they continue to fund Palestinian terrorists.In Lebanon, Hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in Israel. Tonight, you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about Iran, but there\'s a big difference between talking about holding Tehran accountable and actually doing it. Our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement.We must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed. If I\'m elected, the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary.Iranian provocations, like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly, including with more sanctions.Those missiles were stamped with words declaring, and I quote, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history."" We know they could reach Israel or hit the tens of thousands of American troops stationed in the Middle East. This is a serious danger and it demands a serious response.The United States must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on Iran and the Revolutionary Guard for their sponsorship of terrorism, illegal arms transfers, human rights violations and other illicit behaviors, like cyber-attacks. We should continue to demand the safe return of Robert Levinson and all American citizens unjustly held in Iranian prisons.And we must work closely with Israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from Iran to Hezbollah. If the Arab League can designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, surely it is time for our friends in Europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now.At the same time, America should always stand with those voices inside Iran calling for more openness. Now look, we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power, but the Iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard. They should know that America is not theirenemy, they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to Iran.Now, of course, Iran is not the only threat we and Israel face. The United States and Israel also have to stand together against the threat from ISIS and other radical jihadists. An ISIS affiliate in the Sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in Gaza and partners with Hamas.On Saturday, a number of Israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in Istanbul that may well be linked to ISIS. Two of the dead are U.S.-Israeli dual nationals. This is a threat that knows no borders. That\'s why I\'ve laid out a plan to take the fight to ISIS from the air, on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire. Our goal cannot be to contain ISIS; we must defeat ISIS.And here is a third choice, will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel\'s long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state.It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists, but inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated two-state agreement can provide those outcomes.If we look at the broader, regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that I presided over, but Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace.That will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust. Like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools.That poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear, I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.There is one more choice that we face together and in some ways, it may be the most important of all, will we as Americans and as Israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom, nations built on principles of equality, tolerance and pluralism.At our best, both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values. This is the real foundation of our alliance and I think it\'s why so many Americans feel such a deep emotional connection with Israel. I know that I do and it\'s why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israel\'s future, because in Israel\'s story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination.There\'s so many examples. You know, we look at the pride parade in Tel Aviv, one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance. We see the vigorous, even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home.And of course, some of us remember a woman, Golda Meir, leading Israel\'s government decades ago and wonder what\'s taking us so long here in America.But we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished. Every generation has to renew our values and yes, even fight for them. Today, Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies. Now, in a democracy, we\'re going to have differences, but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.Now, we\'ve had dark chapters in our history before, we remember the nearly 1,000 Jews aboard the St. Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe, but America should be better than this and I believe it\'s our responsibility as citizens to say so. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. If you see a bully, stand up to him.On Wednesday evening, Jews around the world will celebrate the Festival of Purim and children will learn the story of Esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil. It wasn\'t easy, she had a good life and by speaking out, she risked everything, but as Mordecai reminded her, we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what\'s right.As Elie Wiesel said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented."" So my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry. Together, let\'s defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great.Let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger. We are stronger together and if we face the future side by side, I know for both Israel and America our best days are still ahead.Thank you so much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"June 2, 2016","b'Remarks in San Diego, California'","b'Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it\'s not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it\'s their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here, thank you very much.And all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.On Monday, we observed Memorial Day  a day that means a great deal to San Diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways  by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.That\'s what I want to speak about today  the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.It\'s a choice between a fearful America that\'s less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.As Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there\'s nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I\'ve offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I\'m going to keep America\'s security at the heart of my campaign.Because as you know so well, Americans aren\'t just electing a President in November. We\'re choosing our next commander-in-chief  the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.And like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.Donald Trump\'s ideas aren\'t just different  they are dangerously incoherent. They\'re not even really ideas  just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.He is not just unprepared  he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  because it\'s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump\'s hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO  the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists  even though those are war crimes.He says he doesn\'t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has  quote \'a very good brain.\'He also said, \'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.\'You know what? I don\'t believe him.He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren\'t heroes.He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends  including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the Pope.He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are  and I quote  a\'third-world country.\'And he\'s been saying things like that for decades.Those are the words my friends of someone who doesn\'t understand America or the world.And they\'re the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak  with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching  then you don\'t know America.And you certainly don\'t deserve to lead it.That\'s why  even if I weren\'t in this race  I\'d be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President  because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.Unlike him, I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.And I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.So I\'m not new to this work. And I\'m proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.I believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country  that we\'re still, in Lincoln\'s words, the last, best hope of earth. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose, and we prevail.And if America doesn\'t lead, we leave a vacuum  and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they\'ll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety  and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.That is not an outcome we can live with.As I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.First, we need to be strong at home.That means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation  the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can\'t lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.Compare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion  that\'s trillion with a\'T\' $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.None of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home. And that would make us weaker in the world.Second, we need to stick with our allies.America\'s network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. And our allies deliver for us every day.Our armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.Take the threat posed by North Korea  perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.When I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it. And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.That\'s the power of allies.And it\'s the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.Now Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. They\'d love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength. If Donald gets his way, they\'ll be celebrating in the Kremlin. We cannot let that happen.That\'s why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO, or says he\'ll stay neutral on Israel\'s security.It\'s no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. We\'re lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?And it\'s no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea  and I quote \'If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.\'I wonder if he even realizes he\'s talking about nuclear war.Yes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene  and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.Third, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.Diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game  but it\'s worth it.Take the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.Now we must enforce that deal vigorously. And as I\'ve said many times before, our approach must be\'distrust and verify.\'The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In particular, Israel\'s security is non-negotiable. They\'re our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.But there is no question that the world and the United States, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm\'s way.Donald Trump says we shouldn\'t have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?Of course Trump doesn\'t have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn\'t know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It\'ll become very clear, very quickly.There\'s no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.But it doesn\'t work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of ""60 Minutes"" as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table  bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets  I\'m willing to bet he\'s writing a few right now.But those tools won\'t do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he\'s much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.Fourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.Countries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO\'s doorstep. Now I\'ve gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.That\'s how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It\'s how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up.The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with  not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.Donald doesn\'t see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements  I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it\'s not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.And I have to say, I don\'t understand Donald\'s bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said,\'You\'ve got to give Kim Jong Un credit\'for taking over North Korea  something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he\'d give him an \'A.\'Now, I\'ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America\'s real friends are. Because it matters. If you don\'t know exactly who you\'re dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.Fifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I\'ve laid out my plans for defeating ISIS.We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria\'s civil war and close Iraq\'s sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace.And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.That  in a nutshell  is my plan for defeating ISIS.What\'s Trump\'s? Well he won\'t say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he\'d do to stop ISIS.Just look at the few things he\'s actually said on the subject.He\'s actually said  and I quote \'maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.\'Oh, okay  let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East.Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.It\'s clear he doesn\'t have a clue what he\'s talking about. So we can\'t be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he\'s capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge.And through all his loose talk, there\'s one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS\'. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn\'t just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It\'s also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.This isn\'t reality television  this is actual reality.And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.And one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.I\'ve worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I\'ve fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump\'s hands.Sixth, we need to stay true to our values.Trump says over and over again,\'The world is laughing at us.\'He\'s been sayingthis for decades, he didn\'t just start this year.He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was  you guessed it  laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he\'s wrong now  and you\'ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.The truth is, there\'s not a country in the world that can rival us. It\'s not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It\'s also that Americans work harder, dream bigger  and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he\'ll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that\'s what honor looks like.And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.What happens to the moral example we set  for the world and for our own children  if our President engages in bigotry?And by the way, Mr. Trump  every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.Donald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.That brings me to the final point I want to make today  the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief.Every President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That\'s the job.A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years  what do you do?Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people\'s points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility  knowing you don\'t know everything  because if you\'re convinced you\'re always right, you\'ll never ask yourself the hard questions.I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President\'s advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.It was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I\'ve ever seen.Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he\'s angry, but America\'s entire arsenal.Do we want him making those calls  someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We\'re all counting on that.Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are  that we\'re fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.That\'s not the America I know and love.So yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers  and we will. But don\'t let anyone tell you that America isn\'t great. Donald Trump\'s got America all wrong. We are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.There is no challenge we can\'t meet, no goal we can\'t achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.Every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. We remember that every Memorial Day.This election is a choice between two very different visions of America.One that\'s angry, afraid, and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline.The other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great  just like we always have been.Let\'s resolve that we can be greater still. That is what I believe in my heart.I went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with? ?\'The United States of America\'emblazoned on the side. That plane  those words  our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity.I love this country and I know you do too. It\'s been an honor and a privilege toserve America and I\'m going to do everything I can to protect our nation, and make sure we don\'t lose sight of how strong we really are.Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"July 28, 2016","b'Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania'","b'Thank you all very, very much! Thank you for that amazing welcome!Thank you all for the great convention that we\'ve had.And Chelsea, thank you. I am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you\'ve become. Thank you for bringing Mark into our family and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago ... it is still going strong.You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us. And I\'ve even gotten a few words in along the way.On Tuesday night I was so happy to see that my ""explainer in chief"" is still on the job.I\'m also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week, thank you. What a remarkable week it\'s been!We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton, and the man of hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama\'s leadership. And I\'m better because of his friendship.We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden.He spoke from his big heart about our party\'s commitment to working people as only he can do.And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching. And the president we elect is going to be their president, too.And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator. And he will make our whole country proud as our vice president.And I want to thank Bernie Sanders.Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.You\'ve put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong.And to all of your supporters here and around the country, I want you to know I\'ve heard you. Your cause is our cause.Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together, now let\'s go out and make it happen together!My friends, we\'ve come to Philadelphia, the birthplace of our nation, because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story, but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king.The Revolution hung in the balance, and somehow they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That\'s what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage, they had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.Now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our Founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together.Our country\'s motto is E Pluribus Unum, out of many we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?Well, we heard Donald Trump\'s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other. He\'s betting that the perils of today\'s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He\'s taken the Republican Party a long way, from morning in America to midnight in America.He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!Now, we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge just as we always have. We will not build a wall; instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we\'ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy.We will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.Yet, we know there is a lot to do. Too many people haven\'t had a pay raise since the crash. There\'s too much inequality, too little social mobility, too much paralysis in Washington.Too many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges.We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.We have the most tolerant and generous young people we\'ve ever had.We have the most powerful military, the most innovative entrepreneurs, the most enduring values, freedom and equality, justice and opportunity, we should be so proud that those words are associated with us.I have to tell you, as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America!So don\'t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We\'re not. Don\'t let anyone tell you we don\'t have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don\'t believe anyone who says I alone can fix it.Yes, those were actually Donald Trump\'s words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn\'t he forgetting troops on the front lines, police officers and firefighters who run toward danger, doctors and nurses who care for us, teachers who change lives, entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem, mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? He\'s forgetting every last one of us.Americans don\'t say ""I alone can fix it."" We say ""we\'ll fix it together!""And remember, remember, our Founders fought a Revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.240 years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.That\'s how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.Twenty years ago I wrote a book called ""It Takes a Village."" And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that? This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That\'s why ""stronger together"" is not just a lesson from our history, it\'s not just a slogan for our campaign, it\'s a guiding principle for the country we\'ve always been and the future we\'re going to build, a country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in. A country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach, where families are strong, communities are safe and, yes, where love trumps hate.That\'s the country we\'re fighting for. That\'s the future we\'re working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America\'s promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!Now, sometimessometimesthe people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I\'m not one of those people. I\'ve been your first lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York, then I represented all of you as secretary of state.But my job titles only tell you what I\'ve done. They don\'t tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part.I get it that some people just don\'t know what to make of me.So let me tell you. The family I\'m from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind, builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had, whatever God gave them and whatever life in America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids.My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college, he played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had, and he did.My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share the entire year.The lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me. No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.So I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund, going door-to- door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school. It just didn\'t seem possible in those days. And I couldn\'t stop thinking of my mother and what she\'d gone through as a child.It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.So we gathered facts, we built a coalition and our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It\'s a big idea, isn\'t it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.But how? How do you make an idea like that real? You do it step by step, year by year, sometimes even door by door. My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage.Because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it\'s true. I sweat the details of policy, whether we\'re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs.Because it\'s not just a detail if it\'s your kid, if it\'s your family. It\'s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to you president, too.After the four days of this convention, you\'ve seen some of the people who have inspired me, people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine, people like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.I first met Ryan as a 7-year old. He was wearing a full-body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero.I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.And in this campaign, I\'ve met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.And you heard from Republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don\'t. For all Americans together!Tonight we\'ve reached a milestone in our nation\'s march toward a more perfect union. The first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president!Standing here as my mother\'s daughter and my daughter\'s mother, I\'m so happy this day has come. I\'m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I\'m happy for boys and men. Because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky\'s the limit!So let\'s keep going. Let\'s keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have!But even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead.Let\'s begin with what we\'re going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.Now, I don\'t think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private sector jobs, 20 million more Americans with health insurance, and an auto industry that just had its best year ever.Now, that\'s real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo, not by a long shot. We\'re still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.I\'ve gone around the country talking to working families and I\'ve heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn\'t working for them. Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You\'re right. It\'s not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work and work hard, but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them, period.Democrats, we are the party of working people.But we haven\'t done a good enough job showing we get what you\'re going through, and we\'re going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives.My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind, from our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian country to coal country, from communities ravaged by addiction, to regions hollowed out by plant closures.And here\'s what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe our economy isn\'t working the way it should because our democracy isn\'t working the way it should.That\'s why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are, but too many aren\'t. It\'s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.And I believe in science!I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying, clean-energy jobs.I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together. And it\'s the right thing to do.So whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.If you believe that companies should share profits, not pad executive bonuses, join us!If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us!If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us!If you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home-grown manufacturers, then join us!If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman\'s right to make her own health care decisions, then join us!And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us!That\'s how we\'re going to make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.Now, you didn\'t hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention? He spoke for 70-odd minutesand I do mean oddand he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn\'t believe these things. No wonder he doesn\'t like talking about his plans. You might have noticed I love talking about mine.In my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we\'ll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all.We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.It\'s just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts and students and families can\'t refinance their debts.And something we don\'t say often enough, sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.We will give small businesses, like my dad\'s, a boost, make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it you should be able to build it.And we will help you balance family and work. And you know what? If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in!Now, here\'s the other thing.Now, we\'re not only going to make all of these investments, we\'re going to pay for every single one of them. And here\'s how: Wall Street, corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.This is not because we resent success. But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that\'s where the money is. And we are going to follow the money.And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we\'ll make them pay us back and we\'ll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home.Now, I imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good, but how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?Well, look at my record. I\'ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that\'s exactly what I\'ll do as president.But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he\'s a businessman, he must know something about the economy.Well, let\'s take a closer look, shall we? In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.Now, remember what the president said last night: Don\'t boo; vote!But think of this. People who did the work and needed the money, not because he couldn\'t pay them, but because he wouldn\'t pay them. He just stiffed them. And you know that sales pitch he\'s making to be president, put your faith in him and you\'ll win big? That\'s the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bag.He also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of ""America first"" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado, Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan, Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio, Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin?Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.You know, anyoneanyonereading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face, from Baghdad to Kabul to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando. We\'re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.So it\'s no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance, looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home.Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I\'m proud that we\'ve put a lid on Iran\'s nuclear program without firing a single shot.Now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel\'s security.I\'m proud that we shaped a global climate agreement. Now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.And I\'m proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.I\'ve laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.It won\'t be easy or quick, but make no mistake we will prevail.Now, Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" No, Donald, you don\'t.He thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster.Well, I\'ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country...including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.So just ask yourself, do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can\'t even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation, when he\'s gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he\'s challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons!I can\'t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men, the ones moved by fear and pride.America\'s strength doesn\'t come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power. And that\'s the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.And if we\'re serious about keeping our country safe, we also can\'t afford to have a president who\'s in the pocket of the gun lobby.I\'m not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I\'m not here to take away your guns. I just don\'t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn\'t have a gun in the first place.We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.You know, for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you, how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw family members of people killed by gun violence, on this stage. You heard, you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.I refuse to believe we can\'t find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country, not just on guns, but on race, immigration and more.And that starts with listening, listening to each other, trying as best we can to walk in each other\'s shoes. So let\'s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable!Let\'s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses good-bye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.And we will defend all our rights, civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women\'s rights and workers\' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities.And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump\'s comments, excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.They thought he couldn\'t possibly mean all the horrible things he says. Like when he called women pigs, or said that an American judge couldn\'t be fair because of his Mexican heritage, or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war, like John McCain, a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect.Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn\'t he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things, could be like that. But here\'s the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump, this is it.And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn\'t get: America is great because America is good!So enough with the bigotry and the bombast. Donald Trump\'s not offering real change, he\'s offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, to get your kids the opportunities they deserve.The choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we\'ll ever pull together. But I\'m here to tell you tonight progress is possible. I know because I\'ve seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.And I know it from my own life. More than a few times I\'ve had to pick myself up and get back in the game.Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother, too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door, go back out there, she said. And she was right.You have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right no matter what. That\'s what we need to do together as a nation.And though we may not live to see the glory, as the song from the musical ""Hamilton"" goes, let us gladly join the fight, let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. That\'s why we\'re here, not just in this hall, but on this earth. The Founders showed us that and so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America\'s destiny is ours to choose. So let\'s be stronger together, my fellow Americans!Let\'s look to the future with courage and confidence. Let\'s build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever!Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 15, 2016","b'Remarks to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C.'","b'""Hello! Hello, CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate, engage, vote. And I can\'t think of better marching orders for the next 54 days. [Cheers.] And anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.I want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders. Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows. It really was like seeing the future of America in one room. I can\'t wait to see everything that they achieve. And I can\'t wait, if I\'m fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work! And I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community  when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington. And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we\'re at right now  not just for Latinos but for our country.My friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters. You\'ve stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters. By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.Now, here\'s a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn\'t be, right? But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama. He\'s always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.I, for one, don\'t think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression. Think of what we\'ve achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage  and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.Now, that doesn\'t mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch. Our work is far from finished. But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it\'s big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn\'t mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it\'s easy to get discouraged. But we\'re here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America\'s future.Either we\'re going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.Either we\'re going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.Either we\'re going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we\'re going to be stronger together.Today, as you know, we\'re in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Julin and Joaqun Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others  names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.Whether you\'re Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you\'re not strangers. You\'re not intruders. You\'re our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again  time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.As I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That\'s been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I\'ll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.First, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There\'s something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country\'s population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We\'ve got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we\'re going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy. And we\'re going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we\'re going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn\'t a luxury, it\'s a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong.And that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn\'t the first time you\'ve heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I\'ve been called a lot of things; I\'ve never been called a quitter. And in this election  in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn\'t just the smart thing to do, it\'s what the American people demand. And you know how we\'ll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January. [Cheers.] But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump. And while we\'re fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we\'re going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn\'t actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I\'ve said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President\'s authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there\'s more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won\'t stop there. We\'re going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.So here\'s the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it\'s always been  a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.Now, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn\'t be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn\'t be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.Right now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They\'re DREAMers in much more than name. I\'ve met so many. I\'ve listened to their stories. They\'ve done everything we\'ve asked of them and made our country stronger in return.So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.I picture Astrid Silva  who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she\'s in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.I picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.He was, his teacher wrote, \'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.\' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he\'d always wanted.All these years later  his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know  he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.We teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they\'ve heard from my opponent  from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.And every time we think he\'s hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess.How insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess  she\'s a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, \'Where was President Obama born?\' And he still wouldn\'t still say \'Hawaii.\' He still wouldn\'t say \'America.\' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?Now, he\'s tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildrenParents and teachers are already worried about what they\'re calling the \'Trump Effect.\' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.At a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of \'Build the wall\' and \'Speak English.\'Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid  afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There\'s no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It\'s all right out there in the open now. So we\'ve got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.Just this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He\'s proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a \'potluck\' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his \'Love Trumps Hate\' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: \'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.\' And good for you, Francisco.That\'s what we have to do in this election, and that\'s what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.Together, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.We\'ve set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can\'t do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.So we\'re going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community  everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.So let\'s stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls.And yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 15, 2016",b'Remarks at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro',"b'""Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It\'s great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family\'s support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, BarbaraI have to say it\'s great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I\'m not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn\'t really encourage reflection, and it\'s important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.People like me  we\'re lucky. When I\'m under the weather  now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I\'m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can\'t. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don\'t they?Lots of Americans still don\'t even have insurance, or they do but it\'s too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.Lots of working parents can\'t afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there\'s no backup. They\'re on their own, aren\'t they?That\'s the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you\'re on your own. If you lose your job or can\'t afford college, you\'re on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don\'t know what to do, you\'re on your own.Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor\'s edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.That right there, that\'s why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who\'s been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I\'m running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.I\'m running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what\'s happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can\'t afford it  not here, not anywhere else in America. I\'m running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, \'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!\' Wouldn\'t you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we\'ve stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she\'ll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I\'ll keep working to get there, but she\'d better be there too.I\'m running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I\'m running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children\'s Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn\'t get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I\'ve known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.So when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can\'t drink the water at home or in school because it\'s poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.That\'s why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country\'s troops taunted ours  not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts  he\'d responded  he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.I\'ve been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I\'ve built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I\'m better at the \'service\' part than the \'public\' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I\'m in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that\'s what this race has always been about for me.Well, now we\'re in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let\'s make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do  make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can\'t be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.So in these final days, let\'s try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn\'t often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let\'s talk about what really matters.And here\'s my promise to you. I\'m going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor  focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.Next week, I\'ll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone\'s contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I\'ll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I\'m going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas  yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer\'s to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you\'re running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you\'re going to get it done, and how you\'re going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.Now, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we\'re talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It\'s not a detail if it\'s your kid. It\'s not a detail if it\'s your family. It\'s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president. Now, I confess, I\'ll never be the showman my opponent is, and that\'s okay with me. Just look at  look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I\'ll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I\'ll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I\'m actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.We don\'t need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don\'t need a president who wants to take away people\'s health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don\'t need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don\'t need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids. That is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn\'t between Democrat or Republican. It\'s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It\'s also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build? Now, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we\'re weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can\'t drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There\'s nothing we can\'t do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.And the American dream  the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe  if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text \'join,\' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can\'t do this without you.And remember, the presidential race isn\'t the only one this fall. We\'ve got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let\'s come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America\'s future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose.We have so many blessings. Now it\'s our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let\'s make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 16, 2016","b""Remarks to the Black Women's Agenda Symposium in Washington, D.C.""","b'""Hello, B-W-A. I thank you all for that warm welcome. There\'s nowhere I\'d rather be than right here with all of you this morning.Please everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I\'ve been privileged to do.I want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it\'s always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting. I want to congratulate today\'s honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.And I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, \'Well, you are coming, aren\'t you?\' And I said, \'I\'m working hard to get it set.\' And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.I also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women\'s Agenda, I\'m thrilled to be with you. I\'m thrilled to be associated with you. I\'m also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women\'s health.Looking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor\'s orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.And you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen\'s beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real. Now, I\'ve been blessed to see this magic\'s influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children\'s Defense Fund. Marian\'s belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn\'t afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn\'t have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart.But Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren\'t in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn\'t because schools weren\'t accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that.We gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I\'m here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I\'m here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge  three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days.It goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It\'s past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let\'s be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We\'ve come far together. And as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I\'m going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children\'s Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against. And together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.We\'re going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.We\'ll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we\'ll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.We are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!We\'ll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we\'re going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.We are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn\'s \'10-20-30\' plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.We\'ll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe. We\'ll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child\'s life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner. We\'ll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity. And we\'re going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We\'ll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected  civil rights and women\'s rights, LGBT rights, worker\'s rights and, of course, voting rights.We are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn\'t it? That\'s because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance. On one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he\'s tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, \'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\' And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history.Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald\'s advisors had the temerity to say, \'He\'s doing the country a \'service\' by pushing these lies.\' No, he isn\'t. He\'s feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country.Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no \'new\' Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn\'t see him as an American. Think of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go  no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn\'t look like him, and doesn\'t agree with him, and thinks, \'That person must not be a real American.\'Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can\'t just accept this.We\'ve got to stand up to it. If we don\'t, it won\'t stop. In addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it\'s time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.That\'s why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, \'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn\'t between a Democrat or Republican.\' It\'s about who will have the power to shape our children\'s lives for the next four years. It\'s also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations. We are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation\'s promise, contribute to its progress. \'Stronger Together\' is not just our campaign slogan. It\'s the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build? Now in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story. Keep up the great work with your Four for 4\' campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, \'I just -- I don\'t know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.\'Well, here\'s what we can do. Let\'s reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.With our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.Thank you very much. Thank you.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 18, 2016","b'Remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C.'","b'""Hello. It\'s so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don\'t think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he\'s done on behalf of our country and the world. And it\'s not just the President he\'s been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, \'When others go low, we go high.\' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you\'re a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps  Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund all those years ago. And I\'m going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.We have so much work to do together. I\'ve heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she\'d been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let\'s prove her right.As a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what\'s at stake in this election. It\'s not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down towho will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.We need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can\'t let Barack Obama\'s legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn\'t understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn\'s 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.When you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it\'s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It\'s also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I\'m not taking your vote or anyone\'s vote for granted. I\'m working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you\'re doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let\'s send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 19, 2016","b'Remarks at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania'","b'""Thank you. Thank you, Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you. I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and  I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.Before I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.I\'m here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future  the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America. I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley. A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia. She loves Temple and we love her. And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction.Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future. Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we\'ve ever seen. And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus  so she started one. And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.Now, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical  especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing\'s ever going to change. But you\'re here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change  but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.You\'re here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You\'re also here because you know this election isn\'t a reality TV show. It shouldn\'t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it\'s wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It\'s wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it\'s wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe.It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?I know what I believe, and I\'m going to close my campaign the same way I started my career  fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you\'ll join me. We can\'t get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors  getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn\'t matter, you forget what\'s really important to your future and to the future of this country.Take the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you\'re willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that\'s been out of reach for too many young people  trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That\'s why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.Next, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you\'re never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.And here\'s something we don\'t talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we\'re offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board  for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today\'s economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.That\'s why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe  the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.Everywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren\'t  and you shouldn\'t be  satisfied with the progress we\'ve made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we\'ve never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America\'s best days are ahead of us. In large part, that\'s because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.I\'m inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she\'s in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this.I\'m inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who\'ve done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York  and I can recommend, it\'s delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.I\'m inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I\'ve ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It\'s been painful for her  a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful  but Erica won\'t give up. As she said, \'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it\'s hard, so I\'m going to walk away? That\'s not the type of world I want to live in.\'That\'s the spirit that makes this country great  we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that\'s the spirit we need in this election too.Now, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you\'re totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.When it comes to public service, the \'service\' part has always easier for me than the \'public\' part. I will never be the showman my opponent is  and you know what, that\'s okay with me. And it\'s also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that\'s because it\'s not a detail for you. It\'s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.So here\'s what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can\'t promise you\'ll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We\'re not keeping it a secret. We\'ve got a book called \'Stronger Together.\'But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.The first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here\'s what she said, one word: \'kindness.\' She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.That mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there\'s always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children\'s Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer  we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I\'d learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, \'Could I work for you this summer?\' She said, \'Sure, but I can\'t pay you.\' I said, \'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.\' She said, \'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.\' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.After graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children\'s Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn\'t seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn\'t force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn\'t about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today. The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn\'t run for anything since student council. I\'d always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, \'Dare to compete.\' Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, \'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.\' Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?Well, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don\'t enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I\'m running now, to even the odds for those who\'ve got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I\'ve learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.Now, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he\'s still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.And when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It\'s going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That\'s why, if I\'m in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.So if you believe diversity is America\'s strength, not America\'s burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.And here\'s how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends. Register everyone you know. This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines. Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump\'s hands. It really does. Text \'join,\' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. I understand here at Temple you\'re already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it. We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election  that\'s just the first step  then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we\'re going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are. So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.You know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I\'ve learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate. So please join us in working together. There\'s no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they\'re from, what they look like, or who they love. That\'s the America we believe in. That\'s the America worth fighting for. That\'s what we\'ve got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let\'s make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 21, 2016","b'Remarks at the Frontline Outreach Center in Orlando, Florida'","b'""Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone  especially Val Demings. Where\'s Val? Val  I know  got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.I want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn\'t she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, \'My twin sister can\'t speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she\'s very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.\' I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl  her confidence and how much she loved her sister.So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I\'m very excited that she\'s here with us today.I also want to thank Orlando. It\'s great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You\'ve been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you\'ve responded with grace. You\'ve shown the world what Orlando is made of  strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now.I\'m here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I\'m sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.There is still much we don\'t know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It\'s unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott\'s death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I\'ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.I\'ve also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country\'s concerned, their lives seem disposable. We\'ve got to do better. And I know we can. And if I\'m elected president, we will  and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.Look, I know I don\'t have all the answers. I don\'t know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn\'t have.Sybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, \'This is about saving our children.\' And she\'s absolutely right. We need to come together, work together  white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us  to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.Now, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that\'s why we\'re here today. Because in just 48 days  can you believe it, 48 days  Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it\'s our job to make sure it\'s there for you and future generations.Building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I\'m a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us  our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth  when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.Now, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women\'s labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn\'t as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it\'s not fair to them  and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.That\'s one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It\'s one reason why I\'m such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that.It\'s also one reason why we\'ve got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That\'s part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it\'s why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we\'ve got to help older Americans who\'ve displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy. And too often, training and retraining doesn\'t work as it should. If you don\'t have a four-year degree, if you haven\'t really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it\'s hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you\'re trying to start your career or you\'ve spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.Now, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I\'m going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we\'ve actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we\'re asking you to support us, we should tell you what we\'re going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn\'t gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that\'s been true for a long time, and we have to change it.I\'m talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We\'ve got to face that and do better for everyone\'s sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency. I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don\'t know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are.Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\'re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They\'re veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They\'re working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they\'re doing phenomenal work. I\'m grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.Now, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability  if you couldn\'t see, couldn\'t walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue  that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn\'t and never would. And that was that.I saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children\'s Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren\'t in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there\'d be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren\'t they in school?I went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren\'t trained to help her. So she didn\'t get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn\'t going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren\'t rich. They weren\'t powerful. So what could they do about it?That little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn\'t face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood  abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn\'t want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children\'s Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.So we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I\'m proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.As Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I\'ve spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He\'s had so many surgeries, we\'ve lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and  for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he\'s a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he\'s just one of the most optimistic people you\'ll ever meet.Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.I\'ll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, \'family values.\' \'Since my accident,\' he said, \'I\'ve found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we\'re all family and we all have value.\' I couldn\'t agree more.We\'ve come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can\'t be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren\'t in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We\'ve got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect. Now, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, \'We don\'t want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.\' As president, I\'m going to give  give them that chance. First, we\'re going to focus on jobs and incomes. I\'m going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn\'t be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we\'re going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.Second, we\'re going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let\'s raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let\'s make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It\'s like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let\'s make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.Third, we\'re going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we\'ll launch a new effort we\'re calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.Fourth, let\'s build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it\'s a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.Now, these ideas are just a start. We\'re working with advocates to come up with even more. If you\'ve got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart.I\'ve always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It\'s how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.Now, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It\'s a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I\'ve carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald\'s. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then  then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she\'d bring her family there on off days just to hang out. Earlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn\'t it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia\'s former managers asked for everyone\'s attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, \'We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.\'My friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn\'t that what we all want to hear? Isn\'t that America at our best? We don\'t thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one\'s worthless, no one\'s \'less than.\' We\'re all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate.Thank you all.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 27, 2016","b'Remarks at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, North Carolina'","b'""Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That\'s the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.Audience Member: We\'re proud of you!Clinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her  I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she\'s taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.Now, I have to thank  I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment\'s about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there\'s nothing we can\'t do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that\'s what I intend to do.Now, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I\'ll tell you somebody else I\'m really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched  I have watched the campaign she\'s run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I\'ll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband\'s and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That\'s former Governor Jim Hunt.Now, there\'s a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. \'I Will Vote.\' Now, that\'s not only a great sign that shows you\'re committed to vote, but it\'s a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you\'ll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that\'s at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it\'s hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you\'re not really wanted. You\'re not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that\'s been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that\'s what it\'s about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That\'s the way we\'re supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I\'ll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote. I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we\'ve ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We\'re seeing spikes in early voting. And we\'re seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.Now, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it\'s more about the future of young people and children than it\'s ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.Now, last night I got a chance  I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I\'m so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I\'m asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children\'s Defense Fund. It\'s always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.And during this campaign, people have asked me, \'Well, how did you get interested in that?\'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn\'t want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother\'s own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I\'m well aware that\'s not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I\'ve been talking about it because I think we\'ve got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they\'d sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, \'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?\' And it wasn\'t until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn\'t have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn\'t well taken care of meant that she stepped in.And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents\' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, \'If you get up early  it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.\' And that\'s what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.So when I talk about us being stronger together, I\'m not just talking about what our government needs to do, I\'m talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure  we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we\'ve got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we\'ve got to do more to help small businesses because that\'s where most of the new jobs will come from.As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just  it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he\'d spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens  if you\'ve ever seen one  and he\'d start at one end and he\'d put it down, he\'d pour the paint in, and he\'d take the squeegee and he\'d lift it up and he\'d go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he\'d start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because  when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I\'ve talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I\'ll be at a caf or sometimes I\'ll be in a store and I\'ll just start talking to them, and they will tell me  it\'s one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you\'re open to it, folks will tell you what\'s on their minds and their hearts.So I\'ve met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and  and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\'s work because  number one, it\'s fair. It\'s fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don\'t you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.Now, that\'s the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we\'ve seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people  dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers  across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It\'s heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I\'m really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.And in addition to making the economy fair, we\'ve got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It\'s really hard out there, isn\'t it? And just listening to Christine\'s story  getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job  that\'s not an uncommon story. We\'ve made it really hard for a lot of people.So here\'s what I think we need to do, and it\'s not a luxury, it\'s a necessity  because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I\'ve heard so many stories. They\'ve told me  people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they\'re under. So let\'s finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let\'s have paid family leave so that when you\'re sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let\'s have earned sick days so that you don\'t lose your job because you\'re sick or you go to work because you\'re sick. And let\'s finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don\'t think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we\'re going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let\'s make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want  I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we\'re also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.Now, how are we going to do that? Well, we\'re going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We\'re going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We\'re going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we\'re going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you\'re going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we\'re going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again  not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn\'t worked out so well. We\'ve got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let\'s be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.So I\'m excited about what we can do. I really am. And I\'m going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of  all of Donald Trump\'s claims. There were  there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here\'s a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there\'s a strong probability he hasn\'t paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn\'t paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won\'t release his tax returns  and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he\'s paid zero  he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn\'t come from millionaire families. My husband\'s father  his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you\'ll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we\'ve been given, we should do our part.The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don\'t think I\'d make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, \'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.\' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.And he made it very clear that he didn\'t prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, \'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I\'ll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that\'s good.\'So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I\'ve done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I\'ve laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I\'ve laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It\'s unclear exactly what he is saying.But words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, ""Hey, we\'re not sure we\'re going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty."" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America\'s word, America\'s intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, \'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.\' This is not reality TV. This is real. It\'s as real as it gets. so we\'re going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We\'re going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There\'s still a lot we don\'t know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We\'ve got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected. And we\'ve got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.So there\'s work to do. But it\'s great work. It\'s important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election\'s going to be close. They all are these days. That\'s why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text \'join,\' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there\'s a big overflow room, and I\'m told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming.So remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it\'s not just the presidential race. It\'s the governor\'s race, the lieutenant governor\'s race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We\'re not fearful. We don\'t want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don\'t want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country.I\'ve got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That\'s what I\'m offering. We\'re going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we\'re going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it\'s either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us.That is exactly right. I love this country. I\'m proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 28, 2016",b'Remarks at the University of New Hampshire in Durham',"b'""Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get [cheers] the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.Bernie\'s campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.I\'m proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.Now, we\'re going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.Isn\'t this one of the strangest elections you\'ve ever seen? I  I really sometimes don\'t know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I\'m fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we\'re not only electing a president, we\'re electing a commander-in-chief. We\'re looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.I was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former  former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it\'s a great honor. He\'s never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I\'m also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are. The next  the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I\'m going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That\'s been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it\'s not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it\'s on the ballot, too. It\'s whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, \'I believe in science.\' Climate change is real. It\'s serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I\'d hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman\'s right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.So there\'s a lot at stake. And that\'s why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that\'s why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.And one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man  he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn\'t so much that it endangered me or my family\'s financial future.And then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, \'Well, I can\'t help you. That  we\'re done. We can\'t help you.\' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That\'s why I could go to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.It\'s absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.Now, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn\'t be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.Indeed, here in New Hampshire, we\'ve got so many young people graduating with debt who aren\'t able to get started in their careers, aren\'t able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.And if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you\'re being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don\'t know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It\'s wrong for students, it\'s wrong for families, and it\'s wrong for our country.I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It\'s the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can\'t get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we\'re going to put a moratorium, so you don\'t have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.We are also  we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I\'ll give a speech about why that is so important.Now, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you\'re in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.Now, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, \'I have student debt,\' you can say, \'I am planning for college,\' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don\'t want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt.I met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, \'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.\' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don\'t know what it means? Well, we\'re going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they\'re getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don\'t make the wrong decisions for themselves.So, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you\'re in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don\'t turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, \'I will vote.\' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you\'re registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you\'re registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration.So both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I\'m going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you\'ve had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he\'ll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.So we\'re going to move now to the panel, and I\'m very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I\'m excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have  specific help for certain groups of students.I\'ll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I\'d go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, \'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor\'s bills?\'And I realized that we\'ve got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We\'ve got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.And we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we\'ve helped thousands of people, so they didn\'t have to drop out. They didn\'t have to cut back. That\'s what I want for our country again, where we\'re helping each other, where we\'re reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it. So please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 29, 2016","b'Remarks at Cowles Commons in Des Moines, Iowa'","b'""Thank you! Thank you all so much. Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you. And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle\'s sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.Now, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is  is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don\'t know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she\'s had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it\'s important to have that perspective. So it\'s a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she\'s going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts. I want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where\'s Patty? Patty\'s out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.Now, while we\'re meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I\'m so fortunate enough as to be president, we\'re going to have a big infrastructure program, and we\'re going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids. Now, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That\'s very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it\'s a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.Now, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that\'s going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.Now, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we\'ve got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don\'t have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We\'ve got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.Any of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it\'s been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.Now, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I\'d go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn\'t have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It\'s what he could afford.And there were two long tables. And he\'d roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there\'s a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he\'d put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he\'d take a squeegee and he\'d go across it. And then he\'d lift it up, and he\'d go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he\'d do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he\'d go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.That\'s how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn\'t have survived all that.All that work, and then to be told we\'re not going to pay you, or maybe we\'ll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That\'s just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We\'ve been looking into the records, and there\'s a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don\'t believe that\'s the way we\'re supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country. Now, my mom had a very different story. My dad\'s father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn\'t want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift.And then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, \'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you\'ll have to come right back.\' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that\'s exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run  run  to get there. But she didn\'t care because she wanted to get an education.So when I learned more about my mom\'s life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who\'ve been left out or left behind in some way. That\'s why I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.So that\'s been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy  because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides.But when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents  and sometimes even great-grandparents  made. If we\'re going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I\'ve seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you\'ve done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn\'t a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it\'s been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs  it\'s nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I\'m excited by that.I\'m running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it\'s real. I believe in science. But I\'ll tell you what else is real. What\'s real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we\'re going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn\'t be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We\'re going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we\'re going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I\'m going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses. But while we\'re growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let\'s raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I\'ve met  you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women  and I\'ve met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women\'s work.And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I\'ll tell you, Mark Cuban\'s a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let\'s tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we\'re going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don\'t have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out.The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that\'s a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I\'m counting on you to know what it\'s like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?That\'s a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I\'ve got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it\'s not just for babies. It\'s for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.The other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.Now, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we\'re going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We\'re going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I\'ll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.And college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we\'re going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you\'re told, \'you\'re fired,\' but the kind where you\'re told, \'you\'re hired.\' We\'re going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.So I\'m excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it\'s not about that. It\'s about you. It\'s about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I\'m asking for your vote. I should tell you what I\'m going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It\'s called, not surprisingly, \'Stronger Together.\' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we\'re trying to do, and where we\'re going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we\'re going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.Now, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it\'s probably true, he hasn\'t paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart.Well, I\'ll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we\'ve been blessed, and we\'re grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that  that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I\'ll tell you, that\'s a person who should never be president because they don\'t understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.So look, I think after  Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we\'ll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he\'s going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.But we can\'t do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We\'re Americans; that\'s in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That\'s the way we\'re going to get things done together.And so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we\'re going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text \'Join,\' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.

And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote. And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we\'re having. Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we\'ll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate.Thank you all very much.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 30, 2016","b'Remarks at Coral Springs Gymnasium in Coral Springs, Florida'","b'""Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much. And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs, in Broward County, in the great state of Florida! And I know there\'s a big overflow crowd in the next building over. I think they can see and hear us, but I wanted to thank them for being part of today\'s event.And I\'ve got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me. He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm. And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise. We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.Well, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don\'t you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember  I\'m so pleased he\'s here with us  Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district  is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.Before I get started and really talk about everything that\'s at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn\'t let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose\'s life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I\'m sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that\'s a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob\'s family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.Now, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I\'ve never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don\'t even recognize the country he\'s talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.This morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can\'t ever forget that.I have laid out specific plans about how we\'re going to make our country even greater. I\'ve actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I\'m asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I\'m going to do. I shouldn\'t just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we\'re going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. That means new jobs  new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.My opponent\'s only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn\'t even raise it. He\'s been going around telling people for months, \'We\'re going to build a wall and we\'re going to make Mexico pay for it.\' So he\'s sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn\'t even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o\'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I\'ll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.So I\'m going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I\'ll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I\'m really proud of that. And I\'m sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn\'t pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing  here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.So as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you\'ve made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. Something else we\'re going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women\'s issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it\'s your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes.And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure  to make sure  more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He\'s always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn\'t pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we\'re stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn\'t it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college. Now, after the primary was over  and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it\'s way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it\'s pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.But I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you\'re willing to do public service, national service, we\'re going to forgive your debt over time. But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain  I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs  not the kind that lead to being told, \'You\'re fired,\' the kind that lead to being told, \'You\'re hired.\' Now, I\'m excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That\'s not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.And while we\'re doing that, we\'re going to make sure that our country\'s safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn\'t know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He\'s kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn\'t care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn\'t care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That\'s the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.As I told him in the debate  he actually said, \'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.\' Words matter. And America\'s word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we\'ve got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together. Climate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it\'s a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country\'s going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it\'s going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let\'s deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let\'s produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There\'s so much we can do together. And that means we\'ve got to work with other countries and we\'ve got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they\'re in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.And then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I\'ve got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that\'s fine. That\'s who we are. I don\'t know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I\'ve known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn\'t always agree with them either, including my husband. But I\'ll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country\'s interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...""Audience Member: ""Day one.""Clinton: ""...is to make them day one  you\'re right  is to make sure everybody in the country knows I\'m the president of every American, every single per-son.Now  so in order for me to do any of this, anything that\'s in this book and making sure that it\'s paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you\'ve moved, you may need to reregister. Here\'s how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you\'re registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will  they have  they have clipboards. We\'re kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they\'re registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.So make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I\'m asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.And, like I say, I\'m not just excited about winning an election. I\'m excited about doing the work. I\'m excited about listening to Americans. I\'ll continue to travel our country. I\'ll be here in Florida so much you\'ll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That\'s kind of hard to believe. So there\'s a lot we\'re going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that\'s what gets me excited.So here\'s what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, \'Where were you this afternoon?\' you say, \'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.\' If they say, \'Oh, that\'s great,"" get them registered. If they say, \'Oh, my gosh. How can you do that?\' if they\'re seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don\'t let friends vote for Trump. And what we believe and what we\'re going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"September 30, 2016","b'Remarks at Sunrise Theatre in Fort Pierce, Florida'","b'""Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what  what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn\'t it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.We\'ve got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?Now, as I said it the other night  how many of you saw the debate?Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about  well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it  not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great  but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.My opponent believes in what I call a \'strongman approach.\' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don\'t see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here\'s what he said. He said, \'I alone can fix it.\' I alone?Well, we have learned that that\'s his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That\'s why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that\'s not how change happens in America. It\'s never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful  all of us.We see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.How many of you  just think back over your lives  how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It\'s one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don\'t just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don\'t get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.People are starting to call out their services!There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what\'s so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it\'s something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.We\'ve got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I\'ll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They\'re building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I\'ll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here\'s how it starts: \'I will get things done for America.\' Isn\'t that great? I think we should make that a national slogan.Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they\'re working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They\'re tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs  all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I\'m really grateful to them.We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn\'t it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It\'s not just how we feel, they\'ve actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It\'s a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.It\'s easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that\'s understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren\'t many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that\'s one of the reasons I think it\'s so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy\'s call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.\' But sometimes it\'s hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that\'s not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute.So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn\'t just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We\'re not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We\'re exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, \'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?\' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I\'m elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here\'s what I plan to do.First, let\'s triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It\'s finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we\'re going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can\'t afford it. So let\'s lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let\'s keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.Now second, let\'s grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it\'s given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it\'s fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We\'ve got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let\'s make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.Third, let\'s expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let\'s be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I\'ve talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn\'t just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn\'t give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.Now I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn\'t something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let\'s give people an encore opportunity after they\'ve ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves  right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let\'s do something like that in the civilian space. Let\'s call it the National Service Reserve.And here\'s the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you\'ll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won\'t have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who\'ve said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can\'t leave their jobs, understandably. We\'ll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There\'s so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let\'s bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.Now, I don\'t think you\'ll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that\'s a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps  but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what\'s being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don\'t usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, \'Well hey, my gosh, you\'ve only got 39 days to go. Why aren\'t you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I\'ll do that, but  I\'ve been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I\'m trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart  and this is one of them.Thank you!For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: \'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.\' Now, I\'ve carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it\'s an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what\'s kept me going are the people that I\'ve met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can\'t think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.That\'s why \'Stronger Together\' is more than just a slogan. It\'s a course of action. So here\'s what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together  to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.There are so many examples in this community and communities across America  39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I\'ll tell you what side I\'m going to be on, and with your help, we\'re going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.Thank you and God bless you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 2, 2016","b'Remarks at Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte, North Carolina'","b'""This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!I am so [...] and so honored to be here. Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker. Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion. I have to confess  we were putting together the [...] Rev. Walker was [...]But he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...]I am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction. And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.This church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...]. It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.It has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don\'t yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, \'We do what each of us can do.\' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.It\'s been a hard year, hasn\'t it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You\'ve seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, \'I wake up every morning scared that I won\'t get to grow up because I am black.\'A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who\'s here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, \'We are black people and we shouldn\'t have to feel like this. It\'s a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can\'t even see them anymore. It\'s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.\' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.But can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she\'s talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what\'s going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children\'s eyes. I\'m a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn\'t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let\'s be honest here  they won\'t face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.You know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We\'ve got to take action, we\'ve got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can\'t solve all these problems over night, which means we don\'t have a moment to lose.Proverbs tells us, \'Where there is no vision, the people perish.\' So let\'s hold on to a common vision. Let\'s come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they\'re born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. \'In uniform,\' he wrote, \'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don\'t let hate infect your heart.\' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, \'I got you.\'Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can\'t do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We\'ve got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn\'s plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people\'s fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more \'law and order.\' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn\'t exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I\'ve been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children\'s Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it\'s not just personal to so many of us, it\'s about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?I love your dress.You know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It\'s not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other\'s children, each other\'s dignity, each other\'s opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You\'ve been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God\'s children is America\'s calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: \'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.\' We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God\'s people. Thank you.""'"

And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James. Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king. I\'m obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability. But I\'ll tell you what really moved me the most is he\'s given back to his hometown. He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities. He\'s spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform. He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice. So I am truly honored to have his support, and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball, but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways.Now, we do have an important election coming up. Who here is planning to vote? Well, that is very good news because this is the most consequential election, I think, in our lifetimes. The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up. And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote? Everybody here registered? Well, I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th. That\'s just a little over a week away. And if you\'re not sure whether or not someone you know is registered, or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive, you can go to iwillvote.com  see that sign over there? You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to.So let\'s get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left. Thirty-six days, now, we are reaching out. We\'re making phone calls. We\'re knocking on doors. If you want to get involved, you can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days. You can text \'join,\' j-o-i-n, at 47246, and get involved, because we are running to win Ohio in this election.And everybody, everybody in the campaign, is crisscrossing Ohio. My daughter\'s been here a bunch. Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here. My husband\'s coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio. And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state. Now, I\'m going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream. See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody. If you\'re willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. Now, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences. And that\'s okay. People have different families, different views of the world. But here\'s what I have noticed. I have noticed that he always puts himself first. And maybe that\'s because he was born into a millionaire family. He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father. His father bailed him out; apparently that\'s a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him. And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.And along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people  small businesses and workers and contractors. And that\'s part of the reason I take this election so seriously. My dad was a small businessman. My grandfather was a factory worker. And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business. He started a printing business. He printed fabrics for draperies. And he worked really hard. He had a print plant in Chicago  no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them. And then if you\'ve ever seen silkscreens, that\'s what he did. You take the silkscreen. You put it down. You pour the paint in. You take the squeegee. You go across. You lift it up. You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table. And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing. It was before there was machines. My dad couldn\'t have afforded that anyway. But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed. I have met people. I\'m talking painters and plumbers. I\'m talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos. He wouldn\'t pay them. Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.And so I met one of the men. I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no. we\'re not going to pay it. And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been. And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we\'ll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar. Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn\'t afford that. They had bought the material, They had provided the services. Trump didn\'t care. He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they\'d been asked to provide. I got to tell you, that is not the way we\'re supposed to do business in America. And I can\'t imagine having a president who believes that that\'s the way you\'re supposed to treat people. But you\'re going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.Now, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of. Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand. And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus  a really crummy game that hurt people. So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...]. That is an important part of how we\'re going to protect. And it\'s run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.Now, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well, we\'re not going to let that happen. That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who\'ve been taken advantage of by corporations. And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.I have said we\'re never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it. Contrast that  contrast that with my opponent. He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street. He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again. Well, I\'ll tell you what, we\'re not going to let that happen. We need more rules, not fewer rules on them. I want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy. But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.But Trump\'s whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics. It\'s the same  the same idea that has failed us before. You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down. Well, we know that doesn\'t work. We\'ve been down that road. And what he wants to do is, I think it\'s fair to say, trickle-down on steroids. What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.Now, I\'m a little confused about this because for a long time we\'ve been saying, \'Hey, where are your tax returns?\' A lot of us wondered what he was hiding. Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there. Everybody who\'s ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns. My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there. You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could. We are grateful for the blessings that we\'ve had over the last 15 years. So did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well, I raised it. I said, \'Well, maybe he doesn\'t want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn\'t paid any taxes.\' Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos. Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really. And yesterday some of his supporters said, \'Well, it just shows he\'s a genius that he didn\'t pay any taxes.\' Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place? In the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart. But think about what that means. It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right  what\'s he saying about us? But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education. And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who\'s been going around really just dumping on America. He says our military\'s a disaster. Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.Today in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes. Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy  the poster boy  for the same rigged system that he would make even worse. Just think about it. He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know. And he\'s advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more. What\'s he want us to do, pay him to lose money? Really?There\'s a lot more to this story, and we\'re just slowly getting it into the public eye. So we know he\'s stiffed people, didn\'t pay his bills. We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times. You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years. We don\'t know what his taxes would be after that. He\'s always talked about how he can\'t release his taxes because he\'s under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009. Show the American people your taxes.I\'ll tell you another thing. If I\'m fortunate enough to be president, we\'re going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.So what did we find out today? Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects. So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us. He sent that money overseas.Now, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right? You hear that all the time when he talks. Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese. It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese. So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.Now, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets. You know that, right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum. How can he make America great again when he won\'t even buy American products in our country? And I\'ll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented. And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese. I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.And today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler  about 700 more jobs, right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job  more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here  Donald Trump said he didn\'t care. Save it, don\'t save it; didn\'t matter to him.Well, I\'ll tell you where I stood. I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry. And look what we got. Last year, our auto industry had the best year they\'ve had in a really long time. And so we\'ve got to keep building it. We\'ve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs. And we\'ve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.So now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state. You\'ve got to get out there. You\'ve got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case. That\'s what we\'ve been doing. That\'s what we\'re going to do all the way to the end of this election. But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump. I know you know people. I know you do. And you\'ve got to stage an intervention. You\'ve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio. In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people  hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families. Now, that\'s the kind of contrast we\'re getting out in the campaign, but that\'s why we need your help  to make sure you go out and talk to everybody. And I know people want change. That\'s part of the American dynamic spirit. We want change. Well, I\'ll tell you, one thing that is certain is we\'ll have change  it\'s just what kind of change. It\'s whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And that\'s exactly what we\'re going to fight for, and that is what we\'re going to get.I\'ll tell you, I\'ve been called a lot of things. Right? I\'ve never been called quitter. If I tell you I\'m going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.But I know I can\'t do it  I can\'t do it alone. Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America. And then he said, \'I alone can fix it.\' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship. He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are. He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin. We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we\'re never going to let that happen again.And so when Trump basically signs up for Putin\'s wish list, that\'s bad enough. But then, when he\'s cavalier  and I\'m not talking about basketball  when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn\'t care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks. He even said he wouldn\'t care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons. One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation. And now it\'s even more important because it\'s not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we\'ve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn\'t matter, because it does.I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table. And what I learned  if you use diplomacy and you\'re tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program. And we\'re going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement. I\'m going to enforce. And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we\'re in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.So I know diplomacy can work because I\'ve done it, and I know that  we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people. I\'ve been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will. And Donald says he has a secret plan. That he won\'t tell us about. Well, there\'s no secret; he has no plan. And we\'ve got to do more  we\'ve got to do more to make sure we protect our country. We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government. I will not rest. As a former Senator from New York on 9/11, I take this as a personal responsibility. I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism.And finally, my friends, we\'ve got to bring our country back together. There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating. Our diversity is one of our strengths. We have to listen to each other. We don\'t have to agree; that is not required. But we need to be respectful. We need to listen. And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.When I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody. I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids. When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with. And they all have nice things to say about me when I\'m not running for something. And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the [...] of that. And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them. We did that. There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of.So I\'m excited about the campaign, but I\'m even more excited about getting to work for you  being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody. I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice. And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you. And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine  it\'s right here  is real simple: I want you to know what we say we\'re going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I don\'t believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we\'re going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else. That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn\'t it? No, here\'s what we\'re going to try to do. We\'re going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations. And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class. That is not going to happen when I am president.So please join this campaign in the last 36 days. Talk to your friends. Remember, friends don\'t let friends vote for Trump. I am motivated every day because now I\'m a grandmother  two beautiful grandchildren  and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country. I want our country to be the land of opportunity. The place where dreams do come true if you\'re willing to work for them. Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child. I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of.Thank you and God bless you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 3, 2016","b'Remarks at Martin Luther King, Jr., Plaza in Toledo, Ohio'","b'""Hello, Toledo. I am  I am very happy to be here today and  I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.I want to acknowledge  we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we\'re glad they\'re here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there\'s a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where\'s Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?It\'s a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know  I\'ve gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I\'m grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there\'s something special about this one. And it\'s a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his  MVP, winner of championships  but he\'s also  LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I\'ll be in Akron, where he\'s done so much for the kids in that community.It\'s a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.Now, one thing I know  I\'ll just say it because I know it\'s for sure  I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.We believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.It\'s personal for me. I\'m the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he\'d have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That\'s what we\'ve got to keep going generation after generation.And because of my grandfather\'s hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.As a young girl, I\'d sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he\'d roll out the fabric and then I\'d watch him work with silkscreens, if you\'ve ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he\'d put it down, he\'d pour the paint in, he\'d take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part.And I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night  like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.And that means we\'ve got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we\'ve got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work  and I say that very clearly; you\'ve got to be willing to work  and if you\'re willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain.Now, I don\'t know about you, but you wouldn\'t think that the theme of my campaign, \'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top\' would be controversial  and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.Now, I will say, most American companies  most  are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else. [Applause.] And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don\'t aggressively enforce the rules, when we don\'t enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don\'t enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.And let\'s be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can\'t afford lawyers and lobbyists.So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it\'s even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen  if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.Now, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?""Audience: ""Yeah.""Clinton: ""That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We\'ve got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.So when we work together, we can all benefit.Now, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders  but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don\'t need to tell you that. You know it, you\'ve lived it, you\'ve seen it. But it is time to get back on track.And you can ask anybody who\'s ever worked for me or worked with me, who\'s ever served with me, when I tell you I\'m going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.So let\'s begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn\'t, we don\'t, right?And I\'m going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.Now, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.But on the other side  on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country\'s future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.Now, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we\'ve seen of egregious corporate behavior.Look at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn\'t it? One of the nation\'s biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.And then in a category by himself, there\'s Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.Now, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It\'s just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn\'t look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it\'s not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.I saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Caf here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, \'I would feel guilty if I didn\'t pay anything. It\'s flat-out cheating the government.\' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims he\'s going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn\'t lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he\'d hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.Now, he says that he\'s the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here\'s what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here\'s one of the many things that I\'m stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you\'re paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He\'d open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually  listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker  his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn\'t care about, certainly doesn\'t understand.Now, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate  in the debate  well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here\'s my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?This is Trump to a T. He\'s taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country\'s. It\'s Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single  not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump\'s campaign. Think about it. I\'ve been endorsed by very successful people  Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, \'Look, I\'ve been successful.\' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That\'s the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.But here\'s what we\'ve got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we\'ve got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It\'s time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We\'re going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.First let\'s start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I\'ll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country  on paper, not in reality  just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand. So here\'s what we\'re going to do. We\'re going to close those loopholes. I\'ve got a list of them we\'re going after. We\'re going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We\'re going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We\'re going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they\'re going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we\'re going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.Second, we\'re going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn\'t a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans\' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio\'s Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.Now, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there\'s a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We\'re never going to let that happen.Now, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam\'s victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print ""gotchas"" to escape accountability. And in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries  from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don\'t. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, \'Well, you can\'t sue us.\' So we\'re going to rein in that abuse across everybody.We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It\'s one of the reasons I\'m against it. I\'ve warned about this for years, I\'ve written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president  because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We\'re going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.And let\'s finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions. So let\'s stand up for taxpayers. Let\'s stand up for consumers. And let\'s stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad\'s very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can\'t use their power to gain unfair advantages.Now, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I\'ve met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I\'m talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers  he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn\'t pay them, but he wouldn\'t pay them. And he told them, \'You want to get your money? Sue me.\' My dad could never have done that. I\'m just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don\'t know what we would have done.More than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it\'s called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.I mean, look what\'s happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don\'t keep getting bigger and bigger.I want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let\'s protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we\'re proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.We need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers\' rights. Let\'s say loudly and clearly: \'right to work\' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.Let\'s also, my friends, let\'s raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don\'t live in poverty. Let\'s defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let\'s provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I\'m going to say: let\'s finally guarantee equal pay for women.Now, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I\'m playing the woman\'s card. And I\'ll tell you  right?  if fighting for working families is playing the women\'s card, you know what? Deal me in!And then finally, I\'ve got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a \'Make It in America\' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.That includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged  ravaged  by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we\'re going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we\'re going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business. Now, you don\'t have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn\'t matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. \'We could have just let it go,\' and that\'s a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who\'s thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren\'t ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn\'t lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.But that\'s not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry\'s back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back. So I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that\'s the way it\'s supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together.So what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election\'s going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text \'join,\' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.So we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let\'s prove  let\'s prove  that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let\'s prove that we\'re going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I\'m here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 10, 2016",b'Remarks at Ohio State University in Columbus',"b'""It is a glorious night here at the university, in Columbus, in the great state of Ohio. And I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn\'t he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.Any of you see that debate last night? I\'ll tell you what, I\'m not sure you\'ll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won\'t. It was such a clear display of what\'s at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward.Now, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we\'ve got to pull this country together if we\'re going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.Now, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else\'s.When I think about the challenges that we\'re facing, I don\'t think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it\'s just locker room banter. You know what\'s happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they\'ve been saying, no, that\'s not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.But it wasn\'t just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it\'s not just about women. Yes, he\'s insulted and demeaned women; we\'ve seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He\'s disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.That is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we\'ve had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history. You know what\'s at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don\'t want someone who says that he\'s going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will  who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman\'s right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you\'re willing to do your part, you\'re willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.We don\'t have to make America great. We\'ve got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.And please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values  and that\'s indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country  a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.And when you do, I want you to know what you\'re voting for, because I don\'t want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here\'s what we\'re going to do.I believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don\'t want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren\'t born, but  there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong  in America, we\'re better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place. So when Donald Trump talks about what I\'ve been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women\'s rights are human rights  while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day  on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on. So we\'ve got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I\'m pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don\'t even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we\'re not using the newest technology. We\'re not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.I do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I\'m not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let\'s lead in precision machining, 3D printing. And let\'s be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation\'s going to have that title. I think it\'s either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We\'re going to fight climate change. And we\'re going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.I\'m running against somebody who doesn\'t believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn\'t , who has even said he thinks it\'s a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it\'s a hoax, but they\'re investing. And they\'re creating. And they\'re going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we\'re going to do it.When I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don\'t you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work? You know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, \'If you\'re elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?\'I said, ""Well, that\'s one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make."" So we\'re going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.And I\'ll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn\'t all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that.Now, there\'s a lot we can do. And people say, \'Well, how are you going to pay for it?\' Well, I\'m going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.Now, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn\'t paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that\'s because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, \'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn\'t have to pay taxes made him a genius.\' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I\'ll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.And then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, \'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.\'So Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here\'s what he said. He said, \'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.\' He said, \'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.\' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, \'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.\' \'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.\' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you\'d better be prepared. And in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what\'s called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I\'ve said that\'s one of the changes I want  so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.Now, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don\'t. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he\'s not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he\'s been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you\'ve seen reports and you\'ve probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He\'s had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve  this is what kills me about him  he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel. You know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really  it really gets me upset. There\'s no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he\'s made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump\'s suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.So we\'ve got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others. We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We\'re going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.Well, we\'re going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we\'ve seen at Wells Fargo. We\'re going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we\'re going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we\'re going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.We\'re also going to end the carried interest loophole. I\'ve been trying to get that done for years. We\'re going to get it done. We\'ve got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don\'t, we\'re going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That\'s going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don\'t want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we\'re going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.Now, people in Ohio often ask about, \'Well, what are we going to do about trade?\' Well, we\'re going to have smart and fair trade. That\'s what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We\'ve got to trade with the rest of the world. We\'re only 5 percent of the population of the world. We\'ve got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.And I\'ve gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we\'re going to stand up. I\'m going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we\'re already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.And I\'ve always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don\'t think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I\'ll oppose it after the election. I\'ll oppose it as president. But I\'m going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world. I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I\'ll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever.So let\'s say yes to good jobs, but here\'s what else we need to say yes to. Let\'s say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they\'re not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There\'s an achievement gap already. There\'s also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they\'re behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I\'m tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it. So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.And then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn\'t for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal.We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don\'t have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I\'ll tell you, the other big problem  how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here\'s what we\'re going to do. We\'re going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that  I feel personally about this because that\'s what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn\'t even have a credit card. Didn\'t believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, \'You\'re on your own. I don\'t have any money for that.\' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund and make, I don\'t know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.So that\'s what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you\'re going to be paying back to our country. And I\'ve got this idea about something I\'m calling the National Service Reserve. It\'s kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you\'re kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you\'re needed, you\'re called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there\'s a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it\'s a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that\'s how we build solidarity. That\'s how we get to know each other better. So I\'m pretty excited about what we\'re going to do together. And I can\'t do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you\'re registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they\'re registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site. And we\'d love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again. I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.It\'s really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not. Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you. So please, if you\'re not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe  if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America\'s strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!And I promise you this. Together we\'re going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America\'s best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America  the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 11, 2016","b'Remarks at the Kendall Campus of Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida'","b'""Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there\'s an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we\'re so happy you\'re here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world\'s most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.About a decade ago, Al made a movie called \'An Inconvenient Truth.\' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven\'t, I hope you\'ll watch it tonight. It doesn\'t have a lot of special effects  but it does have a lot of drama.And here\'s the main message: climate change is real, it\'s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.Now, let me just say  so, so let\'s remember, let\'s remember what\'s at stake. I\'m running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it\'s a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore\'s been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America\'s efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people  in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science  he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.Look at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.So we\'ve really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.That\'s why I\'ve encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.Now, some will say, \'We\'ve always had hurricanes. They\'ve always been destructive.\' And that\'s true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures  and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot  one foot  in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew\'s storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It\'s become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it\'s costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let\'s focus on what\'s really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids  like that adorable young boy over there on his dad\'s shoulders  are grandparents, we believe that\'s more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it\'s as much as $882 billion in property at risk.But there\'s also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.And it\'s also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America\'s national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It\'s the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it\'s sunny. So that\'s why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, \'Ok, I agree, something\'s happening here. We need to take it seriously.\'But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people  in Washington, on the campaign trail  who won\'t face what\'s happening right in front of us.Donald Trump, is, quote, \'not a big believer\' in climate change. As I said, he said it\'s a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach\'s Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these \'Sunny Day\' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemn. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemn. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she\'s supporting our campaignbecause she knows America can\'t afford a candidate who doesn\'t accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, \'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected  please, let\'s come together as a country and do something about it.\'We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.So here\'s what I want to do.First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or usand I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behindnot our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.Now, you wouldn\'t know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn\'t tell the story about what\'s really going on. It\'s actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America  union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting  there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.And in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.So this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let\'s generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let\'s make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I\'m hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.And while we do that, let\'s make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let\'s be more creative  like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we\'ll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they\'re trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.And here\'s something we don\'t talk enough about. Let\'s make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses  heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children\'s Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.And then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don\'t do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There\'s no doubt about that. And so, let\'s move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.When I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark  slip past the guards  it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It\'s called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn\'t care what it would do to the planet. He doesn\'t care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn\'t care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.Well, he may not care  but we do. And that\'s why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It\'s every issue we care about it\'s our values as a country.Climate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state housesand certainly not to the White House.And if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I\'ll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, \'I\'m not a scientist.\' Well, why doesn\'t he ask a scientist and then maybe then he\'d understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That\'s why I hope that you\'ll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.Look, we need leaders who can get results. It\'s easy to stonewall. It\'s not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don\'t have a minute to waste.So, I know it\'s easy to get cynicalespecially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we\'ve got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it\'s so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.And just look, if you will  look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words \'climate change.\' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn\'t anybody  there isn\'t anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can\'t wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 12, 2016",b'Remarks at the Palace of Agriculture at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo',"b'""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.Audience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!Thank you so very, very much. Wow. I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you. I am thrilled. And I can\'t thank you enough.And it\'s a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country. And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar. And I also want to thank somebody else who\'s here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you. And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.I also want to recognize someone who\'s running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.I -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.I was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.And I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?Well, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time. And it is always a treat for either one of us to come. And today, it\'s especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election. And we\'re also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.And this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.Now, if you\'ve already registered to vote, I hope you\'ll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot. Send it back as quick as you can. Don\'t wait to fill it out.Don\'t do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you\'re wondering, ""Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago."" So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.And maybe -- if you haven\'t registered to vote yet, please do it right now. And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered. Pretty easy, huh?Because we need everybody to vote in this election. And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important. I don\'t know that there\'s ever been a more serious or consequential election. And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.A lot of states have what\'s called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought. And bigger than they\'ve been in the past.Just this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote. They couldn\'t wait to cast their ballots. And by the time we\'re done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.So don\'t be left out because we need you. And oh by the way, if you\'ve got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too. We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.And you know, your vote can make all the difference. I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.And as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts. So don\'t sit this one out. And I\'m very proud of the campaign we\'ve run. I\'m proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.It was about -- it was about issues, not insults. We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America. And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.And to me, that is what we\'re supposed to be doing. We\'re supposed to bring people together. We\'re supposed to unify our country. We\'re supposed to solve our problems by working together.And I know it\'s been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare. And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.You know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?Well, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower. And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.When they go low, we go high.And I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone. I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers. I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us. And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.And I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me. And I am very -- I\'m very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.So we\'re going to keep running this campaign. I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.And during these next 28 days, we\'re going to crisscross our country. We\'re going to be talking about what we can do together. But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.His campaign -- his campaign said today that they\'re going to use a, quote, ""scorched Earth"" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That\'s all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.And we\'re not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?I don\'t care what he says about me. I -- I -- I care about what he says about you. And I\'ll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.Now, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.And he is doubling-down on his excuse that it\'s just, quote, ""locker room talk.""Well, you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously. A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more. They are coming together and they\'re saying, ""That doesn\'t happen in our locker rooms.""But of course, you know, it\'s not only women that he has disrespected. He\'s insulted practically everybody. He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana. And Trump said, ""Well, he couldn\'t be trusted because his parents were Mexican.""He has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos. He\'s targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.And every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me. And especially children. It\'s really who Donald Trump is. But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy. His mother wrote to me. She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He\'s only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, \'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?\' That\'s the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.And it is hard to explain to children. And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them. I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.And that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.But here\'s what I also want to know. We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.You know, that\'s called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had. So I believe differently. We\'re going to invest in the middle class. We\'re going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.Audience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!Well, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They\'ve had a really bad couple of weeks.But you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it\'s not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that\'s his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman. I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that\'s what I want to make sure everybody gets.That\'s why I believe we\'ve got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we\'re going to focus on those issues. We\'re going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.And we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here\'s what we\'ve learned, Donald Trump hasn\'t paid a penny in federal income tax in years.Now this is all allegedly because of course we don\'t know for sure because he won\'t release his income taxes but it\'s allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos. Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?Do you know how hard that is? But think about it, it means he\'s contributed zero. Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.He calls the United States military a disaster.Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.Now, you\'ve all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America. There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?So you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.Now, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it. No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we\'ve slowly but surely uncovered how little he\'s done to help anybody except Donald Trump.And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings. Not American steel. He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel. If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we\'re going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we\'re going to make the economy fairer at the same time. And here\'s what I want the young people and their families to hear.Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan. We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.If you already have debt because you\'re trying to get your education, we\'re going to help you refinance it. It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can\'t refinance your student debt. And we\'re going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.Now, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save. Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.And we\'re also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won\'t be in poverty.And we\'re going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.And we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.I\'m going to introduce reform. I can\'t wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can\'t wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We\'re gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.I also think it is past time, don\'t you, to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work?You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it\'s not only a woman\'s issue it\'s a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it\'s your issue. Right? You know that.So Donald Trump always says, you know I\'m playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman\'s card, then deal me in.You see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.And I didn\'t know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn\'t know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, ""It\'s so much worse than they told us.""And it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody\'s hard work.And we can\'t ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who\'ve been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view.We\'re gonna keep those and then we\'re going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they\'re gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they\'ve ever gotten.And I\'ve been very clear about how we\'re gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.I can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes. It is not right.And what I\'ve been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues. And we thank you very much.What - right now - thank you.You know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I\'ll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?Finally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.I\'m now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I\'m going to double - I\'m going to double the child tax credit.That\'s another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it\'s child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we\'re going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.We\'re going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we\'re going to look for other ways to help you.What I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.That is how I was raised. That\'s what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!So we have about four weeks ago. It\'s going to be - it\'s going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you.As I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.People who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?Those issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.And I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we\'re going to win and we\'re going to be able to do everything I\'ve talked about.And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.You know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?I\'ll tell you what, for those of you who aren\'t grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?And there is nothing I wouldn\'t do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they\'re doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That\'s why I work to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.That\'s why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.I got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children\'s Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.I didn\'t know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister\'s hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.It turned out the grandparents didn\'t really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here\'s what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don\'t think there was a day that went by that she didn\'t think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.But, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.Now, you\'ll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.And so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.And we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That\'s what I think about when I imagine, if I\'m so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?That\'s what I think we are called to do. Whether you\'re a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.So let\'s pull together, Pueblo, let\'s get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children. God bless you, thank you.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 20, 2016",b'Remarks at the 71st Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City',"b'Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you. Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, members of the clergy, Al and Nan Smith, Donald and Melania, and all the distinguished guests.You know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband\'s political heroes.This work that you do through the dinner  Al, you\'ve done it now for 30  30 years  is such a labor of love. You\'ve been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York. And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.And as you\'ve already heard, it\'s a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.But, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith. If he were here today and saw how much money we\'ve raised for needy children, he\'d be very proud.And if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he\'d be very confused.It\'s a special honor to be here with Your Eminence. Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying ""If I only sat down with those who were saints, I\'d be taking all my meals alone.""Now, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I\'m not eligible for sainthood. But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.So I guess I\'m up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling. But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who\'ve been at each other\'s throats  mortal enemies, bitter foes; I\'ve got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?Now, I\'ve got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I\'ve been privileged to know and to work with. I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.And you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.And, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don\'t like what I\'m saying feel free to stand up and shout ""Wrong!"" while I\'m talking.You know, come to think of it, it\'s amazing I\'m up here after Donald. I didn\'t think he\'d be okay with a peaceful transition of power.And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.You know, I\'ve had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it. But, remember, if you\'re not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.And it\'s always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America. You know  don\'t you think?People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a ""four.""Maybe a ""five"" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.You know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? Forty-five.But I digress. Now, I\'m going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor. That\'s why it did take a village to write these jokes.People say  and I hear them, I know  they say I\'m boring compared to Donald. But I\'m not boring at all. In fact, I\'m the life of every party I attend and I\'ve been to three.And when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it\'s important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely. And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.Now, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They\'re hard to keep up with, and I\'m sure it\'s even harder when you\'re translating from the original Russian.But every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans  or, as we now like to call them  Hillary supporters.Now, some of my critics  and I hear that too Audience Member: Yeah.Secretary Clinton: Yeah.They think I only say what people want to hear. Well, tonight, that is true. And here\'s exactly what you want to hear  this election will be over very, very soon.And look at this dais  we\'ve got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O\'Donnell, and Katie Couric  this counts as a press conference, right?It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.It\'s a shame he\'s not speaking tonight. I\'m curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.And look at the dais  we\'ve got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials. And we have Rudy Giuliani.Now, many don\'t know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ""If you can\'t beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.""So as I\'ve said, we\'ve now had our third and, thankfully, final debate. Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night\'s debate. And look, I\'ve got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.Now, actually, I did. It\'s called preparation.And looking back, I\'ve had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don\'t have any stamina.That is four and a half hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She\'s working day and night for Donald and because she\'s a contractor, he\'s probably not even going to pay her.But I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate. The bad news is, it\'s Mike Pence. And it\'s been a long, long campaign. That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We\'ll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.And if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President\'s Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?Now, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee. Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you  you don\'t have to support the top of the ticket. Don\'t worry about anyone besides yourself. Just do what\'s in your own best interests. So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.And I don\'t understand their unhappiness. They say Donald doesn\'t have any policies. He has no policies. I keep hearing that.I\'d actually like to defend him on this. Donald has issues, serious issues.Really, really serious issues.And I worry about Donald\'s go it alone attitude. For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the \'90s, I said the same thing about America\'s health care system and it didn\'t work out so well for me, either.But speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned. He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight. Actually, it was a hearse.But I  but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health. We\'ve each released our medical records. My blood pressure is 100/70. His is unbelievably great.My cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.My heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.But Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.But  but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.But this has really been a strange campaign. You saw it last night. You saw it again tonight. Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn\'t get that at first. I kind of get it now. As he told Howard Stern, he doesn\'t like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.But Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.For example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you\'re doing the same. A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.And here\'s another similarity. The Republican National Committee isn\'t spending a dime to help either one of us.So tonight, let\'s embrace the spirit of the evening. Let\'s come together. Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.I hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight. I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line. But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.Donald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over. He has to wait and see. But there\'s nothing funny about the stakes in this election. In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward. It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.And there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.And when I think about what Al Smith went through it\'s important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party\'s nominee for president. Don\'t forget  school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible. Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.And I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.Those appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other. Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other. And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.I believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service. I\'m not Catholic. I\'m a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works. And you certainly don\'t need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis. Or to embrace his message.His message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.Now as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better. But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.So I\'ve taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other. Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won\'t be what we build, but the lives we touch.And that is ultimately what this dinner is all about. And it\'s why it\'s been such a great honor to join you all again. Thank you.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 21, 2016","b'Remarks at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio'","b'""Hello Cleveland. Wow. There is nothing like being introduced by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to get everybody going.I am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.The Indians are going to the World Series.That is after the Cavs won the championship. What a year for Cleveland, you really are ""Believe Land.""Now I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.I want to thank all of the people who are here today because you\'ve heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I\'ll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.I wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.And we need you all in. We need you all in. You\'re rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!Anybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.Really, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.And because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people\'s minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we\'re going to invest in the middle class.We\'re going to invest in you and your families. We\'re going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you. And we\'re also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.But on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.Now, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.He is basically saying hey, we\'ve been around 240 years and we\'ve always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I\'ve lost elections, you don\'t feel very good the next day, do you?But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?And the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It\'s how we hold our country together no matter who\'s in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn\'t win.That can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that\'s true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.And the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.[points to an audience member holding a sign]Those are great. That is great. I\'m excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.That is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.You know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.And listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.Including many people right here in Ohio.In fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.That is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that\'s out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.People are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.And I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.I want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American\'s president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.But I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.CLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn\'t be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.So I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.My opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that\'s with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It\'s really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.And that\'s what we\'re going to do. We\'re going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he\'s on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.And this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you\'re one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I\'m going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we\'re going to change that.And for all of his talk about putting America first, he\'s made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump\'s suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump\'s furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn\'t he start by making things in America again?And we also know that he hasn\'t paid a dime in federal income tax for years.He says that makes him smart. Well, I don\'t know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he\'s contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.Now Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.And I\'ve set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.And enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.We\'re also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.And let\'s remember, it\'s at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.And I\'m going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.Education should lift you up, not hold you back. And we\'re going to help you, we\'re going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts.It\'s going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you\'re never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.It\'s going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.I also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.I want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.And we\'re going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.As I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.We\'ve got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don\'t you think it\'s finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work?Now the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you\'ve got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who\'s working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that\'s good for the entire family, right?But the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We\'ve got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.We cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we\'ve seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\'t think there\'s a woman anywhere who doesn\'t know how that feels.So we\'re going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.And I have said repeatedly that we\'re going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.I want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who\'ve been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it\'s important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard. And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.I\'m going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.So really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me. People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that. I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.I really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election. So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country? What are our values? What kind of future do we want to create together?It is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that. But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.So I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent. I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents. I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.So I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.And the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.So I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. You can text ""JOIN,"" J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join. With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.Remember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th. So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.And I hope you will exercise that. And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind\'s eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.Whether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.If you believe marriage equality should be protected.And that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.If you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.That we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve. If you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.If you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.This is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.You know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.But I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they\'re my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody\'s children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.To be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down. I am motivated by my work that I\'ve done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.From the time I joined the Children\'s Defense Fund, until today. And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.Let\'s go out and prove that love trumps hate. Thank you!""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 22, 2016","b'Remarks to the Press Aboard the Campaign Plane in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania'","b'Secretary Clinton: ""We are really happy to campaign together. As you know, Tim has been doing the most amazing job around the country hitting every state multiple times along with Ann, his extraordinary wife, who has been campaigning tirelessly on her own as well. So we don\'t get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together. But today was a real opportunity for us. I just want to make two quick points. First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot. And in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate. We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight. So we will have a chance to do that with her. I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim. The other point is today, we are making our closing arguments. We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against. And I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he\'s president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior. Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. As we said in the book, ""Stronger To-gether"" we have very specific plans. And we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.Reporter: Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations. What do you have to say to that?Secretary Clinton: That is just not accurate.Reporter: We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps. How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?Secretary Clinton: Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me. We have close elections in America. You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them. it is not unusual that the election would be close. So we are not taking anything for granted. We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground. We have great events planned. We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote. As i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout. the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it\'s never been reached before. 50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging. And then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already. So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do. We have been very clear about that. We\'ve laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum. And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us.Reporter: Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?Secretary Clinton: Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished. I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people. I didn\'t have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else. And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with. I think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor. You don\'t get that done unless you work with folks on the other side. So I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state. And people know that. And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together. And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.Reporter: Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?Clinton: No I really haven\'t. I am a little superstitious about that. We have got a transition operation going, and I haven\'t really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve.Reporter: What kind of qualities are you looking forSecretary Clinton: I am not going to talk anymore about that.Reporter: I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump\'s assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?Secretary Clinton: You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours. I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore. I will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer. He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to. He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he\'s going to sue women who have made accusations against him. I am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president. And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on. Thank you all very much.Reporter: Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that\'s now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making. Would you comment on that as well?Secretary Clinton: No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election. I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 22, 2016","b'Remarks at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania'","b'Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you! Thank you all so much!Wow. It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh. I do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney. I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland. The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it\'s not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me.I also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us. Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here. Mayor Bill Peduto. Mayor John Federman. Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer. And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us. If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.Some of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together. I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.But both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it\'s going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot. Whether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot. Now, my name and Tim\'s name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we\'re going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator. You know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives. Now she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people\'s lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie\'s opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump. A lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say \'he does not represent me\'. But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn\'t really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn\'t have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests? So, you know, when I look at this, I\'m thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it\'s not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children. Now, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.I mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.And after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I\'ve met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad\'s shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.You know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors. You know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can\'t afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can\'t afford it. What are you going to do about it? That is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you. Now, I\'ve got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you\'ve got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country. You know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election. Make no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don\'t feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? You know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election. And you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.And in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe. The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone. Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too. Because whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.And we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That\'s what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy. Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that\'s right. Worked for one. And here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn\'t he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn\'t paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don\'t know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business? Never could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks. I will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it\'s unfair and it\'s wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can\'t be exported out of Pennsylvania.I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges. Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs. We are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don\'t let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class. It is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.So, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it\'s all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don\'t come back to Washington after the next election.We are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.And so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education. And I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out. There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today\'s economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life. We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.It\'s going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it\'s going to help save -- it\'s going to help save people thousands of dollars. In fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you. I mean, ultimately it\'s pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream. So, there\'s a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it\'s not just a woman\'s issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who\'s working, it\'s your issue. It\'s good for the entire family, it\'s good for our economy. So my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that\'s where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.Audience Member: Nope!Secretary Clinton: Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.And I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign. You know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it\'s going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.I care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement. And, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution. And maybe it\'s because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren\'t treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law. You know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don\'t do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary. Or, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on. You know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn\'t one, you will understand why that is so important. And when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion? And if you haven\'t seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of. So, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I\'m reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.So, here we go. Just remember -- you\'ve got to get out and vote, you\'ve got to get everybody you know to get out and vote. If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com. You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet. They will tell you where you are supposed to vote. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246. And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come. There are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants. My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton. And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65. He believed in our country. He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again. We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future. Don\'t let anybody tell you America\'s best days are behind us. Don\'t believe that for a minute.We are going to pull together. We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again. Help us. Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you all.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 24, 2016","b'Remarks at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire'","b""Thank you  Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day! It is so great to be back here in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here.Oh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage. And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here. It's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed  I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign. And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.In New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote  you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!I know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day. I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.Now, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street. And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again! But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo. And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others. In fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator. She is refusing refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.I know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but  I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away. She gets under his thin skin like nobody else. Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is  temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire. You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word. Look at what she has already done. Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.During her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way. She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with. So she has really honed her skills  listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night. From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families. What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground. And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.Because we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington. We have to get back to listening respectfully. We can disagree without being disagreeable. And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.She knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter. So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her. And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now. And Maggie is leaving some big shoes. She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor. Colin is the person for that job. You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.He helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire. Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient. He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators. And Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state. And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families. So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie. Now did anybody see the last debate? I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president. I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.I think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.So, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do. And I get criticized for having so many plans. Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book  oh, there's one copy right there! It's called  oh, another copy! It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president. And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists. We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists  our lists as a country.We are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We are going to make college affordable. We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do. What a novel idea! We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.But I got to tell you. During that debate, Donald said something. Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying. He became the first person running for president  Republican or Democrat  who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election. Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy. I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is. All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy. And I got to tell you  as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed. I take this really seriously.And for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great  something that  something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt. We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are. I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.So when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote. And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever. Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together  Democrats, Republicans and Independents  to reject hate and division. And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.We are more than our disagreements, we Americans. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party. But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for. It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.Because to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's what this has to be about. It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters. You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence. Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq. He has no plan to defeat ISIS. And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.' And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.' Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. I don't think so. He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.But just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why. He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he campaigned against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.' Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is. Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are. And I want us  I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.'This election poses a very clear choice on the economy. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America. So am I. So are every one of you here. That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America. With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.What does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems. There is a lot of great work to be done here. And guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America. I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that. They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.' Well, I'll tell you what. I don't want us competing with low wage jobs. I want us competing for the high wage jobs. Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products. I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.I want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years. That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.And I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared. I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K. I want kids to be prepared to succeed. Because we are in a competition, and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win. And I want our schools  I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire. And I want to bring back technical education to high school. I think we really  we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.And working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college. And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable. Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that. And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level. But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.So after our primary was over  and you know what, I was really proud  I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. And it was a campaign  it was a campaign about ideas, not insults. And that's what campaigns should be about. And after it was over, Bernie and I got together. We put our heads together. And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And if you make more than that, it will be debt free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education. This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future. And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt. We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford. And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.Now, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business. And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end. Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb. Right?We are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare. We are going to work for paid family leave. Because this is the way families are today. We are not living in the 1950s. Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge. They are making all they can make. One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.The other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh. There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were. So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think. Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy. But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be. I got fired.' And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man. What a fine human being. And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.' He told me that story. I think your president should care about that. I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?' Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?' I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign  where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.What happened is trickle-down economics came back. So here is what I am going to do. We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We are going to  we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No  no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.Well, it will for him. That is trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I've really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?Has anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families. For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?So my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction. If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.So please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote. I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake. If you ought to be part of a positive, optimistic, confident, unifying future, please come out to vote on November 8th here in New Hampshire, and prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you all!"""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 25, 2016","b""Remarks at Broward College's North Campus in Coconut Creek, Florida""","b'Hello, Broward County!Whoa. It is so great to be back in Florida. There are just 14 days, two weeks from today.The most important election in our lifetimes. I\'m so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,Congressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson\'s wonderful wife, Grace Nelson. So we are glad you are all here with me.And I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes. And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.I also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree? But it\'s going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done. And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.I think Florida deserves a senator who\'s going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.This is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people. I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America. So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he\'s asked says, well I\'m not a scientist. And I always wonder, why don\'t you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.And you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, ""weakened us as a people.""His solution, Patrick\'s opponent\'s solution, is to privatize Medicare.Audience: Boo!Clinton: That is exactly the right response, but don\'t boo, vote, right?And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida\'s schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.That\'s what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it\'s going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.So please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.Now, I know there\'s an overflow crowd outside and I\'m so sorry they can\'t be in, but I\'m told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.I got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?Well, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.Audience: Happy birthday to you!Clinton: Well, thank you!Thank you. Yeah, you know, you\'re right. That last debate was like an early birthday present, right? But here\'s what I wanted you to remember. I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.You know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve. And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called ""Stronger Together,"" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we\'re going to try to do if we\'re so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president. And I think it\'s important, because I want you to have confidence that we\'re going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth. And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn\'t really have very many plans. You know, I\'ve tried to run a campaign based on issues, he\'s run a campaign based on insults. And so in the debate, we didn\'t have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.But in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying. Well, he said a lot of things, cut there\'s one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this. He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.I guess we shouldn\'t be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.In America, we don\'t say we\'re going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election. We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.And we don\'t impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty. And we don\'t punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press. And we don\'t incite violence and turn people against each other. We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.You know, I\'ve got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.And Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years. Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself. So here\'s what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?I do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. And we\'re going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.You know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king. Right? Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.Instead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made. Eight years, it\'s time to move on. We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king. We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens. I cherish that idea.So here\'s the good news. Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.And here\'s something very exciting. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.And you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida. So I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.But the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it\'s about what we\'re for. It really is. It\'s about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind. But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do. I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted. I\'m going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that\'s two weeks from today.And you know, it\'s so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we\'re seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.And what we\'ve got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that\'s why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.I have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.I got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.And I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that\'s really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.That\'s why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, ""a total disaster"" and that our country is, again a quote, ""looking dumb."" Really? He\'s declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He\'s proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.Here\'s another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he\'d want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would ""love to be neutral.""Now, we can\'t have a president who says he\'s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.I have a different view. We stand with our allies. We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.So I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together. And with your help, we\'re going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I\'ve got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I\'ll tell you something that it\'s kind of sad, to be honest with you. I\'ve traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.Why? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn\'t want to believe the science of climate change; doesn\'t see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.And we\'re also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here\'s what I want all the students to hear, we\'re going to make college more affordable for everyone.You know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.That\'s the vast majority of families. And if you\'re over that, we\'re going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don\'t want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that\'s why we\'re going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don\'t require a four-year college de-gree. Let\'s return technical education to high schools. Let\'s do more with our community colleges. Let\'s have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.And you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That\'s why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn\'t still be in poverty. And don\'t you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work?And, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women\'s issue. It\'s a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it\'s your issue. And that\'s why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.And let\'s make childcare affordable. And let\'s have more profit sharing. And let\'s do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I\'ve got to tell you, I don\'t believe that\'s what it is. I think we\'re paying -- playing the smart card.Because we want everybody\'s incomes to go up. That\'s how we\'re going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that\'s playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.I\'ve also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don\'t need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.We\'re going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn\'t paid any federal taxes?For about 20 years is the best guess we\'ve got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.I\'ve been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you\'re running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?Audience: Yes!Clinton: Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that\'s kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that\'s what we\'re going to do because we don\'t want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.He stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn\'t pay them. He just doesn\'t pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.Well, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I\'m just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.So here\'s the bottom line and here\'s what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it\'s going to be much easier for some of you to vote early. And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.If you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it\'s going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don\'t get -- don\'t get complacent, because we\'ve got to turn people out.So I\'m asking you to vote for me, I\'m asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I\'m asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that\'s what is at stake. So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday. It goes through Sunday, November 6th. You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM. In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.And we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote. But don\'t stop there. If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.Now, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day? And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed. I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.I think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it\'s not just them. I want to help everybody\'s children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we\'re passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.So please join me. This is bigger than me, it\'s bigger than any of us. It\'s even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.This is a crossroads election that\'s going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead. I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.If you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let\'s go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let\'s prove once and for all that love trumps hate.Thank you all very much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 26, 2016","b'Remarks at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in Tampa, Florida'","b'Thank you so much! Thank you. Wow, thank you all. What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa! I am so, so grateful to Jos for that wonderful introduction. He\'s an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he\'s a humanitarian. He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people. He\'s been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages  and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke. I enlisted Jos\'s help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative. And as you heard, he\'s also a proud immigrant and  he is standing up to Donald Trump\'s anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he\'s doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business. He\'d been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Jos heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, \'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.\' That is really gutsy.And today was a perfect time to have Jos be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel. And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them. And today, in opening that hotel, I think it\'s important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers. The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign. So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different. Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes. That is the way that he does business.Now, we\'ve actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy. He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas. He stiffs small businesses. I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman. And I\'ve met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump  provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted  and then weren\'t paid. I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.So I\'m grateful to Jos and I want to thank everyone else  my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson. Congresswoman Kathy Castor. Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who\'s here with his two daughters. Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist. I have to say, we\'ve got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate. And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.So, my friends, here\'s the advice that I got. It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it\'s warm. And some of you have been here a while, right? And I\'m watching the flags. So long as they\'re waving, I know there\'s a breeze. If they stop waving, I\'m really going to cut this short.But let me start by thanking you  thanking you for being here. [Chants of ""Hillary!""] Thank you. Thank you. Well, I\'ll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I\'m coming back to Tampa, Mayor. And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute. No complacency here. Nobody nobody flagging. We\'ve got to get everybody out to vote. And I hope in addition to the people that I\'ve mentioned, someone who\'s not here I hope you will support  that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate. I think you\'ll be pleased because he\'s an independent voice. He\'s a problem-solver. He believes in comprehensive immigration reform. He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered. He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration. He\'ll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures. He\'ll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs. So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.Now, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate? You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. And every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a  yeah, \'Wrong\'  he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama\'s words: when he goes low, we go high.But I got to say, he said something in the last debate we\'ve never heard from anybody running for president. He basically said that he\'s not sure  he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election. Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can\'t really take what he says very seriously. But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans. We have our elections; we\'ve had them from George Washington forward. We\'re going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.I believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it\'s happening, my friends. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That\'s the biggest number ever. And that number includes 50 million young people. And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida. I\'m hearing some great stories from people. Let me just tell you one. It\'s about Steven, from St. Augustine. He\'s been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease. He\'s been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years. But he knows how important his vote is. So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended  clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America. And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses. And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.We have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable. Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa. It\'s a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry. And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I\'m going to need your help.We\'re going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure. That rail system, Bob, that you want, we\'re going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we\'d put to work  technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses. But we\'re also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time. You\'re already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida. I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain. People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it\'s the oceans rising. So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that\'s exactly what we\'re going to do.We\'re also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you\'re not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university. If your family makes more than that, you\'re not going to have to go into debt  pay what you can afford, and then we\'re going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down. And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.And I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators. I want to work with you and be a good partner with you. And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families. So let\'s invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges. Let\'s have more apprenticeship programs  labor and business together.But while we grow the economy, let\'s make it fairer. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren\'t left in poverty. I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work. My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you\'ve got to work for what you get in life, right? But if you\'re working, you shouldn\'t be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.And isn\'t it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work? You know, this is not just a women\'s issue. This is a family issue. If you\'ve got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it\'s your issue. And unlike my opponent, we\'re going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we\'re going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter. And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.So when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer. And compare that with what my opponent has proposed. He really believes if you give trillions  that\'s trillions with a \'t\'  trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down. Now, we know that doesn\'t work; we\'ve seen it. And it\'s pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn\'t paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years. He says not making taxes makes him smart. Well, I don\'t know. I don\'t know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year. And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven\'s sakes?Actually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here. But this means he\'s contributed zero, okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster. Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that? He hasn\'t contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure. This is a false  false  charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.And I\'ll tell you something; we did a little research. He\'s been denigrating America for decades. This didn\'t start with his birther lie against President Obama. It didn\'t even start running against me. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world. So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself. And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we\'re better than that. We are stronger than that. We want to forward  forward  into the future with confidence and optimism, and that\'s what we\'re offering in this campaign.I got to tell you, it is not just what we\'re against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it\'s what we are for. And I believe strongly that what we\'re for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future. America\'s best days can still be ahead of us. But we can\'t make any of this happen if we don\'t have you voting.Now, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he\'s right. That\'s why it\'s so important everyone gets out and votes. And here in Florida  in a lot of places, you can only vote on Election Day, but here in Florida, voting couldn\'t be easier. Early voting began on Monday. In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state. You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. In fact, the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here. You can go vote right after this event. And we\'ll have staff ready to help you get there. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.But I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks. We\'re reaching out to everybody. So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N, and that is 47246. We can use you. We\'re making millions of phone calls in Florida. We\'re knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.We don\'t want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th, America will have a new president. I\'ve got to say  so I\'ve got to say to you that change is inevitable in life. Right? And so the real question is, what kind of change are we going to have? And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent. No. I\'m serious. I\'m serious. After this election, if I\'m fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody. Right? And ask. Ask the people you\'re talking to what kind of change they really want because I don\'t think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons."" Audience: ""No.""Clinton: ""Now, that may be change, but, boy, that\'s not the change we need. And my vision is different. It\'s more hopeful, optimistic, and unifying. I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that\'s what you choose. I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good, high-paying jobs and in new industries, like clean energy and advanced manufacturing. I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants, who pay taxes  and, by the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid. And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare, where we\'re respected in the world, working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. So yes, change is coming, The choice is yours about what kind of change we\'ll have.And I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it\'s not just about winning on November 8th, as important as that is. It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.Tim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president. So if you will help, we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country. Let\'s prove once and for all that love trumps hate.Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 27, 2016","b'Remarks at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina'","b'Hello, Winston-Salem! Hello Wake Forest! It is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many, including the Wake Forest family. And it doesn\'t get any better than being here with our most amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. I want to thank everyone who has filled this arena, and I especially want to thank Dr. Hatch and the staff team and students at Wake Forest University. I will never forget being here with the legendary Maya Angelou, one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard.So I couldn\'t think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever. I want to say what I think is obvious but can\'t be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age. But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future. And this one is about whether we build on the progress we\'ve made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards. So we have a lot of work to do.And I don\'t mean just in the presidential race. Let\'s be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina. He will always put the people of North Carolina first. And he will repeal HB2  because he knows that discrimination is wrong. It\'s bad for business, and it\'s against North Carolina\'s values.And let\'s send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate. She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.And unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And remember, it is not just Roy\'s name and Deborah\'s name or my name that\'s going to be on the ballot. So much of what we care about -- so much that\'s at stake in the election is, too.Voting rights are at stake. And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you\'ve got to vote in this election. And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people\'s votes, you will turn out and say, ""No. We demand the right to vote.""And supporting our veterans is at stake. If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you\'ve got to vote. And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who\'ve worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.And climate change is at stake. Now, I shouldn\'t have to say this in 2016, but I will. If you believe in science, right? And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now  you\'ve got to show up and vote in this election.Immigration is at stake. If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship  you\'ve got to vote.And marriage equality is at stake, too. If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love  then you\'ve got to turn out and vote in this election.Good jobs that pay good wages are at stake. Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country. That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy. That\'s why we\'ve proposed a very big jobs program, because I don\'t want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families. If you believe that, then you\'ve got to come out and vote.And particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you\'ve got to get out and vote in this election.And dignity for women and girls. Again, I wish I didn\'t have to say this, right? But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election. And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you\'re getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you\'ve got to vote  and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.And don\'t just take it from me because I think you\'ve heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.She has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America\'s military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.Now, it hasn\'t been all hard work. She played a mean round of \'Carpool Karaoke,\' and among the many real privileges I\'ve had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House  and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.And boy  thank you! Boy, didn\'t she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?And I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? \'When they go low, we go high.\'And on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.Seriously  is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?And maybe, maybe it\'s especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I\'m going to state the obvious. It\'s not easy. You\'ve got so many people counting on you. You\'ve got the eyes of the world on you. And when you\'re trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible  that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.And let\'s be real  as our first African-American First Lady, she\'s faced pressures I never did. And she\'s handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.And she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.I want to say just one thing about the First Lady\'s work. I mentioned military families. She\'s been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn\'t apologized to them.He actually made it worse  just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don\'t -- I don\'t understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.And he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn\'t understand military strategy, Trump said, \'I\'ll teach him a couple things.\' Well actually, Donald, you\'re the one who\'s got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!No one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we\'ve achieved under President Obama\'s leadership is at stake  he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.And all the work that we\'ve done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.Now, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work  by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans  to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.We\'ve got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It\'s gotten pretty ugly, hasn\'t it? We\'ve all felt it  especially our kids.I hear this from parents and children across our country  kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they\'re hearing, right? I see the educators\' heads nodding.Little girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves  and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady\'s, to stand up and say, \'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,\' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.Our kids are scared that they\'re going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they\'re immigrants. They\'re scared if they\'re Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old  he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he\'s ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, \'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?\'Now that honestly breaks my heart. We\'ve got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we\'ve got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?Well, here\'s one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online  and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we\'re going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who\'ve been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can\'t think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.So ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I\'ve been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.Starting right now, let\'s come together. Let\'s work together. And let\'s be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let\'s have each other\'s backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.Let\'s go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that  for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us. Let\'s make sure you vote early. Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon. I\'m excited about what we\'re going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 29, 2016","b'Remarks at the Dickerson Community Center in Daytona Beach, Florida'","b'Go, Daytona Beach! Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Chants of ""Hillary.""] Thank you, all. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. I am just thrilled to be here. Are you I\'m ready to canvass? Well, we need your help in these last 10 days until the election.I want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children. I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us. And to all of the elected officials, all of the organizers and the volunteers, I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about what\'s at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.I was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration. And a lot of people told me they had already voted, but I said, \'Get your friends. Get your family. Get everybody you know to vote\' because you\'ve got early voting here in this county, in Volusia County, until November 5th. No excuses. Everybody\'s got to get out and vote. And that\'s what this canvass is meant to make sure we do. Right?Now, I\'m sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday. Well, if you\'re like me, you probably have a few questions about it. It is pretty strange. It\'s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, in fact, it\'s not just strange. It\'s unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts. And so we\'ve called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table. Right?Now, of course, Donald Trump is already making up lies about this. He is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I think it\'s time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy. We can\'t let him get away with this, can we?Now, like any campaign, there have been ups and downs and ups and downs, but I\'ve got to tell you I feel so motivated, so excited, so ready because I\'ve always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families. What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night, and I\'m going to stay focused on that, because you know on November 9th that\'s what\'s going to matter. We can\'t let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions. It\'s got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren  and who can help take us there as your president. [Chants of ""Hillary!""] Now, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who\'s ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.Now, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president. That\'s how I was raised. When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home. And my mother  my mother taught me to never, ever quit. Now what does that mean? Well, that means everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. And I\'ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I\'m not stopping now. We\'re just getting started.And let\'s always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: \'When they go low, we go high.\' So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we\'re not going to back down. We\'re not going to get distracted. We\'re not going to get knocked off course. Because we know how much the election matters. We know how many people are counting on us. And that\'s why we\'re going to reject Donald Trump\'s dark and divisive vision about America.We are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th. Right? Because Donald Trump\'s strategy is pretty simple. They\'ve even said it in his campaign. It\'s to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot  get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too. Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign. It goes against everything we stand for. And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.We need more of everybody to vote  more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody. Let\'s break every record that we\'ve ever had for voting. Let\'s make that the story of this election. And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference. Right, Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what\'s at stake in this election, then we will make history. We will win up and down the ballot. And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers. That\'s why I hope you\'ll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate. He will be an independent voice for Florida families. And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Now, here\'s some really good news. We just reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That is the highest number ever. And that includes 50 million young people. That\'s the most in history. And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election. And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like we\'re seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in. Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump\'s demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn\'t born in America.I\'ll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is. Now it\'s up to us to show who we are. And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we\'re against, it\'s about what we\'re for. It\'s about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected  where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.So my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot. Everything we care about is at stake  your future  making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt  the cost of prescription drugs down  protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes. Fighting climate change is at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.Now, did any of you see the debates?""Audience: ""Yes.""Clinton: ""Well, I\'ll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying. He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election. Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he\'s attacking the institutions of democracy. And so it comes down to this. When your kids and grandkids ask, \'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,\' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.And the way we\'re going to do that: We\'re going to turn everybody out. Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County. Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote. The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island. So don\'t wait one more day. Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.Now, I know  I know that we\'ve got our canvass organizers up here. I don\'t want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused. I\'m so grateful to them and to you, and we need you. We need you. Stakes couldn\'t be higher. We got to do everything we can. I don\'t want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, \'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.\' So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, \'When are you going to vote? Do you know where you\'re going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you?\' And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida. And then if you need to, sign up yourselves. We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day. And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days. And we\'re going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you. And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention. Remember, friends don\'t let friends vote for Trump.And think about it this way. On January 20th, we\'re going to have a new president. And I\'ll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we\'ve made under President Obama and go even further. But I can\'t do any of the things that I\'m talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me. So that\'s what I\'m asking you. That\'s why I came to Daytona Beach today. I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days. Let\'s give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions. Let\'s build a future we can all be proud of, and let\'s make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 30, 2016","b'Remarks at the Manor Complex in Wilton Manors, Florida'","b'I am so excited to be here and I want to thank you. And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who can\'t get inso I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside. I\'m here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign. I want to thank Ken Evans. Thank you so much, Ken. I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel. I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here. And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors. And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader, Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign president. I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers. And as I\'ve said many times, HRC for HRC sounds good to me.Well, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th. Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes. And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted. It\'s great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many. And there have been ups and downs in all that we\'ve gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you  your lives, your futures. The problems that keep you up at night. That\'s what I\'m interested in, and that\'s what I\'m going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.That\'s really what this election is about. There\'s a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there. So I want you to know  now, I just have to say I know I\'m preaching to the choir. But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right? Because we\'ve got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top  or someone who\'s temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job. You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I mean, he\'s such a downer, right? And it\'s time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what\'s really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy. We can\'t let him get away with this.But here\'s the good news. Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals. But we are seeing Americans coming together  Democrats, Republicans, independents  to reject Donald Trump\'s dark and divisive vision of our country. And it\'s going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what\'s at stake. Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us. We don\'t want a president who demeans women. We don\'t want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families. We don\'t want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn\'t born in America. We don\'t want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. But I want you to know, the energy we\'re now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we\'re against, it\'s also about what we\'re for. Because we also share a common vision. Beyond partisanship and politics, it\'s a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?And that\'s exactly what I\'m going to be fighting for in these last nine days. We\'re going to honor people, not insult them. Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women. And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future. I agree with that: you do. And I promise you this: I\'m going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.Now, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean? Well, that means ""Audience Member: ""Rise up.""Clinton: ""You got it. You got it. And it also means when you\'re knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again. I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. I\'m not stopping now. We\'re just getting warmed up, right? And we won\'t be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us. We\'re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. So we\'re going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.We\'re going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump\'s strategy is real simple. They\'ve even said it in his campaign. Here\'s his strategy about how he\'s going to win: Get women to stay home. Get young people to stay home. Get people of color to stay home. Get the LGBT committee to say home. It\'s all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for. So you know how we\'re going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.We need everybody to turn out and vote  women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life. Let\'s break every single record. Let\'s make that the story of this election. And here\'s some really good news. This is amazing. More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in. So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.And I want you not only coming out for me. I want you to reelect our members of Congress. And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate. And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this. We\'ve heard some outrageous things in this campaign. I\'m sure we\'ll hear more in the next nine days. But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning. It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the \'90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren\'t welcomed in school.And then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn\'t a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I\'ll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.Back in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump\'s behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, ""I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.""Now, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we\'ve heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here\'s what the Washington Post concludes. \'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a faade.\' And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people\'s giving as his own.Now, of course, because he\'s refused to release his tax returns, we don\'t even know if he\'s ever given anything. But here\'s what we do know. With Donald, it\'s always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn\'t care who\'s left holding the bag.And here\'s what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we\'ve made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he\'ll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama\'s executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It\'s a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump\'s golf courses. So I want you just to think.This guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it\'s the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it\'s a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it\'s deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump\'s business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that\'s how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We\'ve made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don\'t we?There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here\'s what I\'ll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We\'ll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don\'t need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we\'re going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.Now, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want  I want LGBT people in every corner of our country  because don\'t forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today. Right? And we\'re going to elevate this issue. We\'re going to talk about it. We\'re going to reach out.So when you vote in this election, remember, it\'s not just my name on the ballot. It\'s your future. It\'s who we are as a country. It\'s every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.I believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we\'re going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we\'re serious about supporting a middle class, we\'re going to be supporting families.The other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We\'ve got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine\'s hand. And she said to him, ""I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was \'No. Don\'t come back at all.\' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that\'s also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.I want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what\'s the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We\'re going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We\'re going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.And yes, we\'re going to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work. We\'re going to make sure. We\'re going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I\'ve got to tell you that\'s such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy  that\'s with trillions of dollars going to the top  that will somehow trickle down. It hasn\'t worked. It won\'t work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that\'s exactly what we\'re going to do.So, my friends, we\'ve got a guy who won\'t pay his income tax. I mean, I\'ve got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn\'t pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it\'s serious because it means he\'s paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he\'s done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He\'s built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I\'m sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.So, my friends, we\'ve got work to do. And let\'s get to that work. We\'ve got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote. I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America. And look how easy it is. It is so easy. Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now. And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week. And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today. You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. And make sure you have a plan to vote.But, please, also help us in these last nine days. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So go to hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone. Text \'JOIN,\' J-O-I-N, to 47246. I don\'t want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed. I\'m against depression. We don\'t want that to happen in this election. Right?""Audience: ""No!""Clinton: ""I don\'t want people to be sad because they didn\'t do their part. We can\'t let that happen. And I have to ask you if you  if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you\'ve got to stage an intervention. Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don\'t let friends vote for Trump. Right?So I am so grateful to all of you. Have many of you have already voted? Okay. So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? That\'s what\'s going to make the difference. Change is coming. Let\'s make sure it\'s the right kind of change. The choice is yours. We\'re going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us. And we\'re going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 31, 2016","b'Remarks at Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati, Ohio'","b'Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I\'ve known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together  to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you  your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that\'s really what this election is all about. It\'s not about the noise and the distractions. It\'s about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.Now, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it\'s really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there\'s this new email story about  why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That\'s a really good question. But I want you to know  look, I\'ve said repeatedly I made a mistake, I\'m not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn\'t even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They\'re looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am  I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he\'s done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn\'t understand why we can\'t use nuclear weapons. He actually said, ""Then why are we making them?"" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He\'s mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn\'t need to consult because, and I quote, ""I have a very good brain."" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don\'t. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.So in these last days, let\'s not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It\'s not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I\'ve had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that\'s why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges  the challenge posed by slavery  and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.I will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it\'s hopeful and inclusive. It\'s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It\'s a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we\'re only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected  where our veterans are honored  where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I\'m not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn\'t seem to bother him. ""Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,"" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single  a single  nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, ""not have his finger on the button."" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we\'ve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation  when he\'s gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he\'s challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he\'s confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of ""No!""] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you\'ll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It\'s an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we\'ve seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I\'ve had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.But here\'s what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can\'t go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.And look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won\'t stand up to the gun lobby. He\'s sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama\'s actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He\'s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we\'ve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That\'s how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard  and I believe in hard work  you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I\'m going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don\'t care what the political or other barriers are. We\'re going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I\'ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I\'m not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We\'re not going to be distracted. We\'re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They\'ve announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It\'s all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you\'re as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military  I mean, the list goes on and on. It\'s almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we\'re already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven\'t voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about  I\'ve only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent\'s name, but where we stand on these issues, what we\'ve done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th. Audience Member: Happy.Secretary Clinton: Happy. I think that\'s the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn\'t make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what\'s going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear. Audience Member: No!I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we\'re for, not what we\'re against. But I also think it\'s prudent to imagine what could happen if we don\'t do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, \'What did you do when everything was on the line?\' I want you to be able to say, \'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.\'Let\'s go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we\'re going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We\'re going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We\'re going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America\'s best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.Thank you all.""'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"October 31, 2016","b'Remarks at the Kent State Student Recreation Center in Kent, Ohio'","b""Hello, Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio  even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere. I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program! My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question! And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this. Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East. And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies. So, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets. So today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? We'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well. One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age. So what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons  as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal. Earlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. Now thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief. For me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe. That's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration. So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington. We made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief. Now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia. He has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back? And by the wayright now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression. Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City  hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider  is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working. Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election. So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing. And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election. When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be  in their words  'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.' I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country. Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together. Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly  an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone. This goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans  basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency. That's something to defend  and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same. Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future! So let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 3, 2016","b'Remarks at Pasco-Hernando State College East Campus in Dade City, Florida'","b""Hello, Dade City!I am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!It's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election.So are you ready to vote?Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Now somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd  it was a big crowd at Kent State University  I think every voter should hear. Basically  his name was Bruce Blair  he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right.Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called  well, but wait a minute,  he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.And then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.And here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama  literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because  Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned  some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay.And look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?But you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite  they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down  lifting people up and respecting women.In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?So I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'He's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that  he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word  and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.We cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.He doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.Well, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.Well, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers  who  two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.But I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.Don't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!Thank you all."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 3, 2016","b'Remarks at Coastal Credit Union Music Park in Raleigh, North Carolina'","b'Thank you. Wow! Thank you all. Woo!Thank you. Thank you. I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.It is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I\'m delighted they\'re there -- U.S. Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.State Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there. Thank you, Dan.And I\'m not sure she\'s still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator. There she is!Because everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what\'s at stake, it is about who\'s going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates. And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.Now, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.I -- I got to serve with Bernie. We were colleagues in the Senate. I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life. And when we faced each other in the primary, here\'s what I was so proud about. We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.And I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.And I\'ve got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we\'re on the same side.And I want to thank Bernie for everything he\'s done. He\'s crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics. And there\'s no question that his efforts are paying off.And what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true. My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it\'s not about my opponent, it\'s not about Bernie, it\'s not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we\'re going to do together.Now, Bernie and I have already worked, we\'ve worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.Because as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people. So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we\'re going to do together.And I\'m especially pleased to have Pharrell here.Now, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I\'m going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.So tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we\'re here tonight?Well, we sure are. There\'s nowhere we\'d rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you\'re going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?We can all use you in these last days. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?Well, I\'m glad to hear that because it\'s time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.Now, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? I\'ll tell you -- I\'ll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere. People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence. And unlike her opponent, she\'s never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.Are you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?Well, I\'m -- I\'m excited. Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there\'s several -- there\'s several notable aspects of those debates.I mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.But you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years? And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.And today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison. I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children\'s Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970\'s.I went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults. I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.And as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story. She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970\'s, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start. And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does. And she found what she thought would be the perfect place. It was within her budget. It was close to work.She went to apply for an apartment. It was a new building -- brand new building. It wasn\'t even totally finished yet. She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, ""Oh, we don\'t have any apartments."" She said, ""But I saw the advertisement."" ""Well, we have no apartments left.""Well, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination. They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.So when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.And I was also very, very grateful. I had a role in helping to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.I met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born. Her daughter, she was deaf. And the doctors all said she\'ll never -- she\'ll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.And the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn\'t have that kind of money. They didn\'t have that kind of insurance. And she was telling her doctor she didn\'t know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, ""You know, there\'s this new program, it\'s called the Children\'s Health Insurance Program. It\'s for people who are not poor, but they don\'t make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don\'t work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it."" And she did. And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.And when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here. I talked with her. She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.So, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans. Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called ""Stronger Together"" telling you exactly what we\'re going to try to do if we\'re fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it\'s important for you to know what we\'re going to do together.And as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders. As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women\'s rights and LGBT rights all around the world.And you know, everything I\'ve done started by listening to people. Listening to hear your stories, what you\'re worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.You know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care. He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.I said, ""Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?"" There was a silence. He said, ""Well, what do you want me to do?"" I said, ""Well, come to the White House. Come to a meeting. We\'ll sit down and figure out what we can do."" And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.Now, I\'m telling you this because I really believe that\'s the only way we\'re going to get things done. And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we\'ve been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.But as you\'re making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president. It will either be me or my opponent.Now, I think it\'s fair to say, things are going to change. Change is part of life. That much is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?I want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who\'s elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.It\'s hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together. That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what\'s been said and how distressful it\'s been.I know there are a lot of people who are upset about what\'s going on in this campaign, aren\'t there? People come and talk to me. I\'ve had people say that they can\'t sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches. And I think that\'s an im-portant signal because this is a big decision. And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn\'t change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.And I think it\'s fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is. And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States. Our country is founded on religious freedom. It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.He has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair. He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.He seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.And we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five. These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.And in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison. But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, ""They should still be in prison."" Evidence didn\'t matter. The law didn\'t matter. To him, those kids would always be guilty.So think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?Do we want him appointing our judges?Audience: No!Clinton: Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?Audience: No!Clinton: Well, I\'ve said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are. And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that. They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.And that\'s why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture. Here\'s what we\'re going to do together. We\'re going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we\'re seeing across America.What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted. People painted the words ""Vote Trump"" on the side and then set it on fire. Who would do that? Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace? That can never be normal. It can never be acceptable.What happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.Little children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.And then we know, don\'t we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.We know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others. We have got to face this, and we\'re going to get to work to do just that. We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we\'re going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.And we\'re going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need. And we\'re going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.And we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end. It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.When I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform. I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.Too many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected. We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing. We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.And we have to restore trust between police and communities. We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.This is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us. This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all. Too often, despite the progress we\'ve made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.I am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.And I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.We have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.And we\'ve got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.When I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn\'t have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out. We\'ve got to help everybody get ahead.I believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top. And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.So, how are we going to do this? Well, we\'re going to go where the money is. Just as Bernie said, we\'re going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.And I can\'t wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.I know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well. If you\'re struggling with student debt, we\'re going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.And in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.So we could go on all night. I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do. But of course, we can\'t do anything if you don\'t get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.This is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country\'s history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads. It\'s not just who my opponent is. Pharrell is right, we don\'t even have to mention his name very much. Right? It\'s not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns. It\'s about who we are. It\'s about what we want, what we\'re going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.I believe -- I believe America\'s best days are still ahead of us if we do what we\'re sup-posed to do.Every social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity. It\'s not easy. It wasn\'t easy to get the vote for women. It wasn\'t easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced. It wasn\'t easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.And right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?And some people got discouraged about that. I\'ve met some people who say, well, you know, I don\'t even know what they want, what kind of identification. It gets a little discouraging. You cannot get discouraged. Do not grow weary while doing good, right?It is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.And in this election, President Obama\'s entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition. As the president said yesterday, everything we\'ve done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.So I got to tell you, I\'ve told the president I\'m ready to take the baton, but he\'s going to have to bend over because he\'s a lot taller than I am.But I\'m not just taking it, all of us are taking it. We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote. Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can\'t get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.So make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on. I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to be my partners, but I can\'t do any of this.You know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes. If you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is? Roughly two votes per precinct. So don\'t let anybody tell you their vote doesn\'t matter. You\'ve got to get everyone you know to come out and vote. You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th. If you don\'t know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.And then that will be the story of this election. Let\'s make that one for the history books. Please be part of what we\'re doing in these next days and let\'s make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Thank you all.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 3, 2016","b'Remarks at Pitt Community College in Winterville, North Carolina'","b'Thank you so much, wow, it is great to be here. And thank you. I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.It took a lot of courage to come here, Mae. Thank you. Thank you for being with us.I also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that\'s U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here. And either you\'re all related to him or you think he\'s doing a good job.Well, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him. And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people. He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.I also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general. Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And State Senator Don Davis.And I saved the best for last, someone who I\'ve gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with. First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is ""I have to talk to you about our farmers."" Very first thing he said. Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today. We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We\'ve got to be really focused on what we\'re going to do with this extreme weather. We\'re getting more of it in more places. And I\'m going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared. They\'re resilient. But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.And nobody knows more about weather than our farmers. And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms. You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres. You know, that\'s a lot of land, but that\'s not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm. And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people\'s families for generations.And I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it. And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it. There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind. And so we\'ve got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.That is my goal as your president. I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead. Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there. I don\'t know -- 15,000, 16,000 people. It was just extraordinary. But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.And, you know, I\'ve been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field. And, you know, it\'s been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history. And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen. So last night was very special on lots of fronts. And who knows? Maybe we\'ll see even more history made in a few days. You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn\'t vote. And I think women are making up for that in this election.So thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted? [applause]Well, that\'s really impressive. Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs. I know he\'ll do a terrific job. Are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she\'s never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?You know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.But, you know, he kept saying things like, ""Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?"" Well, we know what he\'s done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.I chose a different path. I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And I helped to create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program as first lady. That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year. And I have to tell you, I know it doesn\'t make headlines. It\'s not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I\'ll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, ""The Children\'s Health Insurance Program saved my son\'s life."" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf. And the doctor said, ""You know, she\'s never, ever going to be able to talk; she\'s not ever going to be able to hear."" Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn\'t know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said ""I just heard about this new program, the children\'s health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.""Because it\'s really for families that aren\'t poor, but don\'t have much money, and a lot of families isn\'t it. And families that don\'t have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.So, the mom found out about this thing call the children\'s health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don\'t let anybody tell you, it doesn\'t matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of themAudience: [inaudible]Clinton: Where you there? God bless you. That\'s another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women\'s right and LGBT rights around the world.And everything I\'ve done, it\'s because I\'ve been listening to people and again I know that\'s not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, ""Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,"" right?But I\'ll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people\'s stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I\'ll be.And from the first day of this campaign, I\'ve been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.And you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven\'t yet voted, maybe haven\'t yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn\'t care who gets hurt along the wayA president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don\'t have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.You know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn\'t change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote ""I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had"". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?This is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can\'t help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn\'t alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a ""C"" -- ""C"" for colored.In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn\'t respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the ""Central Park Five."" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.To him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?Audience: No!Clinton: Well, people who are voting for him, that\'s what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he\'s being heard loudly and clearly.Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, ""Make America Great Again."" They said it\'s about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You\'ve got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump\'s America?It\'s not just about communities of color. It\'s about young people. It\'s about any of us who don\'t ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we\'re not going to let it ever go back to that.But it doesn\'t end there. You\'ve also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women\'s confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.So, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I\'ve said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump\'s dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.We are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren\'t we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it\'s so hard and challenging.Love your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you\'ve got to love yourself. You\'ve got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that\'s why I want to paint a different picture. Because here\'s what we\'re going to do if we win this election. We\'re going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.We are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted ""vote Trump"" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can\'t accept that as normal either.So we are going to get to work. I\'m just telling you. If I\'m fortunate enough to be your president, we\'re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that\'s when we\'re at our best, solving our problems.We\'re going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don\'t care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It\'s wrong, and we\'re going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he\'s face with these issues says ""well the answer to our problems is more law and order."" He doesn\'t tell you what he means by that, but it\'s kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it\'s not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we\'ve got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can\'t just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald\'s always trying to say ""oh, you know, she\'s going to repeal the second amendment."" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.And we\'re going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There\'s some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn\'t agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it\'s finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.I don\'t know about you, but this is not just a women\'s issue. I\'m always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I\'m playing the woman\'s card. Well, I\'ve always said, if that\'s playing the woman\'s card, deal me in, you got that right.But I actually think I\'m playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.And we\'re going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we\'re going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We\'re going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.Now it\'s fair to say ""Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?"" Ok, I\'ll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I\'m going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that\'s a bad, bad idea.We\'re going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we\'re going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we\'re going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you\'re struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we\'re going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.But I don\'t think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I\'m going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let\'s bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships. There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I\'m asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don\'t believe we\'re at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.I don\'t think I have all the answers, I don\'t think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn\'t one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you\'ve made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here\'s what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven\'t voted yet, to vote early. Because the other\'s strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump\'s campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there\'s no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He\'s coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we\'ve done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I\'ll tell you what, I\'m ready to grab that baton. He\'s going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he\'s a tall man. But I\'ve been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.So let\'s get out and vote, and let\'s vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 4, 2016","b'Remarks at Eastern Market in Detroit, Michigan'","b'Hello Detroit! Thank you! I\'ll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. And that introduction, I\'m just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we\'ve had in the whole campaign. Thank you Wendell.You know, there\'s something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called \'Rise Up.\' And that is what Detroit is doing  you are rising up! And that is exactly what we\'re going to do in America. We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.I\'m looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because  he\'s not only a real billionaire  he\'s actually shared his profits with his employees.Now, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.Now, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn\'t he? And, you know, there\'s a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, \'Well, what have you done for 30 years?\' And you know, I don\'t want to brag. But I do think it matters what you\'ve done, and especially what you\'ve done that maybe improves somebody else\'s life, right?And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we\'ve been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they\'re not poor families, they\'re working people, but they don\'t make enough money and they don\'t work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, \'We\'re sorry, there\'s really nothing we can do for her.\' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn\'t have that kind of money and they didn\'t have insurance. She was at her doctor\'s office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, \'Well, there\'s this new thing called the Children\'s Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.\' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college  because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.I\'ll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen  the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it  our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I\'ll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I\'m talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don\'t ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.As your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women\'s rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I\'m telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That\'s why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I\'ve got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don\'t recognize the country he\'s talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we\'re going and how we\'re going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there\'s nothing we can\'t achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That\'s why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.And so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know  I know that  I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.And so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn\'t have early voting. I\'ve been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don\'t know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.And I imagine  I imagine there are  some of you know people who say they\'re going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it\'s too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don\'t have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.Now, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn\'t change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we\'ve seen who Donald Trump is.Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.Just last year, he said again it wouldn\'t have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I\'m proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I\'m even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.If Donald wins the election, we\'d have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don\'t you?Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a \'C,\' C for colored. And that didn\'t sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn\'t change. So the government had to take them back to court. That\'s a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn\'t respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn\'t seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here\'s the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn\'t matter if you\'re innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that\'s exactly what Putin does to his people.So we can\'t trust him with our Constitution. We can\'t trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we\'re going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.We have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we\'ve got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we\'ve got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.I have said repeatedly that we\'re going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can\'t accept as normal what we\'re seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted \'Vote Trump\' on the side and then set it on fire. We can\'t let  we can\'t let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We\'ve got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.And it\'s important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II  infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can\'t do that. Well, I\'m telling you, they\'re wrong. They\'re wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We\'re going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we\'re going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we\'re going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.And we\'re going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We\'ve got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.It\'ll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that\'s what we\'re going to work for.We\'re also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he\'s starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we\'ve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\'t have them in the first place.And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I\'ll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That\'s why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn\'t it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women\'s issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it\'s your issue. It\'s a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women\'s card. I\'ll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women\'s card, then deal me in.And one of the other big challenges we\'re going to take on  I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don\'t go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we\'re going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.Now, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, \'People are just frustrated and angry.\' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in \'08 and \'09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That\'s what I will do. That\'s why we\'ve put this all down. It\'s on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It\'s in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called \'Stronger Together.\' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, \'Well, how\'s it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?\' I believe in making lists. Maybe it\'s a women\'s thing. My husband said  once said to me one time, \'You have lists of your lists.\' Well, I do because I want to know what we\'re going to get done and how we can make progress together.And ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?""Audience: ""Yes.""Clinton: ""Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, \'I alone can fix it.\' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn\'t one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers\' rights and women\'s rights and LGBT rights. None of them  none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn\'t happen because somebody one day said, \'I alone can make it happen.\' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn\'t put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.So really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I\'m ready to defend and build on the progress that we\'ve made. I\'m proud I was a member of President Obama\'s cabinet. I\'m proud that  he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it\'s like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn\'t drop to the ground or doesn\'t turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.Now, I\'ve told the President that when he hands off the baton that he\'s going to have to bend over. He\'s a lot taller than I am. But I\'m excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I\'ve got people coming up to me saying they\'ve got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don\'t know what they\'re going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I\'ll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.All I\'m asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody. If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text \'join,\' J?o-i-n, to 47246. Because when your children  and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today. When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, \'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.\' An America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let\'s get to work. Thank you. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 7, 2016","b'Remarks at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan'","b'Hello Grand Valley! Thank you! Thank you.It is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. Are there any Lakers here?Oh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.I have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I\'ll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you\'ll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.She fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don\'t we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it\'s wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.Are you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.The choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you\'ve gone back and forth, you\'ve thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.It\'s between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.In fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I\'ve gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who\'ve run for president, it goes back a ways. And here\'s what I want you to understand. I didn\'t agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.That\'s why this election is so different. And it\'s why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.I was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president\'s order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can\'t say, ""No, don\'t do it."" There\'s no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.So after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I\'d never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.But I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we\'ve got problems. I\'ve spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what\'s on people\'s minds. We\'ve got challenges but America\'s always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?I often didn\'t recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America\'s best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.Make no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.Some of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.When I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn\'t help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son\'s medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, ""Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump\'s America?""Think about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can\'t do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers\' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.And now, now we\'ve got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time. We\'ve got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.If you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. We are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They\'ve got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, ""We just can\'t make it in America anymore."" And I\'ll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We\'re not competing for low-wage jobs, we\'re competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.And we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.He\'s gone all over this country, and he\'s gone all over Michigan, talking about how he\'s gonna really get more jobs and he\'s going to bring back what used to be there. Well I\'ll tell you what. Look at his record, don\'t just listen to his rhetoric.Because I have a different idea. We\'re going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America\'s not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.But I also realized that anger is not a plan. You\'ve got to come together and figure out what is it we\'re gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.And I\'ll just tell you that I believe that we\'ve got to defend the American worker\'s right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.We\'re gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we\'re also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn\'t automated, we were the automaters - and you\'d go all the way down to one table, you\'d go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.And I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, ""I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.""But it\'s not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That\'s how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn\'t still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I\'m gonna raise the national minimum wage.And one of the things I\'ve heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it\'s more expensive than college tuition. We\'re gonna get the cost of childcare down. We\'re going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you\'re sick you won\'t lose your job.I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn\'t get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, ""I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me."" She said that, ""I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won\'t be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, ""OK. You\'re fired.""That is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we\'ve got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today\'s America.And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women\'s work.And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman\'s issue. It\'s a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who\'s in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.Just about everything I\'ve said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I\'m playing the woman\'s card and you know what I say, if that\'s the case? Then deal me in.And here\'s what else I want you to know. It\'s fair to ask, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" That\'s not only fair, that\'s necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you\'re a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.And for small businesses, we\'re gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we\'re going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.When you think about it, Donald hasn\'t paid anything for 20 years. He\'s paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.Especially when you\'re running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he\'s not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.So, we\'ll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can\'t afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we\'re not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I\'ve got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you\'re among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.It makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.I can\'t wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we\'re gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.Look. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it\'s never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we\'ve got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We\'ve got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I\'ve been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.We need more love and kindness in America.I don\'t know about you, I don\'t know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we\'ve all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents\' home and she got this job. And that woman said, ""I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you\'ll have to come back because we\'ll need you in the late afternoon.""Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And There\'s a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they\'ve been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody\'s paying attention, here\'s what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I\'m gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.Because I want to be a president for all Americans.Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let\'s take that first step tomorrow. If you don\'t know where you\'re supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com.

We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you\'ll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.An America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 7, 2016",b'Remarks at North Carolina State University in Raleigh',"b""Thank you all! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you. Well, I got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State University. And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great! Because, you know what? That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity! And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us. He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.I was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay? Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election. Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer? And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!Now, we are all fired up. When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia. You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is. I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.What I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.Our core values  our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.You know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people  people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.Last night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.Well, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes. Absolutely.Think about  think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time.So, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say. Deal me in. And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else. And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote. And if you believe  if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina. You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!Now, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list. But here's what  here's what else I want you to know. A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say. Look. Tomorrow  tomorrow night, this election will end. But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.So I want you to know and I want you to spread the word. I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.So if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the info you need. And you can still sign up to volunteer. Right? Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices. We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Right?And years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you! Let's go vote, North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!"""
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 7, 2016",b'Remarks at the University of Pittsburgh',"b'Hello, Pittsburgh! Woah! Hello back there! Thank you, thank you. Wow! It\'s great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country\'s history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together. The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring. To really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote. Because in Pennsylvania, it\'s all about Election Day. Other places around the country have been voting for weeks. And what you will vote for. I\'m here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent\'s name. I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He\'s in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he\'s got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote. We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history. And I am hoping that you won\'t just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. We\'ve got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman. But mostly, I\'m here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what\'s -- what the stakes are. I love you all, too. Absolutely! So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, \'Maybe, maybe it\'s not worth voting at all,\' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top. Now, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America\'s best days are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn\'t mean we don\'t have to work for it because we do. That doesn\'t mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that. I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this. Right? We can do this! We don\'t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There\'s fear, even anger, in our country. But I\'ve got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends. If we\'re going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we\'ve got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son\'s coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution. As he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life. He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, ""When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump\'s America for Captain Khan?"" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, ""People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It\'s a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election."" Sometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don\'t recognize the country he\'s talking about. That doesn\'t mean we don\'t have problems and challenges, it doesn\'t mean that we don\'t have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women\'s rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities. Tomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another? Now, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues. If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We\'re going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We\'re going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what\'s made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We\'re going to invest in America, and we\'re especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We\'re going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We\'re going to get incomes rising across America. And if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we\'re going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we\'re going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women\'s work. I\'ve got to tell you, this always get\'s about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it\'s not fair, but it\'s also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who\'s working, you don\'t want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I\'m playing the woman\'s card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in. If you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote. I\'ve got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don\'t think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It\'s good for you, it\'s good for your families, it\'s good for our country, and we\'re going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we\'re going to ease that burden. We\'re going to get those interest rates down, we\'re going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you\'re never going to have to pay more than you can afford. You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we\'ve put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it\'s never been more important than it is right now. So this has to be our mission together  doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it\'s all said and done, that\'s what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody\'s burden? We do it individually. My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn\'t want her. Her own grandparents didn\'t want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody\'s home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, \'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You\'ll have to come right back because I\'ll need you, but you can do it.\' And look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, \'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.\' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I\'m speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, \'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.\' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn\'t we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K\'s, everything that people had worked so hard for. Well we\'ve dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we\'ve got to make sure we don\'t leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: \'Coal Miners for Hillary,\' and I\'ll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can\'t do any of this without your help tomorrow. This election is going to really set the course of our country. There\'s no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I\'ll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it\'s not for me. It\'s for us. When President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that\'s what he finds. Wow, those were hard, hard times. I don\'t think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn\'t go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn\'t happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened. Elections have consequences for everything we care about. And that\'s why we\'ve got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, \'Why are you here?\' \'Because my future depends on it,\' they say. So tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it\'s unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I\'ve known a lot of the Republicans who\'ve run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn\'t agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn\'t doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that. So I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future. So it starts tomorrow. If you don\'t know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard. This is a historic, historic election and we\'re going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you\'ll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.'"
Hillary Clinton ,D,c,"November 9, 2016",b'Remarks in New York City Conceding the 2016 Presidential Election',"b'Senator Tim Kaine: My wife, Anne, and I are so proud of Hillary Clinton. [applpause]I\'m proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker in every thing that she has done as a civil rights lawyer and first lady of Arkansas and first lady of this country and senator and secretary of state.She has made history. In a nation that is good at so many things, but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elected to federal office, she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of Americans for the president. [applpause]That is an amazing accomplishment. It is an amazing accomplishment. I\'m proud of Hillary Clinton because in the words of Langston Hughes, she\'s ""held fast to dreams."" She was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well, that\'s the best barometer of whether society does well. In everything she\'s done, she\'s focused on that.We know she would have made history as a president in one sense, but we never have had a president who\'s made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children. And I was as excited about that in the Oval Office as I was excited to have my friend Hillary there and make history as the first woman president.I\'m excited and proud of Hillary because she has built such a wonderful team. There is a...[applpause]There\'s a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the New Testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says I\'m going to pay you this for a full day. Then he hires people at noon, I\'m going to pay you the same thing for the half day. Then he hires people one hours work, I\'m going to pay you the same. And those who started earlier in the day said hold on, we don\'t like this, that you\'re treating everybody who came late just as well as you\'re treating us.I\'m going to tell you something, here\'s what I\'ve come to know so well about Hillary. The team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she\'s so deeply loyal to them is inspiring. But I\'ve seen that same degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team, the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go. Her loyalty and compassion of Hillary and Bill to people, if you\'re with you you\'re with you. And that is just something so remarkable.And finally, I\'m proud of Hillary because she loves this country. [applpause]Nobody  nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy. Nobody had to ask that question. Nobody had to doubt it. She knows our country for what it is. She knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes. She\'s deeply in love with it and accepts it. She\'s been in battles before where if it didn\'t go her way she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she\'s held fast to. And that love of country is something that I think is obvious to everybody, obvious to everyone.I want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride. We  about a week before she asked if I would be her running mate, Anne and I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket.And when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion, I said to Anne, ""Honey, I don\'t know whether we\'re going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we\'re going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life."" And now, we\'ve  we\'ll remember 105 days that we\'ve had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life.I\'ll just say this. Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner. He said, ""They kilt us but they ain\'t whupped us yet."" [applpause]""They kilt us but they ain\'t whupped us yet,"" because we know that the work remains. We know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain. And in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting even at a tough time to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about.So now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. [applpause]Secretary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. [applpause]Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. [applpause]Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I\'m sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. [applpause]I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that\'s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don\'t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. [applpause]Now  and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let\'s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.We\'ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone  for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. [applpause]So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. [applpause]It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. [applpause]To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. [applpause]We  we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most  even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom.I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. [applpause]You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. [applpause]And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites...[laughter and applause]...I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. [applpause]To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us.And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I\'ve had successes and I\'ve had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what\'s right is worth it. [applpause]It is  it is worth it. [applpause]And so we need  we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. [applpause]Now, I  I know  I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. [applpause]And  and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.Finally...[applpause]Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. [applpause]Because, you know  you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.""So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.'"
