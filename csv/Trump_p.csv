The letter to Mr. Trump states, ""As we both know, it is business owners who create jobs- not the government.""Less than fourteen days after sending his request for the $1 million, and after Mr. Trump did not give money to the Club for Growth and instead declared his candidacy, Mr. McIntosh attacked Mr. Trump, was critical of his candidacy, and said, ""It would be unfortunate if (Mr. Trump) takes away a spot at even one Republican debate.""Lewandowski stated, ""The Club for Growth is the worst of the two-faced hypocrisy of Washington.""This exemplifies everything that is wrong with politics in our country.

Look, the Mexican border is a sieve. People are pouring into our country. We don\'t know who they are, where they are, they come from all over the world, not just Mexicans. I employ thousands of Mexicans. I\'ve employed over the years many thousands of Mexicans. I love the Mexican people. They\'re fantastic. Everybody knows that. In terms of the border, it\'s a disgrace. either we have a border or we don\'t have a country. You can\'t have a country without borders. People are coming in and some of those people  I read it even yesterday there was a huge article about the tremendous crime that\'s taking place. It\'s like a crime wave. One of the most dangerous places on earth. And I bring that up all of a sudden I\'m a bad person.""""I read an article yesterday from ""Fusion"" which is owned by Univision talking about women that cross the border are being raped. Many of them, a tremendous percentage, 80 percent, that\'s hard to believe it could be 80% they said the women coming across the border are raped. This is done by ""Fusion"" printed in ""The Huffington Post"" no friend of mine and I use the word rape and all of a sudden everyone goes crazy. It says 80% of the women  which hard to believe to be honest with you  so I can never apologize for the truth. I don\'t mind apologizing for things. I can\'t apologize for the truth.

Donald Trump,R,p,"July 7, 2015","b""Press Release - Coulter: Trump 'Speaking for Working Class,' 'For African-Americans'""","b'BreitbartCoulter said, ""I notice we\'ve been warned all week watch out for ISIS, watch out for ISIS this weekend, and no, instead Americans were killed by [illegal] immigrants. This wasn\'t the only illegal immigrant, and it doesn\'t have to be limited to illegal immigrants, the government is allowing people who have no right to be here into our country, whether legally or illegally. There was also an illegal immigrant who hammered his wife to death in Texas over the weekend, you know, that was an illegal alien wife who was killed. So, it isn\'t just American citizens who aren\'t being protected, but these republicans and, of course, democrats who claim to speak for oh the poor, the downtrodden, the working class. No, they\'re speaking for big business who want their cheap labor and they\'ll externalize their costs, both in terms of taxes and in terms of the crime rate."" And ""You hear Republicans saying, \'well\'  and Democrats, \'Well, of course, no one wants felons in this country.\' Well, what are they doing to stop it? Chris Christie was on Fox News this weekend saying, you know, telling us once again that fences just don\'t work, the human spirit will overcome them. It\'s like saying buckets don\'t work. Of course fences work. Americans aren\'t stupid. Why doesn\'t Chris Christie say that to Israel or China? Because their fences work just fine.""She added, ""the media are always hiding that these are immigrants, sometimes illegal, sometimes not illegal, who are committing a lot of these heinous crimes. It\'s always \'North Carolina Man Indicted on Child Rape.\' So, frankly, we don\'t know after this weekend exactly how many Americans were killed by immigrants in drunk driving accidents, in heinous murders like this one in San Francisco. It\'ll take a few weeks, maybe a year to wait for the court transcripts for the media to even tell us the truth. The government won\'t tell us the truth. The media won\'t tell us the truth. But, the people in America know what the truth is. Unfortunately, the Chamber of Commerce and the Wall Street Journal don\'t. And most of these Republicans are busy sucking up to the rich and don\'t care about the workers. You know, I am sick of this nonsense about Donald Trump being the racist here. He\'s the one who was speaking for working class Americans, for African-Americans. How about  have you seen the black teenaged unemployment rate? Why shouldn\'t they be getting those jobs? It\'s Donald Trump who is speaking up for them. And boy, don\'t think Republican voters aren\'t keeping a list of who\'s naughty and nice on denouncing or praising Donald Trump right now.""Coulter also talked about the 2016 presidential race, stating that ""Now I have a new soft spot in my heart for Sen. Ted Cruz. We always knew he was smart. He\'s been bad on legal immigration, in the past he wanted to triple what even Rubio wanted. But, he seems to have burned that bridge. So, I think he\'s going to be pulling ahead in people\'s estimation. But, Jeb Bush, he said illegal immigration was an act of love. Is he saying every act of immigration was an act of love with this guy who murdered that beautiful woman in San Francisco, was that an act of love of Jeb?"" She added that Rick Perry ""was the pioneer of the argument that fences don\'t work, buckets and wheels don\'t work. It\'s  the craziest argument I\'ve ever heard. Have they heard of East Germany and the Soviet Union? They wanted to keep people in, we want to keep people out. Fences work just fine.""She later argued, ""it\'s going to be very easy for someone like a Sen. Ted Cruz or maybe Scott Walker. ... Because this is a big opening. It\'s the same opening Ronald Reagan had when the Republican Party was officially for the Equal Rights Amendment, much of the Republican Party was for gun control, much of the Republican Party was for abortion. They are standing with the elites and the Wall Street crowd. You get one Republican to come along and speak straight about what the people want to hear, and the media is always surprised, \'Oh, he\'s doing so well.\' There\'s a reason Trump is doing well, and I mean, at this point, we just want a Republican who can do math and figure out unless immigrants are voting 51% for Republicans, you\'re losing Republicans and post-1970 immigrant,s legal immigrants are voting 8-2 for the Democrats. So, this is a suicidal strategy. And I think some of the smarter Republicans will wake up and clean up in the primaries.""Coulter concluded, ""It\'s interesting, a lot of these Republicans talk tough when they need our vote, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80%did running against amnesty, but then got to Washington and spent three years pushing amnesty the Republican Party, their base are working class white males and their wives. That\'s when Republicans clean up. That\'s when  the two landslide presidential elections Republicans have won in the last century, Nixon and Reagan, that was appealing directly to that base, and that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing. He\'s enormously popular with the working class. He\'s quite popular with black people who want those jobs.""'"

Trump filed his Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) forms with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump\'s massive wealth. For instance, they have boxes once a certain number is reached that simply state $50 million or more. Many of these boxes have been checked. As an example, if a building owned by Mr. Trump is worth $1.5 billion, the box checked is ""$50,000,000 or more."" Mr. Trump stated, ""First people said I would never run, and I did. Then, they said, I would never file my statement of candidacy with the FEC, and I did. Next, they said I would never file my personal financial disclosure forms. I filed them early despite the fact that I am allowed two 45 days extensions. Now I have surged in the polls and am fighting to Make America Great Again. I look forward to the challenge of winning the presidency and doing a fantastic job for our country. I will make the United States rich and strong and respected again, but also a country with a \'big heart\' toward the care of our people."" Mr. Trump\'s net worth has increased since the more than one year old financial statement produced at his presidential announcement. Real estate values in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and many other places where he owns property have gone up considerably during this period of time. His debt is a very small percentage of value, and at very low interest rates. As of this date, Mr. Trump\'s net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS. Mr. Trump\'s income for the year 2014, as reported in the PFD statement, is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties). In addition, he was successful in choosing multiple stocks which were sold in January 2014. Even though stock market purchases are not something that Mr. Trump has focused on in the past, and while only a small part of his net worth, 40 of the 45 stocks purchased went up in a relatively short period of time, creating a gain of $27,021,471, not including those stocks still remaining in the portfolio which currently have an unrealized gain of over $22 million (schedule attached). Mr. Trump showed almost 500 business entities of which 91% are owned 100% by him. Mr. Trump wrote Trump: The Art of the Deal, one of the bestselling business books of all time, and numerous other bestsellers over the years.

Donald Trump,R,p,"July 24, 2015",b'Press Release - The Silent Majority Has Awakened!',"b""Have you seentoday's poll? What about this Fox poll? We are in first place! All the polls confirm it! We continue to prove we are ready to take our country back and, more than any other candidate; we have the support of the people. Yesterday I traveled to Laredo, Texas to visit the border and meet with local law enforcement officials. We discussed the need for stronger border security and the importance of continuing the national discussion on this issue. Strengthening our border will most benefit legal immigrants and working class Americans. Continuing to allow illegal immigrants to cross a weak border is hurting America's economy.Many politicians in Washington talk about the border but have no idea how dangerous it really is. I went to the border to make sure the American people have the opportunity to see the truth.Meeting with Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz, City Manager Jesus Olivares, and the Laredo Police DepartmentEarlier this week I hosted my South Carolina campaign kickoff. Hundreds of veterans came to watch my speech. I announced the launch of a new hotline, 855  VETS  352, and email address, [emailprotected], for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration. The way veterans are being treated in our country is a disgrace and I am the candidate that will fix it.Meeting with veterans in South CarolinaI made a campaign stop in Nevada to speak at Freedom Fest. In front of 2,000 energized conservatives I made a pledge that I will remake today; as President I will restore the American free market and ensure that companies are incentivized to bring factories and jobs back to American soil.Speaking at Freedom FestI also traveled to Phoenix to host a rally.15,000 people showed up. It was an incredible testament to the deep commitment of the American people to restoring American greatness. We have stayed silent for far too longwatching bad policies wreak havoc on our economy and our nation. I will take care of our veterans, rebuild our military, and secure our borders.Our incredible crowd in Phoenix, AZMost politicians would have backed down after being relentlessly targeted by the media.I will never stop speaking out on behalf of all Americans.We have been bringing our message across America over the past several weeks. In California I met withthe families of six victims who were killed by illegal aliens. Each family shared their story. It was a heartbreaking reminder of why we must secure our border  to make sure no more Americans are senselessly killed by illegal aliens.Our unprotected border is a threat to the stability of our economy, the personal safety of Americans, and our national security. Too many American lives have been lost because our leaders refuse to secure the border.Standing with the families of victimsI also filed myFEC financial disclosure form. I have spent my life building businesses in large American cities and small American towns. I will use my experience to put Americans back to work  and the polls prove that the people know I am the only one who can do it.Some of our enthusiastic supportersThis campaign is about changing Washington. We need to once again have a government that is of the people, for the people and by the people.We will make America Great Again!"""

Trump Addresses Highly Detrimental Currency Manipulation(New York, NY) November 10th, 2015- Donald J. Trump today unveiled his most recent policy on trade reforms, highlighting his position in a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled Ending China\'s Currency Manipulation. Mr. Trump has consistently been a strong critic of these tactics that prohibit fair trade and have been largely neglected by the all talk, no action politicians that have failed us for far too long. Mr. Trumpoutlines common sense solutions to address the major threat of currency manipulation and trade reforms that will Make America Great Again.How We Got Here: Washington Politicians Let China Off The HookIn January 2000, President Bill Clinton boldly promised China\'s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (WTO) ""is a good deal for America. Our products will gain better access to China\'s market, and every sector from agriculture, to telecommunications, to automobiles. But China gains no new market access to the United States."" None of what President Clinton promised came true. Since China joined the WTO, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was not a good deal for America then and it\'s a bad deal now. It is a typical example of how politicians in Washington have failed our country.The most important component of our China policy is leadership and strength at the negotiating table. We have been too afraid to protect and advance American interests and to challenge China to live up to its obligations. We need smart negotiators who will serve the interests of American workers - not Wall Street insiders that want to move U.S. manufacturing and investment offshore.The Goal Of The Trump Plan: Fighting For American Businesses And WorkersAmerica has always been a trading nation. Under the Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade. Our goal is not protectionism but accountability. America fully opened its markets to China but China has not reciprocated. Its Great Wall of Protectionism uses unlawful tariff and non-tariff barriers to keep American companies out of China and to tilt the playing field in their favor.If you give American workers a level playing field, they will win. At its heart, this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China. The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality.When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over. We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete. The Trump Plan Will Achieve The Following Goals:1. Bring China to the bargaining table by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator.2. Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to China\'s market.3. Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing by putting an end to China\'s illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers.4. Strengthen our negotiating position by lowering our corporate tax rate to keep American companies and jobs here at home, attacking our debt and deficit so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and bolstering the U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism.The entire plan can be viewed here:www.DonaldJTrump.com/positions/us-china-trade-reform.'"

The ads are part of a $300,000 buy announced earlier this month and feature Mr. Trump, Campaign Co-Chair and Iowa Republican Sam Clovis, New Hampshire resident and Trump for President supporter, Louise Buck.With recent events putting an added emphasis on illegal immigration, homeland security, strengthening our military, and defeating ISIS, which have been cornerstones of Mr. Trump\'s campaign since its inception, the ads highlight his vision, leadership and competency.Mr. Trump stated, ""We must address Islamic terrorism and protect our country first. I will lead by example, as I always have, by vowing to defeat ISIS, stop illegal immigration and the Syrian refugee program, secure our border and bring real change to Washington, D.C. I am the only one who can Make America Great Again.""The ads stress the need for real change in Washington, D.C. in order to address problems created by the ""all talk, no action politicians"" that have failed American\'s for far too long. Mr. Trump reminds voters he is self-funding his campaign, unlike all the other republican candidates who are funded by scam Super PAC\'s, lobbyists, and special interests. His financial independence and proven leadership as a job creator and businessman with a hugely successful career built on real results serve as yet another major distinction.Sam Clovis is an Iowa based conservative serving as national Co-Chair for the campaign. He describes Mr. Trump\'s candidacy as historical and reinforces Mr. Trump\'s unparalleled success and proven capability to get things done. Louise Buck is a New Hampshire resident who voices her concerns about homeland security and her support for Mr. Trump as the only choice for a Commander in Chief that will protect American families first.The new advertisements can be heard at:www.donaldjtrump.com/media/category/ads.'"

Donald Trump,R,p,"November 18, 2015","b'Press Release - Fox News Poll: Trump Rules GOP Race in New Hampshire, Sanders by 1 over Clinton'","b'Fox NewsDonald Trump leads the race for the Republican nomination in New Hampshire, while Bernie Sanders edges Hillary Clinton among Democrats.That\'s according to the latest Fox News poll, released Wednesday, and conducted since Friday\'s terrorist attacks in Paris.Trump leads with 27 percent of New Hampshire Republican primary voters. Marco Rubio receives the support of 13 percent, just above Ted Cruz at 11 percent. That\'s it for the double-digit candidates.CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTSJeb Bush and Ben Carson garner 9 percent each, followed by John Kasich at 7 percent and Chris Christie at 6 percent. Just three percent back Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul, while Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum get one percent each. There are differences in how some candidates are doing in New Hampshire versus their recent national standing (pre-Paris). For example, Carson is Trump\'s closest competitor nationally, yet he doesn\'t break double digits here. And the reverse is true for Bush, Christie and Kasich, who do better in New Hampshire than nationally.The poll, however, also shows that the race is in flux: 55 percent of GOP primary voters say they could change their mind before February\'s balloting. Less than half, 44 percent, feel certain of their choice. When asked about their second choice candidate, GOP primary voters put Carson at the top of the list at 16 percent. Rubio is close behind at 13 percent and Trump at 11 percent.When first and second-choice preferences are combined, Trump (38 percent) and Rubio (26 percent) are still at the top. However, Carson (25 percent) moves above Cruz (20 percent) and Bush (16 percent).The favorites among those NH GOP primary voters who identify as ""very"" conservative are Cruz (27 percent), Trump (26 percent), Carson (13 percent) and Rubio (13 percent).Here\'s how the race for the Democratic nomination stands: Sanders has a razor-thin one-point edge over Clinton -- 45-44 percent. Martin O\'Malley gets 5 percent. Sanders can thank younger voters for his edge. Those under age 45 back him by 29 points (59-30 percent). Those ages 45 and over are more likely to support Clinton by 17 points (52-35 percent). Men go for Sanders over Clinton by 49-37 percent. Among women, the vote divides 48 percent for Clinton vs. 42 percent for Sanders. Potential General Election MatchupsAll the candidates remain below 50 percent in the hypothetical matchups tested in this battleground state. Although Trump is the top choice of Republican primary voters, he performs the worst against Clinton in general election ballot tests. Clinton bests Trump by seven points (47-40 percent), Cruz by three points (44-41 percent) and Christie by one (44-43 percent).Clinton and Fiorina tie at 43 percent each. Four Republican candidates come out ahead of the presumptive Democratic nominee: Rubio is ahead by 7 points (47-40 percent), Bush (45-42 percent) and Kasich (43-40 percent) are up by 3 points each, and Carson has a 2-point edge (45-43 percent). President Barack Obama won New Hampshire in both the 2012 presidential election (by 52-46 percent over Republican Mitt Romney) and in 2008 (by 54-45 percent over Republican John McCain).Among New Hampshire voters overall, about 6 in 10 are unhappy with the way things are going in the country today (58 percent), including 31 percent who are ""not at all"" satisfied. Nearly 9 of 10 Republicans are dissatisfied with how things are going (86 percent), compared to 60 percent of independents and 29 percent of Democrats. That dissatisfaction is reflected in Obama\'s performance rating, as more New Hampshire voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (43 percent) of the job he is doing.The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted November 15-17, 2015, by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among a sample of 804 New Hampshire registered voters selected from a statewide voter file. Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, and 5.5 points for Democratic primary voters and 5 points for Republican primary voters. The hypothetical matchups were split sampled, which means each question was only asked of half the sample and the results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 points.'"

But as I learned today, they're also pretty good shots.Their father does not hunt, but both brothers have been hunting since they were kids, introduced to the sport by their maternal grandfather, who encouraged them to embrace the great outdoors during summers spent with him in what was then Czechoslovakia, a life altogether different than the one they lived on Fifth Avenue.And both brothers credit a love of the outdoor for keeping them grounded during that childhood of privilege. They say they know some Americans don't understand the appeal of the sport and especially their fondness for big-game hunting in Africa, which has drawn the ire of online critics. But they are ardent defenders of what they see as the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt: hunting as a pastime complementary to conservation."""

Donald Trump,R,p,"February 2, 2016",b'Press Release - Scott Brown to Endorse Trump',"b'The Washington PostFormer Massachusetts senator Scott P. Brown, a moderate Republican who two years ago ran for Senate in New Hampshire, will endorse Donald Trump at a rally here Tuesday night, one week before the state\'s presidential primary.Brown\'s decision has been closely guarded for days, but it was confirmed by two people familiar with the event, where Brown will appear onstage with the candidate.When reached early Tuesday afternoon, the Trump campaign\'s spokesperson would not discuss the rally or possible guests. Brown was unavailable for comment.Brown\'s move could give Trump a significant boost one day after the mogul lost the Iowa caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Although Brown was defeated in his senatorial bid here, he has been a popular GOP figure in New England ever since his stunning, come-from-behind victory in Massachusetts\'s special election to fill the Senate seat in 2010.Brown is also a favorite of many establishment Republicans because of his centrist positions, including support for abortion rights and for a ban on assault weapons. His profile and personality, however, are blue collar and populist. He drove a pickup truck during his Senate bids and is a habitu of Cheap Trick concerts.On the endorsement front, Brown is the first U.S. senator, current or former, to formally back Trump.In the New Hampshire contest, Trump faces stiff competition not only from Cruz but from a crowd of mainstream Republicans who have strong pockets of support in and have been relentlessly campaigning in the state, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who placed a strong third in Iowa, is another threat.The relationship between Trump and Brown has grown cozy in recent months with a series of meetings and phone calls. At a January event in Portsmouth, N.H., Trump said Brown was cut out of ""central casting"" and could be his vice-presidential pick. Brown called Trump ""the next president of the United States.""Speaking with reporters after the event, Brown said he was weighing three factors as he decided whom to endorse: ""Somebody who is not afraid to make a decision and doesn\'t always follow the polls; sometimes who will be politically incorrect and will do what\'s best for this country. ... Someone also who is not afraid to admit when they\'re wrong."" That somebody is Trump.'"

A wonderful young man, Jamiel Shaw Jr., whose father has become a friend of mine, was shot in the face for no reason by an illegal immigrant. He was getting ready to go to college on a football scholarship and his sole fault was walking home to see his father. Because of the relationship I have established with his father, Jamiel\'s death is very personal to me. We must stop illegal immigration.""Jamiel Shaw added, ""Donald Trump is the only person fighting to put American families first. He will protect our children and put an end to these senseless acts of violence that are caused by our failed policies and broken immigration system. Donald Trump has made it clear he, like most Americans, wants to return the rule of law to the people of this country. Without strong borders we don\'t have a country. Strong border enforcement is the first step to preventing future tragedies. We must secure our borders and return those who came here illegally to their native lands. Donald Trump is a man who stands for what is right. He stands for America and I stand with him.""The ad is currently airing in South Carolina leading up to the February 20th primary contest.

Donald Trump,R,p,"February 15, 2016","b'Press Release - DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. OPED - The Culture of Life'","b'Let me be clearI am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our ""unalienable"" rights.Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed.The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.'"

Trump for the office of President of the United States.In addition to his duties as Secretary of State, Kobach has been one of the nation\'s most prominent advocates of stronger enforcement of immigration laws. He served at the U.S. Department of Justice as Attorney General John Ashcroft\'s chief adviser on immigration law and border security during 2001-03. In that capacity, he designed and implemented the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), which was used to monitor the activities of high-risk aliens in the United States after 9-11. Later, he co-authored Arizona\'s illegal immigration laws of 2007 and 2010. He has helped numerous other states draft state-level laws to reduce illegal immigration. Most notable were Missouri\'s omnibus immigration act of 2008 and Alabama\'s omnibus immigration act of 2011. Since 2012, he has represented in court ICE agents who sued the Obama Administration in an effort to stop Obama\'s executive amnesty of 2012.""I am pleased to announce my support for Mr. Trump."" said Secretary of State Kris Kobach. ""For me, the most important issue in the Republican presidential contest is immigration and its effect on our national security. On that issue Mr. Trump stands head and shoulders above the other candidates. He has made it clear that ramping up the enforcement of our immigration laws will be his top priority. And he has forcefully rejected the notion of giving amnesty to illegal aliens living in the United States.""""Now, more than ever, America needs Mr. Trump\'s aggressive approach to the problem of illegal immigration. Our porous border represents a huge national security threat, and our refugee system has been abused by terrorists in the past and is likely to be abused by ISIS terrorists today. Moreover, there are too many Americans who are out of work because of illegal immigration or who are working in jobs where the wages are depressed because of illegal immigration.""""Finally, on the subject of building the wall on our southern border, Mr. Trump is correct when he says that the United States has the ability to compel Mexico to pay for it. As I have discussed with Mr. Trump, the PATRIOT Act contains a provision that the United States can and should use as leverage with the Government of Mexico. We have the ability to shut down the flow of remittances to Mexico from illegal aliens working in the United States. Mexico will have to make a choice: either make a single payment of $5-10 billion to the United States to pay for the wall, or lose most of the $23 billion in remittances that Mexico receives every year from its nationals working in the United States.""'"

Barrack Jr., Executive Chairman of Colony Capital, and Andy Beal, the most successful and wealthiest investor in the country and the founder of Beal Bank, one of the most profitable banks in America, located in Dallas, Texas. Mr. Trump has received tremendous support from the business community where he is highly regarded for his negotiating, deal-making and unprecedented success in a variety of industries.Mr. Trump stated, ""It is truly an honor to receive the endorsement of two individuals I hold in the highest regard. They are smart, successful and the kind of business leaders our country needs to help negotiate trade deals, create jobs and spur economic development. I am proud to have their support and the support of two business leaders including Carl Icahn.""Tom Barrack is the Executive Chairman of Colony Capital, Inc. and is considered one of the foremost global real estate investors. Mr. Barrack and Mr. Trump have worked together and opposite each other on past deals. They have had a great relationship and share a mutual admiration for their respective accomplishments.Barrack said, ""Donald is one of the smartest and most astute businessmen I have had the pleasure of knowing. His mastery of financial, political and economic intellectual complexity combined with his charm and emotional intelligence when partnering with New York labor unions, governmental regulatory bodies, Wall Street lenders, sophisticated institutional global investors, demanding developers, global media and entertainment companies and hard-working employees, is a dynastic art form. I have invested with Donald in a multitude of transactions over three decades and he has always exceeded my expectations on every measurable metric of excellence. Donald is the only candidate in America who comes to the campaign trail already possessing power, wealth and celebrityship  He does not seek the Presidency to gain those accolades -- he has them. He seeks the Presidency to return those great attributes to America from whom he received them. I am happy to give Donald J. Trump my full endorsement to become the next President of the USA.""Andy Beal of Beal Bank, regarded to as the most successful investor said, ""This country is at a crossroads and needs someone who has the strength of character to pursue ""outside the box"" solutions. I found great opportunity in this country and I want everyone to have access to that same opportunity. I am very concerned that our political system on both sides of the aisle is blocking rather than creating that access to opportunity and is out of touch with the American values that have made America great. Since our inception, our country has always been about creating an environment that fosters opportunity for everyone.""Beal continued, ""Our government has lost sight of that fundamental principle that makes us all Americans. Instead, government keeps growing at the expense of individual opportunity. Since the financial crisis, our government has squandered many trillion of dollars in increased national debt with absolutely nothing to show for it. I don\'t agree with everything that anyone says, but I admire people who are willing to say what they are thinking, without regard to the popularity of the statement. Donald Trump is a man who understands the importance of creating opportunity for everyone and who freely speaks his mind. Donald Trump is the man to lead this nation on a new path and to Make America Great Again. I enthusiastically support Donald Trump for President and believe that your support for Donald is essential to put America back on the path to the greatness, that can only be achieved by embracing individual opportunity for everyone.""Mr. Trump continues to dominate all state and local polls with the most recent national survey from CNN showing Mr. Trump with 49% support ahead of tomorrow\'s Super Tuesday contest.'"

Trump unveiled the latest campaign ad attacking Florida\'s no-show Senator Marco Rubio, to begin airing in Rubio\'s home state of Florida, leading up to next week\'s winner-take-all primary. The latest polls show Mr. Trump with a significant lead in Florida, including the recently released Monmouth survey, showing Mr. Trump with 38% support.Mr. Trump stated, ""Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is a dishonest person. He has cheated with credit cards, and does favors for lobbyists. In my opinion, he is a total crook and I am doing the people of Florida a great favor by further exposing him. In addition to everything else, he is an absentee Senator with one of the worst voting records in the history of the United States Senate, instead preferring to spend his time begging for campaign contributions. He takes his orders from the Republican establishment and Super PACs who are spending millions of dollars to keep their puppet alive and well so he will continue to do what they say. Former Prosecutor and now Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, exposed him on the debate stage for being what he is - a choke artist. We are now going a step further.""Marco Rubio has violated numerous campaign promises, including on amnesty, betraying every Florida voter. Rubio is well-known in Washington as nothing more than a ""yes-man"" for his corporate benefactors. A vote for Rubio is a vote to put Rubio\'s donors in charge of the country. A close investigation of Senator Rubio\'s friends and finances will reveal that he is one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C.

Donald Trump offers the only vision of how to change the path we are on. He has shown a remarkable ability to get things done in the face of seemingly impossible obstructions. No one else in this race has negotiated more successfully than he has in advancing towards a stated goal. He has the wherewithal to go the distance while ignoring the legions of bandit lobbyists in Washington DC and their robber baron bosses from Wall Street. He is unbowed by political correctness and unafraid of the Clinton Machine. He understands the geopolitical peril we face and will rebuild America's reputation and military. He knows the deep debt we owe our veterans. He understands the enormous responsibility of leading America. He understands that he is the President of the whole country. He understands that the decisions he makes will directly affect every American for generations to come. He has learned how to make crucial decisions in a career spanning decades, decisions where if you're wrong then you're out of business, compared to giving eloquent speeches from the safety of the Senate floor. I am proud to endorse his candidacy and to be a volunteer in his campaign, and I look forward to his election as the next President of the United States."""

He has been an outspoken candidate on the need for a Secure Border and for this we are grateful.The American public has continually called for a secure border and Donald Trump has promised to make this desire a reality.

Mr. Manafort is volunteering his considerable insight and expertise because of his belief that Mr. Trump is the right person for these difficult times.

Donald Trump,R,p,"March 30, 2016","b""Press Release - America's Border Patrol AgentsIssue Historic Letter of Endorsement For Donald J. Trump""","b'(WISCONSIN) March 30th, 2016 - America\'s Border Patrol Agents broke with their long-standing non-endorsement policy to issue their first-ever endorsement in a presidential primary. The letter from their official union, the National Border Patrol Council, endorsing Donald J. Trump for President, follows below:""The National Border Patrol Council is the official organization representing our nation\'s Border Patrol Agents. We represent 16,500 agents who selflessly serve this country in an environment where our own political leaders try to keep us from doing our jobs. The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries. We will not, however, shy away from voicing our opinions as it pertains to border security and the men and women of the United States Border Patrol. As such, we are breaking with our past practice and giving our first-ever endorsement in a presidential primary. We think it is that important: if we do not secure our borders, American communities will continue to suffer at the hands of gangs, cartels and violent criminals preying on the innocent. The lives and security of the American people are at stake, and the National Border Patrol Council will not sit on the sidelines.As an organization we expect our elected officials to aggressively pursue the interests of the country. America has already tried a young, articulate freshman senator who never created a job as an attorney and under whose watch criminal cartels have been given the freest border reign ever known.Unlike his opponents, Donald Trump is not a career politician, he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs, pledged to bring about aggressive pro-American change, and who is completely independent of special interests. We don\'t need a person who has the perfect Washington-approved tone, and certainly NOT another establishment politician in the White House. Indeed, the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump\'s tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells us everything we need to know about the corruption in Washington.We need a person in the White House who doesn\'t fear the media, who doesn\'t embrace political correctness, who doesn\'t need the money, who is familiar with success, who won\'t bow to foreign dictators, who is pro-military and values law enforcement, and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations. Donald Trump is such a man.Mr. Trump is as bold and outspoken as other world leaders who put their country\'s interests ahead of all else. Americans deserve to benefit for once instead of always paying and apologizing. Our current political establishment has bled this country dry, sees their power evaporating, and isn\'t listening to voters who do all the heavy lifting. Trump is opposed by the established powers specifically because they know he is the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.You can judge a man by his opponents: all the people responsible for the problems plaguing America today are opposing Mr. Trump. It is those without political power  the workers, the law enforcement officers, the everyday families and community members  who are supporting Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump will take on special interests and embrace the ideas of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management yes-men who say whatever they are programmed to say. This is a refreshing change that we have not seen before  and may never see again. Mr. Trump is correct when he says immigration wouldn\'t be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadn\'t made some bold and necessary statements. And when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of a man. When the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States.There is no greater physical or economic threat to Americans today than our open border. And there is no greater political threat than the control of Washington by special interests. In view of these threats, the National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald J. Trump for President  and asks the American people to support Mr. Trump in his mission to finally secure the border of the United States of America, before it is too late.""In response, Donald J. Trump provided the following statement: Statement on Receiving Historic Endorsement From America\'s Border Patrol Agents'"

His message of hope and prosperity has captured the imagination of millions of Republicans, Democrats and Independents. His vision provides an historic opportunity to unify our people and break through old battle lines to enable the greatness of America to arise again.Donald Trump cares that working Americans are hurting, he understands the policy errors that have caused it to happen, and importantly, he is determined to use all his strength and skill to get us on the right track again.There is so much that must be done  and done before it\'s too late. Donald Trump will only negotiate trade deals that benefit America. He will execute a wise, realistic foreign policy that brings peace through strength. He will finally respect and respond to the American people\'s demand for a lawful immigration system that serves America\'s interests. He will nominate judges of great ability who know they serve under the laws and Constitution, and are not above them. He will sign legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, not veto it. He will produce a tax code that is fair to all and promotes jobs and better wages. He will stop wasteful Washington spending and restore fiscal sanity.The choice could not be clearer. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for a failed status quo that for too long has put the special interests ahead of the people\'s interests.

Trump at a June 11 Tampa Republican Rally (Lakeland). As a testament to the hard work for the Republican Party provided by Republican Women throughout Florida and across the nation, Dena Stebbins DeCamp, president of the largest conservative women\'s organization in the state, the Florida Federation of Republican Women, was tapped to help introduce the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party for President, Donald J. Trump, at a Trump rally on June 11 at the Tampa Convention Center. This honor also serves as a testament to Federation members across Florida who have unparalleled, proven success in Getting Out the Vote. In her proudest voice, she announced, ""I am pleased to tell you today that the Florida Federation of Republican Women is proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America."" Her remarks were also historic because, ""This is the first time in the organization\'s 65 year history that a state Federation President has been so honored, a long-overdue recognition of the nation-wide work tens of thousands of women do day in and day out to advance the goals of the Republican Party,"" DeCamp advised.In Florida, more than 60 federations across the state report to Ms. Decamp, who is also a Director of the National Federation of Republican Women headquartered outside of Washington, D.C., and one of 28 Florida Federation members across the state who have been elected by their peers as delegates to the Republican Convention being held July 18-21 in Cleveland, Ohio. In Florida, delegates are selected based upon their work on behalf of the Republican Party overall; not their political views. Ms. DeCamp told the crowd, ""this year we already have a Winner! Mr. Trump\'s non-traditional campaign style and message resonates with voters both here in Florida and throughout the nation. His primary results are historic; he has broken all turnout records, and we expect a huge turnout for him again in the November General Election!"" She said women are already working hard across the nation to spread the truth and get him elected. She told the audience the real truth about the so-called ""War on Women"". She said, ""there is no war on women in the Republican Party; women are fully engaged and involved. The most shameful war on women is the one Hillary Clinton has waged on her husband\'s girlfriends\'. Furthermore, Hilary Clinton has a disgraceful record of bullying, lying, cheating and hanging on to her husband\'s coat tails to advance her personal agenda. Informed American women will not be fooled by a candidate who disgraced our state department, refuses to hold press conferences and hides behind her husband,"" she concluded. Ms. Decamp also began to dispel the myth that the Republican Party is not inclusive. ""This is just plain nonsense, a fairy tale fabricated by Democrats,"" and added ""here in Florida, I\'m proud to announce today that three minority women in our membership have recently qualified by petition to run for the U.S. Congress in Florida."" As state president, national federation director, and Republican delegate to the National Republican Convention, Ms. DeCamp left no doubt that the next five months will be a full-court press to see that Donald J. Trump is the next president of the United States. She pledged that she and the federation members will leave no stone unturned to assure that the State of Florida is painted ""Red."" #### DeCamp contact info:Dena Stebbins DeCamp Email: [emailprotected]Phone: 863-640-4805'"

Donald Trump,R,p,"June 21, 2016",b'Press Release - Mark Zandi Is An Obama Adviser And Clinton Donor',"b""The lead author of Moody's report, Mark Zandi, was a cheerleader for Obama's stimulus and has regularly appeared before congressional committees on behalf of Democrats. Mr. Zandi, a Democrat, is a maxed-out Hillary donor. http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tom-blumer/2016/03/30/imagine-mark-zandi-economys-head-cheerleader-donated-max-hillary Zandi believes the stimulus worked, but his forecast was way off the mark. In 2009, he claimed that in 2012 we would have 141.4 million payroll jobs if stimulus passed and only 135.8 million without it. In 2012, there were 134.2 million payroll jobs (annual average) or 134.9 million (4th quarter over 4th quarter). Zandi's stimulus projection was not achieved until the 2nd quarter of 2015. Zandi's forecasts for GDP growth were also wildly off. He projected that with the stimulus the economy would grow by 9.1 percent from 2008 through 2012. Actual growth, however, was 3.5 percent over the four years. Zandi's analysis of the Trump plan is based on the same model, which, as shown above, is notably horrible at forecasting and providing policy guidance. Such models assume little or no benefit from tax rate cuts and were used to oppose Reagan's 1986 tax cut and Bush's 2003 tax cut. Zandi believes Food Stamps and Unemployment insurance provide more stimulus than tax cuts or infrastructure spending (see attached chart). The analysis assumes little or no productivity boost from better trade deals, from drawing more Americans into the labor force, and from freeing business from onerous regulations. There's almost no recognition of the importance of new business formation (which has ground down) to job growth and increases in median incomes, and it completely ignores the millions of jobs that will be created through energy policy changes There's no acknowledgment in the report that current policies have caused business investment to disappear and that Trump's effort to battle the establishment and strengthen the rule of law will aggressively attract new business investment (from inside the U.S. and from all over the world). Zandi's analysis warns about the tightening of the labor mark from immigration control, yet admits this will boost wages and incomes for American workers. Zandi's analysis assumes large Fed rate hikes  to 4% in 2017 and 6.3% in 2018, up from 2% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 in the baseline scenario  as a result of large deficits. It is unclear that the Federal Reserve would need increase rates to these levels to prevent overheating in an economy that many fear could slide into recession in the next year. On this alone, the report should be put in the trash can. Zandi admits the arbitrariness of the assumptions by providing three different scenarios. Under the scenario that assumes enacted legislation negotiated with the Congress, the federal budget deficit in 2026 is $1.4 trillion--only some $100 billion higher than Zandi's baseline scenario of $1.3 trillion. Considering that the campaign does not have a complete fiscal plan yet, it is remarkable that Moody's likely scenario leads to deficits that are relatively close to baseline. Given the imprecision of estimates for fiscal results 10 years into the future, that difference is not material. One could equally conclude from the report that the Trump policies would do no harm rather than the great harm portrayed by Hillary Clinton in citing Zandi's analysis. What has the Hillary/Obama economic policy given us  the weakest recovery on record! Since the recession ended, real GDP has grown at an annual rate of just 2.1 percent. Other recoveries since 1960 averaged 3.8 percent over the comparable period. GDP would be $2.0 trillion (real)/$2.2 trillion (nominal) larger if the recovery had only been average. Cumulative lost economic output (real GDP) compared with average recovery is $8.0 trillion. Private-sector payrolls have grown by 12.3 percent since the end of the recession. Average recovery post-1960 over a comparable time frame was 16.3 percent. Average growth would have yielded an additional 5.8 million private-sector jobs than has been achieved under Hillary/Obama. Even from the cycle low in February 2010 (Obama's cherry-picking of date), this recovery comes up 2.9 million short.

Delegate Beau Correll, Jr., had brought the suit against the Commonwealth of Virginia hoping to reject the will of the voters, but was soundly defeated.Specifically, the Court found that RNC Rule 16, which binds delegates based on their election results, ""is in effect presently and that it controls the allocation and binding of delegates as to their voting at convention.""

(p. 7)Further, the Court found that by signing the ""Declaration and Statement of Qualification,"" RNC delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16(c)(2) (p. 10), and that this Declaration obligated Correll to vote in accordance with Republican Party rules and Virginia\'s election results. (p. 46)Trump Campaign Attorney and former FEC Chairman Don McGahn issued the following statement:""The court has confirmed what we have said all along: Rule 16 is in effect and thus delegates, including Correll, are bound to vote in accordance with the election results.
