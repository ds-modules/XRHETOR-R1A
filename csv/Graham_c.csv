Lindsey Graham,R,c,"June 1, 2015","b'Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Central, South Carolina'","b'Thank you.I am lucky to have Darlene as my sister. I\'m lucky to have Verna Mae and Hollis as my aunt and uncle who took care of me. To all my family and all my friends, thank you.Welcome to Central, South Carolina. My hometown. Many of you have known me for a long time. I\'m not aging that well, am I? Some of you have known me since my family lived in the back of the bar in that building. But I\'m pretty sure no one here, including me, ever expected to hear me say, ""I\'m Lindsey Graham and I\'m running for President of the United States.""Thank you.Audience Member: Over here.Graham: Oh, yeah, OK. I\'ll turn back there. I hope they hear that all over the worldthat I\'m running for President of the United States. It\'s because of you that I can make that statement. Everything I am, everything I will be, I owe to the kindness and generosity and example of people of Central, Clemson, Seneca, Walhalla, and other small towns throughout South Carolina. Thank you. Thank you for everything. I want to be President to protect our nation that we all love so much. So get ready, I\'m ready. [laughter] I want to be President to defeat the enemies that are trying to kill us, not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them. Ronald Reagan\'s policy of peace through strength kept America safe during the Cold War. Remember those times?Audience Member: Yep.Graham: But I\'ve come to conclude we will never enjoy peaceful coexistence with radical Islam because its followers intend to destroy our way of life. However, America can be and will be secure only if we have strength. Security through strength will protect us. I want to be President to meet our problems head-on, honestly and realistically, for the purpose of solving them, not hiding them or taking political advantage of them. Graham: I want to be President to make government work for you not the other way around. Audience: Amen. Amen. [applause]I want to make government keeps (sic) its promises to you, to support your dreams, to embrace your values, and to reflect your character. I want to be President to help us build a future greater than our amazing past. And I will work with anyone to do it.  We\'ve made some dangerous mistakes in recent years. The Obama administration and some of my colleagues in Congress have substituted wishful thinking for sound national security strategy. Audience Member: Yes, they have.Audience Member: Yeah, you\'ve got that right.Graham: Every day the headlines attest to the failures of the Obama-Clinton policies.Audience Member: That\'s right.Graham: It is sad for me to report to you, but Barack Obama has made us less safe. Simply put, radical Islam is running wild. They have more safe havens, more money, more capability, and more weapons to strike our homeland than any time since 9/11. They are large. They are rich. They\'re entrenched. As President, I will make them small, poor, and on the run. I\'m afraid some Americans have grown tired of fighting them. I have some bad news to share with you. The radical Islamists are not tired of fighting you...In partnership with others, we must take the fight to them, building lines of defenses over there so they can\'t come here. Building up and supporting regional forces to go after their safe havens that could be used to attack our homeland. The world is exploding in terror and violence. But the biggest threat of all is the nuclear ambitions of the radical Islamists who control Iran. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no moderates in Iran running their government. If the United States isn\'t firm in our intention to deny them such weapons, Iran will trigger a nuclear arms race in the least stable region on Earth, making it more likely the people who aspire to genocide will have the most effective means to commit it.,... Our close ally, Israel, is at risk as a result of Obama\'s failed leadership. With Israel we share values, we share democracy, and our friendship is unbreakable. To our friends in Israel, I will never abandon you. I will always stand firm in supporting the one and only Jewish state. I, too, say ""never again."" I\'m running for President because I have the experience, the judgment and the will to deny the most radical regimes the most dangerous weapons. But to defeat this enemy, it will require more than military might. The most powerful weapon in our arsenal isn\'t a gun; it\'s an idea. The terrorists are selling a glorious death. We must sell a hopeful life. I\'ve learned from my travels that a small school house in a remote region educating a young girl can do more damage to radical Islam than any weapon we possess. However, radical Islam is not the only threat we face. Elsewhere, old adversaries are seizing opportunities to challenge our interests. Putin seized Ukrainian territory and threatens NATO allies. China is building  literally building  their own islands in resource-rich waters claimed by other nations and challenging free navigation to the seas. Our allies feel the absence of American leadership. Our adversaries are taking advantage. American weakness anywhere hurts us everywhere.Our enemies are emboldened and our friends are going it alone. Both reactions are detrimental to our national security interest. It is time for America to come back, and come back, we will. And the way you come back is to make sure that the next President must be an informed and decisive Commander-in-Chief, ready immediately to deal with the threats I\'ve just described. We\'ve learned over the past six years that speeches alone won\'t make us safe. If that were true, we\'d be really safe. Superior power and resolve is the only way to be safe. I\'m running for President of the United States because I am ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one. I am ready on day one to defend our nation with sound strategy, a strong military, stable alliances, and a steady determination. I\'ve been to the Middle East more times than I can count As a United States Senator and a reserve officer in the United States Air Force. To all who have served our country, raise your hand. God bless each and every one of you. [applause]I\'ve got one simple message: I have more experience with our national security than any other candidate in this race. That includes you, Hillary. [Laughter] We will have a reset with Russia that sticks.I know the players; I know our friends and I know our enemies alike, but most importantly, ladies and gentlemen, they know me.I have listened, learned and prepared myself for the job of Commander-in-Chief. I\'ve served in the Air Force for 33 years. And it has been a true pleasure and honor. I\'ve spent much of my adult life as part of a team committed to defending America, protecting our way of life, making sure that we\'re safe. Politicians focus on elections. The military focuses on the mission. If given the privilege to serve as your President, I\'ll focus on the mission to defend America, to protect our way of life, and to leave the next generation a stronger, safer, better nation than we inherited. That will not be easy. It never has. There are dangers that must be faced. And as usual, the best of us will have to face the worst of them. The best of us are the 1% of Americans who are the men and women of the United States armed forces. I cannot promise as Commander-in-Chief that their dangers that they confront will be less, the risks they run, the sacrifices they make, will be fewer or easier. But I can assure them they will have the leadership to defeat our enemies. I can promise them their sacrifices won\'t be wasted and they won\'t fight with their hands tied behind their backs. We will end this conflict on our terms. We will win. Those who believe we can disengage from the world at large and safe  and be safe by leading from behind  vote for someone else; I am not your man. Those who believe the best way to defend ourselves is to lead the world, to make history rather than be overwhelmed by itI ask for your support. Join me if you want to tackle the problems at home that have been kicked down the road because they\'re too hard to fix or too easy to demagogue. Washington\'s failure to do the hard but right thing has put Social Security and Medicare in serious jeopardy. Anybody on Social Security and Medicare? Anybody want to be on Social Security and Medicare one day? All of us. As my generation retires, both programs are on track to go bust. We\'re living longer, and fewer workers are supporting more retirees. That\'s unsustainable. Everybody knows it, but not everybody will admit it. We have to fix entitlement programs to make sure people who need the benefits the most receive them. That\'s going to require determined presidential leadership. I know from personal experience how important these programs are to the lives of millions of Americans. As Darlene mentioned, we lost our parents when I was a young man and she was in middle school. We depended on Social Security benefits to survive. I\'ve been fortunate. I\'ve done better than I ever dreamed. If I and others like me have to take a little bit less, and pay a little more to help those who need it most, so be it. And younger people, you may just have to work a little bit longer.Audience: Yeah.Graham: As president, I\'ll gladly do what it takes to save the program that once saved my family. Now, to those of you who earn for  yearn for a healthy and safe environment, I will join your cause. To those who seek energy independence, I will be your champion. I am tired of sending hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas to buy oil from people who hate us. We must have energy independenceAudience Member: Right.Graham: And I believe, in the process it\'s possible to produce a safe, clean environment and create new, well-paying jobs for Americans of all generations.To my fellow Republicans, I\'ll be a champion for limited and effective government and a strong national defense. I\'ll be a voice for social conservative values without apologyAudience: Yes.Graham: ... or animosity. I love my party. I am committed to see it grow and prosper.To my friends in the other party, on the big things we share a common fate. I\'ll work with you to strengthen the country we both love. Our differences are real and we\'ll debate them. But you\'re not my enemy; you\'re my fellow countrymen. My enemies are those who despise our shared values. The enemies of enlightenment; the culture of death that seeks to destroy the dignity of life. We\'ll fight them together with our partners and we\'ll win. To Americans who trust neither party, I will seek the political common ground our nation so desperately needs to find.Audience Member: Yup. [applause]Graham: That\'s what I\'ve done before. Don\'t take my word for it. Examine my record. I\'ve got the scars to prove it. I intend to be a President not of a single party, but of a nation.Audience: Amen. Graham: I want to do more than make big government smaller. I want to help make a great nation greater. I\'ve traveled the world and had experiences and opportunities I never dreamed of. I\'ve been lucky so much in my life but never luckier than in the people and place I come from. Those of you who\'ve known me for a long time know I\'ve had some ups and downs. As a young man, I lost my parents, struggled financially and emotionally, and I would not have made it through those times without you, and the example my parents set for me. There are a lot of so-called ""self-made"" people in this worldI am not one of them. My family, my friends, neighbors and my faith picked me up when I was down, believed in me when I had doubts. You\'ve made me the man I am today. I\'m a man with many debts to my family, my friends, to you, to South Carolina, to the country. I\'m running for President to repay those debts and to fight as hard for you as you\'ve fought for me. In the end, ladies and gentlemen, that\'s the only promise I can make and it\'s the only pledge I will sign, the only one that matters. If you make me President, I\'ll fight each day harder than I\'ve fought the day before to keep this country safe, prosperous, and as good as the people who made it great. I humbly ask for your support and your vote. I will work every day to make you proud.God bless. [James Brown recording of ""I Feel Good""]'"
Lindsey Graham,R,c,"July 8, 2015","b'Remarks to the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC'","b'I would like to thank the Atlantic Council for hosting me.Today\'s event comes while the United States is at a crossroads.? We have had six years of failed leadership under President Barack Obama, and he shows no signs of changing course. As recently as Monday of this week, he claimed that our strategy against ISIL is working and that we\'re more prepared to deal with major attacks against the homeland. The president constantly oversells our successes and minimizes the threats that our nation faces. There is no coherent strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL, and there are more radical Islamic groups with the capacity and desire to strike our homeland than at any time since 9-11. Our defenses are being overwhelmed by the number of threats. And as the threats grow we continue to cut our budget and embrace strategies that are designed not to destroy ISIL but to pass this problem along to the next president. Simply put, President Obama\'s foreign policy has been a disaster, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of its chief architects.The upcoming presidential election presents Americans with a real choice. For a few, turning our backs to the world as Rand Paul is proposing may be attractive. Others may want to continue down the Obama-Clinton path of appeasement in an effort to avoid conflict.? If so, Hillary Clinton is your clear choice.? I would argue that both of these options pose a great threat to the American homeland, and I am here to present another path. One in which we can restore our relationship with friends like Israel, bolster allies such as those in NATO, and let foes like Iran know that when an American president speaks, they need to be taken seriously.? A path in which we achieve security through strength.Ronald Reagan pursued a path of peace through strength. He understood that peace could be achieved by standing strong in the face of Soviet expansionism, building our capabilities at all levels, and recognizing the power of mutually assured destruction. His determination in pursuit of this path led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.However, this approach assumed a rationality that is lacking in Radical Islam. I have come to conclude we can never achieve peace through strength with this ideology. It is driven by a religious doctrine that does not embrace coexistence, compromise, or tolerance. They are offering a glorious death to their followers. We must offer a hopeful life instead.While we may not enjoy peace with Radical Islam, if we purse the path that I am outlining, we can achieve security. We can build a coalition that will lead to the defeat of ISIL and the forces of Radical Islam.Simply put, we have to provide superior capability, overwhelming capacity and, most important of all, determined will. These are the elements of any successful foreign policy. And yet, in the Obama-Clinton era, we are lacking each one.We have reduced our capability through blind and insane defense cuts under sequestration. We have diminished our capacity to secure our nation with an older and smaller fighting force at a time when we need a modern and robust military more than ever.As for determined will, President Obama  with Hillary Clinton by his side consistently blinked in the face of grave threats. He led from behind during the Arab Spring. In Syria he failed to enforce redlines, provide no-fly zones, or arm the Free Syrian Army. He responded passively to Putin\'s land grab in Ukraine, and prematurely withdrew from Iraq. Throughout their tenure, Barak Obama and Hillary Clinton have consistently failed to understand the nature of the threats we face, develop comprehensive strategies for securing our nation, or confront our enemies head-on. They have acquiesced to our adversaries and alienated our allies. They have made critical decisions based not on circumstances on the ground, but on political calculations. The net effect of this approach has been to embolden the forces of violence and chaos, to disquiet the forces of security and stability, and ultimately leave our nation less secure. All of these failures have created fallout that will take decades to clean up.Nowhere is this more evident than in the resurgence of Iran.? I truly believe that Iran with a nuclear capability is the greatest threat the world will know in my lifetime. We are seemingly moments away from the completion of a nuclear deal that will make Iran flush with cash at the start and leave Iran a nuclear threshold state at the end.? As recently as two years ago, Tehran was suffocating under a sanctions regime that Congress forced the Administration to support.? As Iran\'s currency tumbled, Tehran was forced to the nuclear negotiating table.? Backed by UN Security Council resolutions, the Administration entered into negotiations with a mandate to dismantle Iran\'s nuclear program.? Now at the end of the negotiations, we have backed off almost every single one of our negotiating objectives.From the very start of the emerging agreement, Iran will immediately receive over a hundred billion dollars in sanctions relief as frozen assets are allowed back into Tehran.? While the deal is in place, they will not be subject to anytime, anywhere inspections or be required to come clean on the Possible Military Dimensions of their nuclear program.? And at the end of the agreement, Iran will be a nuclear threshold state, without being forced to change their behavior for a day.During these negotiations, Iran became strengthened and emboldened, now effectively controlling the capitals in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.? In the words of the newest State Department Country reports on Terrorism, ""in 2014, Iran\'s state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide remained undiminishedincluding support for Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, Lebanese Hezbollah, and various groups in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.""? The report goes on: ""Iran continued to provide arms, financing, training, and the facilitation of primarily Iraqi Shia and Afghan fighters to support the Assad regime\'s brutal crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of at least 191,000 people in Syria.""? Keep in mind, this is the ""new"" Iran under the ""moderate leadership"" of President Rouhani.If Iran was able to do this under the yoke of sanctions, imagine what the region will look like as capital flows into the country.A good deal with Iran would be a game changer in the Middle East, but that deal must include anytime, anywhere inspections, sanctions relief only AFTER Iran complies with the terms of a deal, and restrictions on their nuclear activities until Iran has a demonstrated change in behavior.?We must also get a full accounting of the Possible Military Dimensions of Iran\'s past nuclear activity. Only by gaining a clear picture of the full scope of Iran\'s past actions will we be able to put in place an effective inspections regime.A bad deal, however, will increase the likelihood of war with Iran. It will dramatically raise the threat level against the State of Israel, lead to a regional arms race, and enrich terrorist regimes in the region. An emboldened and strengthened Iran is not just a grave threat to the region, but poses a direct threat to the United States as well. Because of its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, who toppled the pro-U.S. government in Sanaa, we have lost our ability to monitor Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the world\'s most lethal groups that aspires to hit our homeland.By propping up Assad and prolonging the brutal conflict in Syria, Iran is putting unsustainable pressure on Lebanon and, even more distressingly, on Jordan. If the King of Jordan were to fall, the consequences for the security of the region and the U.S. would be incalculable. It would increase the reach and capacity of ISIL to a staggering degree, creating a terrorist launching pad against the U.S. that we can hardly imagine.These are the consequences of Iran\'s rising influence in the region. And yet, the brink of an enriched and empowered Iran is precisely where the Obama-Clinton Doctrine has put us today.The resurgence of Radical Islam in the region further threatens our interests both at home and abroad. And it is further evidence of the Obama-Clinton failures. While this scourge was far from eradicated in 2009, it had lost its momentum. The surge in Iraq was a military and political success, putting al Qaeda on the run with the strong engagement of Sunni leaders in Anbar Province. ISIL was a small force with minimal reach. The moderates who make up the vast majority of the Muslim world were steadily reclaiming the initiative throughout the Middle East. Those hard-fought gains were no accident of history. They were achieved through the enormous sacrifices of U.S. troops. Their undoing is no accident either, but comes as a direct result of President Obama\'s refusal to heed the advice of military commanders in 2011, choosing instead to fulfill a campaign promise and withdraw every last U.S. service member.When President Obama made this decision, the warning signs were already evident. In April of 2011, I begged and pleaded with the White House to leave behind 10-15,000 troops. Otherwise, as I said then, ""Iraq could go to hell.""? I also said that, ""this is a defining moment in the future of Iraq and in my view they are going down the wrong road.""? Through the summer of 2011, I advocated that President Obama reverse course, and on the day of the announcement lamented that ""this decision has set in motion events that will come back to haunt our country.""? I wish I had been wrong.As consequential as that blunder was, it is hardly the only one to blame for the current state of the Middle East. Again ignoring the dire warnings of military experts, this Administration refused to confront Bashar Assad when the Syrian people began rising up against him and to bolster the moderate groups who tried to take him on. I and many of my colleagues in Congress again called for decisive U.S. action, including no-fly zones and defensive arms for moderate rebels. Again these calls were ignored. Worse still, the Administration drew a red line on the use of chemical weapons, and then refused to follow through when Assad crossed that line. The result has been a security and humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, a failing state-in-waiting that ISIL has adeptly and viciously exploited. These twin vacuums in Syria and Iraq created a single battle space from which ISIL has exerted its authority, seized oil revenues, and inflicted unspeakable horrors, especially against women, girls, and religious minorities. This is the very base of operations from which a devastating attack could be launched against the United States by seasoned fighters holding Western passports.What\'s more, the failures of the Obama-Clinton doctrine are rippling out far beyond the Middle East. The world has witnessed their crisis of leadership and is acting accordingly. Vladimir Putin has seized Crimea, continues to fuel an ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, and menaces other U.S. allies along his border. China is thwarting freedom of navigation through vital sea lanes in the Asia Pacific region and attempting to unilaterally impose its will in territorial disputes. Terrorist groups such as Boko Haram are declaring their allegiance to ISIL and wreaking havoc on African soil. Latin America is learning that nations like Cuba who flagrantly disregard human rights and the rule of law get more attention and engagement than those who steadily work to build democratic and free-market institutions. And in cyberspace, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea launch assault after assault on our military and commercial assets, deeply compromising our security and our global economic competitiveness.These blunders and miscalculations have created a perfect storm and brought us to a point of crisis. I am running for President because I have a path forward.First, I would walk away from the disastrous Iranian nuclear negotiations, and return to the table only when Iran is prepared to accept a deal that puts an end to its nuclear weapons program and its support of global terrorism.Next, I would present a clear strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL, drive Assad from power, and re-establish stability in the Middle East. It is imperative that we look at Iraq and Syria as a single battle space. We cannot stabilize Iraq without a strategy to deal with the ISIL safe havens in Syria. And we cannot deal with Syria while Bashar al Assad remains in power.The current force structure of approximately 3500 U.S. troops in Iraq is inadequate to the task. According to Gen. Keane, one of the chief architects of the 2007 surge, we will need roughly 10,000 U.S. troops to once again change the tide of battle in Iraq. These additional forces would allow us to train and advise Iraqi troops at the battalion level, making them far more likely to stay in the fight. With the increased numbers, we could deploy attack helicopters to give the Iraqi army a substantial advantage over ISIL. These numbers would also allow us to put in place robust special operations capability to apply constant pressure on ISIL\'s leadership morning, noon, and night. They would never communicate or move without being subject to being captured or killed. I would also supply better arms and equipment to the Kurds so that they could project force from the north, supplementing our efforts in the south.When it comes to Syria, where the majority of ISIL fighters reside, I would lead the effort to create a regional force with troops from Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other willing nations to go in on the ground and pull the Caliphate up by its roots. No regional force will take this task on until we commit to removing Assad, the puppet of Iran. The defeat of ISIL and removal of Assad must be joint goals and they must be achieved with regional troops and regional resources. U.S. forces would only be made available to provide targeted capabilities that our regional partners lack.Without this comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIL and drive out Assad, the region will fall into greater and greater chaos as the humanitarian crisis spreads. According to U.S. government reports, there are now more Syrian children attending Lebanese schools than Lebanese children. The situation is especially dire in Jordan, one of our closest allies, which has been overwhelmed with refugees. The status quo in Syria jeopardizes the stability of our friends, prevents us from achieving our goals in Iraq, and constitutes a strategic win for Iran.My long history in the region has taught me that failure to choose is a choice in and of itself. That hoping the problem gets better seldom works. That the price of intervention has to be weighed against the price of sitting on the sidelines. In the case of ISIL and other Radical Islamic groups, our current strategy is allowing them to get stronger and putting us at risk of a serious attack on our homeland. The time has come for the strategy to change and it must change soon. We all make mistakes. The key is to learn from those mistakes.President Obama is not the first president to make mistakes, and he won\'t be the last. President Bush and his supporters in Congress  of which I was one  made mistakes as well. The United States invaded Iraq based on faulty intelligence. We learned the hard way that de-Baathification was the wrong approach. As the insurgency in Iraq grew, we realized that we needed to change the strategy. So we did. The architects of the Surge recognized we needed more troops and we needed to engage with Sunni sheiks. So we did. And it succeeded. Iraq on the eve of President Obama\'s disastrous withdrawal was stable. The very difficult work of political reconciliation had begun. We made some mistakes and then fixed them. President Obama, by contrast, simply doubles down. As President, I would bring the kind of seasoned leadership that learns, adapts, and overcomes.As for Putin, I would immediately and dramatically increase natural gas exports to our European allies to undercut his greatest source of leverage in the region. I would arm the Ukrainian military with defensive weapons and impose even more crippling sanctions on Moscow, including asset freezes targeting Putin and his cronies. And I would inject a much-needed dose of strong American leadership into NATO. We must refocus the alliance. We must firm up the resolve of our European friends to commit the necessary military might to stop Putin from threatening and destabilizing the region.As President, I would also combine the hard power of our military might with the soft power of development and diplomacy. As former CENTCOM Commander Gen. Mattis told Congress, if we fail to fund our diplomatic and international assistance initiatives, we better be prepared to buy guys like him more bullets. Our foreign assistance programs make up just 1% of the federal budget. But they punch far above their weight. For an amount of money that is less than a rounding error in total spending, the U.S. taxpayers are buying something priceless: greater security. Just as Iran\'s support for terrorism in the Middle East is a great threat to us, our support for peace and prosperity in the region is a great benefit to us. What happens there and what happens here are directly linked.Educating a young girl in a remote region of Syria, or Iraq, or Afghanistan does more to improve our security than dropping a 500-pound bomb. Investing in the future of young men and women in the developing world provides a hopeful alternative to those who live where Radical Islam seeks to dominate, recruit, and wreak havoc.Alleviating humanitarian crises and enhancing the capacity of partner nations to bring security and prosperity to their people makes us safer. It diminishes the potential for terrorist safe havens. It empowers our allies to be more effective partners in the struggle against violent extremism. Prevailing in this struggle will take sustained partnerships in the region and generational involvement on the development side.There are two historical events taking place simultaneously throughout the Middle East. The first is the demand for better governance and social justice by women, the young, and the disenfranchised. This movement, commonly called the Arab Spring, has been hijacked, but it is still very much alive. The second event is a fight for the heart and soul of Islam, with Al Qaeda, ISIL, and other Radical Islamic groups on one side, and the overwhelming majority of the Muslim faithful on the other. It is incumbent upon us to recognize these historic moments and side with the demands for better governance and social justice, and by those within the faith who are willing to fight radical Islam. The outcome of these struggles will affect our national security and our way of life for generations to come. We must provide capacity where we find the will to bring about a more representative and peaceful Middle East.We cannot accomplish this without the necessary resources, so as President, I would end sequestration. I would rebuild our military, intelligence, law enforcement, and international assistance capacity that has been devastated by senseless cuts. I would ensure the tools of both hard and soft power are funded at a level that keeps our homeland safe.Once again, this is about ensuring we have the capability, the capacity, and the will to secure our nation. The superior capability of the world\'s best fighting force. The overwhelming capacity of a robust national defense and development agenda. And the determined will to demonstrate to friends and foes alike that we are prepared to use every tool in our arsenal to confront our enemies and turn the tide against them.This focus on capability, capacity, and will would be the centerpiece of my plan as Commander in Chief. It is the focus we need in order to change course as a nation and secure our homeland. It is the focus that I would urge President Obama to bring to the remainder of his presidency. January 20, 2017 is still many months away, with grave threats and key decisions on the horizon.Afghanistan is a critical decision point. The president\'s decision to withdraw down to 1000 U.S. forces by the end of 2016 is a disaster in the making. A Kabul-centric force of this size will not allow us an effective counter terrorism mission against radical organizations that reside along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This mission alone requires well over 1000 troops to be effective. Losing a counter-terrorism and intelligence presence in Afghanistan would be political and military malpractice. If we continue on the course set by President Obama, we will be repeating the same mistakes made in Iraq. As president, I would leave in place the current force of 9,800 until conditions on the ground warrant our withdrawal. As president, every military decision would be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timelines. To do otherwise would be a direct threat to our homeland and would squander all we have fought for in Afghanistan after more than a decade of sacrifice.Finally, as President, I will always tell the American people the truth about what we need to do to be safe. My message at times may be hard to hear. But I will never leave our nation vulnerable out of deference to polls. My commitment is simple: whatever it takes, as long as it takes, until we defeat them.This has always been a dangerous world. But the Obama-Clinton world is contending with grave dangers of its own making. Our nation and our global standing have been badly weakened after two terms of this agenda. We absolutely cannot afford a third. I am running to be President of the United States to put an end to the Obama-Clinton doctrine.I am ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. I have a clear strategy to prevent a nuclear Iran, to confront ISIL and Radical Islam, to drive Bashar Assad from power, and to re-establish stability in the Middle East. I will restore our relationship with the State of Israel. I will engage with our Arab allies to achieve a regional solution. I will reinvigorate NATO and shore up the resolve of our European allies to develop a strategy to take on Putin. I will make it clear to our friends and our enemies that the U.S. once again has the capability, capacity, and will to be the world\'s greatest force for security. We have paid a dear price for leading from behind. I intend to return the United States to its rightful place.'"
Lindsey Graham,R,c,"September 8, 2015","b'Remarks at the National Press Club Luncheon in Washington, DC'","b'President Obama\'s deal with Iran could only be reached through a long series of mistakes and miscalculations. His biggest mistake of all was to disassociate Iran\'s destabilizing behavior from their nuclear ambitions. By separating the two, Obama opened up funding for the war machine of the world\'s greatest sponsor of terrorism. This was a strategic blunder for the ages.As to Israel, this deal empowers their chief antagonist with more money, more weapons, and a pathway to a bomb. To my Democratic colleagues who say this agreement saves Israel and secures its future, I couldn\'t disagree more strongly. Every single major political party in Israel, not just Likud, opposes this deal because they know it gives the Ayatollah the ability to make his chants of ""Death to Israel"" a reality. If this agreement does not dramatically change, it could very well be a death sentence to our closest ally in region.I believe the Ayatollah is compelled by his religious beliefs to purify Islam, destroy the one and only Jewish state, and attack democracies like ours. There is no place in the Ayatollah\'s world for religious tolerance, peaceful dissent, or the selection of leaders by the people.Some of the collateral damage from Obama\'s fixation on a deal with Iran at any cost has been the unchecked provocations of Russia and China. In the face of Russia\'s interventions in Ukraine and its support for Assad, or China\'s aggression against its neighbors and the U.S., Obama has been afraid to push back because he needs Moscow and Beijing in order to reach a deal with Iran.As a result, the losers of this deal include American businesses and government officials who have been cyber attacked by China, the good people of Ukraine, and the overwhelming majority of Syrians who have had to suffer under Assad\'s oppression. All because Obama has been unwilling to counter these provocations in a forceful manner for fear of jeopardizing his agreement.The biggest losers of all are the Iranian people themselves. Those who yearn for freedom and to see the end of oppression by the Ayatollah and his henchmen. This agreement empowers the Ayatollah and makes it far more difficult for the Iranian people to unshackle themselves from this oppressive religious theocracy. When the history of these times has been written, unfortunately I believe it will be said that President Obama was a weak opponent of evil and a poor champion of freedom.His nuclear deal with Iran is The Great Miscalculation of his presidency. In an administration marked by failing policies here at home and around the world, this deal will prove to be his most consequential failure.He went to the negotiating table without understanding who he was dealing with. And he went to the table as a weakened president who had long been broadcasting to the world he had no will to confront our adversaries. Having disastrously and prematurely withdrawn from Iraq, drawing red lines in Syria and then backing down, and making it crystal clear that a military option was not really on the table, he set the stage for a negotiation with Iran that could only go one way.Just as Obama\'s position of weakness was crystal clear, it should also have been very clear what kind of adversary we were dealing with. Iran has been run by a radical, fanatical regime for over three and a half decades. Their nuclear ambitions, their hatred for the U.S. and Israel, their support for terror, and their religious fanaticism are well known. Even if President Obama entered office without understanding this regime, history had given him a crash course in 2009.Two years before the Arab Spring broke out, the people of Iran began to revolt against their tyrannical government. The Ayatollah had rigged the presidential election and the people of Iran knew it. Within hours of the announcement of the stolen election, hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets demanding nothing more than their democratic rights.This Green Revolution, as it was called, made up of political and religious moderates, youth, women, workers, and anyone who wanted a better life, all stood up to peacefully but forcefully demand a new kind of Iran. The reaction of the Ayatollah was swift and barbaric. Thousands were savagely beaten. Dozens were killed in cold blood, and hundreds more were jailed, many of whom were tortured and tried in sham trials.At this point, Iran had reached a crossroads. Either this Green Revolution would succeed in bringing about real change in Tehran, or the radical Islamic government would succeed in squashing the movement. The United States was at a crossroads too. President Obama had a clear choice: stand with the people of Iran, or remain on the sidelines during the brutal crackdown.At this pivotal moment, President Obama chose to remain on the sidelines. The religious Nazis running Iran faced no consequences for their actions. The people of Iran received no support. Without the support of the world\'s greatest democracy, their effort was doomed. The Ayatollah and his henchmen in the Revolutionary Guard killed, jailed, or terrified into silence every Iranian moderate. In the six years since, there has been no sign of that resistance. The crackdown was complete. The cost of protest clearly too high.What happened in 2009 helped to sharpen the world\'s focus on this fanatical regime. In the years following, those of us who had long understood the threat Iran poses redoubled our efforts to step up the pressure. The U.S. Congress put the screws to the Iranian government, cutting off access to global markets and especially western financial institutions. Our allies followed our lead. We painstakingly built an international consensus on Iranian sanctions.I helped to lead this effort because I believed then and I believe now that the single greatest threat to our security as a nation is the prospect of a nuclear Iran. Iran, in turn, felt the deep pain inflicted by a united sanctions effort, and agreed to come to the negotiating table.This was a critical moment. We had backed Iran into the corner. What was needed now more than ever was a tough American president. Someone who wanted a deal, but not so badly that he would take a bad one. A president who credibly put all options on the table so that Iran knew we meant business. A president who laid out negotiating objectives and stuck to them. A president who, without a shred of doubt, would do whatever it takes to defend America.But that\'s not the president we had. We had a president who projected weakness and clearly didn\'t understand who he was dealing with. But believe me, they knew exactly who they were dealing with. They saw President Obama\'s weakness and they took every possible advantage.While John Kerry was giving away the farm at the negotiating table, his own State Department was writing a report detailing Iran\'s terror campaign throughout the Middle East. This report outlined very clearly the money, arms, and training that Iran was providing to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, who attack the State of Israel and, in the case of Hezbollah, hold the government of Lebanon hostage.While the Obama Administration was giving away our ability to dismantle Iran\'s nuclear program, Iran was propping up Bashar Al Assad and prolonging the Syrian conflict, giving rise to ISIL and the world\'s most devastating humanitarian crisis.While our negotiators were giving up on anywhere/anytime inspections, Iran was destabilizing Iraq and reviving sectarian tensions with its Shiite militias, paving the way for ISIL to move in and undo the gains made by American troops.While President Obama was backing down from every single negotiating objective he had laid out, Iran was taking down the government of Yemen. Through their proxies, the Houthis, they toppled this pro-US government and crippled our ability to monitor AQAP.In short, Iran set the entire Middle East on fire, taking over four Arab capitals and creating the conditions for the most devastating and sophisticated attacks against our homeland, all while negotiating with the Obama Administration. And what did they get at the end of that negotiation? A deal that gives them a nuclear bomb, a missile to deliver it, and the money to pay for it.The disastrous failings of this agreement are well known by now. It gives the Ayatollah an immediate cash infusion of $100 billion. It allows the Iranians, even if they abide by the agreement, to arrive at the threshold of being a nuclear-armed state in just a few short years. And of course we know they will not abide by the agreement. They have consistently lied and cheated from day one about their nuclear weapons program, and this deal relies on trust rather than real verification with anywhere/anytime inspections. It lifts bans on ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. And the launch of the deal hinges on a secret side deal between the IAEA and Iran regarding the possible military dimensions of their program. So far, Congress and the American people have been barred from seeing this agreement, but we know at the very least it leaves inspections in the hands of the Iranians themselves.Today the Senate begins its debate on this deal. I have spent every day since the deal was announced analyzing the details, talking with experts, and explaining to my colleagues and the American people why it is so dangerous. I will continue making the case on the Senate floor and encouraging my Democratic colleagues to put our security above politics. Regardless of how the vote goes, the fight for a better deal will not end. I am leading the effort to impose additional sanctions on the Iranian regime until all of our hostages are released. I will support re-imposing the current sanctions before they expire at the end of 2016. I will also block funding for the IAEA until they come clean about their side deals with Iran. I will not let up until we change course, force Iran back to the table, and get a better deal.President Obama says that our choice is between this deal and war. He says that there\'s no better deal to be had. He\'s half right - there\'s no better deal to be had from a president who negotiates from weakness. But the right president will get the right deal.As president, I would say to the Iranians you can have a peaceful nuclear energy program. You can have sanctions relief. But first you will completely dismantle your nuclear weapons program. You will abandon your support for terror. You will submit to inspections anytime, anywhere, so that we know you\'re not cheating. And you will not get a penny of sanctions relief until we know you\'ve complied and continue to comply. That\'s the deal. If you reject those terms and walk away, that\'s your choice. If Iran tries to break out, they will be stopped.To achieve this better deal, I would work with the Congress to impose new sanctions that would put off limits American banking to any company that would do business with Iran. I believe having the choice between the Iranian economy and the American banking system would create tremendous leverage that I would use wisely.I am running for president because this is the deal we need. It is the only deal that will secure our nation, protect our closest allies like Israel, and assure our Arab allies that they do not need to pursue nuclear weapons of their own. President Obama can\'t get this deal. He has neither the will nor an understanding of the complexities of the Middle East. But I do. I have spent months on the ground through dozens of trips to the region, as a senator and a service member in uniform. I know the key players. More important, they know me. As president I will get us a better deal and do what it takes to make sure Iran never achieves the ability to hit us at home.'"
