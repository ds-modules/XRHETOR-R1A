Bernie Sanders,D,s,"April 30, 2015",Statement Announcing Candidacy for President,"I am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of the United States. I ask for your support.For many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across our country, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good, hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeply concerned about the future of our country.They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity and security.The challenges facing our country are enormous.It's not just that, for 40 years, the middle class has been disappearing. It's that 99 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent, and the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at any time since the late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being squeezed and left behind.The disastrous decision of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case and in other related decisions is undermining the very foundations of American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super PACS to buy politicians and elections.And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is the central challenge of our times and our planet.The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last another generation if we don't boldly change course now.After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President. But let's be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ""Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"July 9, 2015","Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders: Bush 'Does Not Seem to Understand Our Economy,'","WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday reacted to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's statement on Wednesday that ""people need to work longer hours"" to improve the economy.""Unfortunately,"" Sanders said, ""Gov. Bush does not seem to understand what is happening in our economy today. The sad truth is that because the middle class has declined over the last 40 years, while almost all new income and wealth have gone to the people on top, Americans already work the longest hours of any people in the western industrialized world. In fact, 80 percent of working men work longer than 40 hours a week. What we need now is an economy that provides decent wages and income for the middle class, not demands that people work even longer hours than they currently do.""Bush's statement, which he later reportedly attempted to walk back, came during an editorial board with the New Hampshire Union Leader."
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"July 14, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders Welcoming Secretary Clinton to Senate Caucus Meeting,"WASHINGTON  Saying he looks forward to an issue-oriented campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday welcomed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to a meeting of the Senate Democratic Caucus.""I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years, since she was first lady. I served with her in the Senate. I like and respect Hillary Clinton,"" Sanders said. ""But there are differences of opinion that we have which should be the basis for a serious discussion.""""The American middle class continues to disappear while almost all of the new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent. I look forward to an issues-oriented debate with Secretary Clinton as to the best way forward to help working families in America.""Sanders highlighted several issues on which he and the former U.S. senator from New York have different views.""I have strongly opposed disastrous trade agreements which have led to the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs and I oppose the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. Secretary Clinton has a different view,"" Sanders said.""I strongly opposed the war in Iraq. Secretary Clinton, as a senator, voted for it.""I voted against the so-called Patriot Act which authorized the National Security Agency to collect the telephone and e-mail records of millions of Americans. Secretary Clinton voted for it.""Because of concerns about climate change, I strongly opposed the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Secretary Clinton has not voiced an opinion.""I helped lead the effort to stop the deregulation of Wall Street. I believe the biggest banks should be broken up and that Glass-Steagall financial regulations should be reinstated. To the best of my knowledge, she isn't for either one.""I believe we should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and have introduced legislation to create 13 million jobs by a $1 trillion investment in our crumbling infrastructure. Secretary Clinton has been unclear.""I have offered legislation to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and would pay for it by a transaction fee on Wall Street speculators. Her position is unclear."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"July 21, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on the Texas Police Video,"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement tonight after a police dashboard video was released showing the arrest of the late Sandra Bland:""This video of the arrest of Sandra Bland shows totally outrageous police behavior. No one should be yanked from her car, thrown to the ground, assaulted and arrested for a minor traffic stop. The result is that three days later she is dead in her jail cell. This video highlights once again why we need real police reform. People should not die for a minor traffic infraction. This type of police abuse has become an all-too-common occurrence for people of color and it must stop."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"July 23, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Comments by Jeb Bush on Medicare,"WASHINGTON  Responding to Jeb Bush's assertion that ""we need to figure out a way to phase out"" Medicare, Sen. Bernie Sanders today issued the following statement:""It is an indication of how far right-wing the Republican Party has become when its 'moderate' candidate, Jeb Bush, at a forum sponsored by the billionaire Koch brothers, is now talking about phasing out Medicare. This follows Bush's statement that we should raise the retirement age for Social Security.""As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare, it is important that we defend this enormously important program rather than talk about ending it.""Medicare provides health care to 51 million American seniors and people with disabilities and has saved the lives of countless Americans.""Further, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the finances of Medicare have been significantly improved and it is now fully funded for the next 15 years through 2030.""Our goal as a nation should be to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all Americans, not end a highly-successful program which protects seniors and the disabled."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"August 3, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Obama Climate Change Initiative,"BURLINGTON, Vt.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign was endorsed over the weekend by Friends of the Earth, on Monday applauded President Barack Obama's proposal on climate change and issued the following statement:""I applaud President Obama for recognizing that climate change is the great planetary crisis facing our country and the world. I support his plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and to promote more wind and solar power and other sources of renewable energy.""It is time for Republicans in Congress to stop obstructing efforts to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.""I understand that Republicans, including many of those running for president, are dependent on the Koch brothers, oil companies and other fossil-fuel contributors. Maybe for once they can overcome the needs of their campaign contributors and worry instead about the planet they are leaving their kids and grandchildren and young people all over the world."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"August 5, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders Accepting an Invitation to Speak at Liberty University,"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement tonight on his acceptance of an invitation from Liberty University to speak at the Sept. 14 convocation at the school in Lynchburg, Virginia:""Liberty University was kind enough to invite me to address a convocation and I decided to accept. It goes without saying that my views on many issues  women's rights, gay rights, education  are very different from the opinions of some in the Liberty University community. I think it is important, however, to see if we can reach consensus regarding the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in our country, about the collapse of the middle class, about the high level of childhood poverty, about climate change and other issues.""It is very easy for a candidate to speak to people who hold the same views. It's harder but important to reach out to others who look at the world differently. I look forward to meeting with the students and faculty of Liberty University."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"August 6, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on the DNC Primary Schedule,"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today on the Democratic National Committee's announcement of the 2016 primary debate schedule:""I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the debate schedule announced by the Democratic National Committee.

I look forward to working with the DNC to see if we can significantly expand the proposed debate schedule."""

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after two demonstrators blocked him from addressing an event hosted by an organization supporting Social Security and Medicare:""I am disappointed that two people disrupted a rally attended by thousands at which I was invited to speak about fighting to protect Social Security and Medicare.

Bernie Sanders,D,s,"September 7, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Obama Action on Paid Sick Leave,"AMHERST, N.H.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement applauding President Barack Obama for issuing an executive order requiring paid sick leave for employees of federal contractors:""The president's executive order on paid sick leave is exactly the right thing to do. Now that paid sick leave has been extended to hundreds of thousands of Americans who work for federal contractors, Congress has got to extend these rights to all workers.""We have got to end the international embarrassment of the U.S. being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee paid leave to workers. Not only do workers need paid sick leave, they also need at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and at least two weeks of paid vacation. In the richest country on earth, no one should force mothers to go back to work days or weeks after giving birth."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"September 8, 2015","Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders: Our Criminal Justice System is Broken, Ending Private Prisons is a Good First Step Forward","BURLINGTON, Vt.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders stated today that the United States needs major reforms to our broken criminal justice system, and that a good step forward would be to end the practice of prisons in America being run by private corporations. He will soon introduce legislation to do just that.Of the nearly 1.6 million people in federal and state prisons in 2013, 133,044 (8.4 percent) were in private prisons. That included 41,150 federal inmates in private facilities (19.1 percent of all federal prisoners) and 91,885 state prisoners in private facilities (6.8 percent of total state inmates). Most of the individuals detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement also are in private detention facilities.""It is clear to most Americans that we need major reforms in our broken criminal justice system,"" Sanders said. ""We need to end the tragic reality that the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth, and that the people being incarcerated are disproportionately black and Hispanic. We need to take a hard look at why the rate of recidivism in this country is so high and why we are not developing successful paths back to civil society for those who serve prison time. Further we need to end, once and for all, the disgraceful practice of corporations profiting from the incarceration of Americans.""As a nation, our goal must be to do everything we can to create the conditions that prevent mass incarceration. At a time when we are spending $50 billion a year on our correctional system, it makes a lot more sense to me to be investing in jobs and education for our young people than in more and more jails. Not only can we prevent thousands of lives from being destroyed, we can save billions of taxpayer dollars. Locking people up is a lot more expensive than schools,"" Sanders said.""Overall, we need bold change in our criminal justice system. A good first step forward is to start treating prisoners as human beings, not profiting from their incarceration. Our emphasis must be on rehabilitation, not incarceration and longer prison sentences. The basic decisions regarding criminal justice and public safety are, without a doubt, the responsibility of the citizens of our country and not the investors in private corporations.""My legislation will eliminate federal, state and local contracts for privately run prisons within 2 years. It will reinstate the federal parole system. It will increase oversight and eliminate the overcharging of prisoners by private companies for banking and other services. It will end the mandatory quota of immigrants detained. It will require ICE to improve the monitoring of detention facilities and eliminate private detention centers within 2 years.""Sanders will be introducing this bill next week."
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"September 14, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Trade Unions,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement on Gov. Scott Walker's plan to eliminate overtime pay, lower wages and destroy the trade union movement in the United States:""At a time when the rich are getting richer and everyone else is getting poorer, Gov. Walker's attack on the trade union movement would lower wages and the benefits that working people receive while making the wealthy and large corporations even richer.""Workers have the constitutional right to form unions, to collectively bargain and to participate in the political process. If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade union movement, not a weaker one. Gov. Walker's proposal would move us in exactly the wrong direction."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"September 17, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on the Federal Reserve Leaving Interest Rates Unchanged,"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after the Federal Reserve announced that it would hold off on raising interest rates:""It is good news that the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates today. At a time when real unemployment is over 10 percent, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. It is now time for the Fed to act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago."""

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said a Muslim should not be elected president:""I am very disappointed that Dr. Carson would suggest that a Muslim should not become president of the United States. It took us too long to overcome the prejudice against electing a Catholic or an African-American president. People should be elected to office based on their ideas, not their religion or the color of their skin."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"September 22, 2015",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Prices for Prescription Drugs,"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Tuesday on his proposal to rein in skyrocketing prices for prescription drugs:""The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people. We now pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and 1 in 5 Americans  including patients suffering with cancer  cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.""The time is long overdue for Congress to listen to the needs of the American people and not the enormously-profitable pharmaceutical industry. The top three drug companies racked up $45 billion in profits last year after the industry doled out $250 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.""In 1999, I was the first member of Congress to take Americans across the border to purchase lower-cost drugs in Canada. Americans should not have to leave their country to get affordable medicine. Congress must act now to allow the re-importation of low-cost prescription drugs and Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry to save seniors and taxpayers billions of dollars.""To read more about Sen.

I support President Obama's effort to combat the Islamic State in Syria while at the same time supporting those in Syria trying to overthrow the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Assad.""I oppose, at this point, a unilateral American no-fly zone in Syria which could get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never-ending U.S. entanglement in that region."""

Bernie Sanders on Monday said he believes a consensus can be developed for ways to lessen the likelihood of horrific mass-shootings which have plagued the country, including last week's murders at a community college in Oregon.""Like the rest of the nation, I am appalled by gun violence in our country and the mass shootings in our churches and colleges,"" Sanders said. ""While there is no simple fix, that does not mean we should do nothing. The status quo clearly is not working and people on both sides of this issue cannot simply continue shouting at each other. Nobody wants more mass killings and serious people are going to have to engage in serious discussion.""""In my view, there are very concrete steps we can take to lessen the number of tragedies and to make those that happen less lethal, including ideas supported by a majority of gun owners,"" the senator added.Sanders said:""We must strengthen and better enforce the instant background check system.""We must close the gun-show loophole, which allows unlicensed dealers to sell guns to people who otherwise would not be able to get them.""We must make 'straw man' purchases a federal crime.""We must ban semi-automatic assault weapons which are designed strictly for killing human beings.""We must recognize that our mental health system is seriously broken. While there has been much talk about mental health parity in our health care system, we are not even close to achieving it. It's past time for a serious discussion about identifying, intervening and treating mental illness and ensuring access to care.""In addition, Sanders said his presidential campaign is assembling a comprehensive package of measures to address gun violence.As Vermont's lone congressman and as a senator, Sanders consistently supported strong gun safety legislation. As a result, he has a National Rifle Association rating of D-."

It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multi-national corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense.""This agreement follows failed trade deals with Mexico, China and other low-wage countries that have cost millions of jobs and shuttered tens of thousands of factories across the United States.""In the Senate, I will do all that I can to defeat this agreement. We need trade policies that benefit American workers and consumers, not just the CEOs of large multi-national corporations."""

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement today after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she now opposes a proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement:""The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a continuation of disastrous trade policies which have cost this country millions of decent-paying jobs and have led to a race to the bottom. As someone who voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China and who has helped lead the effort against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I am glad that Secretary Clinton has now come on board. I hope that, with her help, with the efforts of virtually every union in the country and with the opposition of many environmental groups, we can defeat this agreement which was largely written by Wall Street and corporate America.""Watch the Video:"

We must eliminate sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine. That is why I have repeatedly voted in favor of addressing this disparity.""When we talk about criminal justice reform, we also need to understand that millions of people have been arrested for using marijuana. We must recognize that blacks are four times more likely than whites to get arrested for marijuana possession, even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana. Any serious criminal justice reform must include removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act.""Further, real criminal justice reform must have the United States join every other major democracy in eliminating the death penalty."""

Quoting Donald Trump's assertion that wages in the United States are ""too high,"" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said Trump's attempt to back away from his own words shows that the Republican front-runner is ""getting nervous that working families are catching on"" to his views.""Donald Trump says that I'm a liar because I said he believes wages in America are too high. Really?"" Sanders said in response to Trump's assertion on Twitter on Sunday. ""This is what CNN reported last Nov. 12,"" Sanders added. ""Trump insisted on Thursday that the U.S. must keep wages low in order to compete with other countries, one day after he dug in on his assertion that 'wages are too high' in America. 'Whether it's taxes or wages, if they're too high we're not going to be able to compete with other countries,' Trump said Thursday morning on Fox News. Trump first said he believes wages are 'too high' during Tuesday night's Republican debate.""""It appears that Mr. Trump is getting nervous that working families are catching on that his policies represent the interests of the billionaire class against almost everyone else. He refuses to support raising the minimum wage. He believes wages are too high and he wants to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very richest families in America. That's not an agenda that 'makes America great.' It's just another Republican billionaire wanting to make the very rich richer at the expense of working families."""

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Wednesday after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, in a speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, accused Sanders of wanting to raise tax rates to 90 percent:""It appears that Donald Trump, a pathological liar, simply cannot control himself. He lies, lies and lies again. Today, he repeated his lie that I want to raise taxes to 90 percent. Totally untrue. And PolitiFact gave Trump's same statement last October a 'Pants-on-Fire' rating.""What is true is that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality billionaires like Trump should pay their fair share of taxes. Unlike Trump, who wants to give huge tax breaks to his fellow billionaires and large multi-national corporations, what we need is real tax reform which asks the very wealthiest people in this country and large, profitable corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes.""It is absurd that in America today we have multi-national corporations who stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens and, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income taxes. It is grossly unfair that there are millionaires in this country who take advantage of all kinds of loopholes and end up paying an effective tax rate lower than a middle-class worker."""

They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer. A vast majority of the American people, including responsible gun owners who are sickened by the deaths of so many innocent people, agree with the common sense reforms announced today. As president, I will continue these executive orders because it's past time to end the moral outrage of Aurora, and Newtown and Charleston."""

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Thursday on the environmental crisis caused by a gas leak in Porter Ranch, California:""The massive and tragic natural gas leak in Porter Ranch, California, is yet another example of the urgent national need to transition away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainable, renewable sources of power.""The Porter Ranch gas leak is an absolute climate disaster. More than 87,000 metric tons of methane gas have escaped into the air. Methane traps more than 85 times the heat of carbon dioxide. The scale of the Porter Ranch leak would equal the emissions of six coal-burning power plants or an additional 7 million cars on the road. In climate terms, this leak compares with the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.""More directly, thousands of residents have been put out of their homes and local schools have been closed. And the health risk is real  methane exposure can cause headaches, vomiting and bloody noses.""Today I am calling for a sense of national urgency and action to stop this leak. The EPA needs to expedite action on its investigation. Southern California Gas Company needs to do much more, apply more resources to close the leak and release complete air quality data. It is simply unacceptable that a gas leak which began last October is still poisoning the air and that the company continues to profit from the storage facility.""It also appears fracking of nearby wells could have contributed to this disaster. It is yet another reason why I have called for a ban on all fracking. ""Porter Ranch is simply one more tragic cautionary tale in our dependence on oil and gas.""That is why I have put forth the most far-reaching climate plan of any candidate for the presidency. I opposed Keystone XL from Day One. I am the only candidate for president who has opposed the Bakken Pipeline in Iowa, and the proposed pipelines in New Hampshire and Vermont carrying fracked gas.""I will continue to stand up to the big money and lobbying power of Big Oil and fight for a new energy system based on clean sources of power like wind and solar, creating millions of new jobs  and saving our planet."""

Bernie Sanders on Friday welcomed Hillary Clinton's assertion that she supports expanding Social Security, but pressed her to clarify her new stand.""We're glad that, for the first time, Secretary Clinton has indicated that she will join me in expanding Social Security benefits,"" Sanders said. ""But we need more clarity,"" he added.""Is she prepared to scrap the cap on payroll taxes? Is she prepared to support legislation that I have offered that would both expand Social Security benefits and extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 58 years as a result of lifting the cap on taxable income on people who earn more than $250,000 a year? I hope so but we're still not sure,"" Sanders said.Sanders asked Clinton to plainly say that she supports making the wealthy pay their fair share into the retirement program. He also called on her to explicitly oppose cutting benefits by raising the retirement age.As recently as Oct. 28, Clinton had left open the possibility that she would support raising the retirement age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security. ""I would consider it,"" she told a town meeting in New Hampshire.Back in April of 2008, Clinton falsely claimed that Obama's plan to scrap the cap would increase taxes on the middle class. ""I'm certainly against one of Senator Obama's ideas, which is to lift the cap on the payroll tax, because that would impose additional taxes on people who are educators, police officers, firefighters and the like.""FactCheck.org ruled that Clinton's claim was false. ""Clinton exaggerated when she said that lifting the cap on wages that are subject to the Social Security tax 'would impose additional taxes on people who are, you know, educators here in the Philadelphia area or in the suburbs, police officers, firefighters and the like.' In fact, only individuals earning more than $102,000 a year would be affected, and few cops or teachers earn that much.""In a Friday night tweet, Clinton asserted, ""I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll defend it, I'll expand it."" Her statement came hours after Sanders, during a speech in Exeter, New Hampshire, urged Clinton to ""join me in saying it is imperative to increase and expand benefits for seniors on Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income.""Sanders has introduced legislation to make the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.Under Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.The proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. Sanders' plan is similar to a proposal to scrap the cap first brought forward by President Barack Obama in 2008.According to new estimates from the Social Security Administration, the Sanders plan would extend the solvency of Social Security until the year 2074."

Bernie Sanders,D,s,"March 21, 2016","Message to the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC","[This message was sent in lieu of remarks in person]Download a PDF of Senator Sanders's submitted remarks.I was invited along with other presidential candidates to be at the AIPAC conference in Washington, but obviously I could not make it because we are here. The issues that AIPAC is dealing with are very important issues and I wanted to give the same speech here as I would have given if we were at that conference. Let me begin by saying that I think I am probably the only candidate for president who has personal ties with Israel. I spent a number of months there when I was a young man on a kibbutz, so I know a little bit about Israel.Clearly, the United States and Israel are united by historical ties. We are united by culture. We are united by our values, including a deep commitment to democratic principles, civil rights and the rule of law.Israel is one of America's closest allies, and we  as a nation  are committed not just to guaranteeing Israel's survival, but also to making sure that its people have a right to live in peace and security.To my mind, as friends  long-term friends with Israel  we are obligated to speak the truth as we see it. That is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times.Our disagreements will come and go, and we must weather them constructively.But it is important among friends to be honest and truthful about differences that we may have. America and Israel have faced great challenges together. We have supported each other, and we will continue to do just that as we face a very daunting challenge and that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.I am here to tell the American people that, if elected president, I will work tirelessly to advance the cause of peace as a partner and as a friend to Israel. But to be successful, we have also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people, where in Gaza unemployment today is 44 percent and we have there a poverty rate which is almost as high.So when we talk about Israel and Palestinian areas, it is important to understand that today there is a whole lot of suffering among Palestinians and that cannot be ignored. You can't have good policy that results in peace if you ignore one side.The road toward peace will be difficult. Wonderful people, well-intentioned people have tried decade after decade to achieve that and it will not be easy. I cannot tell you exactly how it will look  I do not believe anyone can  but I firmly believe that the only prospect for peace is the successful negotiation of a two-state solution.The first step in that road ahead is to set the stage for resuming the peace process through direct negotiations. Progress is never made unless people are prepared to sit down and talk to each other. This is no small thing. It means building confidence on both sides, offering some signs of good faith, and then proceeding to talks when conditions permit them to be constructive. Again, this is not easy, but that is the direction we've got to go.This will require compromises on both sides, but I believe it can be done. I believe that Israel, the Palestinians, and the international community can, must, and will rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done to achieve a lasting peace in a region of the world that has seen so much war, so much conflict and so much suffering.Peace will require the unconditional recognition by all people of Israel's right to exist. It will require an end to attacks of all kinds against Israel.Peace will require that organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah renounce their efforts to undermine the security of Israel. It will require the entire world to recognize Israel.Peace has to mean security for every Israeli from violence and terrorism.But peace also means security for every Palestinian. It means achieving self-determination, civil rights, and economic well-being for the Palestinian people.Peace will mean ending what amounts to the occupation of Palestinian territory, establishing mutually agreed upon borders, and pulling back settlements in the West Bank, just as Israel did in Gaza  once considered an unthinkable move on Israel's part.That is why I join much of the international community, including the U.S. State Department and European Union, in voicing my concern that Israel's recent expropriation of an additional 579 acres of land in the West Bank undermines the peace process and, ultimately, Israeli security as well.It is absurd for elements within the Netanyahu government to suggest that building more settlements in the West Bank is the appropriate response to the most recent violence. It is also not acceptable that the Netanyahu government decided to withhold hundreds of millions of shekels in tax revenue from the Palestinians, which it is supposed to collect on their behalf.But, by the same token, it is also unacceptable for President Abbas to call for the abrogation of the Oslo Agreement when the goal should be the ending of violence.Peace will also mean ending the economic blockade of Gaza. And it will mean a sustainable and equitable distribution of precious water resources so that Israel and Palestine can both thrive as neighbors.Right now, Israel controls 80 percent of the water reserves in the West Bank. Inadequate water supply has contributed to the degradation and desertification of Palestinian land. A lasting peace will have to recognize Palestinians are entitled to control their own lives and there is nothing human life needs more than water.Peace will require strict adherence by both sides to the tenets of international humanitarian law. This includes Israel ending disproportionate responses to being attacked  even though any attack on Israel is unacceptable.We recently saw a dramatic example of just how important this concept is. In 2014, the decades-old conflict escalated once more as Israel launched a major military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli offensive came after weeks of indiscriminate rocket fire into its territory and the kidnapping of Israeli citizens.Of course, I strongly object to Hamas' long held position that Israel does not have the right to exist  that is unacceptable. Of course, I strongly condemn indiscriminate rocket fire by Hamas into Israeli territory, and Hamas' use of civilian neighborhoods to launch those attacks. I condemn the fact that Hamas diverted funds and materials for much-needed construction projects designed to improve the quality of life of the Palestinian people, and instead used those funds to construct a network of tunnels for military purposes.However, let me also be very clear: I  along with many supporters of Israel  spoke out strongly against the Israeli counterattacks that killed nearly 1,500 civilians and wounded thousands more. I condemned the bombing of hospitals, schools and refugee camps.Today, Gaza is still largely in ruins. The international community must come together to help Gaza recover. That doesn't mean rebuilding factories that produce bombs and missiles  but it does mean rebuilding schools, homes and hospitals that are vital to the future of the Palestinian people.These are difficult subjects. They are hard to talk about both for many Americans and for Israelis. I recognize that, but it is clear to me that the path toward peace will require tapping into our shared humanity to make hard but just decisions.Nobody can tell you when peace will be achieved between Israel and the Palestinians. No one knows the exact order that compromises will have to be made to reach a viable two-state solution. But as we undertake that work together, the United States will continue its unwavering commitment to the safety of Israeli citizens and the country of Israel.Let me just say a word about an overall agenda for the Middle East.Of course, beyond the Palestinian question, Israel finds itself in the midst of a region in severe upheaval.First, the so-called Islamic State  ISIS  threatens the security of the entire region and beyond, including our own country and our allies. Secretary of State Kerry was right to say that ISIS is committing genocide, and there is no doubt in my mind that the United States must continue to participate in an international coalition to destroy this barbaric organization.While obviously much needs to be done, so far our effort has had some important progress, as airstrikes have degraded ISIS' military capacity, and the group has lost more than 20 percent of its territory in the past year.So we are making some progress.But we are entering a difficult period in the campaign against ISIS.The government in Baghdad has yet to achieve a sustainable political order that unites Iraq's various ethnic and sectarian factions, which has limited its ability to sustain military victories against ISIS. Unless there is a united government, it's going to be hard to be effective in destroying ISIS. More inclusive, stable governance in Iraq will be vital to inflict a lasting defeat on ISIS. Otherwise, ISIS could regain its influence or another, similar organization may spring up in its place.In Syria, the challenges are even more difficult. The fractured nature of the civil war there has often diluted the fight against ISIS  exemplified by the Russian airstrikes that prioritized hitting anti-Assad fighters rather than ISIS. And, just like in Iraq, ISIS cannot be defeated until the groups that take territory from ISIS can responsibly govern the areas they take back. Ultimately, this will require a political framework for all of Syria.The U.S. must also play a greater role disrupting the financing of ISIS and efforts on the Internet to turn disaffected youth into a new generation of terrorists.While the U.S. has an important role to play in defeating ISIS, that struggle must be led by the Muslim countries themselves on the ground. I agree with King Abdullah of Jordan who a number of months ago said that what is going on there right now is nothing less than a battle for the soul of Islam and the only people who will effectively destroy ISIS there will be Muslim troops on the ground.So what we need is a coalition of those countries.Now, I am not suggesting that Saudi Arabia or any other states in the region invade other countries, nor unilaterally intervene in conflicts driven in part by sectarian tensions.What I am saying is that countries like Qatar  which intends to spend up to $200 billion to host the 2022 World Cup  Qatar which per capita is the wealthiest nation in the world  Qatar can do more to contribute to the fight Against ISIS. If they are prepared to spend $200 billion for a soccer tournament, then they have got to spend a lot spend a lot more against a barbaric organization.What I am also saying is that other countries in the region  like Saudi Arabia, which has the 4th largest defense budget in the world  has to dedicate itself more fully to the destruction of ISIS, instead of other military adventures like the one it is pursuing right now in Yemen.And keep in mind that while ISIS is obviously a dangerous and formidable enemy, ISIS has only 30,000 fighters on the ground. So when we ask the nations in the region to stand up to do more against ISIS  nations in the region which have millions of men and women under arms  we know it is surely within their capability to destroy ISIS.Now the United States has every right in the world to insist on these points. Remember  I want everybody to remember  that not so many years ago it was the United States and our troops that reinstalled the royal family in Kuwait after Saddam Hussein's invasion in 1990. We put these people back on the throne. Now they have the obligation to work with us and other countries to destroy ISIS.The very wealthy  and some of these countries are extraordinarily wealthy from oil money or gas money  these very wealthy and powerful nations in the region can no longer expect the United States to do their work for them. Uncle Sam cannot and should not do it all. We are not the policeman of the world.As we continue a strongly coordinated effort against ISIS, the United States and other western nations should be supportive of efforts to fight ISIS and al-Qaeda. But it is the countries in the region that have to stand up against these violently extremist and brutal organizations.Now I realize that given the geopolitics of the region this is not going to be easy. I realize that there are very strong and historical disagreements between different countries in the region about how ISIS should be dealt with. I realize different countries have different priorities. But we can help set the agenda and mobilize stronger collective action to defeat ISIS in a lasting way.Bottom line is the countries in the region  countries which by the way are most threatened by ISIS  they're going to have to come together, they're going to have to work out their compromises, they are going to have to lead the effort with the support of the United States and other major powers in destroying ISIS. Another major challenge in the region, of course, is the Syrian Civil War itself  one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent history.After five years of brutal conflict, the only solution in Syria will be, in my view, a negotiated political settlement. Those who advocate for stronger military involvement by the U.S. to oust Assad from power have not paid close enough attention to history. That would simply prolong the war and increase the chaos in Syria, not end it.In other words, we all recognize that Assad is a brutal dictator. But I think that our priorities right now have got to be destroy ISIS, and work out a political settlement with Russia and Iran to get Assad out of power.I applaud Secretary Kerry and the Obama administration for negotiating a partial ceasefire between the Assad regime and most opposition forces. The ceasefire shows the value of American-led diplomacy, rather than escalating violence. It may not seem like a lot, but it is. Diplomacy in this instance has had some real success.Let me also say what I think most Americans now understand, that for a great military power like the United States it is easy to use a war to remove a tyrant from power, but it is much more difficult to comprehend the day after that tyrant is removed from power and a political vacuum occurs.All of us know what has occurred in Iraq. We got rid of Saddam Hussein, a brutal, brutal murderer and a tyrant. A nd yet we created massive instability in that region which led to the creation of ISIS. I am very proud to have been one of the members in Congress to vote against that disastrous war.And the situation is not totally dissimilar from what has happened in Libya. We got rid of a terrible dictator there, Colonel Gaddafi, but right now chaos has erupted and ISIS now has a foothold in that area.The bottom line is that regime change for a major power like us is not hard. But understanding what happens afterward is something that always has got to be taken into consideration.In my view, the military option for a powerful nation like ours  the most powerful nation in the world  should always be on the table. That's why we have the most powerful military in the world. But it should always be the last resort, not the first resort.Another major challenge in the region is Iran, which routinely destabilizes the Middle East and threatens the security of Israel.Now, I think all of us agree that Iran must not be able to acquire a nuclear weapon. That would just destabilize the entire region and create disastrous consequences.Where we may disagree is how to achieve that goal. I personally strongly supported the nuclear deal with the United States, France, China, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran because it is the best hope to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.I want to thank the Obama administration for doing a very good job under very, very difficult circumstances.I believe we have an obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.You know it is very easy for politicians to go before the people and talk about how tough we are, and how we want to wipe out everybody else. But I think if we have learned anything from history it is that we pursue every diplomatic option before we resort to military intervention.And interestingly enough, more often than not, diplomacy can achieve goals that military intervention cannot achieve. And that is why I supported the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table and allowed us to reach an agreement.But let me tell you what I firmly believe. The bottom line is this: if successfully implemented  and I think it can be  the nuclear deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And preventing Iran from getting the bomb makes the world a safer place.Does the agreement achieve everything I would like? Of course not.But to my mind, it is far better than the path we were on with Iran developing nuclear weapons and the potential for military intervention by the United States and Israel growing greater by the day.I do not accept the idea that the ""pro-Israel"" position was to oppose the deal.Preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon will strengthen not only the United States' security, but Israel's security as well.And I am not alone in that idea. While Prime Minister Netanyahu is vocally opposed to the accord, his is hardly a consensus opinion in Israel and it's important that everyone understand that. Dozens of former security officials, including retired Army generals and chiefs of the Shin Bet and Mossad intelligence agencies support the agreement. Netanyahu may not, but many others in Israel do.But let me be clear: if Iran does not live up to the agreement, we should re-impose sanctions and all options are back on the table.Moreover, the deal does not mean we let Iran's aggressive acts go unchecked. The world must stand united in condemning Iran's recent ballistic missile tests as well as its continued support for terrorism through groups like Hezbollah.Going forward, I believe we need a longer-term vision for dealing with Iran that balances two important objectives.First, we must counter the destabilizing behavior of Iran's leaders.But secondly we must also leave the door open to more diplomacy to encourage Iranian moderates and the segments of the Iranian people  especially the younger generations  who want a better relationship with the West. While only a small step in the right direction, I was heartened by the results of the recent parliamentary elections in which Iranian voters elected moderates in what was, in part, a referendum on the nuclear deal.I know that some say there is just no dealing with Iran  in any way at all  for the foreseeable future. And that is the position of some. After all, Iran is in a competition with Saudi Arabia and its allies for influence over that region.But a more balanced approach toward Iran that serves our national security interests should hardly be a radical idea. We have serious concerns about the nature of the Iranian government, but we have to honest enough, and sometimes we are not, to admit that Saudi Arabia  a repressive regime in its own right  is hardly an example of Jeffersonian democracy.Balancing firmness with willingness to engage with diplomacy in dealing with Iran will not be easy. But it is the wisest course of action to help improve the long-term prospects of stability and peace in the Middle East  and to keep us safe.Lastly, these are but some  not all  of the major issues where the interests of Israel intersect with those of the United States. I would address these issues and challenges as I would most issues and that is by having an honest discussion and by bringing people together.The truth is there are good people on both sides who want peace, And the other truth is there despots and liars on both sides who benefit from continued antagonism.I would conclude by saying there has a disturbing trend among some of the Republicans in this presidential election that take a very, very different approach. And their approach I think would be a disaster for this country. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion  something unprecedented in our country's history.Now this would not only go against everything we stand for as a nation, but also  in terms of our relationship to the rest of the world  it would be a disaster.Let me just conclude by saying this: the issues that I've discussed today are not going to be easily solved. Everybody knows that. But I think the United States has the opportunity, as the most powerful nation on earth, to play an extraordinary role in trying to bring to people together  to try to put together coalitions in the region to destroy ISIS.And that is a responsibility that I, if elected president, would accept in a very, very serious way. We have seen too many wars, too much killing, too much suffering. And let us all together  people of good faith  do everything we can to finally, finally bring peace and stability to that region.Thank you all very much."

But let me be clear: Establishing an unelected oversight board that would be given the power to inflict even more economic pain on the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico would be a move in exactly the wrong direction. It must be defeated.""The economic situation in Puerto Rico will not be improved by closing more schools, firing more teachers, laying-off more workers, slashing pensions and suspending the minimum wage. Instead, Puerto Rico must be given the time it needs to restructure its debt and grow its economy in a fair way.""Congress must act immediately to give Puerto Rico the same authority granted to every municipality in this country to restructure its debt under the supervision of a bankruptcy court.""We must not give in to the demands of vulture funds and Wall Street investment banks who are demanding a 100 percent return on their investments. Instead, these wealthy investors must take a significant haircut. The people in Puerto Rico should not be asked to suffer even more, so that a handful of wealthy investors can become even wealthier. Moreover, if any of Puerto Rico's debt was incurred in violation of its Constitution it must be immediately set aside."""

Bernie Sanders on Monday issued the following statement as minors, parents and asylum seekers fleeing violence continue to be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement:""America has always been a beacon of liberty for those fleeing violence and persecution. Raids separating families are not who we are. Deportation can be a death sentence to detained minors, parents and asylum seekers. Asking children as young as three to represent themselves at hearings is a shameful miscarriage of justice that cannot be allowed to stand. Families deserve fair treatment and our compassion, not a process rigged to expose them to danger. The cruel and inhumane imprisonment and deportation of Central American refugees who have been fleeing violence must end. The president should enact a moratorium on these raids as soon as possible.""The arbitrary separation of families and the possible deportation of Wildin Acosta, a young teenager who fled Honduras after a gang member threatened to kill him; the Bangladeshi and South Asian asylum seekers currently in corporate prisons who are on hunger strike; and the pending deportation of Ladislao Padilla-Ochoa, a father who has lived in Tennessee for almost 20 years are wrong. They must be reunited with their families.""We need an immigration system that unites families, not one that tears them apart.""Sen. Sanders has previously called on the Obama administration to reassess its immigration enforcement initiative and extend Temporary Protected Status to families who have fled violence in Central America. He has introduced legislation that would eliminate quotas for the number of immigrants held in detention and ban private prisons, and cosponsored legislation to guarantee due process for border refugees. Recently, he joined a letter calling for transgender detainees to be protected from abuse, unreasonable strip searches, and sexual assault while in U.S. custody."

Not too long ago, the establishment told us that a $15 minimum wage was unrealistic. Some thought it was 'pie-in-the-sky.' But a grassroots movement led by millions of working people refused to take 'no' for an answer.

That includes ending the subminimum wage for tipped workers and persons with disabilities.""New York is also joining California, New Jersey and Rhode Island in guaranteeing paid family leave. In my view, we must go further by passing the Gillibrand-DeLauro FAMILY Act to guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave to every worker in America. Secretary Clinton opposes this bill. She believes that a $1.61 a week payroll tax on the average worker is too high a price to pay for this legislation. I disagree.""As president, I will proudly stand with working families all across our country and fight for Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and provide paid family leave to every worker in America.

I wish I had been proven wrong about this, but it has now come to light that the extent of Panama's tax avoidance scams is even worse than I had feared.""My opponent, on the other hand, opposed this trade agreement when she was running against Barack Obama for president in 2008. But when it really mattered she quickly reversed course and helped push the Panama Free Trade Agreement through Congress as Secretary of State. The results have been a disaster.""The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election.""It is time for real change. As president, I will use my authority to terminate the Panama Free Trade Agreement within six months.

Bernie Sanders on Friday issued the following statement ahead of Saturday's Nevada Democratic Party convention:""I want to thank my supporters in Nevada. Together, we are creating transformational change in America through honest and dignified discussion of the issues facing our citizens. We share a commitment to electing progressive Democrats up-and-down the ballot in Nevada and across the country and are committed to soundly defeating Donald Trump and the right-wing Republican agenda. Working together respectfully and constructively on Saturday at the Nevada Democratic convention will move us closer to those essential goals."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 17, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Nevada,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday issued the following statement:""It is imperative that the Democratic leadership, both nationally and in the states, understand that the political world is changing and that millions of Americans are outraged at establishment politics and establishment economics. The people of this country want a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent, super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors.""The Democratic Party has a choice. It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change - people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy.""Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a 'penchant for violence.' That is nonsense. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked.""If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned. I am happy to say that has been the case at state conventions in Maine, Alaska, Colorado and Hawaii where good discussions were held and democratic decisions were reached. Unfortunately, that was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place. Among other things:The chair of the convention announced that the convention rules passed on voice vote, when the vote was a clear no-vote. At the very least, the Chair should have allowed for a headcount.The chair allowed its Credentials Committee to en mass rule that 64 delegates were ineligible without offering an opportunity for 58 of them to be heard. That decision enabled the Clinton campaign to end up with a 30-vote majority.The chair refused to acknowledge any motions made from the floor or allow votes on them.The chair refused to accept any petitions for amendments to the rules that were properly submitted.""These are on top of failures at the precinct and county conventions including trying to depose and then threaten with arrest the Clark County convention credentials chair because she was operating too fairly."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 20, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Puerto Rico's Financial Situation,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday issued the following statement on a proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives to put Puerto Rico under control of a congressionally-appointed financial control board:""We must never give an unelected control board the power to balance Puerto Rico's budget on the backs of children, senior citizens, the sick and the most vulnerable people in Puerto Rico while giving the people of Puerto Rico absolutely no say at all in the process.""We cannot allow Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to determine the fate of Puerto Rico by handpicking a majority of the control board's members, while the people of Puerto Rico would be in charge of choosing none. That may make sense to groups representing Wall Street, but it makes absolutely no sense to me.""Among other efforts, what Congress should do is to act immediately to give Puerto Rico the same authority granted to every municipality in this country to restructure its debt under the supervision of a bankruptcy court.""The billionaire hedge fund managers on Wall Street cannot get a 100 percent return on their bonds while workers, senior citizens and children are punished. Wall Street vulture capitalists must not be allowed to get it all.""Today, I am proud to stand in strong opposition to this bill not only with the people of Puerto Rico, but the AFL-CIO, UAW, SEIU, AFSCME, UFCW and other unions that recognize just how bad this bill would be.""We must stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the American citizens of Puerto Rico with the respect and dignity that they deserve."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 23, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on DNC Platform,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Monday on the makeup of a key committee that will draft the party platform for this summer's Democratic National Convention:""We believe that we will have the representation on the platform drafting committee to create a Democratic platform that reflects the views of millions of our supporters who want the party to address the needs of working families in this country and not just Wall Street, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry and other powerful special interests."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 23, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on California Debate,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement on Monday after Hillary Clinton reneged on her commitment to take part in a presidential debate in California in May ahead of the June 7 primary election:""I am disappointed but not surprised by Secretary Clinton's unwillingness to debate before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.""The state of California and the United States face some enormous crises. Democracy, and respect for the voters of California, would suggest that there should be a vigorous debate in which the voters may determine whose ideas they support. I hope Secretary Clinton reconsiders her unfortunate decision to back away from her commitment to debate.""I also would suggest that Secretary Clinton may want to be not quite so presumptuous about thinking that she is a certain winner. In the last several weeks, the people of Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon have suggested otherwise."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 26, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders Following the Kentucky Primary,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Thursday on the primary election results in Kentucky:""We accept the results in Kentucky. We are very pleased that we split the delegates in a state with a closed primary in which independents cannot vote and where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 35 points in 2008.""I thank the people of Kentucky very much for their support."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 27, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Donald Trump's Offer to Debate,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Friday on Donald Trump's on-again, off-again position on a debate:""In recent days, Donald Trump has said he wants to debate, he doesn't want to debate, he wants to debate and, now, he doesn't want to debate.""Given that there are several television networks prepared to carry this debate and donate funds to charity, I hope that he changes his mind once again and comes on board.""There is a reason why in virtually every national and statewide poll I am defeating Donald Trump, sometimes by very large margins and almost always by far larger margins than Secretary Clinton. There is a reason for that reality and the American people should be able to see it up front in a good debate and a clash of ideas."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"May 27, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on the Verizon Settlement,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Friday on the agreement between Verizon and 39,000 striking members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers:""I congratulate the strikers, their unions and Verizon management for reaching an apparent settlement after 45 days. This strike has been emblematic of the growing gap between our largest corporations and front line workers when it comes to living standards and employment security.""I was proud to stand with these workers before and during the strike, and even prouder of the thousands of volunteers from our campaign that joined demonstrations and picket lines for the last six weeks.""I also congratulate Secretary of Labor Tom Perez for bringing the unions and management together in his office and supporting the ongoing negotiations for the past two weeks."""
Bernie Sanders,D,s,"June 2, 2016",Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on Foreign Policy,"MODESTO, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday issued the following statement after Hillary Clinton delivered a speech criticizing Donald Trump's foreign policy vision:""I agree with Secretary Clinton that Donald Trump's foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible. But when it comes to foreign policy, we cannot forget that Secretary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, and that she has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences.""We need a foreign policy based on building coalitions and making certain that the brave American men and women in our military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. That's what I will fight for as president."""
