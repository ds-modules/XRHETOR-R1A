Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 30, 2015",b'Interview with Ed Schultz of MSNBC Regarding Statement of Presidential Candidacy',"b""Schultz: A gentleman who has appeared on the program quite often joins us tonight, backing up a big announcement. Earlier today, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders officially announced he will run as a Democrat for the President of the United States. This makes Senator Sanders the first Democratic challenger to Hillary Clinton. Many will view this as a good day for democracy and the backdrop of all of this today is activism in numerous cities across America. You're looking live at a march in Philadelphia today after marches and protests in New York City last night; this seems to have taken on a life of its own. There will be marches later on today in Baltimore, but this is the scene in Philadelphia. And we start our interview tonight with Senator Sanders on this topic. Senator, good to have you with us. Sanders: Great to be with you.Schultz: Congratulations on this announcement. Certainly, it is a big challenge for you, but I want to go right to today's news, Senator. You're now President of the United States. You see what's unfolding on American streets. What's the problem as you see it, what's the solution? Sanders: Well, the problem is that for many years, police brutality and the killing of innocent people has not been dealt with. That's a fact. The good news is that the American people, not just the African American community, are saying enough is enough, you can't hold people in custody and suddenly find out they're dead. You can't shoot people in the backYou know, in South Carolina, a conservative Southern state, a police officer was charged with murder. I'm a former mayor. I know that being a cop is not an easy job. But when police officers misbehave, they've got to be held accountable. The other good news is that all over this country, when people are beginning to stand up and say enough is enough, change is taking about. You ask me what I would do as president? Number one, we would fight hard for police reform, for body cameras, for the training that police officers need to know how to treat people who are in captivity with respect. But the underlying issue in terms of Freddie Gray's community, as I understand it, do you know what the unemployment rate is there? Schultz: It's extremely high. [crosstalk]  and they've lost so many manufacturing jobs over the last 15 years, the city, the community has not found a way to deal with it.Sanders: And you can have every police officer in America being a Harvard Law School graduate and you're not going to address this issue unless we give people some hope, unless we give people some opportunity. That means jobs, education, you can't turn your back on neglected parts of America.Schultz: What would you do if you're president when it comes to revitalizing communities like this that are having socioeconomic problems? Sanders: We've already introduced legislation, for a start we would invest a trillion dollars in our infrastructure. Putting 13 million  creating 13 million new jobs, rebuilding our roads and bridges, water systems, wastewater plants to create a whole lot of jobs. I've introduce with Congressman John Conyers of Michigan a $5.5 billion job training, job creating program for young people. Youth unemployment in America is 17 percent. African American youth unemployment is totally off the charts. We've got to put young people to work. We've got to give them an education rather than putting them in jail.Schultz: What did you think of the riots the other night? I want to know, has the social structure gotten to the point where this is the only outlet these people had at that particular time? I've heard of a lot of officials say, well, this is in Baltimore, they're peaceful for a week until the cameras showed up. But it did happen. The riots did happen and it was in Baltimore. So what's the solution? Sanders: This is what I think. I think there's a massive amount of anger and discontent. I think it has more than just what happened to Freddie Gray. I think it is people are saying, how come we are living in the richest country in the history of the world, our kids can't go to college, we don't have child care for our kids, we don't have any jobs. I think that's significantly what it's about.Schultz: All right. Senator, why are you running, doing this? Sanders: I tell you why I'm doing it. This is my first day out there, and I'm feeling good about it. This country today, Ed, faces more crises than we have faced since the Great Depression and if you throw in climate change, which the scientists are telling us is the major global crisis that we face, is probably worse off than we were in the Great Depression. I don't see people talking about this issue. I don't see politicians working on this issue. And I think it's time that we address it. And getting back to your point. The only way that change takes place in my view is when millions of people stand up and say, enough is enough. And it's not just with police brutality. Enough is enough when the great middle class of this country is disappearing. How does it happen that we have more technology and increased productivity and people are working longer hours for low wages and we have more people living in poverty than almost anytime in the history of America? How does that happen? How does it happen that 99 percent of all new income in this country goes to the top 1 percent? How does it happen that the top tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? These are the central issues facing this country and on top of that as a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, we are at a moment where billionaires are about to buy the United States government and undermine American democracy.Schultz: So why would you be a better president, a better nominee than Hillary Clinton? Sanders: Well I'll let Hillary Clinton speak for herself.Schultz: Let's talk about how she's handled a big issue, and that is trade. Today, her communications team or at least an excerpt from her book saying that she stands with Elizabeth Warren when it comes to trade and did an excerpt. I think the American people are looking more for a direct answer, which you have been very direct on this. You are against Trade Promotional Authority and you are against the TPP. Because the TPA would lead to a bad trade deal. So where do you stand on this?And right after President Obama, after the midterms took place and the Republicans took over the Senate, this is the first thing that Mitch McConnell talked about the day after press conference, saying there's areas that they can work on with the president, one of them is trade. That was supposed to be a slam dunk. We're now almost at May 1st and they don't have the votes in the House. Does that give you any confidence [inaudible] help you? [crosstalk]Sanders: Absolutely. I've been going around the country, talking about the trade issue. I don't have to talk about it. People increasingly know about it. And they are saying, look, NAFTA was a disaster. CAFTA was a disaster. Permanent noble trade relations with China was a disaster. Why do we want to continue down a path where the previous agreements have led to the loss of millions of decent paying jobs? So if you're asking me should the American worker be forced to compete against somebody in Vietnam who has a minimum wage of 56 cents an hour, you know what the answer is? No. We've got to demand that corporate America start reinvesting in the United States of America, not China. It is a huge issue. I voted against all of these agreements. I will help lead the opposition against the TPP.Schultz: What about the money, can you raise enough money to run a competitive campaign? Sanders: One of the hesitancies I had about going forward was just that. Clearly, I'm not going to have anywhere near the same amount of money as the other candidates who are going to be probably raising over a billion dollars, but you know what? I think that we can raise a lot of small donations today. We opened up our website. We announced candidacy, berniesanders.com. I believe in the first hours, we've raised over half a million dollars. So I think there is a lot of potential out there from people who say, Bernie, I can't give you a million dollars or a thousand dollars, I can give you $50. I think we can raise the money we need to run a strong campaign.Schultz: So to run a campaign, there's an admission here you certainly won't have the television presence that Hillary Clinton's campaign will have, and I have to keep bringing up Hillary Clinton because she's the only one in the race besides you. And it might turn out to be that's just it. So what do you think it takes to run a competitive campaign to organize? Sanders: I'll tell you what it takes. What it requires is and what I have always done in Vermont is run strong grassroots campaigns. Last campaign I ran, I didn't put a nickel, not a nickel on TV ads. We put all of our money into grassroots organizations. I got 71 percent of the vote. So I think what we have to do is go out there, get good organizers, build a strong volunteer base, work with the labor movement, work with the environmental community, work with the women's community and mobilize people in all across this country to stand up and fight back to the billionaires.Schultz: Do you expect the support of labor? Sanders: I think we will have certainly some labor, absolutely. Schultz: Some?Sanders: It's hard to say at this point. I have talked to some of the unions. Some of them are sympathetic. Some of them may not be. We will see.Schultz: But they're all against the TPP.Sanders: Without exception.Schultz: All of them? Sanders: Every single union.Schultz: This is their issue.Sanders: Rich Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO recently reported and said, again, this is a key issue for the AFL-CIO.Schultz: How would President Bernie Sanders be different from President Obama? Sanders: I'll tell you. First of all, I have a lot of respect for President Obama. He's a friend. I have disagreed with him on tax policy. I was on the floor of the Senate a few years ago for 8.5 hours, arguing that he should not continue some of Bush's tax breaks for the rich. And obviously, we have strong disagreements on the TPP. Where I think the president has made his biggest mistake is that after his historic and brilliant 2008 presidential campaign, in which he rallied the American people, brought young people into the political process, what he did after he was elected is kind of say, hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. You're gone. And now I'm going to sit down and argue and try to negotiate with John Boehner. I think that was a terrible mistake because here's the truth, Ed. And I'm the only candidate maybe will ever say this. No president, not the smartest, best human being in the world can do it alone. You cannot take on this, the power that is in Washington, the billionaires and their lobbyists and the military industrial complex, all this money and power, you can't do it. You need a mass movement of Americans who are looking in Congress and will say directly, if you don't make college education affordable, you're out of here. Because we know it's going on. If you don't end these huge tax breaks for the rich, you're out of here. So what we have got to do  and I call it a political revolution  is raise political consciousness in this country. Make people aware of what's going on in Washington, the importance of politics, get them involved in the political process and have them stand up to the big money and trust them today have so much power.Schultz: If you're President of the United States, what would be your policy in dealing with ISIS? Sanders: This is what I think. ISIS is obviously a barbaric organization that has to be defeated, but I will do everything that I can to prevent the United States getting involved in another war in that country. Two wars is enough. We Schultz: Can they be defeated without a ground war? Sanders: No, but I think the people who have to wage the ground war are not troops from the United States of America. You have Saudi Arabia sitting right in that area, which has  nobody knows this  the third largest military budget in the world. Third largest. You have other very wealthy and powerful countries sitting in that region. They have got to wage the fight for the soul of Islam. We should be supportive along with other European countries. Give them support. I support airstrikes, special missions, but at the end of the day, it's going to be  have to be the Muslim nations themselves who are leading the fight with our support.Schultz: You say you support airstrikes. What about the use of drones and the way they're handled in the Obama administration? Can they do that?Sanders: Well, I don't think it's a yes or no. Clearly, it has been counterproductive when we kill innocent people, including Americans. But they are one tool that I think is in the arsenal but clearly, in many instances, they have backfired on us.Schultz: So drone strikes would continue then if you were president? Sanders: In a very selective way.Schultz: Would the policy change, would there be a different vetting process on how to get to that? Sanders: Look, we have had some success with drones and we have had a lot of failures with drones. I think we have to reanalyze what we're doing there.Schultz: Senator Sanders, you have been really the fighter out front and the leader when it comes to the conversation of income inequality in America. Wall Street. Would you be in favor of reinstating or advocating for the reimplementation of Glass-Steagall, was that the beginning of our problems, the break-up of the commercial and investment banks? Sanders: Well, Ed, if you want to go to YouTube, you can see a dialogue I had when I was in the House with Alan Greenspan and taking him on, he was talking about all of the wonderful benefits of the deregulation of Wall Street. I told him he was dead wrong then and he was. I was, as a member of the House, one of the leaders in opposition of this deregulation, I think it was a tragic mistake. But this is what I'll tell you. I would go further than just reinstating Glass-Steagall. I think what we've got to appreciate is when we have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to about 60 percent of the GDP of America, you know what? Let's be honest. You can't regulate that.Schultz: You'd break up the banks.Sanders: Absolutely. Absolutely. If they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist. They are issuing 50 percent of the mortgages and two-thirds of the credit cards in this country. If Teddy Roosevelt were the president, what do you think he'd do? Schultz: Well, he's probably do that.Sanders: That's right.Schultz: OK.Senator Sanders, stay with us. [commercial break]Schultz: From the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, to the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders has taken a very interesting and clear path to this very day. The senator joins me again this evening here on THE ED SHOW. Senator, we never talk about you that much. We're always talking about issues. Why did you get into politics? Why are you doing this for a living? Sanders: You know, Ed, I grew up in a lower middle class family. My dad came to this country from Poland without a nickel in his pocket and he never made much money. We lived in a 3.5-room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn before I moved to Vermont. It was clear to me as a kid, the impact that money had on my family, the stress, the arguments that my parents had, seeing other kids having benefits that certain other kids didn't have. And so from my earliest years I understood the importance of income security, the need for people to have at least a minimum standard of living to enjoy the kind of life that they're entitled to. That's kind of what's motivated me.Schultz: That's motivated you throughout the years.Sanders: I never forgot those experiences.Schultz: Hey, it's interesting. Some of the sound bites that you had back in yesteryear matched to your philosophy today.Has it always been that way?Sanders: Yes, the people of Vermont will tell you, oh, god, not again, he's saying the same thing for 30 years, but here's what  Schultz: Your focus on issues is the same Sanders:  but the other thing that I think the report indicated, more and more people are catching on. I was talking about these issues 20 years ago before it was popular but this issue of income and wealth inequality, Ed, it's not only an economic issue or a political issue, it's a moral issue. It is a moral issue. And by the way, you know the guy who speaks about that most forcefully in this world? It's the pope, Pope Francis. He raises this as a moral issue. Are we content to have the highest rate in this country of childhood poverty and at the same time have a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires? That is a moral issue and I think the American people say, no, that's not who we are as a people.Schultz: When you go to Iowa and you say that, what's your reaction? What's the reaction of the folks? Sanders: I got to tell you, it may be self-serving and it's people who come out to our meetings. But the response has been really extraordinary. Not only in Iowa, all over this country. People are saying enough is enough. Think about all the things we can do as a nation. Why we can't we guarantee health care to all people, when every other major country does it?In Germany, many other countries, college tuition is free. Why isn't it free in America? Why do we have the highest rate of childhood poverty when other countries have rates much lower than we have? Why don't we have pay equity for women workers? Why aren't we leading the world in transforming our energy system in terms of climate change? We could do that.Are we dumb? Are we lazy? Not the case.Schultz: I want to focus on college. It is expensive. It's exorbitant at this point. Students get out, strapped with debt. The American dream escapes them early on if they're ever going to own their own home and have any kind of financial independence. What would you do differently? Sanders: I'll tell you what I would do exactly and we're going to introduce legislation to do it. It will cost us about $70 billion a year of federal money or money in general to provide free tuition in every public college and university in America, $70 billion a year. The Republicans want to give $269 billion in tax breaks to the richest 5,000 families by eliminating the estate tax. We lose $110 billion every year because corporations stash their money in the Cayman Islands and pay nothing in federal taxes. I happen to believe if we're going to be competitive in the global economy, we need the best educated workforce, we need to encourage kids to go to college, graduate school, regardless of their income. We can come up with that money and that's what I'll be fighting for.Schultz: What's on your schedule the next week? Sanders: We're going to be speaking to the AFL-CIO on Saturday in New Hampshire. We have a brunch in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday. We'll be doing a national TV show. We'll be working very hard in the United States Senate on the ranking member of the Budget Committee. This Republican budget is beyond belief. Tax breaks for billionaires, cuts for working families, throwing 27 million people off of health insurance. We'll raise hell about that issue as well.Schultz: All right. Senator Bernie Sanders, obviously we'll visit again. Great to have you with us tonight. Thank you so much.Sanders: Great to be with you."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 30, 2015",b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN Regarding Statement of Presidential Candidacy',"b""Blitzer: I want to move to politics right now and the announcement by the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, that he is now officially a candidate for president of the United States. Here's where he stands, by the way, in our latest CNN/ORC poll. This poll was taken right after Hillary Clinton declared that she was a candidate for president. Clinton, 69 percent, Vice President Biden who says at least not yet that he's running, at 11 percent, Senator Sanders, he's third with 5 percent. Senator Sanders is with us right now. Senator, thanks very much for joining us. An important day for you. We've been speaking about this for weeks and you were telling us you were thinking of doing it. Now you've decided to go ahead and do it. I want to talk about the politics in a moment, but I want to get your thoughts on Baltimore first. We've been watching this very closely. If you were president of the United States, what would you do about this? It's a crisis, not just in Baltimore, but in a lot of other communities around the country. Sanders: Well, you know, it's primarily a local and state issue, but the president has the bully pulpit and the president has the eyes of the nation. Look, the issue here is - I was a mayor for eight years. Being a cop is a very, very difficult job. But the word has got to get out that when police act inappropriately, and, of course, in this case, there has to be a thorough investigation, but for too many years, too many mostly black suspects have been treated terribly and, in some cases, murdered. That is unacceptable. And police officers have got to be held accountable for their actions. Second of all, in the neighborhood where this gentleman lives, as I understand it, the unemployment rate is over 50 percent, over 50 percent. What we have got to do as a nation is understand that we have got to create millions of jobs to put people back to work to make sure that kids are in schools and not in jails. So, short term, we've got to make sure that police officers have cameras. We've got to make sure that we have real police reform so that suspects are treated with respect. Long term, we've got to make sure that our young people are working, they're in school, they're not hanging out on street corners. Blitzer: So as president, though, what do you do - I mean how do you - how do you fix those problems? We've been hearing about those problems, as you and I know, for decades. Sanders: Well, I - I, along with John Conyers of Michigan, I've introduced legislation which would create a million jobs for young people in this country in some of the hardest pressed areas of America. Real unemployment is a serious problem in this country. Got to put our people back to work. I think the federal government has got to work with state and local governments to make sure that we move towards what I called in Burlington, Vermont, when I was the mayor, we called community policing, where police are per received as part of the community, the good guys, rather than as infloppers, people who are from the outside coming in. Blitzer: Let's talk about the race for the White House. Why do you think you're more qualified than Hillary Clinton to get the Democratic nomination? Sanders: Well, first of all, I've known Hillary Clinton for some 25 years. I like her. I respect her. What I believe is that this country today faces more serious problems that any time since the Great Depression and at the top of the list is the disappearing middle class. For 40 years, the middle class has been disappeared, and we have seen a massive transfer of wealth, trillions of dollars from working families to the top one tenth of 1 percent. That is the issue. And then on top of that you've got Citizen's United and a political system now where billionaires are buying elections, spending hundreds of millions of dollars. I have been a vigorous opponent of that trend. My history, my beliefs are that you stand with working families and you say to the billionaire class -Blitzer: And Hillary Clinton doesn't? Sanders: Well, I'm just saying what I say, you know, take - you mobilize people and you say, enough is enough, the billionaires can't have it all, all right? I believe we should break up the Wall Street banks. I think they are - if they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist. Blitzer: So what's the difference on policy, not - forget about politics, on policy between you and Hillary Clinton? Sanders: Well, there are some clear examples. [inaudible].Blitzer: What are some examples?Sanders: Well, I voted against the war in Iraq. Not only did I vote against the war in Iraq, I believed and I spoke out, I led the effort against that war because I had the feeling that what did happen would happen. Blitzer: So does that - her vote disqualify her? Sanders: No, it doesn't disqualify her. Look, we will have that debate over issues. I believe, as I said a moment ago, that you should take on Wall Street. They have too much power right now. Blitzer: Is she ready to do that? Sanders: Well, you'll have to ask her, Wolf, I'm not going to speak for her. Blitzer: Well, what do you think?Sanders: No, I'm not going to say that. I mean I -Blitzer: All right, so you voted against the war. She voted for it. What else is a difference between you and Hillary Clinton? Sanders: All right, I happen to think that climate change is the major environmental crisis facing this planet. I voted against the Keystone Pipeline. I don't think you should transport across America some of the dirtiest fuel in the world. I don't know that she has spoken out on that.In terms of trade, right now I'm helping to lead the opposition against the TPP. I voted against all of these disastrous trade agreements which have led to the shutdown of factories in America and jobs moving to China and other low wage countries. That's my view. She'll have to -Blitzer: As secretary of state, she supported - we haven't heard from her lately on her position -Sanders: And your job is to ask her but, you know, I - so those are some of the areas. But mostly the American people will have to make a decision. I believe that we have an economic and political crisis in this country. I think the billionaire class is getting virtually all of the gains. I think they have too much political power. I think the people of this country have to come together, stand up to them. Blitzer: What about campaign fund raising? I know you - there's no way you're going to compete with her when it comes to collecting money, right?Sanders: I agree. Blitzer: All right. So she's going to have a huge, huge advantage. Sanders: Right.Blitzer: How do you deal with that? Sanders: All right, let me take a step back because you're asking a very profound question. The real question is, can any candidate in this country who represents working families, who is not a billionaire, who is not beholden to big money, can that candidate in this day and age win an election? It's not just Bernie Sanders. I don't know the answer. Blitzer: Because last week or two weeks ago when we spoke you said you were thinking of running. The big question is, could you raise enough money to be competitive? Sanders: That's right. That's right. Blitzer: So can you raise enough money to compete with Hillary Clinton? Sanders: Well, we are just sending out a social media message on berniesanders.com. From what I'm understanding, we're raising hundreds of thousands of dollars today. Clearly we're not going to be having the billions of dollars that our opponents will have. But I do believe, and I would not have entered this race if, A, I didn't think we could win, and, B, if we could not raise enough money to run a strong campaign. Blitzer: If there's a billionaire out there who's a liberal and likes you, wants to give you a ton of money, is that OK? Sanders: I doubt that there is.Blitzer: Let's say there is. Let's say there's some George Soros type that  [crosstalk]  really feels that you're best for the country  [crosstalk]Sanders: I am not supportive of a super PAC. Blitzer: You wouldn't accept that kind of support? Sanders: No. No. Blitzer: Really? Sanders: Well, I don't know. Maybe if it was you, Wolf. [crosstalk]Blitzer: I don't have that kind of money. Sanders: Frankly, it is vulgar to me that we are having a war of billionaires. Sheldon Adelson is versing the Koch brothers. People did not die to create a democratic system where it's a war between billionaires. I will get the vast amount of money from small, individual contributions. That's how I've always done it. That's how I'll do it this time. Blitzer: You're running as a Democrat, not as and Independent? Sanders: I am the longest-serving Independent in the history of the United States Congress, I will be active in the Democratic primary process. Blitzer: Looking forward to debating not only Hillary Clinton, but the other Democrats who are interested? Sanders: I am excited about getting around the country, excited about the debate. I've never run a negative ad in my life. I detest the ugly, 30 second ads. I hope we can have a strong issue-oriented campaign and I hope the media allows us that opportunity, not to get into political gossip, but to debate the enormous issues facing working families. Blitzer: Look forward to hearing the debates, and good luck. Sanders: Thank you.Blitzer: Bernie Sanders, the Independent Senator from Vermont who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. Is that right? Sanders: Yes. Thank you.Blitzer: Thank you for joining us."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 30, 2015",b'Interview with Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC Regarding Statement of Presidential Candidacy',"b""Sanders (from video clip): I believe that in a democracy, what elections are about a serious debate over serious issues, not political gossip, not making campaigns into soap operas. This is not the Red Sox versus the Yankees. This is the debate over major issues the American people. Honest people.Mitchell: Senator Bernie Sanders making his first speech as a presidential candidate only moments ago at a news conference outside Capitol Hill. The Independent senator will run in the Democrat field in 2016. Yesterday I caught up with the senator before his big announce to the talk about why. [videorecording of interview begins]Mitchell: What is inspiring you to challenge Hillary Clinton, who is of course the front runner by everyone's accounts? Sanders: Well, it's not taking on Hillary Clinton that's interesting. It's addressing the very, very serious crises facing our country, crises that have to be addressed. Look, for the last forty years, the American middle class has been disappearing. We have people working longer hours for lower wages. And at the same time we have seen huge increase in income and wealth inequality, such that the top 1 percent are now earning 99 percent of all new income generated in this country, and the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That is not what an American economy should be about. And that spills over to, Andrea, campaign finance, where billionaires, as a result of Citizens United Supreme Court decision, are literally buying candidates and buying elections. And that's not what American democracy is supposed to be about. Mitchell: But Hillary Clinton says that she is the champion of everyday Americans. Why isn't she the best standard bearer for the party? Sanders: Well, we'll let the American people make that decision. I have been working the last 25, 30 years on behalf of working families. I have stood up and fought against disastrous trade agreements, for example, which have shut down plants in America and moved our jobs to China and other low wage countries. I've been leader on the issue of climate change, against the Keystone pipeline. I have introduced legislation which breaks up the largest Wall Street banks, which today have so much economic and political power over the nation. So I'm out there to talk about real issues, to defend my record. And I'm sure that Secretary Clinton will do her best to make her case. And let the American people make their decisions.Mitchell: Her campaign is supposedly going to raise $1.5 billion. Yet she says she wants campaign finance reform and a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending. Is that authentic? Sanders: Well, let me be  you'll be the first to know we're not going to raise $1.5 billion. I think we can generate a reasonable amount of money through small donations. In the past, I have received a higher percentage of small donations than any other member of the United States Senate. But my Senate ought to be millionaires; are not going to be billionaires. And we will be heavily outspent. Mitchell: What about the money her campaign relies on from the same people who contributed to the Clinton Foundation? Do you have concerns about failures to disclose about foreign money going into the Foundation, the family foundation, while she was Secretary of State? Sanders: Well, Andrea, I do. But I have a broader concern about the unbelievably horrendous role that big money is playing on all of the campaigns. I think raising questions about Secretary Clinton's funding is legitimate. But I think we have ask what motives are of the Koch brothers and Republican billionaires who frankly want to end Social Security, end Medicare, end Medicaid, and give more tax breaks to billionaires. Mitchell: She has come out very strongly against the wage disparity, where CEOs and hedge fund executives are making such extraordinary amounts of money. Yet she was obviously the senator from New York, the senator from Wall Street. Does she have a problem here in being credible? Sanders: Well, look, this is an issue that I have been talking about for years. In the United States, CEOs make 300 times what their workers make. And I think that is simply immoral and it's an issue that has to be dealt with, and it's an issue that we have been part of legislation dealing with. Mitchell: Now, you're an Independent in the Senate. You're running as a Democrat. How do you justify running as a Democrat when you are an Independent? Sanders: Well, that's fair question. I've always been elected in Vermont as an Independent, but I will be running, in a sense, as an independent Democrat within the Democrat primary process. And the reason is pretty simple. I am not a billionaire. To run outside of the two party system would require enormous sums of money and a great expenditure of energy and time just to get on the ballot. So I think right now the best path forward to win this election, to raise the important issues that the American people are deeply concerned about  the need to create jobs, the need for health care for all, the need to deal with climate change  I can do that best running within the Democratic primary process. Mitchell: Will you support her if she does turn out to be the Democratic nominee? Sanders: Well, that's a little bit premature and we will see what happens. But I will most certainly not be supporting any of these right wing Republican candidates. That's for sure. Mitchell: Senator Sanders, good luck out there on the campaign trail. Thank you so much, sir.Sanders: Thank you, Andrea."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 6, 2015","b'Interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN\'s ""New Day""'","b""CUOMO: Senator Sanders, welcome to the race. Good luck to you. The big question is, why you, not Hillary? SANDERS: Well, I think, for the last 30 years, since I was mayor and a congressman in the Senate, what I have been focusing on is the needs of working families and the middle class. And right now, Chris, we have a situation where, for the last 40 years, the middle class of this country has been disappearing, people are working longer hours for low wages and yet almost all of the new income, all of the new wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Ninety-nine percent of all new income, in terms of wealth, the distribution of wealth, it's absolutely obscene. The top .1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. I am prepared to take on the billionaire class, and I think that's what has to happen if we're going to see a middle class in this country expand rather than continue to shrink. CUOMO: Amen say families all across the country, senator, but Hillary says the same thing, that she's for everyday Americans. Why Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton? SANDERS: Well, I think people have got to - first of all, let me tell you this, Chris. I've known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I like her and I respect her. And I am running for working families in the middle class, not against Hillary Clinton. But I think people have got to look at the record. I have voted against every disastrous trade agreement coming down the pike and helping to lead the effort against this Trans Pacific Partnership, which will mean the outsourcing of more good paying jobs to low wage countries. People have got to look at Secretary Clinton's record. Later today I'm going to continue my effort to call for a breakup of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street, who, in my view, if they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist. They have simply too much power. I am calling for and will introduce legislation that will provide a free college university education, public colleges and universities in this country. No tuition. We have introduced legislation that says to the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, you know what, you're going to have to start paying your fair share of taxes. You can't stash your money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. I've been a leader in terms of climate change, introduced legislation for the first time that would have a carbon tax and say, this is a globe crisis. America has got to move away from fossil fuel and carbon. Those are my views and people have to judge Secretary Clinton's views. CUOMO: Testing it, it would be, tax and spend, senator. That's what you're saying. More typical lefty rhetoric. You're going to tax the rich, punish them for doing well and just dump it into programs that never work. SANDERS: Well, Chris, the truth is, that for the last 25 years there has been a huge transfer of wealth in this country from the middle class and working families. I'm talking about trillions of dollars. So the slice of the pie for the middle class has gotten smaller and all of that money has gone to the top 0.1 percent. And you compound that with this disastrous Citizens United decision in which billionaires are now able literally to control the political process in this country. I am very proud - I've got to tell you this - we announced five days ago on berniesanders.com. We sent out hundreds of thousands of messages. And on our first day we received $1.5 million in campaign contributions. Do you know what the average contribution was, Chris?CUOMO: What was it?SANDERS: $43. How's that?CUOMO: So you're saying you're not going to be about the big money, but you have that big Supreme Court case, Citizens United. I mean that - that says that money is speech and they can play the game and it seems like everybody takes money in politics these days. You'll never change it. SANDERS: No, Chris, we - look, Chris, let's be very clear. When you have a handful of billionaires able to spend as much money as they want, supporting their candidates, so people like the Koch who are extreme right wing, what you are looking - and let's be clear - is the undermining of American democracy and moving our nation to an oligarchic form of society - and I mean that very seriously - where a handful of billionaires will determine who are elected officials are. We're not going to do that. I'm not going to take - establish a super PAC. We're getting small contributions from working people. I think we can raise the kinds of money we need, not to outspend our opponents, that won't happen, but to run a credible and, in fact, winning campaign. CUOMO: Do you think that you can match Hillary's position on immigration? She says full path to citizenship for the undocumented. It will be unpopular with the right. It will be unpopular with some in the middle. What do you say? SANDERS: Well, I have - I haven't seen her position in detail, but what I believe is, you know, we have 11 billion undocumented people in this country. I voted for a comprehensive immigration reform. I support comprehensive immigration reform. And that's what we should do.CUOMO: Full path to citizenship or qualified? SANDERS: Over a period of years, a full path of citizenship. CUOMO: So over a period of years and then you make the adjustments within it?SANDERS: Right.CUOMO: Now, Hillary Clinton says, I'm going to take on the big banks. I'm against this super wealthy class. I'm every day Americans. I'm going to do the same stuff Bernie does, I just sound different than he does. What do you say? SANDERS: Well, again, you know, Chris, that's for the American people to decide. I think you have to look at my record. There is, in my lifetime, political life, no special interests that we have not taken on. I was the first member of the United States Congress when I was in the House to take on the pharmaceutical industry and tell people in my state and around the country, you know what, let's go to Canada and we can buy prescription drugs at a significantly lower price than we can in the United States. I have introduced legislation which says, not only are we not going to cut Social Security. You know what we have to do? We have so many low income seniors, we have to expand Social Security. You know what we have to do? We have to tell, in terms of the individual taxpayers, that these hedge fund guys are going to have to start paying their fair share. So I think if you look detail by detail at my record, I think you'll find it is a very strong record and standing up for people who are kind of voiceless today, who have given up on the political process, who don't have much power. That's my view. CUOMO: How do you get them out on the polls? SANDERS: Ah.CUOMO: Because when you say things about expanding entitlements and giving more to the have nots, that's unpopular. It sounds like it's expensive. And the people who vote may not like it.SANDERS: I disagree with you, Chris. First of all, it is not expensive in the sense that if you say to people all over this country, should large profitable multinational corporations, who today are not paying a nickel in federal taxes because they're stashing their money in Cayman Islands and other tax havens, start paying their fair share? The American people, across the political spectrum, say, yes, they should. We're losing well over $100 billion every single year because of those taxes. I've introduced legislation that would end that. Talk to Warren Buffett, one of the richest guys in the world. He says, you know, it's absurd. My effective tax rate is lower than my secretaries. The American people understand that. So what we have got to do is spend money intelligently. We have got to make college affordable for our young people if we're going to compete in the global economy. I'll tell you what else we need to do. Real unemployment in this country is not 5.5 percent, it's 11 percent. We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that, in terms of roads, bridges, water systems, rail, airports, we can put some 13 million people back to work. And that's the kind of agenda that I'm going to be fighting for.CUOMO: Bernie Sanders, you're in the race. Senator, there are a lot of issues to cover, certainly foreign (ph) as well, but this is a start. Thank you for joining us on NEW DAY. Good luck going forward. SANDERS: Chris, thank you very much."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 11, 2015",b'Interview with Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC',"b'MITCHELL: Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, Independent Senator who strongly opposes the trade deal. On Friday, President Obama criticized fellow Democrats fighting the deal, especially Elizabeth Warren, saying they\'re plain wrong. So far Hillary Clinton is trying to stay out of the fray. Senator Sanders joins me now. Thank you, Senator. Thanks for being with us. SANDERS: My pleasure. MITCHELL: Tell me why you\'re right and President Obama is wrong. SANDERS: I\'ll tell you why. Andrea, the middle class of this country has been disappearing for 40 years. Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, we have millions of Americans who are working longer hours for low wages. Since 2001, we have lost some 60,000 factories in America and millions of good paying manufacturing jobs. Why is that? How did that happen? Well, there are a number of reasons. But it think central to that are disastrous trade agreements, which have allowed corporate America to shut down in this country, move to Mexico, move to China, move to other low wage countries, produce their products there and then bring those back into the United States. The TPP, in my view, is a continuation of disastrous trade policies. Enough is enough. We need new approaches to trade which creates jobs in America and not in China. MITCHELL: Of course, what the president says is that things would be worse if not for trade agreements, that this trade agreement is better than previous trade agreements, has better protections and that it\'s wrong to blame all the ills of the shrinking -- growing wage disparity, shrinking wage increases, shrinking manufacturing base on trade agreements. SANDERS: Well, again, I was on the floor of the Senate a couple of weeks ago. You know what I was doing? I was reading the quotes from what people like President Clinton and Mitch McConnell and all of the advocates of unfitted free trade, all oft he right-wing think tanks, all of the corporate people, all of the wonderful things that they promised us if we pass free trade with China or [inaudible] et cetera, et cetera. It turned out that in almost every instance they were wrong.I\'m not saying that trade alone is the reason why the middle class is disappearing. I am saying, and we have all kinds of economic studies to back it up, that it\'s one of the central factors. Look, nobody doubts that corporations have shut down in America and gone to low wage countries. It makes sense to them. Why do they want to pay an American worker $15 to $20 an hour when you can go to Vietnam? You know what the minimum wage in Vietnam is? It\'s 56 cents an hour there. That\'s what corporate America wants. So I think when you have all of the corporations, when you have Wall Street and the drug companies telling us that this is a really good agreement and meanwhile, you have trade unionists and environmentalists saying this is not a good trade agreement, I will listen to those people who represent workers, not large corporations. MITCHELL: Here\'s President Obama. He was, as you know, at Nike headquarters in an export state, Oregon, which is in favor of trade deals, and then sat down with Matt Bai and here\'s what he had to say about Elizabeth Warren. [begin video clip]PRESIDENT OBAMA: The notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure we don\'t repeat what happened in 2007-2008. Then I sign a provision that would unravel it? I\'d have to be pretty stupid. It doesn\'t make any sense. This is pure speculation. She and I both taught law school. One of the things you do as a law professor is you spin out hypotheticals. This is all hypothetical, speculative.[end video clip]MITCHELL: So, it\'s just hypothetical? SANDERS: I\'m not a law professor, but this is what I know. Within this provision, within this agreement, there will be provisions for investor state relationships. What this agreement will allow is for corporations to sue governments, local, state, federal, countries around the world, if they\'re inhibiting the future profits of that corporation.Let me give you an example of what has happened. In the tiny country of Uruguay, they have - pass strong regulations trying to keep their children from smoking and get hooked on cigarettes. This has threatened the prophets of Philip Morris. Philip Morris has taken them to an international tribunal in order to get back the profits they would lose. This is what it contained in the TPP and I think that\'s an outrage. Governments have the right to protect the health of the environment of their people. MITCHELL: Just briefly, Senator, I wanted to ask you -- one of your opponents, your most prominent opponent, Hillary Clinton, according to her officials to Phil Rucker of ""The Washington Post,"" they\'re not going to have former President Bill Clinton campaign for her. Is that a relief for you, or would you rather see him out there? SANDERS: No, I\'d love to see him to be debating my wife, Jane. [laughter] She\'s pretty smart. MITCHELL: I love that. She\'d have to be to keep up with you, Senator. Or keep ahead of you, I should say. Thank you very much. Senator Bernie Sanders.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 26, 2015","b'Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Burlington, Vermont'","b'Thank you all very much for being here and for all the support that you have given me over the years: as the mayor of this great city, as Vermont\'s only congressman and now as a U.S. senator. Thanks also to my longtime friends and fellow Vermonters Bill McKibben, Brenda Torpey, Donna Bailey, Mike O\'Day and Ben and Jerry for all that you do  and for your very generous remarks. Thanks also to Jenny Nelson for moderating this event and for your leadership in Vermont agriculture.I also want to thank my family: My wife Jane, my brother Larry, my children Levi, Heather, Carina and Dave for their love and support, and my seven beautiful grandchildren  Sonny, Cole, Ryleigh, Grayson, Ella, Tess and Dylan who provide so much joy in my life.Today, here in our small state  a state that has led the nation in so many ways  I am proud to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America.Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally.Today, we stand here and say loudly and clearly that; ""Enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people, and not to a handful of billionaires, their Super-PACs and their lobbyists.""Brothers and sisters: Now is not the time for thinking small. Now is not the time for the same old  same old establishment politics and stale inside-the-beltway ideas.Now is the time for millions of working families to come together, to revitalize American democracy, to end the collapse of the American middle class and to make certain that our children and grandchildren are able to enjoy a quality of life that brings them health, prosperity, security and joy  and that once again makes the United States the leader in the world in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for a world of peace.My fellow Americans: This country faces more serious problems today than at any time since the Great Depression and, if you include the planetary crisis of climate change, it may well be that the challenges we face now are direr than any time in our modern history.Here is my promise to you for this campaign. Not only will I fight to protect the working families of this country, but we\'re going to build a movement of millions of Americans who are prepared to stand up and fight back. We\'re going to take this campaign directly to the people  in town meetings, door to door conversations, on street corners and in social media  and that\'s BernieSanders.com by the way. This week we will be in New Hampshire, Iowa and Minnesota  and that\'s just the start of a vigorous grassroots campaign.Let\'s be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Jeb Bush or anyone else. This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs. As someone who has never run a negative political ad in his life, my campaign will be driven by issues and serious debate; not political gossip, not reckless personal attacks or character assassination. This is what I believe the American people want and deserve. I hope other candidates agree, and I hope the media allows that to happen. Politics in a democratic society should not be treated like a baseball game, a game show or a soap opera. The times are too serious for that.Let me take a minute to touch on some of the issues that I will be focusing on in the coming months, and then give you an outline of an Agenda for America which will, in fact, deal with these problems and lead us to a better future.Income and Wealth Inequality: Today, we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little for most of us because almost all of that wealth is owned and controlled by a tiny handful of individuals. In America we now have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth, and the gap between the very rich and everyone is wider than at any time since the 1920s. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. And we will address it.Let me be very clear. There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. There is something profoundly wrong when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about. This has got to change and, as your president, together we will change it.Economics: But it is not just income and wealth inequality. It is the tragic reality that for the last 40 years the great middle class of our country  once the envy of the world  has been disappearing. Despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity, median family income is almost $5,000 less than it was in 1999. In Vermont and throughout this country it is not uncommon for people to be working two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income to survive on and some health care benefits.The truth is that real unemployment is not the 5.4 percent you read in newspapers. It is close to 11 percent if you include those workers who have given up looking for jobs or who are working part time when they want to work full time. Youth unemployment is over 17 percent and African-American youth unemployment is much higher than that. Today, shamefully, we have 45 million people living in poverty, many of whom are working at low-wage jobs. These are the people who struggle every day to find the money to feed their kids, to pay their electric bills and to put gas in the car to get to work. This campaign is about those people and our struggling middle class. It is about creating an economy that works for all, and not just the one percent.Citizens United: My fellow Americans: Let me be as blunt as I can and tell you what you already know. As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do.American democracy is not about billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections. It is not about the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and other incredibly wealthy individuals spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poorer. According to media reports the Koch brothers alone, one family, will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy. This is oligarchy. In Vermont and at our town meetings we know what American democracy is supposed to be about. It is one person, one vote  with every citizen having an equal say  and no voter suppression. And that\'s the kind of American political system we have to fight for and will fight for in this campaign.Climate Change: When we talk about our responsibilities as human beings and as parents, there is nothing more important than leaving this country and the entire planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and grandchildren. The debate is over. The scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in the United States and around the world.The scientists are telling us that if we do not boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energies, this planet could be five to ten degrees Fahrenheit warmer by the end of this century. This is catastrophic. It will mean more drought, more famine, more rising sea level, more floods, more ocean acidification, more extreme weather disturbances, more disease and more human suffering. We must not, we cannot, and we will not allow that to happen.It is no secret that there is massive discontent with politics in America today. In the mid-term election in November, 63 percent of Americans did not vote, including 80 percent of young people. Poll after poll tells us that our citizens no longer have confidence in our political institutions and, given the power of Big Money in the political process, they have serious doubts about how much their vote actually matters and whether politicians have any clue as to what is going on in their lives.Combatting this political alienation, this cynicism and this legitimate anger will not be easy. That\'s for sure. But that is exactly what, together, we have to do if we are going to turn this country around  and that is what this campaign is all about.And to bring people together we need a simple and straight-forward progressive agenda which speaks to the needs of our people, and which provides us with a vision of a very different America. And what is that agenda?Jobs, Jobs, Jobs: It begins with jobs. If we are truly serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need a major federal jobs program which puts millions of Americans back to work at decent paying jobs. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That\'s why I\'ve introduced legislation which would invest $1 trillion over 5 years to modernize our country\'s physical infrastructure. This legislation would create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs, while making our country more productive, efficient and safe. And I promise you as president I will lead that legislation into law.I will also continue to oppose our current trade policies. For decades, presidents from both parties have supported trade agreements which have cost us millions of decent paying jobs as corporate America shuts down plants here and moves to low-wage countries. As president, my trade policies will break that cycle of agreements which enrich at the expense of the working people of this country.Raising Wages: Let us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage  which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years  which is exactly what Los Angeles recently did  and I applaud them for doing that. Our goal as a nation must be to ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. Further, we must establish pay equity for women workers. It\'s unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men who perform the same work. We must also end the scandal in which millions of American employees, often earning less than $30,000 a year, work 50 or 60 hours a week  and earn no overtime. And we need paid sick leave and guaranteed vacation time for all.Addressing Wealth and Income Inequality: This campaign is going to send a message to the billionaire class. And that is: you can\'t have it all. You can\'t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. You can\'t continue sending our jobs to China while millions are looking for work. You can\'t hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, while there are massive unmet needs on every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end. You cannot take advantage of all the benefits of America, if you refuse to accept your responsibilities.That is why we need a tax system which is fair and progressive, which makes wealthy individuals and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes.Reforming Wall Street: It is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments while expecting the public to bail it out. If a bank is too big to fail it is too big to exist. We need a banking system which is part of the job creating productive economy, not a handful of huge banks on Wall Street which engage in reckless and illegal activities.Campaign Finance Reform: If we are serious about creating jobs, about climate change and the needs of our children and the elderly, we must be deadly serious about campaign finance reform and the need for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. I have said it before and I\'ll say it again. I will not nominate any justice to the Supreme Court who has not made it clear that he or she will move to overturn that disastrous decision which is undermining our democracy. Long term, we need to go further and establish public funding of elections.Reversing Climate Change: The United States must lead the world in reversing climate change. We can do that if we transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, toward energy efficiency and such sustainable energies such as wind, solar, geo-thermal and bio-mass. Millions of homes and buildings need to be weatherized, our transportation system needs to be energy efficient, and we need a tax on carbon to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel.Health Care for All: The United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all as a right. Despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act, 35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance and many more are under-insured. Yet, we continue paying far more per capita for health care than any other nation. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right by moving toward a Medicare-for-All single-payer system.Protecting Our Most Vulnerable: At a time when millions of Americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically, at a time when senior poverty is increasing, at a time when millions of kids are living in dire poverty, my Republican colleagues, as part of their recently-passed budget, are trying to make a terrible situation even worse. If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low-income Americans, including pregnant women off of nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids in the Head Start program. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families.Well, let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security, we\'re going to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting Head Start and child care, we are going to move to a universal pre-K system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us, a nation\'s greatness is judged not by what it provides to the most well-off, but how it treats the people most in need. And that\'s the kind of nation we must become.College for All: And when we talk about education, let me be very clear. In a highly competitive global economy, we need the best educated workforce we can create. It is insane and counter-productive to the best interests of our country, that hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college, and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. That must end. That is why, as president, I will fight to make tuition in public colleges and universities free, as well as substantially lower interest rates on student loans.War and Peace: As everybody knows, we live in a difficult and dangerous world, and there are people out there who want to do us harm. As president, I will defend this nation  but I will do it responsibly. As a member of Congress I voted against the war in Iraq, and that was the right vote. I am vigorously opposed to an endless war in the Middle East  a war which is unwise and unnecessary. We must be vigorous in combatting terrorism and defeating ISIS, but we should not have to bear that burden alone. We must be part of an international coalition, led by Muslim nations, that can not only defeat ISIS but begin the process of creating conditions for a lasting peace.As some of you know, I was born in a far-away land called Brooklyn, New York. My father came to this country from Poland without a penny in his pocket and without much of an education. My mother graduated high school in New York City. My father worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we were solidly lower-middle class. My parents, brother and I lived in a small rent-controlled apartment. My mother\'s dream was to move out of that small apartment into a home of our own. She died young and her dream was never fulfilled. As a kid I learned, in many, many ways, what lack of money means to a family. That\'s a lesson I have never forgotten.I have seen the promise of America in my own life. My parents would have never dreamed that their son would be a U.S. Senator, let alone run for president. But for too many of our fellow Americans, the dream of progress and opportunity is being denied by the grind of an economy that funnels all the wealth to the top.And to those who say we cannot restore the dream, I say just look where we are standing. This beautiful place was once an unsightly rail yard that served no public purpose and was an eyesore. As mayor, I worked with the people of Burlington to help turn this waterfront into the beautiful people-oriented public space it is today. We took the fight to the courts, to the legislature and to the people. And we won.The lesson to be learned is that when people stand together, and are prepared to fight back, there is nothing that can\'t be accomplished.We can live in a country:Where every person has health care as a right, not a privilege;Where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college;Where every senior can live in dignity and security, and not be forced to choose between their medicine or their food;Where every veteran who defends this nation gets the quality health care and benefits they have earned and receives the respect they deserve;Where every person, no matter their race, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans.That is the nation we can build together, and I ask you to join me in this campaign to build a future that works for all of us, and not just the few on top.Thank you, and on this beautiful day on the shore of Lake Champlain, I welcome you aboard.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 26, 2015",b'Interview with John Harwood of CNBC',"b'Harwood: People on Wall Street, people in business..some have even likened the progressive/Democratic crusade to Hitler\'s Germany hunting down the Jews. What do you think when you hear stuff like that?Sanders: It\'s sick. And I think these people are so greedy, they\'re so out of touch with reality. They think they own the world. And the idea that anybody like me or anybody else are challenging them and say, may be, just maybe there\'s something wrong when 99% of all new income goes to the top 1%. Oh, this is Hitlerism that you suggest that. What a disgusting remark. If you have seen a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1%, you know what, we\'ve got to transfer that back. Radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, I think the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90%.Harwood: When you think about 90%, you don\'t think that\'s obviously too high?Sanders: No. What I think is obscene and what frightens me is, again, when you have the top one tenth of 1% owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Does anybody think that that is the kind of economy this country should have? Do we think it\'s moral? You got people not workin\' one job. They\'re workin\' two jobs, three jobs. People scared to death about what happens tomorrow. Half the people in America have less than $10,000 in savings.Harwood: Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, in the last 16 months, have made $30 million making speeches. What does that kind of money do to a politician\'s perspective on the struggles you were just talking about?Sanders: Well, theoretically, you could be a multibillionaire and, in fact, be very concerned about the issues of working people. Theoretically, that\'s true. When you hustle money like that, you don\'t sit in restaurants like this. You sit in restaurants where you\'re spending  I don\'t know what they spend  hundreds of dollars for dinner and so forth. That\'s the world that you\'re accustomed to and that\'s the world view that you adopt. I am not going to condemn Hillary and Bill Clinton because they have made a lot of money. That type of wealth can, you know, has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.Harwood: You and I talked some months ago. You said you were going to take a look at running, and you weren\'t going to do if it was a fool\'s errand, it if it wasn\'t viable. What did you see that made you think it was viable? Sanders: There is more discontent and more anger at the establishment  that is the corporate establishment, the political establishment, the media establishment if you like.Harwood: Is Hillary Clinton the establishment?Sanders: I think it\'s hard not to acknowledge that Hillary Clinton is part of the establishment. I think that\'s hard not to acknowledge.Harwood: I\'ve heard a lot of Democrats say, ""It\'s great that Bernie\'s running. Of course he won\'t win the nomination."" And I wonder if you have any idea that you\'re, in the end, gonna be seen as this giant cruise ship is rolling by, and you\'re in a paddle boat, yelling after it and not making an impact.Sanders: John, let me say this. I fully concede that I get into this race as a major underdog. No question about it. I\'ve said before though, don\'t underestimate me. I think we\'re gonna do better than people think. And I think we got a shot to win this thing.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"June 18, 2015",b'News Conference by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Marcy Kaptur on Legislation to Restore Pension Guarantees for Thousands of Retired Union Workers',"b""SANDERS: Before -- thank you all very much for coming. Before we begin the very, very important discussion on pensions, I think it's appropriate that we all take a moment to think about the tragedy that took place last night in Charleston, which the Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taunts and taints our nation. This senseless violence fills me and I believe all Americans with outrage, with disgust and with a deep, deep sadness. The hateful killing of nine people who were praying inside a church is a horrific reminder that while we have made in our country significant progress in advancing civil rights, we are very far from eradicating racism. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families and their congregation. UNKNOWN: Amen. SANDERS: Amen.UNKNOWN: Amen.SANDERS: Let me thank all of the people who are with us today on an issue of huge, huge consequence. And this is an issue, by the way, that does not -- doesn't just touch these workers. It endangers every work in America who has been promised a pension. So let me begin by thanking Marcy Kaptur, Tim Ryan, John Murphy and other political leaders who are here. Robert Roach, who is with the International Association of Machinists. And I also want to thank Frank Bryant for joining us to share his personal story of how these proposed pension cuts will impact retirees. More than 40 years ago the federal government made a solemn commitment to the workers of this country. If a retiree is promised a certain pension benefit after a lifetime of hard work, a company could not renege on that promise. That commitment 40 years ago was exactly the right thing to do. When someone works for their entire life, gives up pay raises, gives up health care benefits in order to make sure that they will have a secure retirement, it is absolutely unacceptable to pull the rug out from underneath that worker. [cheers and applause]This is not a negotiation over wage increases. Sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't. This is not a negotiation over health care benefits. This is a promise made to workers and paid for by workers that simply cannot be nullified if people are to have any faith in our system. UNKNOWN: Yes. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: But last year, behind closed doors, a provision was slipped into a must-pass spending bill that now makes it legal to cut the pension benefits of about 1.5 million workers and retirees in troubled, multiemployer pension plans. As a result, retirees all over this country are waking up to the unacceptable reality that the promises made to them could be broken, and that the pension benefits they are receiving today may soon be cut by 30, 40 or even 65 percent. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. SANDERS: This is incomprehensible. What this means is that retirees who are currently receiving a pension benefit of $18,000 a year, paid for by a lifetime of hard work, are in danger of seeing that benefit cut by up to $3,800 or a 21 percent cut. Retirees who are currently receiving a pension benefit of $36,000 a year could see their pension benefits cut by up to $21,000, a 60 percent cut. In other words, tens of thousands of retirees all across our country who are in the middle class today, who have worked their entire life to be in the middle class, their dreams of a happy and secure retirement could be replaced by poverty and insecurity if we do not act. And we are determined to act. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. [cheers and applause]UNKNOWN: Tell it like it is.SANDERS: Today we send a very clear message to the Republican leadership and to the president of the United States. When a promise is made to the working people of this country, with respect to their pensions, with respect to the idea that people have a right to live their retirement years with dignity and not in poverty, those promises have got to be kept. So today what we are saying is that we are going to revisit that legislation...AUDIENCE: Yes. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: ... benefits.UNKNOWN: We earned it. We earned it. AUDIENCE: We earned it. Yes. We earned it. UNKNOWN: Thank you, Bernie. SANDERS: And we are also going to say that if Congress can bail out Wall Street and foreign banks...UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. AUDIENCE: Yes.SANDERS: ... throughout the world... [cheers and applause]UNKNOWN: Yessiree. SANDERS: You know what? We're going to stand up and protect these people who have worked their entire lives for a secure retirement. [cheers and applause]The legislation that I'm introducing today with Marcy Kaptur and Tim Ryan and others in the House, and Senators Sherrod Brown and Tammy Baldwin in the Senate, would prevent the retirement benefits of about 1.5 million workers -- retirees from being cut by repealing the anti-pension rider in last year's appropriation bill. [cheers and applause]What we are doing is establishing an emergency fund within the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to make sure that multiemployer pension plans can continue to provide every pension benefit owed to every eligible American for decades to come. [cheers and applause]And it is fully paid for by closing two tax loopholes that allow the wealthiest Americans in this country to avoid paying their fair share of estate taxes and gift taxes. So bottom line here is that when people work their entire lives for a secure retirement and promises were made to those workers by their employers and by the federal government, we have got to keep those promises. And all of us here are going to work hard to make sure that those promises are in fact kept. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [cheers and applause]AUDIENCE: Bernie. Bernie. Bernie.SANDERS: And now...AUDIENCE: Bernie. Bernie. Bernie. Bernie...SANDERS: Thank you. It's not about me. It's not about me, it's about you. It's about you. All right. Now I want to introduce a woman who has been a fighter for decades for working people in every area of our life. Please welcome Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. [cheers and applause]KAPTUR: Senator Sanders, it is a privilege to join you here on the Senate side. My colleagues Tim Ryan of Ohio and Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania believe in this bill so much that they have taken a few moments away from a very serious debate about Trade Promotion Authority to come here to the Senate side. I want to thank all those who've joined us from around the country who understand what it is to work hard for a living, and what it means to have a pension there for you when you retire. It's your livelihood, and you've earned it and you deserve it. And you deserve it. AUDIENCE: Yes. [applause]KAPTUR: I'm here to say that along with Senator Sanders in the House we have a companion bill, the Keep Our Pension Promise Act. And it has been introduced. It's written. It's a companion bill. And we're facing elections for the Congress coming up very soon, and obviously for the presidency. And we expect this bill to be part of the debate. All right?AUDIENCE: Yes. KAPTUR: So we're here on serious business. We know that at least 1.5 million Americans who are represented by those who've taken time to be with us today, are immediately impacted, and will find their benefit checks cut, as Senator Sanders said, by 35 to 70 percent. We adopt the motto of the Marine Corps here today. We leave no soldier behind. We leave no soldier behind in America, OK? [applause]And we are here to fight for this act. And to do it in a way that makes sure that the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation remains whole, but that for those pension plans and those pensioners who may have difficulty, we create a special fund. And we will find ways, as Wall Street has always found ways, to make sure that Congress takes care of all of the American people, not just some. And we find the funds to fill the gap from those who are part of the 1 percent who have artwork and very, very large holdings. And we find a way to fill the gap in the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation Fund to fund these pensions in that way. So I guess you could say it's deficit-neutral in terms of what we do. And essentially the result is we prevent people who have worked their entire lives from being thrown into poverty and having more worry in their retirement years. What could be more important than rewarding work in our country? And it's not easy.I want to allow time for my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Ohio to speak, so I'll be brief. But I can tell you, a member of our family drove truck his entire life in Ohio. And he's had it very difficult. He's not 62 yet, but he's completely disabled. He was forced by -- several companies closed, several shipping companies. He would come to work and all of a sudden the gate was shuttered and that company was then closed. And he had to go to work somewhere else. And he was made to drive more hours per day. Some of you might've been through that. Even ended up in companies where he had to then load the truck, which really wasn't his job as the driver. But he ended up having massive heart failure because of all of that. And I think about someone like that who's not even retirement age yet and has a wife to support, and what he's facing and how difficult, how difficult this family has had it over the last decade because of the hard work -- his belief in hard work. He never wanted a handout. He wanted to work for a living. He had to drive halfway across the country, you know, into the New Jersey region, for example, where there's a lot of traffic and a little bit different than Ohio sometimes. And just as one person in America, what that worker has faced, what that family has faced because what hard work exacts out of those who do it. So we respect the work that you've done. And we say that in your retirement years you have a right to the pensions that you've earned. UNKNOWN: Yes, ma'am. KAPTUR: And if this government could bail out Wall Street and not penalize them, why can't this government reward those who've worked hard for a living and have done what's right? We need to keep our pension promise to you. Thank you so very much. [cheers and applause]Let me ask our colleagues from the House, Congressman Tim Ryan and Congressman Brendan Boyle if they would like to add a word. BOYLE: I'll just speak for a moment. I'm Congressman Brendan Boyle. I'm from Pennsylvania. It's an honor to be here. Thank you. All right. We have one Pennsylvanian here at least. [laughter]Honored to be here with Marcy Kaptur and Tim Ryan from the House and Bernie Sanders from the Senate. I'm just going to speak brief, and I'm not going to speak about myself. I'm going to speak about my dad. Along with my mom, the main reason why I'm here. My dad, as I was telling someone earlier, was an Acme Markets warehouseman with teamster Local 169 for 25 years. For the last 15 years he's been a janitor. He would still be in that warehouse today coming up on his 40th year had Acme Markets not picked up and moved to a jurisdiction where they could layoff all their union workers and hire people for half the wages and half the benefits. UNKNOWN: Yes. Yes.BOYLE: But, as my dad is approaching retirement and he asks his son, who happens to be a member of Congress, to do his financial planning -- that might be his first mistake. But I'm the one doing it, and I think a lot of families are in the same situation. The pillars of my dad's retirement are twofold: Social Security that he paid into over his entire life of working, and that pension from supermarkets warehouse Local 169. Now, after 40 years of work, someone's going to come along and say that pension you paid into, that pension that you were promised, that pension that you gave up at the bargaining table pay increases for year after year, now at the end of your life when you're most vulnerable and can no longer work, we're going to pull that rug from out underneath you. That is wrong. That is un-American and we're not going to allow it to happen. [cheers and applause]One of the great advances of the 20th century was the pension. The reason why the 20th century was known as the American century in part was because America had the biggest middle class in the history of the world. Pensions, along with other provisions, helped make that happen. I am not going to be part of a Congress that in the 21st century is going to see that disappear, that is going to see the American middle class disappear. We will not allow that to happen. It is time to fight and keep our pensions and keep our American middle class. UNKNOWN: Yes , sir. [cheers and applause]UNKNOWN: Thank you, sir. Thank you. RYAN: Thank you. I'm Tim Ryan from Akron and Youngstown, Ohio. I'm proud to be here with Senator Sanders... [cheers and applause]O-H.AUDIENCE: I-O.RYAN: There we go.I'm proud to be here with Senator Sanders and support Senator Brown and Baldwin and my friend Marcy Kaptur. This is a huge issue in our community. And I think the main point is what Senator Sanders said. If you're negotiating a contract, you are negotiating wages and benefits and all the rest. And you say instead of paying me now, I want you to take some of this money and invest it or put it somewhere, and I want it when I can't work anymore. When I can't get in a truck and drive it for eight hours across state lines in bad weather. And then I want it back. UNKNOWN: Yes. RYAN: That was the promise that's in this legislation. And that's the promise that was violated. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. AUDIENCE: Yes, sir. RYAN: And our obligation as legislators, because we are the only thing that stands between a system that's broken and the men and women who work in America. And so we have an obligation to stand up, step up and do what's right and make sure that we get this fixed. It is a matter of respect because if we can't help people who play by the rules, work hard...UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. RYAN: ... every single day, work weekends ,miss soccer matches, miss baseball games, miss hanging out with their kid so that they can make a living and give their kids a better life. If we can't help them, what in the hell are we doing here?UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. [cheers and applause]RYAN: So, I want to share two brief stories because these are people who call my office in Youngstown, Ohio. These aren't made up. This isn't a theoretical discussion. Someone called our office, worked for a freight and leaseway company for 42 years, delivering cars to the local auto plant. After the legislation passed, they get the letter. Anybody here get the letter?UNKNOWN: Oh yes. AUDIENCE: Yes.RYAN: And in the letter he was informed his pension would be cut, but he'd be notified at some point as to what level, but it could be cut up to 110 percent, which means his pension would go from $3,200 a month to $2,000. You're stealing $1,200 or $1,300 from this person. Another woman came in, the wife of a pensioner, worked for a variety of trucking companies in the Youngstown area, ended his employment. Similar letter that he got. He was currently -- he is currently receiving $3,000 a month and he could be dramatically reduced, again, down to $2,000 or less a month. I'm proud to stand up here with the senator and my fellow colleagues from the House. We got a lot of work to do. But this comes down to the fact are we going to respect the worker? Are we going to continue to have a Congress that caters to the top 1 percent and the people who just move money around for a living? And I think you know where we stand up here. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: Thank you, Tim. [applause]And let me now introduce John Murphy, who was with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. John? [cheers and applause]MURPHY: Thank you, Senator Sanders.Good afternoon, everyone, or good morning. On behalf of Teamster's General President Jim Hoffa and General Secretary Treasurer Ken Hall, I'm here today to thank Senator Sanders, Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Tim Ryan, Brendan Boyle and the other sponsors of legislation to do what was done to you last December. What they are doing, these sponsors, are saying to Congress that it's time to honor the pledge that was made to the American people in 1974 when ERISA was passed, covering single employer plans and multiemployer plans. That law was passed because of the collapse of corporate pension plans in the 1960s and 1970s. What that law said, and it was a promise, as the senator and the representatives have said. It was a promise that workers and retirees would be protected from having ever again to suffer the loss of their hard-earned retirement benefits due to unfunded and underfunded pension plan. That law, ERISA, has turned out to be a colossal failure. Right now bankruptcy laws trump your pension rights. The senator and the representatives are -- as part of that bill are going to say pension benefits for retirees are as good as corporate debt. Bankruptcy has been used by companies as an easy pass-away for them to seek to avoid what they promised to you when you worked for them. UNKNOWN: Yes. That's right. MURPHY: The federal agency, the PBGC, that the senator mentioned, which was established to provide the assurance to protect your pension from being reduced, is inadequately funded and is itself expected to be insolvent within 10 years. That's why the senator is putting new money into that agency with this bill. The net consequences of the failure of this Congress to accomplish what it promised back in 1974, the protection of retirement benefits, is that millions of workers and retirees are nearly as exposed to the risk of losing retirement benefits as their grandparents and parents. And Congress supposedly fixed that problem back in the 1970s. UNKNOWN: Yes. They sure did. MURPHY: Now we have this law passed in December. That promise that Congress made in 1974, which has been broken, the consequences of that are now being put on the American worker and retirees, the people that it was supposed to protect. It requires that the most severe cuts and accrued benefits be first imposed on workers and retirees who were under benefits working for companies that are no longer in benefit -- in business, excuse me. All of this is a tragedy and an affront to the American dream that all of us believed in when we were younger and still believe in now. We see it under attack. And I want to thank the senator and the representatives from Congress for willing to come up here and say we stand with workers. [applause]Because that's what this is all about. [applause]So in closing... [applause]In closing, Senator Sanders, Reps. Kaptur, Boyle and Ryan, the Teamsters union is grateful for what you are trying to do. We appreciate your efforts to protect the pensions of working people. Because of this you have earned the friendship of (the Teamsters union. And we never forget those who are our friends. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: John, thank you very much. It's now my pleasure to introduce Robert Roach, who's with the International Association of Machinists. Robert? [cheers and applause]ROACH: Thank you, senator. On behalf of International President Tom Buffenbarger, I've come to thank Senator Sanders, Reps. Kaptur, Boyle and Ryan, and all the other representatives who are standing with us and working people in America today to protect their pension security. The IAM knows full well what can happen to a pension plan because during the airline crisis after 9/11, thousands -- tens of thousands of people lost their pension plans through bankruptcy. And the IAM, through its well-funded multiemployer plan, protected those pensions. And those people are enjoying pension rights today.The legislation that was enacted threatens the very integrity of the entire system. And therefore, millions and millions of people will be jeopardized by this legislation. Therefore, the IAM stands strong with Senator Sanders, Rep. Kaptur and others to pass this legislation to reverse the harm that was done to the working people of America. Without a strong middle class, without strong senior citizens, the entire economy is at risk. And when the economy is at risk, the nation's security is at risk. This is an important issue. Again, when the law was passed 40 years ago to protect pensions, that was the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do today to reverse the injustice that was done. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. ROACH: ... in the middle of the night.AUDIENCE: Yes. ROACH: Without the support of the American people. UNKNOWN: Swept it under the rug. ROACH: And we stand 600,000 strong active and retired machinist union with these representatives to do everything that we can to reverse the injustice, to walk to Capitol Hill, to knock on doors and make the people aware that while Citigroup, Bank of America, AIG was bailed out to the tune of $250 billion ,they can't find $10 billion or $15 billion to bail out the American worker. It's an injustice that must be answered. [cheers and applause]And it must be answered through this legislation. Thank you very much. UNKNOWN: Thank you. AUDIENCE: Thank you. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: Thanks, Robert. UNKNOWN: Give us what we earned. UNKNOWN: We earned it.SANDERS: I would like to also now bring up Frank Bryant to share his personal story of how these proposed pension cuts will impact retirees. Frank?BRYANT: Thank you, Senator. Hello. My name is Frank Bryant and I am a co-founder of the North Carolina Committee to Protect Pensions. And we were formed to fight the terrible pension cuts that are allowed under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. I am honored today to be joined by so many other retirees from around the country who came by the busloads this morning to support this important legislation. I want to thank Senator Sanders and Rep. Kaptur and the other cosponsors for introducing this important piece of legislation today, and to thank the national labor leaders who are here to support it also. I want to also thank the Pension Rights Center for their support. I drove a truck for UPS for 31 years and retired in 2003 after I wrecked my health doing this back-breaking work. I never expected a handout, but I did expect a good pension. After jumping in and out of that brown truck for hundreds of times a day over the years, I actually was in much pain when I retired, and I deserve a good pension because it was negotiated for me by the Teamsters union. It was part of my pay, part of my vacation pay I sacrificed. And we were denied that. What kept me going was knowing that at the end of my time I was going to get a pension that was going to allow me to live comfortably in my retirement. After all, I gave up wages and vacation pay so I could get this monthly pension. That was a promise, a contract, something that I was told could not be broken. We feel betrayed and angry that at the end of 2014 Congress passed a Multiemployer Pension Reform Act allowing retirees' and widows' pensions to be cut in order to balance the books of multiemployer pension plans. That is just plain wrong. Unless the pension cuts allowed by MPRA are repealed, I and others will end up on public assistance. Because of my pension I am able to support my extended family the way I should. But believe me, there are a lot of folks who have it much worse than me. For instance, widows who are living on half of their husband's pensions, and end up losing their homes, if not living on the streets. Every person out there today wearing a tee shirt or a button has a story to tell. And I hope you'll take the time to talk to them. We are regular, hardworking people. We all lived and believed in the American dream. We don't ask for anything. We worked for everything we have. UNKNOWN: Right. AUDIENCE: That's right. BRYANT: We ask Congress today to pass the Keep Our Pension Promises Act. We are a rich country and a good country, and we have faith that thanks to Senator Sanders, Reps. Kaptur and Ryan and the other cosponsors ,that our government will protect us. Thank you. [cheers and applause]UNKNOWN: Way to go, Frank. [applause]SANDERS: Thank you very much, Frank. I think the bottom line is pretty simple. And it's been stated by every speaker. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. The Republicans just passed a budget which would provide over 10 years over $200 billion in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent. AUDIENCE: Boo.SANDERS: If the Republicans and members of Congress can provide huge tax breaks for billionaires, the very least that we can do... UNKNOWN: All right now. SANDERS: ... is to keep our promises made to people...UNKNOWN: All right now. UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. [cheers and applause]SANDERS: ... who worked and earned these pensions. [cheers and applause]So thank you all very, very much for being here today. This is a fight. You're fighting not just for yourselves. Because if this promise is broken to you, it can be broken for every American worker, every American worker. [cheers and applause]UNKNOWN: All right, Bernie Sanders. SANDERS: All right. Well, thank you all very much. UNKNOWN: Bernie. AUDIENCE: Bernie. Bernie. Bernie. QUESTION: [inaudible] about the workers in terms of tax cuts for billionaires bailouts to Wall Street. It seems to be resonating for you around the country. SANDERS: I don't want to make this into a political issue. QUESTION: Well you don't have to have politics. But were you surprised by the reaction of people to that kind of message?SANDERS: What I am increasingly understanding is that people all over this country understand that we have an economic system today that is rigged. UNKNOWN: Amen. SANDERS: It's a rigged system. These people have worked their entire lives. Promises have been made to them. They gave up on wage benefits in order to have a secure, decent retirement. And the rug has been pulled out from underneath them. And that is happening. That is happening in many ways to working people all over this country. And what we are seeing is an outrageous level of income and wealth inequality. People on top doing phenomenally well, while the middle class is disappearing. That is what this is about. And we say loudly and clearly, that's not what America's about. Enough is enough. [cheers and applause]All right. Thank you all very much. Thank you. AUDIENCE: [cheering] Way to go. Thank you. Nice job. SANDERS: Thank you very much. UNKNOWN: Thank you. You're a wonderful speaker... [crosstalk]"""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"June 19, 2015","b'Remarks at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada'","b""Thank you for allowingme to be with you today, and thank you for your willingness to represent your constituents.Today, I want to talk about two major issues facing our country. The need for comprehensive immigration reform, and the need for an economy which works for all of our people, and not just a handful of people on the top.It is no great secret that across the United States undocumented workers perform a critical role in our economy. They harvest and process our food and it is no exaggeration to say that, with out them, food production in the United States would significantly decline. Undocumented workers build many of our homes, cook our meals, maintain our landscapes. We even entrust undocumented workers with that which we hold most dear  our children.?Despite the central role they play in our economy and in our daily lives, undocumented workers are reviled by many for political gain and shunted into the shadows. Let me be clear about where I stand. It is time for this disgraceful situation to end. This country faces enormous problems and they will not be solved unless we are united. It is time to end the politics of division on this country, of politicians playing one group of people against another: white against black, male against female, straight against gay, native born against immigrant.?That is why I supported the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the United States Senate. While a complicated piece of comprehensive legislation like this can always be improved I believed then and now that it is time to end the discussion of mass deportation or self-deportation. We cannot and we should not even be talking about sweeping up millions of men, women, and children  many of whom have been here for years  and throwing them out of the country. That's wrong and that type of discussion has got to end.Until we can pass comprehensive reform, we must be aggressive in pursuing policies that are humane and sensible and that keep families together. This includes taking measures that are currently available, including reforms through executive action.I strongly support the Administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. DACA a good first step, but should be expanded. Deferred action should include the parents of citizens, parents of legal permanent residents, and the parents of DREAMERs. We should be pursuing policies that unite families  not tear them apart.I continue to be a strong supporter of the DREAM Act, which would offer the opportunity of permanent residency and eventual citizenship to young people who were brought to the United States as children. It is my belief that we should recognize the young men and women who comprise the DREAMers for what they are  American kids who deserve the right to legally be in the country they know as home.As is often said, we are a nation of immigrants. For generations, families braved treacherous paths, often fleeing unspeakable poverty and violence, in search of better futures, for better lives for their children.I, myself, am the son of an immigrant. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket and without much of an education. Like immigrants before and since, he worked hard to give his family a better life here in the United States. He was a paint salesman and we were solidly lower-middle class. My parents, my brother and I lived together in a small rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. My mother's wish  which she never realized  was that we would be able to buy a house of our own and move out of that small apartment. Through my parents hard work both my brother and I went to college.Their story, my story, our story is a story of America. Hard working families coming to the United States to create a brighter future for their children. It is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope. It is a story that continues to this day in families all across the United States.Let me tell you that I have seen first-hand the impact of our broken immigration system. In 2008, my U.S. Senate office learned about a crisis occurring with migrant laborers in the tomato fields of Immokalee, Florida. The Immokalee workers were fighting to increase the paltry wages they were receiving for back-breaking work.Although far from Vermont, in January of 2008, I decided to go there myself and investigate. Armed with a letter of support signed by three of my colleagues  Senators Durbin, Brown, and Kennedy, what I found was a human tragedy. Workers were being paid starvation wages, living in severely substandard housing, and subjected to abusive labor practices. The injustice inthe lives of the workers was overwhelming.In fact, the situation was so bad that on the day I visited two men were indicted for human slavery. Slavery in the 21st century in the United States of America.My visit to the tomato fields was followed by a hearing in the Senator Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on which I sat and which my friend, the late Senator Kennedy chaired. At that hearing, we heard the voices of the workers of Immokalee  workers in America at the lowest rungs of the economic ladders. We heard from people who were ruthlessly exploited, denied decent wages, decent working conditions and decent housing. And that hearing enabled the workers of Immokalee to confront the interests that cheated them and abused them.I am happy to tell you that this story has a positive ending. The campaign by the Immokalee workers resulted in substantial reforms in the tomato fields of Florida. In the aggregate, workers there have seen their wages increase by millions of dollars and improvement in their working conditions.But how many more Immokalees are out there? How many fields or factories are there where people  often without legal status  are used up and thrown away? We cannot continue to run an economy where millions are made so vulnerable because of their undocumented status. We have to ask ourselves. Whose interest is it in to keep undocumented workers in the shadows without the protection of the law?Many in the business community have argued for guest worker programs as the answer to the immigration issue. This concerns me very much.As the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented, guest workers have been routinely cheated out of wages; held virtually captive by employers who have seized their documents; forced to live in unspeakably inhumane conditions; and denied medical benefits for on-the-job injuries. That is unacceptable.In the U.S. Senate, I have introduced legislation in 2007 that would authorize the Legal Services Corporation to provide legal representation to guest workers who have been abused by their employers. Further, employers under my bill would be required to reimburse guest workers for transportation expenses and provide workers' compensation insurance, among other things.I also opposed tying immigration reform to the building of a border fence. Let me say what most people already know. Undocumented workers come to the United States to escape economic hardship and political persecution.Undocumented workers looking for economic opportunity come to the United States because there are no jobs where they are coming from, and there are jobs for them here. Plain and simple.Unfortunately, American policy in Latin America has too often made difficult economic and political problems even worse. Take for example, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.Supporters of NAFTA told us it would increase the standard of living in Mexico and significantly reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants into this country as a result. The opposite was true.Since the implementation of NAFTA, the number of Mexicans living below the poverty line has increased by over 14 million people. Almost 2 million small famers have been displaced. And in the twenty years since NAFTA growth in per capita GDP has been only half of that experienced by other Latin American nations. Not surprisingly we have seen a 185 percent increase in the number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico from 1992 to 2011.We as a nation have got to realize the importance of dealing not just with the issue of immigration but with the very real refugee crisis we face. It was appalling to me that last year when the papers were full of discussion of the large numbers of unaccompanied children at the borders there were so many voices insisting they be turned away or simply shipped back to their country of origin like a package marked return to sender. America has always been a haven for the oppressed. Is there any group more vulnerable than children? We cannot and must not shirk the historic role of the United States as a protector of vulnerable people fleeing persecution.The bottom line of all of this is that It is time to bring our neighbors out of the shadows. It is time to give them legal status. It is time to create a reasonable and responsible path to citizenship.In addition to immigration reform, we must also pursue policies that empower minority communities. This must start with energizing Latinos all across the country to engage in the democratic process and by thwarting efforts to disenfranchise minority voters. Restricting access through draconian voter ID laws and shortening early voting periods are thinly-veiled efforts to marginalize communities of color, low income people and seniors. These policies must be combatted at both the state and federal levels.But to truly empower our communities, we must address the crippling poverty that affects tens of millions of people in this country. Today, shamefully, we have more than 12 million Latinos living in poverty. That'snearly one out of every four Latinos in this country. If you are a Latino child, there is nearly a one in three chance (32 percent) that you are growing up in poverty.Many of those in poverty are working at low-wage jobs. These are the people who struggle every day to find the money to feed their kids, to pay their electric bills and to put gas in the car to get to work.I believe we need a major federal jobs program to put millions of American back to work. One in four construction workers are Latino, and the fastest way to increase jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure: roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants, airports, railroads and schools. It has been estimated that the cost of the Iraq War, a war we should never have waged, will total between $4-6 trillion by the time the last veteran receives needed care. A $1 trillion investment in infrastructure would create 13 million decent paying jobs and make this country more efficient, productive and safer.We also need to address the crisis of youth unemployment. The real unemployment rate for young Hispanic college graduates is 11%, nearly double the rate of white Americans. For young Hispanics with only a high school degree, the real unemployment rate is 36%.More than 50,000 Latinos turn 18 every month, and the time is long overdue for us to start investing in our young people, to help them get the jobs and training they need, the education they deserve, so that they can be part of the middle class. It's time to bring opportunity to communities across the country. I recently introduced legislation to provide $5.5 billion in immediate funding to States and localities to employ 1 million young Americans between the ages of 16 and 24, and provide job training to hundreds of thousands of other young Americans.We must also finally address the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street. Financial institutions cannot be an island unto themselves, standing as huge profit centers outside of the real economy. Their speculation and illegal behavior plunged this country into the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, and Latinos were the hardest hit. Latinos were disproportionately steered into subprime loans and around a quarter of Latino borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure or are seriously delinquent. In my view, Wall Street is too large and powerful to be reformed. The huge financial institutions must be broken up.In today's highly competitive global economy, millions of Americans are unable to afford the higher education they need in order to get good-paying jobs. Some of our young people have given up the dream of going to college, while others are leaving school deeply in debt. Many of the countries we compete with understand that free public education should not end at high school. In many European countries, students leave college debt free. That should be the case here in our country. I've introduced legislation to make all public colleges in this country tuition free.What we need to do is invest in the Latino community so that America can reach its full potential. I'm proud to stand with the Latino community and receive a 100% voting score from the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda last Congress.In short, I believe we can live in a country:Where hard working immigrants can have a path to citizenship;Where health care is a right, not a privilege;Where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college;Where every senior can live in dignity and security, and not be forced to choose between their medicine or their food;Where every person, no matter their race, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"July 25, 2015","b'Remarks at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Baton Rouge, Louisiana'","b'Thank you for inviting me to be with you tonight. Thank you for the work you continue to do as leaders in civil rights. You have always been a voice for the voiceless and champions for social justice.Your courageous history dates back to the Montgomery Bus Boycott when one person, Rosa Parks, by the simple act of sitting down at the front of the bus, inspired a whole community to stand up and bring the transportation system in Montgomery to its knees, to capture the imagination of the nation and to cause what my friend John Lewis calls ""a nonviolent revolution.""You knew then, what the American people are beginning to remember now  that real change takes place when millions of people stand up and say ""enough is enough,"" and when we create a political revolution from the ground up. That is what the Southern Christian Leadership Conference has always been about. That is what is beginning to happen today. The American people are sick and tired with establishment politics, with establishment economics and with establishment media. They\'re sick of being told that they don\'t matter. They fully understand that corporate greed is destroying our economy, that American politics is now dominated by a handful of billionaires and that much of the corporate media is prepared to discuss everything except the most important issues facing our country.I realize that many of you don\'t know me very well. So let me take a moment to let you know a little bit about my background. I was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, from 1981-1989, Vermont\'s lone congressman from 1990-2006 and a U.S. senator from Vermont from 2007 until today.I was born in Brooklyn, New York. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a penny in his pocket and without much of an education. My mother graduated from high school in New York City. My father worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we lived with my brother in a small rent-controlled apartment. My mother\'s dream was to move out of that three-room apartment into a home of our own. She died young and her dream was never fulfilled. As a kid I learned what lack of money means to a family, a lesson I have never forgotten.When I was a young college student, I came to Washington, D.C., to participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. I heard this organization\'s first president, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his famous speech, and he inspired me, just as he inspired a whole generation  black and white  to get involved in the civil rights movement. In Chicago, I worked for housing desegregation and was arrested protesting public school segregation. During that time I was active in what was a sister-organization to the SCLC, the Congress of Racial Equality of CORE, which was headed up by the late James Farmer.Since I have been an elected official, I have used my influence to stand with those who have no power, and to take on virtually every element of our current ruling class  from Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies to Big Energy, to the Koch Brothers to the Military Industrial Complex. That\'s what I do.The decision to run for president was a very difficult one for me and my family. I love my job as Vermont\'s senator and love spending time in Vermont with my four kids and seven beautiful grandchildren  something, needless to say, that I am less able to do today.My family and I decided that I should run for president because the reality is that this country today faces more serious problems than at any time since the Great Depression and, if you include the planetary crisis of climate change, it may well be that the challenges we face now are more dire than any time in our modern history. And to address these crises we need leadership that is prepared to rally the American people, to create the political revolution that this country desperately needs, to take on the wealthy special interests that wield so much power.Let me take this opportunity to quote from an excellent article by the columnist Eugene Robinson which appeared in the Washington Post. Here are some excerpts from that article:As we celebrate King\'s great achievement and sacrifice, it is wrong to round off the sharp edges of his legacy. He saw inequality as a fundamental and tragic flaw in this society, and he made clear in the weeks leading up to his assassination that economic issues were becoming the central focus of his advocacy.Nearly five decades later, King\'s words on the subject still ring true. On March 10, 1968, just weeks before his death, he spoke to a union group in New York about what he called ""the other America."" He was preparing to launch a Poor People\'s Campaign whose premise was that issues of jobs and issues of justice were inextricably intertwined.""One America is flowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality,"" King said. ""That America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits. But as we assemble here tonight, I\'m sure that each of us is painfully aware of the fact that there is another America, and that other America has a daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair.""Those who lived in the other America, King said, were plagued by ""inadequate, substandard and often dilapidated housing conditions,"" by ""substandard, inferior, quality-less schools,"" by having to choose between unemployment and low-wage jobs that didn\'t even pay enough to put food on the table.The problem was structural, King said: ""This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.""Eight days later, speaking in Memphis, King continued the theme. ""Do you know that most of the poor people in our country are working every day?"" he asked striking sanitation workers. ""And they are making wages so low that they cannot begin to function in the mainstream of the economic life of our nation. These are facts which must be seen, and it is criminal to have people working on a full-time basis and a full-time job getting part-time income.""King explained the shift in his focus: ""Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn\'t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn\'t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?""But what King saw in 1968  and what we all should recognize today  is that it is useless to try to address race without also taking on the larger issue of inequality. He was planning a poor people\'s march on Washington that would include not only African-Americans but also Latinos, Native Americans and poor Appalachian whites. He envisioned a rainbow of the dispossessed, assembled to demand not just an end to discrimination but a change in the way the economy doles out its spoils.""And that is the theme that I wish to pursue this evening. The need to simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else  especially the African-American community and working-class whites  are becoming poorer.Let\'s go to an issue that is rightly on everyone\'s mind, the continuing struggle for racial justice in America and the need to combat structural racism. Let\'s start with the facts. The horrible facts.If current trends continue, one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy.Blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites.People of color are incarcerated, policed and sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than their white counterparts.One in every 15 African-American men is incarcerated, compared to one in every 106 white men.A report by the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop, compared to white motorists.African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police.African-Americans make up two-fifths of confined youth today.African-American women are three times more likely than white women to be incarcerated.Once convicted, black offenders receive longer sentences (10 percent longer) than white offenders for the same crimes.Thirteen percent of African-American men have lost the right to vote due to felony convictions.But as bad as those statistics are, and they are indeed a tragedy, the situation for many people of color is worse yet.Too many African-Americans today are simultaneously having to deal the crisis of racial justice while coping with the effects of poverty and economic deprivation, such as drugs, crime, and despair.Of course the majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children. But there are neighborhoods where mothers are afraid to let their children outside for fear of gang violence and drugs. And they are also afraid of their children being targeted by the police because of the color of their skin. No person should have to worry that a routine interaction with law enforcement will end in violence or death.As Martin Luther King, Jr., said; Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.Across the nation, too many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. A growing number of communities do not trust the police and police have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect.Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice. We know their names. Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody. The chants are growing louder. People are angry. I am angry. And people have a right to be angry. Violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of law enforcement sworn to protect and serve our communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.We must reform our criminal justice system. Black lives do matter. And we must value black lives.We must move away from the militarization of police forces. We must invest in community policing. Only when we get officers into the communities, working within the neighborhoods before trouble arises, do we really develop the relationships necessary to make our communities safer.We need a federal initiative to completely redo how we train police officers in this country and give them body cameras. States and localities that make progress in this area should get more federal justice grant money. Those that do not should get their funding slashed. The measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up.For people who have committed crimes that have landed them in jail, there needs to be a path back from prison. The federal system of parole needs to be reinstated. We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated.We must end the over incarceration of non-violent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society. It is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth  more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China. That has got to end.The war on drugs has been a failure and has ruined the lives of too many people. African-Americans comprise 14 percent of regular drug users but are 37 percent of those arrested for drug offenses. From 1980 to 2007, about one in three adults arrested for drugs was African-American.It is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana, but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy. This must change.We need to end prisons for profit, which result in an over-incentive to arrest, jail and detain, in order to keep prison beds full. We need to invest in drug courts and medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that they do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.But we have to go beyond just violence perpetuated by the state. As we saw so horribly in South Carolina, there are still those who seek to terrorize the African American community with violence and intimidation. We need to make sure the federal resources are there to crack down on the illegal activities of hate groups. We need a new social movement to let all the racist haters out there know that they will no longer be accepted in a civilized society.In addition to the physical violence faced by too many in our country we need look at the lives of black children and address a few other difficult facts. Black children, who make up just 18 percent of preschoolers, account for 48 percent of all out-of-school suspensions before kindergarten. We are failing our black children before kindergarten! Black students were expelled at three times the rate of white students. Black girls were suspended at higher rates than all other girls and most boys. According to the Department of Education, African American students are more likely to suffer harsh punishments  suspensions and arrests  at school.We need to take a hard look at education system. Black students attended schools with higher concentrations of first-year teachers, compared with white students. Black students were more than three times as likely to attend schools where fewer than 60 percent of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements.We must get into our schools and keep kids in school. We must ensure that children graduate from high school and don\'t drop out. This is a complicated problem and I\'m not going to stand here and say I have all the answers.But one thing that will help kids stay in school is if they have a belief that they will be able to get a college education. For too many families college seems like an impossibility. We have got to change that. We need to give our children, regardless of their race or their income, a fair shot at attending college. That\'s why I support making all public universities tuition free.Communities of color also face the violence of economic deprivation. Let\'s be frank: neighborhoods like those in west Baltimore, where Freddie Gray resided, suffer the most. However, the problem of economic immobility isn\'t just a problem for young men like Freddie Gray. It has become a problem for millions of Americans who, despite hard-work and the will to get ahead, can spend their entire lives struggling to survive on the economic treadmill.We live at a time when most Americans don\'t have $10,000 in savings, and millions of working adults have no idea how they will ever retire in dignity. God forbid, they are confronted with an unforeseen car accident, a medical emergency, or the loss of a job. It would literally send their lives into an economic tailspin. And the problems are even more serious when we consider race.Most black and Latino households have less than $350 in savings. The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate over the last 40 years, regardless of education. This is unacceptable. The American people in general, want change  they want a better deal. A fairer deal. A new deal. They want an America with laws and policies that truly reward hard work with economic mobility. They want an America that affords all of its citizens with the economic security to take risks and the opportunity to realize their full potential.Income and Wealth InequalityToday, we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but that reality means little because almost all of that wealth is controlled by a tiny handful of individuals.There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. There is something profoundly wrong when we have a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. That is why we need a tax system that is fair and progressive, which makes wealthy individuals and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes. This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about. This has got to change and, together we will change it.We need to send a message to the billionaire class: ""You can\'t have it all. You can\'t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. You can\'t continue sending our jobs to China while millions are looking for work. You can\'t hide your profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, while there are massive unmet needs on every corner of this nation. Your greed has got to end. You cannot take advantage of all the benefits of America, if you refuse to accept your responsibilities as Americans.""EconomicsBut it is not just income and wealth inequality. It is the tragic reality that for the last 40 years the great middle class of our country  once the envy of the world  has been disappearing. Despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity, median family income is almost $5,000 less than it was in 1999. Throughout this country it is not uncommon for people to be working two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income and some health care benefits to survive.The truth is that real unemployment is not the 5.5 percent you read in newspapers. It is close to 11 percent if you include those workers who have given up looking for jobs or who are working part-time when they want to work full-time. And here is something we don\'t hear much about. According to a recent analysis of Census Bureau data by the Economic Policy Institute, real youth unemployment in this country has reached crisis proportions. If you include those who are not working, who have given up looking for work or who are working part-time, white high school graduates aged 17-20 have an unemployment rate of 33 percent, Hispanics in the same age group have an unemployment rate of 36 percent while black youth have an unemployment rate of 51 percent. Today, shamefully, we have 45 million people living in poverty, many of whom are working at low-wage jobs.Raising Wages and BenefitsLet us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage  which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years. The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple and concrete  that no full-time worker should live in poverty.And a living wage should not only be fair, it should be equitable. That is why we must establish pay equity for women workers by law. It\'s unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men who perform the same work. We must also end the scandal in which millions of American employees, often earning less than $30,000 a year, work 50 or 60 hours a week  and earn no overtime.Further, the United States must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth, the only one, which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave, paid sick time and paid vacation time. Last place is no place for America. That is why I will fight for 12 weeks of paid family leave, at least 10 days of paid vacation time and seven days of paid sick time. My Republican colleagues talk a lot about ""family values."" Well, let me be very clear. It is not a family value to force the mother of a new born baby to go back to work a few days after she gives birth, because she doesn\'t have the money to stay home and bond with her baby. That is not a family value. That is an insult to everything that I know about what family is about.Today, as a result of the collapse of our middle class and declining wages, the American people are working longer hours than the people of any other country  137 hours a year more than the Japanese, 260 more hours per year than the British and 499 hours a year more than the French. Well, 100 years later we still have not achieved that. Incredibly, today, 85 percent of working men and 66 percent of working women work more than 40 hours a week. And do you know what? Many workers in this country get no or very little paid vacation time. That has got to end.Protecting Our Most VulnerableAt a time when millions of Americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically, at a time when senior poverty is increasing, at a time when millions of kids are living in dire poverty my Republican colleagues are trying to make a terrible situation even worse. If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low income Americans, including pregnant women off nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids into Head Start. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very, very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families.Well, let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security, we need to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting Head Start and childcare, we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us: ""The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little."" And that is a test that we as a nation must once again meet and master.We need to make health care a basic right in our society.We need to make sure every parent has quality affordable child care and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college, by making a 4-year education at every public college and university in this country free. If Germany, Sweden and Denmark can afford to do this, then so can we.We need to invest in jobs and job training, rather than to be building more and more jails and to be locking up more and more people. That is why I have submitted legislation to spend $5.5 billion dollars to fund job-training programs for inner city youth. Instead of building more and more prisons, we need to be building more and more meaningful lives where young people can have a future, not be stuck in a dead end with no hope or opportunity.If we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need a major federal jobs program that puts millions of Americans back to work at decent paying jobs. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That\'s why I\'ve introduced legislation that would invest $1 trillion over 5 years to modernize our country\'s physical infrastructure. This legislation would create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs, while making our country more productive, efficient and safe. And I commit to you that as president, I will lead that legislation into law.This is an ambitious program that would lift millions of families out of poverty and provide a pathway to greater economic security for all Americans. The right to a college education, the right to health care, and a guaranteed right to employment. It will not heal all wounds or relieve all tensions, but it would go beyond anything we have tried before, and it would send a clear signal that black lives matter.Citizens United and Campaign Finance Reform and Voting RightsI want to talk about our democracy. The billionaire class is controlling our political and economic lives because of the disastrous Citizens United case. The Supreme Court unconscionably gutted the Voting Rights Act. Make no mistake, we watching the erosion of our democracy and the gains that we have fought so hard to achieve.Some of you may not see the connection between an out-of-control campaign financing system and the gutting of our voting rights, but you should not be fooled  they are two sides of the same coin. Our access to our democracy is being ripped away. The billionaires do not want people to vote.My friends  let me be as blunt as I can while telling you what you already know. As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do.If we are serious about creating jobs, about climate change and the needs of our children, our veterans and the elderly, about reforming our criminal justice system, we must be deadly serious about campaign finance reform. That is why in my campaign for president, I have said that I will not nominate any justice to the Supreme Court who has not made it clear that he or she will move to overturn that disastrous decision which is undermining our democracy. Long term, we need to go further and establish public funding of elections, so that the dark money of American politics is stopped before democracy is bought and paid for by a handful of billionaires and corporations.American democracy is not about corporations and billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections. It is not about Wall Street and big oil or the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poorer. According to media reports the Koch brothers alone, one family, will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy. This is oligarchy. The defining principle of American democracy is one person, one vote  with every citizen having an equal say  and no voter suppression. And that\'s the kind of American political system we have to fight for.Not only are big moneyed interests trying to buy the American electorate, Republican-controlled legislatures have done everything in their power to make it more difficult to vote.Voting is becoming more difficult, not less. The Voting Rights Act has been gutted by the Supreme Court, and efforts to repair it in Congress have been sidelined. Voter suppression today is alive and well in the form of unnecessary voter ID laws, restrictions on registering to vote, improper purging of voter rolls, felon disenfranchisement, and a staggering array of deceptive practices that are preventing eligible voters from participating in the political process. It is embarrassing that the United States\' voting system is so dysfunctional.We need to remember the price that was paid for the right to vote. We must restore our democracy\'s promise of one man, one vote. We must repeal Citizens United and take the political process back from the billionaire class. We need to extend early voting, extend voting hours, make Election Day a holiday or move it to a weekend.One area that I have been interested in is voter registration. Unsurprisingly, most other advanced democracies make voter registration much easier than we do here in the United States. Some countries, such as Argentina, Belgium, and Germany, maintain a national or municipal population database and local election officials add eligible voters to the rolls based on those lists. Some countries hire workers to go door-to-door and register all eligible voters, including Great Britain and Indonesia. Mexico deploys such workers to rural areas.France automatically registers 18-year-olds to vote when they register with the Selective Service. Canada uses info collected from other government agencies to add eligible citizens to the rollsBritish Columbia uses DMV records; Quebec uses health insurance records. If more info is needed, the government reaches out by mail and sends the potential voter a registration form, with a postage-paid return envelope.The U.S. is one of the few countries which puts the onus of registration on the voter, not the state. This is ridiculous.In 2009, the Brennan Center released a study of worldwide voter registration rates, based on citizen voting-age population. Here are a few countries:Argentina (2007): 100%Great Britain (2008): 97%Belgium (2007): 94%Canada (2008): 93%Germany (2005): 93%Australia (2008): 92%France (2007): 91%United States (2006): 68%The Census Bureau Population Survey says in 2012, 71.2 percent of Americans were registered to vote. The number varies by ageonly 58 percent of 18-29-year-olds were registered to vote, but 79 percent of those older than 70 were registered.We should be making voting easier, not harder.Let us also be very clear that the stakes are very high. The right to vote is preservative of all other rights. And when in this last election in November 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote; 80 percent of young people chose not to vote; and almost 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote, it should not come as a surprise that the stranglehold that the billionaire class has on the economy is tightening around the middle class.And when we talk about voting rights, we have to address the reality of over 2 million African-Americans who have been disenfranchised due to criminal convictions. This is not the way to help bring people returning from prison back into their communities. If you can believe it, in some states over 20 percent of the African-American population is disenfranchised. Florida  23 percent. Virginia  20 percent. Kentucky  22 percent. But the percentages don\'t necessarily give the entire picture because in many, many states with large African American populations, the percentage may be lower but the number of individuals who can\'t cast a ballot is high. Georgia  almost 160,000 people; Texas  over 150,000 people; Alabama  over 135,000 people; Mississippi  over 107,000 people. That is why I am a sponsor of legislation introduced on the House side by Rep. John Conyers called the Democracy Restoration Act which would restore federal voting rights.We must remember that the struggle for our rights is not a struggle for one day, or one year, or one generation  it is the struggle of a lifetime, and one that must be fought by every generation.All of you in this room know it, but it bears saying out loud: civil rights are not just about for voting rights, but economic and social equality  and most importantly, jobs. 50 years later, it remains the great unfinished business of the civil rights movement.In conclusion, I\'ve been traveling this country for over a year now. People are ready for a new movement  a political revolution  to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally. In other words, we are building a movement of millions of Americans who are prepared to stand up and fight back.I believe the time has come to say loudly and clearly: enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people, and not to a handful of billionaires, their Super-PACs and their lobbyists.Now is not the time for thinking small. Now is not the time for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and stale inside-the-beltway ideas.Now is the time for millions of working families  black and white, Latino and Native American, gay and straight  to come together, to revitalize American democracy, to end the collapse of the American middle class and to make certain that our children and grandchildren are able to enjoy a quality of life that brings them health, prosperity, security and joy  and that once again makes the United States the leader in the world in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for a world of peace.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"July 30, 2015","b'Remarks with Joseph Stiglitz, James Galbraith, and Stephanie Kelton in a Discussion on the Greek Debt Crisis'","b'SANDERS: Please let meI\'m Senator Bernie Sanders and let melet me thank all of you for coming out this afternoon to discuss an issue of enormous consequence and something I think we don\'t quite focus on as much as we might here in the United States.And I\'m especially pleased that we have a great panel, who will help us discuss the issue. And on the panel will be Joe Stiglitz, who is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, chief economist at Roosevelt Institute and Professor of Economics at Columbia.We have Jacob Kirkegaard, who\'s the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. We have James Galbraith, Professor of Government at the University of Texas.And have Stephanie Kelton, who will be the moderator, who is the former chair of the Economics Department at KansasKansas City University, and is the chief economist for the minority on the Budget Committee.We think perhaps we have the ambassador here. OK, and we thank Ambassador Panagopoulos very much for being here and I\'m going to get you up here in a moment.What we are here today to talk about is the very, very important issue regarding the ongoing debt crisis in Greece and the way that people in governments all over the world are struggling with too much debt.This iswe\'re going to be focusing on Greece, but in truth, this issue goes beyond Greece, and countries that are struggling not only with too much debt, too much inequality, and too little growth in income.Today, as I think all of you know, there is a very, very serious economic situation unfolding in Greece. In many ways, Greece today resembles the United States in the 1930s, in the midst of the worst depressioneconomic downturn in the history of our country.The Greece economy has basically collapsed and the people of Greece are trapped in a very, very deep depression. I want to begin by expressing my solidarity with the people of Greece. With five years of cruel and counterproductive austerity policies; policies demanded by the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund have left the people of Greece facing a full-blown humanitarian crisis.In my view, there is no more obvious example of the failure of austerity policies than what is going on Greece. For more than five years, Greece has cut pensions, Greece has slashed its government workforce, Greece has made deep spending cuts that have eviscerated its social safety net.In other words, despite what we have been led to believe by many in the media, Greece has not gone on a shopping spree. It has not overfunded its government. Rather, it has imposed massive spending cuts that have caused devastating pain to some of its most vulnerable people.It has done this because its creditors, led by Germany, have insisted that austerity is the only way to dig Greece out of its debt. As a result, today, Greece has the highest levels of inequality and the worst unemployment rates in Europe.The official unemployment rate is 26 percent, 26 percent. Youth unemployment in Greece today is more than 50 percent. More than 30 percent of the people in Greece are living in poverty. And the Greek economy is 25 percent smallerhas shrunk by 25 percent over the last five years.That is really quite incredible.Instead of solving the problem, austerity, in my view, has made a bad situation much worse. Greece has seen its debt-to-GDP ratio shoot up from about 120 percent to about 175 percent today. And now to, quote, unquote, ""fix the problem,"" the Troika wants Greece to borrow more money and make deeper cuts to wages, pensions, and other social programs.In January, as you all know, the people of Greece stood up and said enough is enough. They elected a new government, known as Syriza, that promised to end the harsh austerity policiesthat was their campaign pledge; by increasing their minimum wage, by increasing job production, by protecting the most vulnerable against pension cuts, and ensuring that the wealthiest people in Greece started paying their fair share of taxes, a very serious problem in that country.But instead of working with the new government to find a rational path forward, the Troika demanded more austerity than ever.On July 5th, the people of Greece spoke, once again, in an overwhelming show of solidarity with their government, 61 percent of the people of Greece said no to more austerity for the poor, for the children, for the sick, and for the elderly.Yet, instead of working with the Greek government on a sensible plan that would allow Greece to improve its economy and pay back its debt, Germany and the Troika continued to push Greece to accept even greater austerity.They want even deeper pension cuts, an increase in the regressive VAT tax from 13 percent to 23 percent, automatic budget cuts as the Greek economy underperforms, privatization of state assets, including the electricity grid, deregulation of the transportation, rail, pharmaceutical, and other sectors in the economy, weakening of trade unions.In other words, the people of Greece are being told that their voices, which they cast in two elections, really do not matter, that their misery does not matter, that an entire generation of young people who are unemployed or underemployed does not matter, that the sick and the elderly do not matter, that democracy itself does not matter, and that, to my perspective, is unacceptable.I believe that this plan is simply unsustainable. In my view, austerity has failed and continuing with austerity means the Greek economy will continue to fail its people, unemployment, poverty, and inequality will increase from already obscene levels.And maybe, just maybe, some people are beginning to wake up to this reality.In a confidential report that was made public earlier this month, officials from the IMF warned that the IMF could not take part in any new bailout for Greece unless the Greek government was offered a substantial debt-relief package as part of any new deal.In light of this report, it is time for the Troika to provide the Greek government with the flexibility it needs to create jobs, raise wages, and improve its economy. Without a substantial improvement in its economy, Greece will never escape its debt crisis.And let us not forget a little bit about history. Let us not forget what happened after World War I, when the allies imposed oppressive austerity on Germanyon Germany, as part of the Versailles Treaty.And I think all of you who know anything about history understand what happened and that I the German economy collapsed, unemployment skyrocketed, people were pushing their money around in wheelbarrows to buy a loaf of bread, and the result of all of that massive discontent was that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party won an election and took power, and you all know the results of that.What many people do not know about Greece today is that the party that finished third in the Greekrecent Greek election is called Golden Dawn. This is a party which some people call a Neo-Nazi Party, but other people believe that it is nothing neo about it. It is a Nazi Party, which came in third place in the recent election.In my view, we should learn from history and we should understand that when democracy fails, when people vote for something and cannot get what the government promised because of outside forces, this leads to massive discontent. It leads to contempt for democracy and it opens the path for right-wing extremist parties like Golden Dawn. Finally, let us remember that one of the main reasons why Greece was unable to take on so much debt was because it had help from Goldman Sachs, who helped disguise the nature of the Greek debt.Today, when we talk about debt, we should appreciate that something similar is happening right now in Puerto Rico, where the government there is struggling with unsustainable debt. And a group of hedge fund billionaires are demanding austerity in Puerto Rico.They are demanding the firing of teachers, the closing of schools, so that they can reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the children and the people of Puerto Rico.It is time for creditors to sit down with the governments of Greece and Puerto Rico, and work out a debt-repayment plan that is fair to both sides. The people of Greece and the children of Puerto Rico deserve nothing less.Over seven years ago, the major economic leaders of 44 countries gathered in a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish international economic and financial rules. As a result of that conference, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were established.I think it is clear to anyone who has taken a look at this situation that the rules regarding our international financial system today are rigged in favor of the wealthy and the powerful, at the expense of everyone else.Today, 85 of the wealthiest people in this world own more wealth than the bottom half of the world\'s population, over 3 billion people. By next year, Oxfam has estimated that the top 1 percent of the world\'s population will own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent of the world\'s population.In my view, we have got to beginand I hope this forum today is a start in that process; a serious discussion about how we change our international financial rules to expandexpand economic opportunity and reduce income and wealth inequality, not only in Greece and in Puerto Rico, but throughout the world.The global economy is simply unsustainable when so few have so much and so many have so little.It is now my pleasure to introduce, to say a few words, and we\'re delighted that he\'s with us today, Ambassador Panagopoulos. Ambassador? [applause]PANAGOPOULOS: Thank you very much, Senator. [applause] Thank you so very much. [inaudible] [applause] Thank you so very much, Senator, for providing usme, first of all, the opportunity to be with you today, and for bringing together this great gathering, and for being really, not only an American leader, butbut a global leader.We need these kind of voices. And by the glance you gave us, the very basic perimeters of the plight of my country. Having the privilegethere are some that would say privilege to represent a country which I think quite easily would win the subtitle of the number 1 victim of the 2008 economic crisis, I can subscribe to the whole of your presentation.Let me tell you, youyou tell us in the most right way what the situation there it is, doubled our GDP, 25 percent unemployment, 25 percent-plus, the youth unemployment, a horrific number, close to 60 percent.All this tells that this is not only the labor. This catastrophe, it\'s not only a labor of our mistakes, which of course they exist. No question about this. We do need reforms. I know of no nation who doesn\'t need to change reforms, but which kind ofof reforms.You just posed the problem, what the realitythe substance of the problem is there.I\'ve been present in countless European councils, trying to solve, from the very beginning, the Greek crisis. My impression, always Brussels came too little, too late. I hope this time is not like this, but at the last agreement we had with our creditors, it looks like they begin , and you described some of them; some charter recessionary dimensions in this program.But let me tell you that we\'re determined to work as partners, not as enemies, and find a way out. It won\'t be easy. That\'s why we look forward to this discussion with world-famous personalities from the academic world, Professor Stiglitz, Professor Galbraith, and others to give us their expertise and help us with ideas.And, Senator, let me tell you that we\'d like to thank you so very much for your solidarity, your ideas, your intervention. They are most welcome from - from us. I would like to bring you best regards from [inaudible] and my government also.And let me close with somesomehowsome more bright remarks. First of all, we have a sense back in Greece that we haveand this is not far from reality; we have somehow better understanding and support here, this part of the [inaudible].Why? Probably the answer lies in the fact that you are the only ones who dealt successfully [inaudible] through the Great Depression and you don\'t try to bring recipes that they do not work. In other words, you don\'t take out the oxygen of an economy that is collapsing.The second one is a more bright one, that if we put these things behind us, and it will take a lot of effort to do that, Greece can recover relatively swiftly. We do run economy very heavy in investor background. So, it\'s mainly a service economy and if we get the right decisions, in a relatively short time, we can come back.Why? It\'s our geographical position, our geopolitical role there, building bridges centuries long, with all our environment, starting from Iran to the Arab world to our Israel friends, the Balkan countries. That creates a neighborhood, very promising, and we\'re in the heart of this, having the best relations with all this environment.So thank you so very much, looking forward to your discussion. Thank you very much.SANDERS: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. [applause]OK, I\'m going to give the mike over to Stephanie Kelton. Stephanie?KELTON: [off-mike] Excuse me. Thanks, boss. [laughter] Thank you all for coming.Thank you, Senator Sanders, for coming up with the idea toto do an event like this. He\'s been just very, very interested in Greece for a long time now. And so I appreciate very much the ambassador finding time in his schedule, and all of the panelists, as well, for agreeing to take part in what I think will be a very important discussion.What we\'re going to do is invite each of the panelists to say a few words. We\'ll try to keep comments to five to seven minutes or so, and then we\'ll began aa back-and-forth discussions, hopefully leaving just a little bit of time at the very end for some audience Q&amp;A.All right, we\'ll begin with Professor Stiglitz.STIGLITZ: [off-mike]Well, thank you very much forfor calling this meeting, Senator Sanders, andand the issue\'s a really important one.Greece is important for the United States. It - it islocation is important for our security. As the senator pointed out, there\'s a basic sense of solidarity, a solidarity that\'s based onon a long friendship. And there\'s aimportance of democracy. And I think we also need to recognize some aspects of our special culpability. The senator mentioned the Goldman Sachs. We have to also remember that we did play a role in, once before, destroying the democracy and unseating thethethe Colonel the Colonel was unseating the Papandreou government in 1967.And I\'ve watched, very carefully, the recreation of democracy in Greece and have been deeply, deeply disturbed by the fact of what amounts to the attempt by the European authorities to undermine democracy in Greece.So this is an issue about economics, but it\'s also an issue of basic democracy and it\'s an issue about broad security, in which all Americans should have an interest.I want to just spend a second in putting this in a broader context. Again, the senator did this. There are so many countries, so many debt crises. And if there were just one, you could say, oh, that country didn\'t manage its affairs well.But within Europe, Greece is just one of several countries that are in crisis. There\'s Spain, Portugal, Ireland. In the case of Spain and Ireland, they had a surplus before the crisis. They had a low debt-GDP ratio. The crisis caused the deficits, not the other way around.And it\'s important to bear that in mind in all the rhetoric about the economics of this crisis.But we have a crisis, a very similar one here in the United States and Puerto Rico. And many of the problems in the context of Puerto Rico echo what is happening in Greece.One of the really disturbing aspects of the Puerto Rican crisis is thatwe don\'t like to use this word, but Puerto Rico is our colony. And as our colony, we have a special responsibility.But we constructed things so that it\'s neither fish nor fowl. It\'s neither independent, nor do we take on the responsibility of the colonial master.So, when I was chief economist at the World Bank and wethere was the East Asia crisis, one of the things we told every country, you have to have a good bankruptcy law. And yet, when Puerto Rico decided to pass its bankruptcy law, we said, oh no, you\'re a colony. You can\'t have your own bankruptcy law.But our congress refuses to give them a bankruptcy law. And so, here they are, with this debt beyond their ability to manage and no way out of working this out under a rule of law.Globally, we have the same thing. We have no international rule of law governing sovereign debt restructuring. Argentina and many other countries have suffered as a result, and in some ways, Greece is suffering today as a result of that. Last September, the U.N. beganapproached us, there was an overwhelming vote in the U.N. to start a process of constructing an international rule of law for sovereign debt restructuring. But unfortunately, the United States has been the major opponent to the creation of an international rule of law.Now, I don\'t have time here to explain why they take on this peculiar position, given that we say we believe in the rule of law and yet vote, in the case of Puerto Rico, in thein the context of globally, we have done everything we can to stop the creation. And it has to do with the influence of financial markets.But, as an economist, when I see problems like this occurring over and over again, it\'s very natural to say, well, if only one country, you say there\'s a problem in the country. There\'s a rotten apple in every barrel.But when you see something so systemic, you have to say there\'s a systemic problem and we have to study and deal with the systemic problem. Otherwise, we\'re going to have a problem here and then a problem there.And that\'s really what this is about. What are the systemic issues? Now, I don\'t have really time tototo go through all the aspects of what can we do to prevent the recurrence of another. What I want to do is focus this afternoon on the failure of our response to the crisis, as opposed to the creation.What I emphasize, it was not excessive [inaudible] that created the crises in Spain and Ireland and all that. And one has to see the Greek crisis in that broaderbroader context.When the crisis struck, Greece\'s debt-to-GDP ratio was 110, 120 percent of GDP. To put it in context, at the end of World War II, we had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 130 percent. But we didn\'t say that was unsustainable.What we said is that if we could grow the economy, debt-GDP ratio would go down, because GDP would go up. Just simple arithmetic, if you can get GDP to go up then the debt-GDP ratio goes down and debt becomes more sustainable.But unbelievably, the Troika, this group of IMF, the ECBthe European Central Bank, and the European Commission decided the way to attack the problem of excessive debt was to get GDP down. And of course if you get GDP down, then the debt-GDP ratio goes up.So, they have went from a situation where initially they had a debt-GDP ratio of 110, 120, to 170. But what the senator didn\'t point out, in the middle of that, they had a massive debt write-off. So, even with the debt write-off, things got worse.And it wasn\'t because Greece didn\'t do what it was told. It was because they did do what was told. They did follow the macroeconomic mandates. And those macroeconomic mandates, predictably and predicted, led to a decline in GDP and a debt-unsustainability. It led to the recession and now we have to be clear. The description of what is going on in Greece is the Great Depression. And Germany and the other members of the Troika don\'t use that word, but it is a Great Depression.And the statistics, you know, if you\'re a young personand there are so many young people here; if the unemployment rate is 60 percent and it\'s been that way for five years, and is likely to remain that way as long as it canI can see, there\'s no hope.What\'s happening, the unemployment rate would be even worse, except for so many of the young people have been leaving the country. But what does that do to the future of the country? The debt stays there, but people move. So, the debt-unsustainability gets even worse.And this has a lot to do with the structure of the euro. I can\'t go into all theagain, all the details, butbut fundamental things, there\'s a deep long structure in the Eurozone, but the policies that have been implemented have made things worse. And they causedthey caused this deep depression.Now, back in the 19th century, when individuals got excessively into debt, there was a simple solution. You put them into prison. And we had debtor prisons. Now you ask a simple question. Do people in prison generate the income to repay the debt?Well the answerit\'s a rhetorical question, in case you didn\'t know. Now , you don\'t make money when you\'re in prison, but that is what the Troika has been doing, effectively, to Greece.Or to give another example, in the 19th century, and even into the 20th century, when countries couldn\'t repay the debt, what happened? We sent in armies. When Venezuela couldn\'t pay its debt at the beginning of theofof the 20th century, we sent inEurope sent in warships.And interestingly, Argentina came to the defense of Venezuela and said whenever you lend to a sovereign, sovereign immunity pertains. You cannot destroy sovereign immunity. It\'s sacrosanct.And they came and the guyinteresting; the name of theof the foreign minister of Argentina at the time was Drago . It\'s a different Draghi than the European Central Bank. But he came to the defense of Venezuela.Thetoday, what we\'ve been doing in Greece is not sending in armed troops. What we\'ll be doing is just as forceful. It is the Troika saying that if you don\'t do what we say, life is over.Now let me talk a little bit about the other conditions. The most invidious conditions are the macro conditions. And under the new program, things are going to get worse. The depression is going to get deeper.The primary surplus is going to go from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent. And even with debt forgiveness, that primary surplus is going to lead to an economic downturn.But beyond that are all these conditions that are referred to structural reforms. Most of thesemany of these are unimportant. They represent a reflection of special interest in the rest of Europe.They\'re arguing over the shelf life of milk, the size of the loaves of bread, things that are not important. And they\'re not doing anything about the important things, which is the growth of inequality , the role of the big banks in dominating, the role of the big media.So, they\'re ignoring the big issue. But in fact, in some ways, they\'re making the big issues worse and that\'s what I find very disturbing.So we all know inequality increases if workers don\'t have anythinganybody to defend them. But they want to weaken unions. It\'s bad enough that wages are down 25, 30, 35 percent, but they said that\'s not enough. We have to weaken unions.And then, finally, there are a whole set of issueswell, actually, not finally, there are a whole set of issues that are counterproductive, like small businesses have to pay their taxes ahead of time, a year ahead of time.That\'s a death knell for businessessmall businesses. And 90 percent of the businessesor more than 90 percent inininin - in Greece are small businesses. So you\'re trying to recover the economy and then you have structural reforms that are designed to make that economy crash.The final thing is the privatizations. And their privatizations are not designed to rejuvenate the economy. One article that was published over the weekend in the London Review of Books really tells it all. There\'s one companythey talk about Greek tax evaders.The largestprobably one of the largest tax evaders is a German company that runs the Greek airport. It was almost a billion dollars. And the prices, after privatization of the airport, are among the highest in the world.So, here you have privatization, to a German company, and things have gotten worse. Now how is that going to solve the problem by having more privatizations of that kind? So, the bottom line is there needs to be a program for Greece, but it\'s not the one the Troika is offering.I think it\'s really important or the United States to come to the assistance, and I hope Congress will take some actions, because unfortunately, what we\'re seeing right now is, under the Troika program, Greece is going to deeper into depression. [applause]KIRKEGAARD: Well, thank you very much. I\'m [inaudible] for thanking Stephanie and Senator Sanders for inviting me. And I should also say that I was invited, I believe, to provide a diversity of views. And based on what we\'ve heard so far, I don\'t think that will be too difficult.But I\'m actually happy to say that the first diversity view that I will say is that I\'m actually quite optimistic with regards to the Greek economy, because I believe that if Prime Minister Tsipras continues on his new path, the one he found in the last couple weeks, I believe it is entirely possible that the Greek economy will grow 3 percent next year.Why is that? It\'s because I believe that, if he sticks with his commitments, he will achieve significant debt relief in the first quarter of 2016. He will also getor the Greek economy will enjoy a sizable monetary stimulus by being eligible for quantitative easing purchases by the ECB, et cetera.And the will alsoalso maybe end up with a short-term fiscal target of, I believe, a primary deficit of perhaps 1 percent over the next 12 months, all of which, in my opinion, should beprovided there is political stability, should be more than enough to see economy go back to significant growth.So, I can tell that I also think that it\'s important to provide a diversity of view, as I said, to perhaps attack what I consider to be some of the myths about the Greek crisis that seems to be quite widespread.And the first such myth I would argue that exists is the idea that austerity was imposed on Greece. I think the reality is quite different, because the reality is that, quite unlike in the United States or the UK, for instance, where austerity has been a choice, austerity in Greece came as the result of two things.One, that it faced an objective loss of market access. There were simply no buyers for its debts in the private markets.And secondly, that inin 2009, it had a primary deficit of more than 10 percent of GDP. And if you have a primary deficit of more than 10 percent of GDP and have lost market access, austerity\'s going to come your way no matter what happens.And that\'s the situation that Greece were in. So when we talk about who imposed austerity on this, it wasn\'t the German government. It was the privateit was the private market participants said they didn\'t want to buy the debt.Vermont Teachers\' Union could have done it. The Endowment of Columbia or Texas University could have done it. No one did it. That\'s why it was imposed.Now it is certainly the case that the initial Troika program, in my opinion, was wrongly structured. It had too much emphasis on fiscal consolidation. It didn\'t take into consideration that Greece was going to be the first domino in what turned out to be regional crisis and that in many ways the pro-growth element of the program had other issues related to them. So there was too much austerity built relatively in the program, but it wasn\'t a case of why the Greek budget deficit had to be cut. It was simply because, in my opinion, there was no other alternative.The second myth that you often hear is that the original bailout that was structured in 2010 was done predominantly to save the German and French banks that had lent a lot of money, allegedly, to Greece.Now, it is true that the Germanthe combined German and French banking exposure to Greece in the lastthe first quarter of 2010 was about 50 billion euros. And there\'s no doubt that, by the way the structure of the deal, they saved quite a lot of money, these banks, from doing so.But the waythe reason that the bailout was designed in this way was not to save justto save these few banks in France and Germany. It was to save the entire Euro area financial system, and indeed, make sure that there wasn\'t a sustained on other peripheral countries in Europe at the time, basically to save Europe and the global economy from another Lehman moment, which was entirely the right thing to do.Andand I would also say that we should keep in mind that, yes, German and French bank had 50 billion in euro exposure. Let\'s hypothesize that they hadn\'t been salvaged, so they had lost all that money.That would have accounted for about 6 to 7 percent of theof the base capital in the French and German banking system, 6 to 7 percent. You know, significant loss, but not probably catastrophic either.Now we should also keep in mind that they weren\'t the only banks that were saved by this bailout in 2010, because the reality is that the exposure of the Greek banking system to Greek sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2010 was 40 billion euros as well, which surprisingly accounted for about 100 percent of Greek banking sector capital at the time.So if you had not had the bailout, you would have wiped out the entire capital of the Greek banking system and you would probably have had no other choice than to bail in depositors at the time to recapitalize. That would have been the true counterfactual to the way the bailout was done.The third significant myth I would argue about Greece is that the demand by the Troika for, in the long runand as I said, I believe for the next 12 months, would probably have a primary deficit for Greece for about 1 percent, which I think is appropriate.But the idea that it is completely unrealistic and unfeasible to have long-term fiscal primary surplus targets of 3 percent or above, I actually think is not true, because if you look at the fiscal history of advanced economy from 1950 onwards, and you look at the countriesthe number of times in which countries actually managed to run these kids of surpluses, you will see that about a quarter of all years in such a time or such a data set, you will have primary surpluses of more than 3 percent.So this is entirely feasible and in fact not, therefore, a competing theme to ask for in the case of Greece, because you do want primary deficits when you have a situationexcuse me; where there are, you know, high debts and a big differential between interest and roof , which will certainly be the case in Greece.The fourth myth I would argue that exists is that the ECB is some sort of an enforcer of depression era politics in Greece. I actually don\'t think that\'s the case at all.The reality is that the ECB is the central bank for all of Europe, and as being thatsorry; for all of the Euro area, they are also the Greece\'s, by far, biggest creditor, which had lent Greece, in various forms, either through bond purchase of liquidity provision, about 130 billion euros, which is 70 or so percent of GDP.But what it has also done, of course, it that, yes, it has been instrumental in shutting down the Greek banking system, but that is an entirely predictable outcome when you have a sovereign government that decides to draw question marks about the solvency of itself, and therefore, whether or not the collateral that itthat its banking system relies on is also maybe solvent or not.You cannot ask any independent or any central bank in the world at all to actually lend against collateral that isn\'t sound . The ECBECB didn\'t do it and one that should not be surprised that it didn\'t do it.And therefore, many of the policies that thethe current government inin Greece engaged in earlier in this year would have hadshould have had entirely predictable outcomes, which in fact, seems to have been the case, now that we know there was in fact a plan to potentially try to introduce another currency in Greece in the instance that the ECB did as it did.But as I said, that is a natural follow-through of what I would call normal, prudent central bank policies.The last final myth I would argue is that basically I would contend that you cannot get to a situation where Grexit makes any sense for a country like Greece.And I think here, it\'s quite important to recognize that there is in fact no valid historical comparisons to which to draw such inferences, because the reality, we sometimes here that, well, we have Argentina. Or we have, you know, the collapse of the Soviet Union, new currencies, the breakup of Czechoslovakia, or the former Yugoslavia.But the reality is that none ofnone of those cases are the situation that Greece is in, because it is not the case in Greece that it\'s sort of breaking a currency board , like what was the case in Argentina. It\'s not the case in Greece that is the dissolution of a currency union, like in Czechoslovakia, et cetera. The case that Greece would be in would basically be to reverse full currency substitution or reverse at a full dollarization, and try to introduce a new currency while the existing bank or currency, the euro in this case, was still in place.And I don\'t believe there is a single example in financial history that has actually been instrumented. [inaudible] either in the euro area or the dollar. Even theeven theeven in Ecuador, having tried to roll back full dollarization, or Panama or, you know, El Salvador or other countries.And there\'s actually, in my opinion, therefore, no historical record to suggest that he would be successful in Greece, but I certainly look forward to, at some point, reading the reports that were prepared for the former finance minister.But I think it\'s also, we should be clear, that Greece is a country that exports relatively little. It has all a fairly undiversified economy, so it would be a valid . It imports a great many things of importance, food, energy, medical supplies, et cetera, which suggests that the idea, in my opinion, that you could achieve a real exchange rate depreciation in Greece is doubtful.And in fact, it would certainly only be able to do so if you had very high levels of nominal inflation, with fairly catastrophic social effects onto that. Andand therefore, II basically don\'t think you could do it And if you could do it in Greece, I think I will end it with a final question, which is why not do it also with Puerto Rico? If it makes to do it in Greece, why doesn\'t make any sense to do it in Puerto Rico? Yet, Puerto Rico dropped out of the dollar and introduced its new currency.I would [inaudible] consistent advice would advocate [inaudible].Thank you. [applause]GALBRAITH: Thanks very much and it\'s a pleasure to be here.My engagement with the Greek question goes back now quite a few years and it has a lot to do with a personal-professional association that I had with the former finance minister and my good friend, Yanis Varoufakis.But I want to begin here, especially to thank in very, most profound terms, Senator Sanders, who, when this crisis became, you know, acute in the wake of the election in January, he stepped up and he expressed his solidarity, expressed to [inaudible] a statesman-like manner, and a manner which I know the ambassador has already saidI can tell you that my friends in Greece took note and were deeply, deeply appreciative.And Greece is a small and a fairly distant country. And apart from a shared heritage and a cultural legacy, it\'s reasonable to ask why the United States should be engaged with it. And we\'ve already heard a number of answers.There is a strategic argument, which the ambassador made. Greece is what you might call a near frontline state in an important neighborhood, on the margins of an unstable, but nevertheless, promising region.It has a role to play in that part of the world and it is an important, longstanding NATO ally of the United States, so that\'sthat\'s the first reason.The second argument is that Senator Sanders made in his introduction that Joe also made, which is an argument of principal, not economic policy, which is that when economic policy proves to behave disastrous effects, it should change.It shouldthe fact should be recognized, consequences should be evaluated in an open [inaudible], and changes in policy should be introduced.It\'s worth notingand I\'m not going to dispute for a minute what you just said about the inevitability of austerity in the Greek context, given the financial crises in 2010, and given the mismanagement of Greek state finances in the years before the crisis.But when the policies were imposed at that time, there was a projecting that they would produce a decline in Greek GDP of 5 percent, with a recovery coming within a year or two, so that things would be back to normal by 2012.That was on the basis of the policies that were implemented. And the actual decline in GDP was 25 percent over a few years, with no recovery to speak of. The notion that things were recovering in 2014, was an artifact of the fact that prices were falling more rapidly than nominal GDP.So you were in a debt deflation, which was making the burden of private debts go up and the burden never [inaudible] go up.So, the stress of that situation five yearsit\'s not 25 percent the GDP annually. It\'s five years of lost GDP on every social institution, every piece of infrastructure that makes the economy function, the healthcare system, the education system, the physical infrastructure, the maintenance of buildings and roads and so forth, has been enormous.The stress has been enormous and the loss of top-level personal to immigration, as well as promising young people to emigration is also a long-term consequence of this.So, one has to ask, when you go back and re-impose the same policies, which I don\'t believe anybody in authority in the Eurozone thinks is appropriate for Greece. I think Wolfgang Schaeublein fact I know that Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that they\'re not appropriate for Greece. It\'s not the reason he\'s imposing them. You have to ask what is the likelihood of success. I\'ll estimate [inaudible] for every extra point on the primary surface, you lose a point of GDP so that we\'re likely to see continued declines, if those targets are, in fact, met.If we\'re lucky and you\'re right, the targets won\'t be met. And that\'s the basis for some possible improvement in conditions in the next year or so. But we have to remember that the policy that\'s been imposed will impose automatic cuts in spending if the revenue targets are not met.And that is going to possibly create a continuing, deepening spiral, which will affect the stability of loans in the banking system.There\'s still, I think, a larger reason why we should be concerned with the Greek question and that has to do with the future of Europe. Europe is a very large place. And it\'s a partner on which we rely to function as a major economic and political success and poll of stability in the world.And as an economic entity, Europe is in trouble, thanks to an unstable architecture, destabilized, in part by the great success of industry in one part of Europe, in the north of Europe and especially in German, by deep internal imbalances, surpluses in one area, offset by large deficits everywhere else, and by a lack of stabilizing mechanisms of the kind that we have enjoyed in this country since the New Deal and the Great Society.And that imbalance and that architecture works to impoverish and alienate a large part of the European population, and economic failure is reinforced or enforced by democratic failure, one of the features of the deal or the bid cap that was imposed on Greece earlier this month is a requirement, for example, that the parliament may not even submit forthe government may not even submit for public comment, legislation that has not previously been approved by the creditors.That is a draft , if you like , of popular sovereignty, and in my view, a violation of a core principle of the Treaties of the European Union, which is that the union is based on representative democracy.The fracturelet me just make one more point about the saving of the banks in 2010. I don\'t disagree that it was necessary, but I think it was done here under false premises. Why was the Greek debt extended?You made the point, I think accurately, that you do not make a new loan on bad collateral, but that sin was already committed in 2010, when the IMF, against the advice of staff and of certain executive directors, extended a quotaa loan to Greece, 32 times its quota, the largest in history, for the purposes that you just mentioned.It would have been much better at that time to recognize that the Greek debt should be written off and to bailout the banks directly as a problem within the north European context.So, anyway, the fracture that has happened could have come in other countries, but it happened in Greece for two reasons. For one reason is that the conditions were especially severe. Greece adjusted more and suffered more than any other European crisis country by a factor of about three.And the second was a kind of happenstance, which is that a new political party arose in Greece, that had an especially clear voice and platform that presented a concrete alternative that made an argument to the Greek people, which they found persuasive and which they rewarded with a victory in the elections in January.And so the Greek governmentthe new Greek government was in a position to try something, which awas a five-month effort, which I was very proud to have a very small supporting role in, to attempt to negotiate change in Europe; attempt to win a change in European policy.That would occur within the euro. And it has been, the ambassador I think will confirm, the consistent policy of this government to stay within the euro and the Eurozone and to attempt to do so under viable conditions.We didn\'t succeed. That\'s not their fault. The fact was theythey were negotiating against aa phalanx of partners, so-called partners, institutions and governments that for many different reasons were not prepared to concede anything at all; not on the debt, not on the conditions, not on the terms.They also did not succeed in defending the core of political principles and economic common sense of the government\'s program with respect to pensions, for example, particularly a very low-income people; with respect to the basic rights, internationally recognized labor rights; with respect to the sensible management of state assets.All of these things were overridden under the basic threat you have to the end of the month and if they didn\'t concede, the banks would be closed and would not reopen and the depositors would lose their money, which is the working capital of the Greek business sector, and that would bring on an economic collapse.So, I think as I said, I think the effort was awas an honorable one. The fact that it did not succeed does not mean that the problems will now go away.They make get better for a short while, but the underlying issues will remain and they will arise again; if not in Greece, then elsewhere as other countries experience similar and a negative dynamic.We talked a little bit about the role of the United States. The United States I think has a reputation in Europe and especially in Greece for pragmatism, right?And I think that the government of the United States played a constructive role in recent months. The president made a number of important telephone calls to Chancellor Merkel, in particular, in order to try and bring the two partners together in a bargaining sense and to achieve some element of compromise on both sides.That was a useful thing to do up to a point. But it seems to me now, given what we\'ve experienced, that we the United States need a stronger policy in two respects.First, as I think Senator Sanders said to begin with, we need to help. We need to provide moral and economic support for the country, our ally which is in trouble in these conditions.But we also should be more open than we have been to Democratic progressive forces in Europe that are pressing for change. We should recognize their legitimacy, not wait for them to get into government before we start talking to them, but be part of a dialogue about the kind of changes that are required, even though that may make existing governments in other countries who are also our allies uncomfortable. It should be part of our principle that we are open to having this discussion because it\'s important for the future of Europe.These forces likely represent the future in several countries. You can see that in the Greek referendum bill when it was the youth who overwhelmingly voted no, right? That\'s where the youth are going to be. We need to be engaged with that if we want to havekeep our friends and build our alliances with Europe as a whole.And finally, we should I think begin to distinguish between the strategic importance of the European Union, which is 28 countries, and which includes some of our most important allies, Britain, Poland and some smaller countries; Croatia, the Czech Republic are very strong American allies who are not members of the Eurozone and who are not inclined to become members of the Eurozone. They certainly are doing their best to avoid meeting the criteria if they can do so.And the Eurozone, on the other hand, which is 19 countries and is an economic device, an economic device to be supported when it can be made to work but not if it can\'t. Some I would say .If other countries gravitate toward an alternative structure, we should not confuse the two things. It does not mean that they are moving out of Europe; it does not mean that they are moving out of the West, that they are wavering in their commitments to democracy.It may mean, quite the contrary, that they\'re simply recognizing that the existing arrangements were not built on sound economic principles. And when that happens, it is the proper and pragmatic thing to change them and we should at least be neutral; we should be neutral and helpful in trying to find workable solutions.One of the lessons of the last five months is that there is an enormous challenge in front of us all to do that. Because at present, Europe is well short of what it takes to provide a workable solution to the economic problems that it has built for itself over the last 15 years. So once again, thank you very much. Thank you, Senator, for organizing this extremely important event.And I have to say it was even worthwhile, although I did it with considerable pain, to sacrifice a few days on my farm in Vermont to come down...[laughter]And be with you guys. [applause]KELTON: Thank you all. Let me pose a question, initially to Jamie. Jamie, Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, said that it was impossible to discuss the economic rationale for austerity with his European counterparts.When he tried, he said he was, quote, ""met with blank stares"" and that it was as if he hadn\'t even spoken. Why was it so hard for Yanis to inject an element of reason into the conversation, given the colossal failures of the austerity policies?GALBRAITH: Oh, that\'sthat\'s straightforward; he was dealing with finance ministers. I mean...[laughter]Yanis Varoufakis comes from a world of, let\'s say, reasoned argument. He\'s really very good at it.You can read his blog; there are millions of words going back five years, six years, seven years that describe exactly and in very acute termsthis is why I was drawn to him to begin with. I think he\'s one of the most significant forces in this debate that ininin the world at the moment.And of course, thehis colleagues or counterparties in the Eurogroup, which is the quasi-formal entity that coordinates the activity of the finance ministers of the Eurozone, are political figures orwell, they\'re basically political figures who have I think in many cases, they areat least a few cases, highly intelligent. That\'s certainly true ofofof the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble.But they are not interested in argument of the kind that Yanis brought to bear and they\'re not interested particularly in the economic conditions in Greece. They\'re interested in the political fortunes of their own governments, which they tend to be the more conservative elements; that\'s what finance ministers get to be. Andand they\'re interested in being on the right side of the power centers in Europe, which are the government of Germany and then of course the European Central Bank.So, it\'s not surprising that he was one against 18. But then if youif youif you made it a criteria that ofof merit that you have to be with the majority on these matters then, you know, everybody from Andrei Sakharov to Jesus Christ would be in trouble. [laughter]STIGLITZ: [off-mike] Cancan I just addcan I just add onegood. I\'d just add one little thing.It is a little bit more surprising because the IMF Olivier Blanchard in their world economic outlook did put out that austerity has these adverse effects.So, even though you had what had been aaa conservative institution, they woke up and, you know, not perfectly, and I won\'t say throughout their organizations, even they didn\'t buy their own arguments. But at the top level, therethere was a recognition austerity has these adverse effects.And thereso, to me, it was a little bit surprising that they ignored evidence to the extent that they did.KELTON: [off-mike] Thisthis actually witnesses we have to continue to turn these on and off, don\'t we?This brings me to the next question I was actually going to ask you, Professor Stiglitz. Paul Samuelson, another Nobel Prize winning economist...STIGLITZ: From Gary, Indiana, the same town I came from.KELTON: How about that? [laughter]Samuelson said of FDR, ""Roosevelt did not know a lot about economics but he knew which whiskey wasn\'t working and he was ready to shop around in a way Herbert Hoover, by temperament, could not have done.""So, my question is you\'ve just returned from Greece and I know you\'ve been all over Europe and you\'re working in perhaps an advisory role.Have you found an FDR in the Eurogroup, at the IMF? You mentioned Olivier Blanchard. Are there others now who you think are beginning to see that the whiskey isn\'t working and they\'re willing to shop around for alternative policies?STIGLITZ: Well, I think when you\'re talking about a number of the officials, particularly finance ministers, unfortunately I sense a lot of intimidation.People are afraid to get on the other side of Germany because they may need help. And so many of the countries are inin thatII don\'t want to say precarious, but are in that difficult position.Officially, Holland andandthethethe president of France and most of the economists in France are very supportive of the Greek government, very critical of the austerity. They\'ve been very loud.I know they were calling up the president all the time and telling him, you know, you can\'t allow this to continue and that\'s where his heart was. But in the end, in that negotiating room, I think, you know, who knows what was going on in his mind. But ithe wasn\'t able to be strong enough to counter the pressure fromfrom Germany.KELTON: Are you wanting to jump in?GALBRAITH: Yeah, II think it\'s fair to say that quite a number of countries had their own reasons for being resistant to any change in European policy.To go east to Finland or the Baltics, you have strong ideological commitment to the neoliberal and austerity line. They\'re just deeply imbedded in it.The Finns were nervous because their commitment to the euro has cost them very dearly in economic terms compared to the Swedes or the Norwegians.Theyif you go in the other direction to Spain and Portugal and also Ireland, these are governments, conservative governments which were extremely hostile because any success granted to the Greek government would cost them politically against Podemos, against Livre, against Sinn Fein. And that gave them exceptionally reason of their own to be unforthcoming.But then, basically the other reality is that the negotiations didn\'t occur in the Eurogroup; they occurred with the institutions. The Eurogroup was there to put a stamp on it, basically. The institutions themselves, not entirely internally unified.As we know, the IMF says we can\'t do this without debt restructuring; that\'s a sensible position. The IMF on the other hand was much stricter on the policy terms than the European Commission would\'ve been.So, it was a complex case where you had one country negotiating against multiple and not entirely unified partners who hadwhose operating instruction was don\'t give any ground. And that was whatit was easiest for them.And as Joe has said, and I think in a very important piece in the New York Times, they also threw in everything. You know, they weren\'t discriminating about whether a policy actually had evidence behind it. They said, well, they have aIMF has an obsession about who owns Greek pharmacies; it has absolutely nothing to do with whether the Greek population is getting its over-the-counter drugs at low prices, which is in fact the case, right, and has to do with who owns thewho gets the rents from owning a pharmacy, which is not a competitiveness issue.KELTON: I want to let...STIGLITZ: Let me just add one thing on the pharmacy because it\'s got so much attention. One of the interesting things that Papandreou had done was put all the prescriptions online and that actually brought prices down and saved a couple billion dollars.No attention is given to those really deep reforms that actually made a difference. And it\'s all about...GALBRAITH: Who owns them and when ...STIGLITZ: Who owns them, whichwhich is not going to determine the way the economy functions.KELTON: I want to give Jacob a chance because Jacob is not convinced that the whiskey is not working. And so, I want to ask him to describe for us what failure would look like.KIRKEGAARD: Well, failure, in my opinion, indicates that Greece will certainly look like a, shall we say, attempt to introduce a new currency, for instance. I think that would be an abject failure because, in my opinion, the consequences of that would be catastrophic, even beyond where we are now.And I would be the first to admit that the program as it was originally designed has been largely a failure for a whole host of reasons. So, I\'m not by any means suggesting that, you know, what we have inin Greece is a success or even anan acceptable outcome; it\'s not.And I certainly also agree that it was very clear for all the reasons that Jamie and Joe has just described why it was 18 to one. But I guess I would say that anyone who understands how Europe works and recognizes that these 18 other finance ministers in the room come with their own democratic mandates and therefore, they\'re not going to listen to arguments of the type that former finance minister Varoufakis was bringing.The outcome of what has happened in Greece inin the last five to six months were not actually very surprising. And therefore, the mystery to me is why thisthisin the knowledge thereof, or what should, in my opinion, have been the knowledge that this would be the end point, namely that you would end up with the banks closed indefinitely, why it was nonetheless attempted. Because at the end of the day, I don\'t think any democratic government anywhere has actually survived the closure of its banking system.But what would failure look like? No, I think failure would lookwould have looked like a Greece that were tumbling out of the euro area which also, in my opinion, would mean that it would be shut out ofof the E.U. budget, meaning de facto end up without being a member of the E.U. because this would\'ve had catastrophic consequences for the country.In some ways, I would argue that what has happened in the last five years is a, you know, in many ways, near-lethal fall from the 50th to the 40th floor, but there\'s still quite a long way you can drop if you do some bad things.KELTON: Let me ask Joe and Jamie both to share their reaction to the idea that a Grexit isit would be absolutely catastrophic.STIGLITZ: Yeah, II\'m more of the view thatthat actually the current path is catastrophic because there\'s depression without end.You know, I think with a lot of work, you could make euro work. But it\'s going to take a lot of work.And given the politics and the reasoning that we\'ve just described where you have finance ministers who don\'t understand economics or if they understand economics, feel their hands are tied by domestic politics and so they can\'t do anything, that\'s a Europe that can\'t work. You have an economic regime where economic principles are thrown to the side.So, the question is is it possible to organize a Grexit that will be not destabilizing? And I am absolutely convinced that it is, particularly in the 21st century.Because in the 21st century, wemoney is different from it used to be. We have, you know, we havewe have electronic financial institutions, you know, electronic money.So, thethe way the corralito worked in Argentina was actually relatively smooth after the first couple of weeks of, you know, maybe a month, a couple months of adjustment. Once that happened, actually the discount on the money that was inside the banking system and the money floating on turned out to be essentially zero.So, you know, there\'s a fundamental flaw. Want to people say, well, Greece doesn\'t get support . Well, that\'s really a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of modern prey .They sell tourist services. I just came back from buying a very large amount of tourist services and that generates foreign exchange revenue.If you raise the VAT, of course you make it less competitive. Youif you force the banksfor small businesses, which most of them are, to pay their VAT, to pay their income tax a year ahead of time, of course that\'s going to destroy the economy.But what I\'m saying iswhat one can do is a change in the de facto exchange rate. And you can stay in the euro andand have this money inside thethe banking system as well as money outside the banking system. You could actually make this work.Before the last episode of the crisis actually, Greece had a current account surplus. So, theit will take a little while to restore that current account surplus, but I feel very convinced that you can make a very smooth transition out. And it may turn out to be the only way that you restore prosperity to Greece, given the obstinacy ofof its so-called partners.KELTON: Jamie, can you talk a little bit about plan B, since we\'re hearing I think a little bit about electronic transitions to a new currency? Whatis there anywhat can you tell us?GALBRAITH: I can tell you quite a bit.KELTON: I know you can. [laughter]What will you tell us?GALBRAITH: You know, it was...[laughter]It was always the policy of the Greek government and of the finance ministry to negotiation within the euro. And everybody who was attempting to be helpful, as I was to my friend, was conscious of that and extremely careful not to do anything or say anything that might be construed as having another objective.It was not, in fact, an alternative policy scheme. It was a precautionary operation.The danger that the Greek government faced, which was known toto its high officials from the beginning, from January when the president of the Eurogroup visited Athens and told Yanis Varoufakis flatly that it was either the memorandum of understanding as it existed or that the Europeans would crash the banking system.That was not a threat that was taken idly and we were very conscious that the European Central Bank, having first waived thewithdrawn the waiver that permitted Greek banks to refinance themselves directly on February 4th, held in its hands the tool, namely emergency liquidity assistance, that could bring the Greek banking system to its knees, which is did eventually but capping it at the time of the referendum. But it could\'ve also reopened it, which would have had very serious consequences.So, it was only prudent to task a small group very discreetly to think about what kind of challenges would have to be faced if that situation arose. That\'s what we were doing.What were the methods? The methods were any method any academic is going to use in these circumstances. We read the open literature.We looked at the experience of U.S. municipalities issuing IOU scrip in the 1930s. We looked at the experience of the state of California in 2002. We looked at the implementation of capital controls in Cyprus. We looked at the experience in Latin America with thein particular, the Argentine crisis in 2002. We looked at a wide range of things. We looked at the European treaties.We came to the view that an exit would not necessarily mean athis was basically legal advice, that thenot necessarily mean exit from the European Union. That would be a decision that would be taken by the European Union and probably if they chose to keep Greece in, they could. They could simply reestablish the kind of derogation that Britain and Sweden already enjoy.Would it have beenlet me kind of say it to Jacob, thatthat nothing you said about thethe perils of this was any news to us. Our job was to outline what the problems were and we outlined quite a lot of them.This was not something that was going to be taken lightly and it was something whichfor which there would have to be a level of preparation which was impossible because it would\'ve not beenyou couldn\'t do it without essentially creating a self-fulfilling prophesy.So, it was at most a preliminary effort for a circumstance that we very much wished to avoid that in fact was avoided.What are the basic economics? I think they\'re basically two things.You have transition costs. And in the transition costs, you have to work very carefully to ensure that this society functions and that people who are vulnerable are not hurt anyor hurt as little as possible.And you have vulnerable people; you have people who rely on ATMs to get their pensions. What happens if you don\'t have cash to put in the ATMs? That\'s a question you have to think about, what your alternatives are.Once you\'re through the transition, I think the evidence is you would get, as Joe said, a fairly rapid rebound because you would have the advantage of the depreciation which would be substantial in some sectors like tourism. And you would have control over your own policy and you wouldn\'t be subject to the memorandum anymore so you could pursue what you thought was most appropriate for Greece, the government could on its own lights .But ideally, it would\'ve been better and would still be better to achieve a compromise that\'s workable within the Eurozone and that has everybody\'s support. So, that\'s I think the, you know, the government has taken its choices.I think the government chose according to its ownits best lights under the very difficult conditions that it faced. And I have nothing but respect for every side inside that government which strikes me as aaa group of people who are worthy of respect, which is why I\'m very proud to be associated with them. KELTON: Thanks, Jamie.Let me ask aa question that is related to something that you often hear in the halls, these halls here. And that question is isis Greece a canary in the coalmine for the United States?You often hear people make the argument that here in the U.S., we need to begin making deep cuts to programs like social security and Medicare and other forms of social safety net programs to avoid ending up like Greece.And so, my question is what do you say to people who make those arguments? Can the U.S. end up in a Greek-style debt crisis? I\'m going to start at the end and go right down.KIRKEGAARD: No. I mean, I think the probability of that happening is essentially zero. And I think the narrative going in that direction is entirely misguided.We can talk for a very long time about why Greece ended up in the situation that it did, but I think on any conceivable parameter, the United States is a very, very different entity. So, I think it\'s a completely misguided characterization.KELTON: Joe?STIGLITZ: Yeah, II agree. Let me just make a coupleexplanation why it\'s so different. First, we borrow in dollars and we print dollars. We control the exchange rate; we control thethethe creation of dollars, the Federal Reserve.Theone of the major mistakes, things that was not grasped when they created the euro is that they created a problem that\'s analogous to what we saw in all the emerging markets in developing countries. Countries were borrowing in dollars and they didn\'t control the currency they were borrowing.What happened is Greece and all these several countries were borrowing in euros but the euros were controlled from Frankfurt. And that\'s an inherent problem once you go into that.And that\'s why a lot of people say you ought to create a euro bond or the ECB bought to borrow and then relend. So, that was a fundamental flaw in the structure ofofof the euro.The second point I would make isis it\'s already, you know, it\'s clear; the U.S. government can borrow at a negative real interest rate. You know I said one of the important points that Jacob pointed out waswas that there was a sudden stop in the ability to borrow. We\'re nowhere near that.When the United States can borrow at a negative real interest rate with all the debt we have, it\'s very clear we\'re nowhere near that kind of situation.KELTON: You agree? GALBRAITH: Yeah, I think thethisthis is a point of absolute non-controversiality. [laughter]KELTON: Funny, we keep hearing it around here. [laughter]GALBRAITH: It isit is possible to do a lot ofof, let\'s say, self-inflicted damage. And there are always quite a few people who are really happy to do that, funny .KELTON: Talk to us, if you would, about why it is so difficult to get thethethe so-called oligarchs in Greece. Why is it so difficult to get them to pay their taxes?KIRKEGAARD: Well, II guess theprobably the most notorious example of this isis in the shipping industry, which is constitutionally exempt from any kind of taxation, more or less.And part of the reason for that isisis in my opinion, it goes back to the military dictatorship in the \'60s, et cetera. But if you think about it in economic terms, part of the reason of it isis clearly that the Greek shipping owners have always been able to tell the Greek government, look, if you subject us to any kind of taxation, we\'re all going to move to Liberia.So, it\'s a very mobile factor, if you like. And that makes it quite difficult, not impossible, I would argue; I mean, there\'s actually, if you look at the major shipping nations of the world, they actually allmost of them are advanced economies. They have managed to do.Butbut why is it so difficult? I think the other reason is that many of them have great media interests and therefore they\'re politically difficult to attack, which is not sort of a Silvio Berlusconi type situation like we know from Italy. It can beit can be very difficult to address it there.But I would also say that in my opinion, this was one of the great hopes I actually had for the new government when it came in because it was not part of the two old established parties that have essentially sort of divvied up the Greek economy over the last 30 to 40 years. It actually had an opportunity to attack many of these but it didn\'t and I think this was obviously very unfortunate.GALBRAITH: Can I just add a...KELTON: Yeah.STIGLITZ: A couplea couple points then maybe . You know, the firstthe first point is absolutely right; very hard to tax the shipping industry for exact there\'s no industry that\'s more mobile. So, they could\'ve done it a little bit more, but I think the limits were very, very severe. But there is some problem with transfer pricing that they could\'vetheythey could\'ve addressed. These are where the shipping industries were actually getting profits in other industries and they could\'ve attacked those other industries and stopped the transfer pricing. So, the exemption actually had broaderbroader context.Thethe second point is theagain, a point thatthat was raised, the previous government, the Samaras government, was an oligarchy government. So, how could you expect them to support the taxation of the oligarchs? So, to me, that was not a surprise, that theyou know, in terms of previous.The thirdthe third point is that, you know, Papandreou, who was the one before that, actually did try to stop some of the links between media and the banks and thetheand actually made some success. But then some of that was reversed.And one of my disappointments was that the IMF or the troika never said anything as these efforts to tame thethethe oligarchs and to tame the collective lending as that waswas brought back in, theythey were totally silent. And they should\'ve been very loud, particularly with this media, because that is one of the mechanisms by which the oligarchy gets preserved.Thethe final point I want to emphasize is one of the reasons that tax collection more generally, not the oligarchs, but tax collection in general is difficult isis it\'s a country of small businesses. And before the United States went on to credit cards and electronic, it was very hard to tax small businesses.So, itit is a real challenge. And not that it can\'t be solved, but wewe ought to recognize thatthat in a cash economy, very difficult.Final point that it isshould\'ve been taxing more property, large property, but there\'s no property register. And one of the things that the IMF should have been working with them to create that kind of register.GALBRAITH: OK, thatthreethree quick points. First of all, the government is moving against tax evaders and against the oligarchs. This is a legal process; it doesn\'t happen all at once.But there are steps being taken and it is the case that this government is not in the pocket of the oligarchs. And it is in its political and economic interest to take steps which it is taking.A second point has to do with the enforcement problem in Europe when you\'re dealing with people who\'ve taken their money outside the country and have it squirreled away in Switzerland or some other tax haven, perhaps Luxembourg.The basic fact of the matter is that you can get cooperation from the tax authorities in such places if you are the United States of America. And if you are the Hellenic Republic, it\'s not so easy. There\'s a question of the willingnesspolitical willingness of these governments to cooperate with an external tax authority. And of course the Internal Revenue Service has, let\'s say, influence that smaller just don\'t have; that\'s a problem.STIGLITZ: Can I just...GALBRAITH: A thirdlet melet me...STIGLITZ: Yeah.GALBRAITH: Get to the third pointthird point. I\'ll yield back.The third point is that as a matter of policy, inat the end of June, the Greek government brought to Brussels, having yielded on the question of austerity per say, they sought to achieve the goals, theor tothe targets with something that they called redistributive austerity, which would havehave basically worked by raising some income tax rates and raising rates onon relatively large business profits.And the partners, the creditors said no, you can\'t do that. They blocked it on the grounds that it was anti-growth.So, you have an ideological predisposition that a tax on corporate profits is anti-growth whereas a cut in low income pensions is pro-growth and thator a rise in value-added taxes on the tourist industry is pro-growth.There is no evidence for this proposition. It\'s purely a question of ideology and compliance with the previous memorandum and perhaps also a political element of conservative forces seeking to basically thwart all progressive alternative policies.And that was anotheranother problem. That was whatperhaps whatthe reason why Prime Minister Tsipras felt impelled at that point toto call for the referendum, which is basically saying you can\'t do anything that we don\'t tell you exactly what and how to do it. The result of theof the process was that, in effect, the cost has been shifted to low income pensioners.And I just want to recount one thing I saw in the paper shortly after that happened, was that the assistant secretary for thein the ministry that was responsible for pensions resigned and his statement said, look, I just can\'t sign off on a pension of 87 euro a month to a handicapped person; 87 euro a month. That I think speaks to the values of the people who are in the government; it also speaks to the realities of what\'s being imposed on the ground in Greece.STIGLITZ: Ithejust a minor point on the second point thatthat Jamie made, which is one of the demands, one of the points in thein thein the negotiations is that the Greek government wanted to have a withholding tax on cross-border capital flows. Andwhich was to say that when money was going out of the country, you ought to tax it because once it\'s out of there, you\'ll never get it.And they saiddemanded that theythey eliminate the withholding tax on cross-border flow. So, their view was it\'s OK for foreigners tototo escape taxation, but not Greeks.KELTON: Let me ask if the audience has just one question. We started a couple of minutes late and II did say that we would try to take a question but justjust one.QUESTION: I have a question. It\'s not just sort of about Greece, but about the Eurozone. A lot of people say that countries like Ireland, Spain, they\'re doing incredibly well. But obviously in Spain, the unemployment rate is 25 percent; in Ireland it\'s 15 percent.Now, given what\'s going in the European situation, right now, things are going up in Ireland and Spain. But as soon as they go back down again, let\'s say you have a penalized recession in Europe, what happens to those countries in terms of their euro access, in terms of their debt to GDP, and also in terms ofof their debt talk ?KIRKEGAARD: Well, I mean, I can take a stab at that. I mean, it\'s very clear that a number of these European countries have come out of this crisis and, you know, like the United States, with much higher levels of public debt. And quite likely in the case of a number of them also, lower levels of potential growth, which means that they have a long term sustainability problem.Now, how much of that is relate to euro membership or not, I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that inin the case of Ireland, you wouldn\'t have had the housing bubble that you did if they hadn\'t been a member of the euro, and that\'s true in the case of Spain, as well.So, butbut going forward, are theisis it in my opinion aa detriment to these countries that they are in the euro or not? II don\'tcertainly don\'t believe it is, not least because the transition costs that Jamie talked about are going to be just as high for these countries as they would have been for Greece.So, in terms of the European architecture, and my opinion is that the basic element of thewhat this crisis has shown is that the original master design of the euro, the sort of standalone monetary union, has not worked.And what you have seen since the beginning of the crisis is that you have created this bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, and you have begun the integration of the banking system and so-called banking union, which are significant steps forward.But it\'s certainly not where the euro area needs to be 10, 15, 20 years from now where I believe you should move towards much more integrated political institutions and therefore with such political institutions, also have the ability to issue euro bonds and a European finance ministry, et cetera. QUESTION: So, you\'re saying you think that it\'ll get worse for these countries? You know to 15 and 25 percent unemployment would actually build higher?KIRKEGAARD: Oh, no, not at all. I mean, look, I mean, I thinkI think Ireland will grow 5 percent this year. I think Spain will achieve 3 to 3-and-a-half. We can then debate how, you know, whether that\'s going to continue.But no, I absolutely do not believe that it\'s going to get any worse in these countries; on the contrary, I think they will do quite well.GALBRAITH: I think thatwell, let\'sjust to take Ireland as an example, one commentator whose views I follow on this argues that the Irish economy has benefited from being on the cusp of a property boom bubble in the U.K.Should that come to an end, thethe cheery picture thatrelatively cheery picture that is presently being drawn in Ireland will also come to an end. And so, then we may well see some of the same questions that havewere raised in the Greek setting coming up in the Irish setting. And there\'s some of the political alternatives that have actually happened in Greece may also begin to happen in Ireland, as well.My own view is that given its current policy commitments, ideological commitments and policy commitments, and given the failure to reform and structure, the Eurozone is probably not going to endure indefinitely.The Greek effort was, I think, a really strong test of whether you could get reasonable variations. One way of putting it is thatwhat Greece needed wastheif Eurozone is a hospital, Greece needed to be in the intensive care unit where it would get oxygen, where it would get I.V. fluids, where it would get antibiotics, monitoring and so forth.And that I.C. unit doesn\'t exist in the Eurozone. Everybody gets the same treatment and when they don\'t recovery, they get lectured for notfor backsliding.This is not a successful model and it won\'t be tolerated indefinitely by the political forces in Europe.STIGLITZ: Yeah.GALBRAITH: Now, let\'s justone moreone more question on theone morejust quickly on the question of transition costs, it strikes me that wewe were very conscious of the transition costs. And the Greek government which, I mean, didn\'t really get their information from us was farfareven more conscious of the dangers and the risks of exiting.But one of the consequences of the discussion that\'s now already occurred is that those transition costs will be examined very carefully. And when it comes up the next time, it\'s quite possible that they will be much lower because the conditions under which this crisis may occur may be ones under which there is some agreement to do things cooperatively and to reduce the transition costs. And if that happens, then the whole I think framework for the future of the currency becomes much more flexible.And I guess my view is that\'s a good thing. And you probably ought to move to something that has a fixed but adjustable framework at some point. And it would be great to do that in a way which was constructive, cooperative and as easy as possible rather than one which is result of aof aof a really challenging confrontation.And I\'m veryyou know, again, I don\'t judgeI don\'t doubt the judgment of the Greek government in terms of the choices it made; was a very, very tough situation that they faced.STIGLITZ: Yeah, just let me add, I agree basically with what Jamie said and a lot with what Jacob said.Let me just make two points. One is you use the word very success isthat Ireland andand Spain. And I don\'t view aa country where the youth unemployment is 50 percent isis a marked success; it\'s a peculiar view.And it\'s sort of like, you know, again, to use another analogy, somebody jumps off of a 50-story building and they hit the ground and they\'re spattered andand everybody says, oh, he stopped falling. Well, yes, he did stop falling but he\'s not exactly healthy.And that\'s actually relevant in the following sense. Greece, Spain, all these other countries, people have been leaving; the young people have been leaving. So, their potential growth is going to be much lower.So, the damage, the technical term that economists use is hysteresis; what has happened in the last five years has done a great deal of damage and won\'t be repaired.And then you look at, you know, just going back to normal economics ofof 5 percent, 7 percent unemployment, we\'re talking with Spain, if things continue at the current rate, maybe 10 years, maybe 15 years, you know, Keynes saidyou know, people said, well, in the long run and Keynes respond is, yes, in the long run, we\'re all dead. And we\'re talking about a generation of suffering.So, to me, I don\'t view thatthat as a success unless Europe moves more rapidly and addresses some of the fundamental issues of real conversions like industrial policies reforming a central bank who\'s in the past focused just on inflation and not on unemployment, inequality, financial stability or all the other things that it ought to be.Unless they really go to the structure of the Eurozone, II think the likelihood of this union of currency\'s not likely to survive. And moremore important, I think the E.U. project is really important and I think to save the E.U., you have to let the eurothethe euro go. It\'s just a little piece of paper and I don\'t understand why people have such emotions about these little pieces of paper. [laughter]KELTON: OK, on that note, I\'m going to thank all of you. II would like to thank Senator Sanders, I know he\'s not with us, but for convening this group.Thank you to the Roosevelt Institute for sponsoring the event. Thank you to all of the panelists; really, really terrific. Thank you so much for coming out, and thank all of you, as well. [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"August 10, 2015","b'Remarks at National Nurses United Endorsement in Oakland, California'","b""Let me begin by thanking Rose Ann DeMoro, and the 185,000 members of National Nurses United, for providing high quality healthcare to the American people.I am honored to have the support of the largest nurse's union in this country!Year after year, I have been proud to work with National Nurses United fighting to expand Medicare, fighting to address the nursing shortage in this country, and fighting to make sure that nurses at the VA and all over this country have the right to collectively bargain for decent wages and benefits, among many other things.There is no job in this country that is more demanding, more important, and more fulfilling than being a nurse.You take care of our young children when they get sick. You take care of the elderly in their time of need. You take care of our veterans, many of whom have come home with no arms, no legs, and no eyesight.And, you give people hope that they will live to see a better day.Last year, when nurses became infected with Ebola after treating sick patients, I marched with you in Oakland to make sure that every nurse in America has the training, the equipment, and the protective gear that they need to stay healthy. And, we need to make sure that gets done.We have a nursing shortage in this country that we have got to address. We need to make it a national priority to work together to train more nurses, and that's exactly what I intend to do as your President. We all know that nurses prevent medical errors, reduce health care costs, and help patients recover more quickly. We need to be looking at health outcomes and nurses are the key to making patients healthier.During the debate over the Affordable Care Act, I was delighted to work with you to substantially increase funding for the National Health Service Corps to provide scholarships and loan repayments for nurses and other health care professionals who work in areas where there is a desperate need for quality healthcare. As you know, I have spent my career fighting for something that I consider to be a human right. That human right is health care. And let me say loudly and clearly  health care is a right of all people, not a privilege. The time has come for us to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. And together  with your help  we are going to end that embarrassment. All of you here today  nurses who see people at their sickest, at their most vulnerable  understand better than anyone the extent of the tragedy that exists in this country when people have no health insurance. Every single year thousands of our fellow Americans die because they don't get the preventive care they need when they should. They wait and wait until the problem can't be ignored any more and they show up in the emergency room  far sicker than they should have ever gotten. Sick with an illness that could have been prevented, could have been caught far sooner. And when the doctor or the nurse say well why didn't you come in when you were first sick, they say well, I didn't have any health insurance. I didn't have any money. Or maybe I did have insurance, but my deductible was so high I just couldn't afford to take the money out of pocket. That should not happen in the United States of America. When you're sick, you should be able to access health care. When you go to the hospital, you should not come out in bankruptcy.Nobody understands that reality more than the National Nurses United!That's why I have been proud to work with all of you to guarantee health care as a right of citizenship to every man, woman, and child in this country. The time has come for the United States to join every other major industrialized country and make sure that we have a health care system that works for all of our people. The time has come for a Medicare for All single payer health care program.We have got to move towards a healthcare system which is based on providing quality care to all of our people rather than worrying about the profits of the insurance companies. We have got to move toward a healthcare system which ends the absurdity of Americans paying, by far, the highest price for prescription drugs in the world. And, we have got to require Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies to lower the outrageously high prices of prescription drugs.And, do you know what we are also going to do? We are going to impose a financial transactions tax on Wall Street speculators in order to make sure that tuition is free in public colleges and universities throughout this country. One of the major reasons why the middle class is collapsing, 45 million Americans are living in poverty, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, is because of the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street.In my view, if we are going to rebuild the middle class, and allow Americans to get the education, the healthcare, and the jobs they need, we have got to make sure that Wall Street pays its fair share in taxes.Not only would a tax on Wall Street speculation provide us with the revenue that we need to make a college education tuition free, it would also reduce speculation and encourage Wall Street to invest in the job-creating productive economy.This is not a radical idea. It was done in this country from 1914-1966. Today, it's what 40 countries around the world are doing.And I am very proud to have worked with you on legislation to do just that!Wall Street has got to understand that it can't have it all. If we are going to have the best educated workforce in the world and a vibrant middle class, Wall Street has got to pay its fair share in taxes. And with your support, and the support of millions of other Americans we can build a political revolution in this country that can make this happen.It's time to say enough is enough! We are going to make healthcare a right of all of our people!We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially reduce student loan debt in America!We are going to make it easier, not harder, for nurses and millions of Americans to join unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits!We are going to rebuild the middle class in America!"""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"August 15, 2015",b'Remarks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines',"b'You know, three and a half months ago, we just began to campaign, and everybody said this campaign was a joke. Who believes that the American people are prepared to take on the economic and political establishment of America? And three and a half months have gone by, we have had huge crowds all over America. In Iowa, New Hampshire, California, Oregon, you name it. And when people ask me why, what I tell them is the American people are saying, ""Enough is enough."" This country belongs to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. And before I get going, I want to wish a happy birthday to some institution, it is called Social Security, 80 years old. And let me be very clear, virtually all of the Republican candidates, in one form or another, wants to cut Social Security. Together, we are not going to let them do that. When we have seniors in this country trying to get by at $12, $13,000 per year, disabled people unable to put enough food on the table, no, we are not going to cut Social Security, we are going to expand Social Security. And we are going to do that by lifting the cap on taxable income. [applause] In America today, what we are seeing is the disappearance of the great middle class. We are seeing millions of our brothers and sisters in Iowa, Vermont, all over this country, working longer hours for lower wages, people are working two, three jobs in order to put food on the table. Meanwhile, almost of the new income, all of the new wealth is going to the top one percent. That is going to change. We need an economy that works for working people, not a handful of billionaires. And let me tell you something about this campaign finance system that we have today. It is a corrupt system. Citizens United will go down in history as one of the worst decisions ever made by a Supreme Court. [applause] And let me repeat a promise that I have made to other crowds. And that is, no nominee of mine through the Supreme Court will get that position unless he or she pledges to make certain that Citizens United is overturned. And when we try to understand why it is that so many of our family members, our friends, our neighbors, are working in two or three jobs in order to cobble together an income and some health care, the answer is that wages in our country, for many people, are much, too low. And that is why we have got to recognize that a $7.25 minimum wage is a starvation wage, we have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. [applause] What we understand also, is that when we live in a competitive global economy, we need the best educated workforce possible. [applause] It makes no sense to me that we have hundreds of thousands of bright, qualified young people who want to get a higher education, are unable to do so because their family lacks the income. That\'s wrong. And that is why I have introduced legislation, and will fight for as president of the United States, to make sure that every public college and university in America is tuition free. [applause] And we have also got to deal with the disgrace of outrageously high student debt. There are millions of Americans, young, and not so young, who are paying 7, 8, 10 percent on their student debt, 20, 25 percent of their limited income. If you can refinance your home at two or three percent today, you should not be paying eight or ten percent on student debt. [applause] And the government should also not be profiteering on student debt held by working-class families. [applause] And when we talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, we have also got to talk about pay equity for women workers. [applause] Women cannot continue to earn $.78 on the dollar compared to men workers. Many of my Republican colleagues talk about family values. Their values are that a woman should not have the right to control her own body, I disagree. [applause] Their values are that our gay brothers and sisters should not be able to get married, or enjoy all the benefits of American citizenship, I disagree. But my family values -- I have been married 27 years, got four kids, seven grandchildren. My family values are that the United States has to earn -- end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth that doesn\'t guarantee pay, family, and medical leave. When a woman has a baby in this country, regardless of her income, she should be able to spend three months with that baby, getting to know that baby, love that baby. That\'s a family value. And when we talk about American values, when we talk about where we want to go as a country, I want to end the absurdity of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right. [applause] And that is why I strongly support a Medicare for all single payer programs. And when we talk about our responsibilities as adults, as parents, as citizens of this Earth, we have a moral responsibility to make certain that we leave this planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and our grandchildren. The debate is over. Climate change is a real, climate change is caused by human activity, climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. What the United States must do -- and I will do as president, is lead the world, working with other countries to transform our energy system. Well, there is Donald Trump, what can we do? I apologize, we left the helicopter at home. It\'s in the garage, forgot to bring it. But our job is to make sure that we join the rest of the world, major countries around the world, in guaranteeing health care to every man, woman, and child as a right of citizenship. It makes no sense to me that, despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act, we continue to have 35 million people uninsured, and many of you are underinsured, right? High deductibles, high co-payments, and yet, after all of that, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. That is wrong, that has got to change. Let me close on one issue that I know a lot of people are thinking about. The truth is, that in America we have made real progress in terms of fighting racism over the years. And I want to thank the people of Iowa for their courage in voting for Obama in 2008. [applause] And what you showed is that a state which is mostly white could go beyond the color of a candidate\'s skin and vote for somebody based on their character and their ideas. Thank you, Iowa. [applause] But anyone who reads the papers, anyone who looks at TV, understands that we still have a long way to go. Anyone who as seen the tapes of Sandra Bland or Samuel Dubose understand that it is unacceptable that African-Americans can get taken out of their cars, thrown to the ground, assaulted, and thrown into jail and die three days later. That is not what this country is supposed to be about. So you are looking at a candidate who, if elected president, will do everything that he can to end the stain of racism and institutional racism in this country, and bring about major criminal justice reforms. [applause] I was a mayor for eight years, and I\'ve worked with our police department, and the truth is, most cops have are good, very difficult job, they do the right thing. It\'s a very hard job. But when a police officer, or any other public official, breaks the law, that officer must be held accountable. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, including China. We have a disproportionate number of people in jail who are black or Hispanic. So we have got a lot of work to do in criminal justice. Number one, I will end this absurdity of having private corporations making billions out of jails. [applause] We are going to end this minimum sentencing by which too many people have criminal records. And when people go to jail, I want to make sure that there is a pathway for them out of jail. If people leave jail without money, without jobs, without education, without housing, without mental health issues being dealt with, the likelihood is they\'re going to end up back in jail, and that is pretty crazy. So what I want to see, is I want to see us invest heavily in jobs and education, not jail and incarceration. [applause] Now, let me just conclude by telling you one thing that no other candidate will tell you, and that is I need your help, obviously, to win here in Iowa, and I appreciate the support of so many people. But if we are going to transform America, if we are going to have a government that represents working families and not large campaign donors, we need a political revolution in this country. [applause] We need millions of people to stand up and make it clear to the billionaire class they cannot have it all. They are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. They are not going to continue to ship out jobs to China and elsewhere. But to make all of that happen, we need a strong grassroots political movement from Vermont to California, and significantly here in Iowa. So I welcome and urge all of you to join me in helping to make a political revolution, which transforms America, which creates a government that works for all of us, and not just a handful. Thank you all very much. [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"August 18, 2015",b'Remarks at the Nevada State AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention in Las Vegas',"b'Brothers and sisters, thank you for inviting me to be with you today, and I want to thank all of the 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO for working hard each and every day to improve the lives of all of the American people.During my 24 years in Congress, I have been proud to stand side by side with the AFL-CIO fighting to increase the minimum wage; fighting to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right of citizenship; fighting to make it easier for workers to join unions; fighting to create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; fighting for pay equity for women workers; fighting for paid family and medical leave; fighting to expand, not cut Social Security; and fighting against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China that have destroyed millions of decent-paying jobs in America.Since the formation of our nation over 230 years ago, the trade union movement has always led the fight to improve the quality of life for all Americans, and that is what the AFL-CIO is all about.When only the wealthy were allowed to vote, the trade union movement was successful in demanding universal suffrage and a more democratic society. When tiny children were forced to work in the factories and fields, it was the trade union movement who put an end to abusive child labor and who fought for quality public education. When bosses refused to negotiate with their workers and fired them for standing up for their rights, the trade union movement pushed Congress into passing legislation which guaranteed all people the right to organize unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits.The list goes on. Social Security, the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, affordable housing  are just a few of the benefits that workers have won over the years thanks in large part to the trade union movement.None of those historic accomplishments would have been achieved without the work of the trade union movement. But today, all of those accomplishments are under attack by some of the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country.Brothers and sisters, the fact of the matter is that there is a war going on in this country today. And, I\'m not talking about the misguided and unnecessary war we waged in Iraq.I\'m not talking about the war so many of my Republican colleagues seem hell bent to wage with Iran.I\'m talking about the 40-year war against the American middle class, the American standard of living, and the American dream of owning a home, sending kids to college, and having a secure retirement.What business leaders are telling us today is that if workers don\'t accept massive cuts in salary with no benefits, they\'ll move to China. They\'ll move to Mexico. And, the American worker can join the increasing ranks of the poor. In other words, what they are saying is to hell with the American middle class; to hell with the American dream. CEOs are rewarding themselves with outrageous compensation packages while they are squeezing everything they can out of the American worker. That is the war that is being waged against the middle class and that is what we have got to fight against!Brothers and sisters, you understand why the American people are angry because you have witnessed the decline of the middle class with your own eyes. You have seen companies receiving tax breaks for shutting down factories in this country and moving overseas. You have seen CEOs earn 300 times what their average workers make. You have seen workers fired for standing up for their rights to collectively bargain. You have seen the transformation of our country away from a General Motors economy of good wages and good benefits to a Walmart economy of starvation wages and no benefits. And, you are saying very loudly and very clearly that enough is enough!There is something profoundly wrong when the United States of America has more wealth and income inequality since 1928. There is something profoundly wrong when almost all of the new income gains generated since the Wall Street crash is flowing to the top one percent.There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.You understand better than anyone else that the real unemployment is not 5.3%. If you include people who have given up looking for work and people who are working part-time when they want to work full-time the real unemployment rate is 10.4 percent. And, here is something that is almost never discussed in the mainstream media. Youth unemployment is off the charts. Today, the average real unemployment rate of young high school graduates is 33.8 percent for white Americans, 36.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, and 51.3 percent for African-Americans.It is a national disgrace that real median family income has gone down by nearly $5,000 since 1999 and is lower today than it was 26 years ago. It is unacceptable that the typical male worker made $783 less last year than he did 42 years ago. It is unacceptable that the typical female worker made $1,337 less last year than she did in 2007. It is an international embarrassment that nearly 20 percent of kids in America are living in poverty and we have the highest childhood poverty rate of any major developed country on earth. Today, over half of American workers have less than $10,000 in savings and have no idea how they will be able to retire with any shred of dignity.Meanwhile, while the middle class is disappearing and 45 million Americans are living in poverty, the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good.Over the last two years, the wealthiest 15 people in this country  including Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, the owners of Walmart, the Koch brothers, and Sheldon Adelson  have seen an increase in their wealth of $170 billion. Today, one family, the Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans!That is the economic reality of today, and that is what we are fighting against.Brothers and sisters, fighting for the rights of working people is not just another issue for me. It\'s what I am all about.In my view, the trade union movement is the last line of defense against the billionaire class and the moneyed interests who are out to destroy virtually every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years to protect the working people of this country.Let\'s be clear about what we are up against.Today, as a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, is prepared to spend some $900 million this election cycle  more than either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party is likely to spend.Why? What do the Koch brothers want? Let me tell you.The Koch brothers and their billionaire allies don\'t just want to cut Social Security, they want to eliminate Social Security; they don\'t want to just cut Medicare, they want to eliminate Medicare; they don\'t just want to cut healthcare at the VA, they want to eliminate the Veterans Administration; they don\'t want to just cut the Postal Service, they want to eliminate it; they\'re not only opposed to increasing the minimum wage, they don\'t believe in the concept of the minimum wage; they don\'t want to just cut the estate tax, they want to abolish it.In other words, the Koch brothers and the billionaire class want it all. They want to give Americans the ""freedom"" to live in poverty working for $3 or $4 an hour without healthcare, without childcare, without a pension, without the ability to send their kids to college, and without any hope that their children will have a higher standard of living than they do.And they understand that the major obstacle standing in the way of their extreme, right wing agenda is the trade union movement.That\'s why they have fought so hard to eliminate unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and all over this country by ending collective bargaining rights.And, that\'s why I believe that we need to create a political revolution in this country of millions of workers, veterans, the elderly, the disabled, people of color standing together and telling the billionaire class that enough is enough! Your greed is destroying this country. You cannot have it all! You cannot continue to get tax breaks while children in this country are going hungry. This country belongs to all of us, not just to a handful of millionaires and billionaires.In my view, the American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians and the establishment media telling them that they need to be realistic; that they have got to lower their expectations; that we cannot afford to expand Social Security; that we cannot raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; that we cannot pass a major jobs program to put millions of Americans to work; that we cannot guarantee healthcare to all Americans; that it is just too impossible to end institutional racism in this country; and that the only option in the general election must be between two candidates who will support a continuation of disastrous trade policies that are destroying the middle class in this country.In my view, we have got to send a very loud and a very clear message to the establishment: You are wrong, you are dead wrong!On every one of these issues, the American people are on our side. Maybe, just maybe, it\'s time that the American people truly had a candidate who will stand up for their interests, not just for CEOs and billionaires on Wall Street. And, that\'s why I am running for president of the United States of America.Brothers and Sisters, in my view, every candidate running for president has got to answer the following questions:Why is it that, despite all of the incredible gains we have made in productivity and all of the advancements that we have been made in technology, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages while a handful of billionaires do unbelievably well? Why does it happen that most of the new jobs being created today in America are part-time, low wage jobs?How did it happen that since 2001, over 60,000 factories have shut down in America and millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs have disappeared? How does it happen that new manufacturing jobs created in this country pay in some cases half of what manufacturing jobs used to pay? Why are we in a race to the bottom with low wage countries like China, Mexico, and India?In my view, there are two fundamental reasons for this. The first has to do with our disastrous unfettered free trade policy  which literally tells corporate America  throw American workers out on the street, move to China, move to Mexico, move to Vietnam where you can pay workers pennies an hour; where you don\'t have to worry about the environment; where you don\'t need to worry about the health and safety of workers; where you don\'t need to have one iota of respect for human rights.During my tenure in Congress I am proud to tell you that I have voted against and helped lead the opposition to every major free trade agreement that has been passed in recent years. And, let me be clear in telling you that I will continue to lead the opposition against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade agreement in the history of our country.Brothers and sisters, the reality is that NAFTA has failed, CAFTA has failed, our membership in the World Trade Organization has failed, and perhaps, above all, Permanent Normal Trade relations with China has failed.In my view, the time is now, and it is long overdue, for the United States Congress to stand up to corporate America, to stand up to the President of the United States, to stand up to the editorial writers all over this country who year after year after year have told us how wonderful unfettered free trade is, how many new jobs would be created.The results are in. They are wrong. Unfettered free trade has been a disaster for working Americans. It has been a disaster for the middle class. And, it is high time we understood that. It is high time we ended our disastrous trade policies and began to negotiate trade policies that work not just for corporate America, not just for CEOs who make huge compensation packages, but trade policies that are fair for the working people of this country. And, that\'s exactly what I intend to do as president. The second fundamental reason for the decline in the middle class is that the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined.Today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that employee has a one in five chance of getting fired.Today, half of all employers threaten to close or re-locate their business if workers elect to form a union.Today, when workers become interested in forming a union, 92 percent of private-sector employers force employees to attend closed-door meetings to hear anti-union propaganda; 80 percent require supervisors to attend training sessions on how to attack unions; 78 percent require that supervisors deliver anti-union messages to workers they oversee; and 75% hire outside consultants to run anti-union campaigns.According to Human Rights Watch: ""Freedom of association is a right under severe, often buckling pressure when workers in the United States try to exercise it.""That is unacceptable!And, even when workers are faced with all of these enormous obstacles  even when these workers win union elections, more than one-third of the victories do not result in a first contract for workers.Today, corporate executives are routinely negotiating obscenely high compensation packages for themselves, but they continue to deny their own employees the ability to bargain for a better life. That is wrong.It is time to turn this around.It is time to make the Employee Free Choice Act the law of the land!If a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards stating that they want a union as their bargaining representative, they must have the right to a union. Period!One of the very first bills that I introduced when I was elected to Congress in 1991 was a card check bill.And, I will tell you that if I am elected President, making it easier for workers to form a union will be one of the very first things that I do in the White House.Today, tens of millions of workers would join a union right now if they had the chance. Yet, only 11 percent of the workforce has a union. That is unacceptable and that has got to change! Brothers and Sisters, if we are serious about strengthening America\'s middle class, we have got to restore workers\' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and safer working conditions.Why do we need to do that?Because we know that union workers earn 30 percent more money, on average, than non-union workers. If you want to make more money to support your family, you need a union!We know that 79 percent of union workers have a defined benefit pension plan that guarantees income in retirement, while only 16 percent of non-union workers do. If you want to have a secure retirement, you need a union!We know that 83 percent of union workers have paid sick leave, while only 62 percent of non-union workers do. If you want to make sure that you can take time off from work when you or your child is sick, you need a union! And, if I am elected as the next president, that\'s exactly what I will fight to do.And, that\'s not all.We have got to acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage  which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years. The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple and concrete  that no full-time worker should live in poverty. And a living wage should not only be fair, it should be equitable. That is why we must establish pay equity for women workers by law. It\'s unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men.Further, the United States must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth, the only one, which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave, paid sick time and paid vacation time. Last place is no place for America. That is why I will fight for 12 weeks of paid family leave, at least 10 days of paid vacation time and seven days of paid sick time. My Republican colleagues talk a lot about ""family values."" Well, let me be very clear. It is not a family value to force the mother of a newborn baby to go back to work a few days after she gives birth, because she doesn\'t have the money to stay home and bond with her baby. That is not a family value. That is an insult to everything that I know about what family is about.Today, as a result of the collapse of our middle class and declining wages, the American people are working longer hours than the people of any other country  54 hours a year more than Japanese workers, 119 more hours per year than British workers, 299 hours more than French workers, and 425 hours more than German workers. Over 100 ago, workers in this country marched in protest for a 40 hour work week. Well, one hundred years later we still have not achieved that. Incredibly, today, 85% of working men and 66% of working women work more than 40 hours a week. And do you know what? Many workers in this country get no or very little paid vacation time. That has got to end.Jobs, Jobs, Jobs If we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need a major federal jobs program that puts millions of Americans back to work at decent paying jobs. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That\'s why I\'ve introduced legislation that would invest $1 trillion over 5 years to modernize our country\'s physical infrastructure. This legislation would create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs, while making our country more productive, efficient and safe. And I commit to you that as President, I will lead that legislation into law. Reforming Wall StreetIt is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments while expecting the public to bail it out. We need a banking system that is part of creating a productive economy, not a handful of huge banks on Wall Street that engage in reckless and illegal activities. If a bank is too big to fail it is too big to exist.Citizens United and Campaign Finance Reform Let me be as blunt as I can while telling you what you already know. As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do. If we are serious about creating jobs, about climate change and the needs of our children, our veterans and the elderly, we must be deadly serious about campaign finance reform. That is why I will not nominate any justice to the Supreme Court who has not made it clear that he or she will move to overturn that disastrous decision which is undermining our democracy. Long term, we need to go further and establish public funding of elections, so that the dark money of American politics is stopped before democracy is bought and paid for by a handful of billionaires and corporations. American democracy is not about corporations and billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections. It is not about Wall Street and big oil or the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poorer.This is not democracy. This is oligarchy. The defining principle of American democracy is one person, one vote  with every citizen having an equal say  and no voter suppression. And that\'s the kind of American political system we have to fight for.College For AllAnd when we talk about education, let me be very clear. In a highly competitive global economy, we need the best-educated workforce we can create. It is insane and counter-productive to the best interests of our country and its future, that hundreds of thousands of bright young people can not afford to go to college, and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. That shortsighted path to the future must end. As President, I will fight to make tuition in public colleges and universities free, as well as substantially lower interest rates on student loans. Every person, young and old in America should be given the tools to realize their full god given potential.Health Care for All The United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all as a right. Despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act, 35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance and many more are under-insured. Yet, we continue paying far more per capita for health care than any other nation. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right by moving toward a Medicare-for-All single-payer system.Protecting Our Most VulnerableAt a time when millions of Americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically, at a time when senior poverty is increasing, at a time when millions of kids are living in dire poverty my Republican colleagues are trying to make a terrible situation even worse. If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low income Americans, including pregnant women off nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids into Head Start. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very, very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families.Well, let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security, we need to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting head start and childcare, we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us: ""The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little."" And that is a test that we as a nation must once again meet and master.Racial Justice and Economic OpportunityThe struggle for equality continues today in America, and the front line of that struggle is the inner cities throughout our nation. From Ferguson to Baltimore and across the nation, too many African Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals.If current trends continue, 1 in 4 black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. But this crisis of over incarceration is not just a destruction of human life. It is also costly to the taxpayers who pay almost $70 Billion a year for prisons. It makes a lot more sense to me to be investing in jobs and education rather than in jails and incarceration. This issue is a crisis in American society. It is an international disgrace. That is why I have introduced legislation to spend $5.5 billion dollars to fund job-training programs for inner city youth. As a former Mayor I understand the importance of police community relations, and the need today across America to improve the climate and dialogue in those relations. Instead of building more and more prisons, we need to be building more and more meaningful lives where young people can have a future, not be stuck in a dead end with no hope or opportunity.Immigration ReformToday millions of decent, hardworking people live in America with no hope of gaining the status to live and work here legally. Many were brought here in their youth, and other came to find a life free of fear, oppression, war or deprivation. We need a rational immigration process, not the Republican alternatives of self- deportation or some other draconian non-solution. I believe in a path to citizenship, and I agree with President Obama\'s plans to do through executive action what the Congress reuses to do through legislation. We need to solve problems like immigration in American, not use these issues to promote division and hostility.Closing:Brothers and sisters, I believe we can restore the promise of America to every person who wants to work hard to build a future for themselves and their family.We can live in a country:Where every citizen has health care as a right, not a privilege;Where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college;Where every senior can live in dignity and security, and not be forced to choose between their medicine and their food;Where every veteran who defends this nation gets the quality health care and benefits they have earned and receives the respect they deserve;Where the inner cities of our nation become safer, and where people who want to succeed are treated fairly and given a helping hand;Where every person who dreams of becoming a citizen has a rationale path forward, not just a dark corner to hide in;Where everyone, no matter their race, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans.That is the nation we can build together, and I look forward to working with all of you to build a future that works for all of us, and not just the few on top.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"August 28, 2015","b'Remarks at the Democratic National Committee Summer Meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota'","b'Thank you for inviting me to be with you today, and thank you for the hard work that all of you do every day in trying to make our country a better place in which to live and raise a family.I understand that there are Republicans who proclaim how much they love America, but how much they hate the people who work in our government or who participate in the political process. I disagree. In my view, participating in the political process and strengthening democracy  as you do  is one of the most patriotic things we can do as American citizens, and I thank you all for your efforts.I only have a few minutes, so let me jump to the points I want to make:When I announced my candidacy less than four months ago, I think that it\'s fair to say that few took our campaign seriously. But a lot has changed in these last few months. All across the country we have drawn some the largest crowds of this campaign, including many young people who have not previously been involved in the political process.Hundreds of thousands of people have signed on with our campaign as volunteers and are already hitting the streets and phones.We have, I believe, received more individual campaign contributions than any other presidential campaign, some 400,000. And in this day of super-PACs and huge campaign contributions I am proud to tell you that our average contribution is $31.20.Most importantly, few would deny that the issues I am running on are generating a great deal of energy and enthusiasm in our grassroots campaign, a campaign that is calling for a political revolution.The Republicans did not win the mid-term election in November. The Democrats lost that election because voter turnout was abysmally low, and millions of working people, minorities and young people gave up on ""politics as usual"" and stayed home.Let me be very clear. In my view, Democrats will not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate, will not gain the House and will not be successful in dozens of governor\'s races unless we run a campaign which generates excitement and momentum and which produces a huge voter turnout.With all due respect, and I do not mean to insult anyone here, that will not happen with politics as usual. The same old, same old will not be successful. The people of our country understand that  given the collapse of the American middle class and the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality we are experiencing  we do not need more establishment politics or establishment economics. We need a political movement which is prepared to take on the billionaire class and create a government which represents all Americans, and not just corporate America and wealthy campaign donors.In other words, we need a movement which takes on the economic and political establishment, not one which is part of it.We need a movement which tells corporate America and the wealthy that you will start paying your fair share of taxes.We need a movement which tells Wall Street that when a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. That we will reinstate Glass-Steagall and break up those huge banks which have a stranglehold over our economy. That we will create a financial system which provides affordable loans to small and medium size businesses, not maintain a financial system which is an island unto itself  designed to make huge profits for the few.We need a movement which will work with the trade union movement to end our disastrous trade policies, and that includes defeating the disastrous TPP.We need a movement which says that every worker in America deserves a living wage, and that we will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years; that we will provide pay equity to women workers and that we will end the international disgrace of being the only major country on earth that does not provide at least 12 weeks of family and medical leave, not to mention paid sick time and vacation time.We need a movement which says that, when real unemployment is over 10 percent and youth unemployment is off the charts, we need to create millions of decent paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.We need a movement which tells the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they will not be able to continue buying candidates and elections and that we will overturn this disastrous Citizen\'s United Supreme Court decision and move toward public funding of elections. We need a movement which understands that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and that we need to lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And that includes defeating the Keystone pipe line.We need a movement that says, in a highly competitive global economy, that all of our people who have the ability, the qualifications and the desire, will be able to get a college education regardless of the income of their families because we will make public colleges and universities tuition free  and we\'re going to pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.We need a movement which, once and for all, will end institutional racism in our country and reform a very, very broken criminal justice system. We must not continue being the country in the world with more people in jail than any other  disproportionately people of color. We must become the country in the world which invests in jobs and education, not in jails and incarceration.And when we talk about bringing our country together, we cannot forget that there are 11 million people here who are undocumented. We must provide legal protections for them, we must pass comprehensive immigration reform and we must provide a path towards citizenship. And we must be clear that the racist and un-American idea that we are going to round up millions of people in the dead of night is unacceptable in this great country of ours.You are looking at a former congressman who did not believe George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld and who voted against the war in Iraq, one of the worst foreign policy blunders in modern American history. And you are looking at a senator who will stand with President Obama in preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, but will do it in a way that prevents another war.Let me conclude by saying this: We will win in 2016, not just the White House, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, but Statehouses all across the country because we are going to create an unprecedented grassroots movement which taps into the American people\'s desire for real change in this country.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"September 14, 2015","b'Remarks at the Liberty University Convocation in Lynchburg, Virginia'","b'Thank you very much for inviting me to be with you today.You know, and I know, that the views that many of you here at Liberty University hold are very different than mine  whether those issues relate to women\'s rights, gay rights and other issues. That\'s no secret.I came here today because I believe that it is important for those with different views in our country to engage in civil discourse  not just to shout at each other or make fun of each other. It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us  and I do that every day. It is harder, but not less important, to try and communicate with those who do not agree with us and see where, if possible, we can find common ground. In other words, to reach out of our zone of comfort.Liberty University is a religious school. It is a school which tries to understand the meaning of morality and the words of the Bible, within the context of a very complicated modern world. It is a school which tries to teach its students how to behave with decency and honesty and how to best relate to their fellow human beings. I applaud those goals. So let me take a few moments to tell you what motivates me in the work that I do as a public servant and as an elected official. I am far, far from perfect human being but I am motivated by a vision which exists in all of the great religions Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and others  and which is so beautifully and clearly stated in Matthew 7:12. ""So in everything, do to others what you would have them to do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets."" The Golden Rule. Do to others what you would have them do to you. Not very complicated.Let me be very frank. I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to you, and that we disagree on those issues. I get that. But let me respectfully suggest that there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and the world and that maybe, just maybe, we don\'t disagree on them. And maybe, just maybe, we can work together in trying to resolve them.Amos 5:24; ""But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!""Justice. Treating others the way we would like to be treated. Treating all people with dignity and respect.It would, I think, be hard for anyone in this room to make the case that the United States today is a ""just"" society or anything resembling a just society.In America today there is massive injustice in terms of income and wealth inequality. Injustice is rampant. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world but most Americans don\'t know that because almost all of that wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent. We are living at a time where a handful of people have wealth beyond comprehension  huge yachts, jet planes, tens of billions of dollars, more money that they could spend in a thousand life-times, while, at the same time, millions of people are struggling to feed their families or put a roof over their heads or find the money to go to a doctor.When we talk about morality and when we talk about justice we have to understand that there is no justice when the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. There is no justice when all over this country people are working long hours for abysmally low wages, $7.25 an hour, $8 an hour, while 58 percent of all new income being created today goes to the top 1 percent.There is no justice when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while, at the same time, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. How can we talk about morality when we turn our backs on the children of this country? Twenty percent of the children in this country live in poverty and that includes 40 percent of African-American children. There is no justice when, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, children in our country go to bed hungry.There is no justice when the 15 wealthiest people in this country in the last two years saw their wealth increase by $170 billion dollars. That is more wealth, acquired in a two-year period, than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. And while the very rich become much richer, millions of families have no savings at all and struggle every week just to stay alive economically, and the elderly and disabled wonder how they stay warm in the winter. That is not justice. That is a rigged economy designed by the wealthiest people in this country to benefit the wealthiest people in this country at the expense of everyone else.There is no justice when thousands of people in America die each year because they don\'t have health insurance and don\'t get to a doctor when they should, or when elderly people are forced to choose between food or medicine because our citizens pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is not justice. That is not morality. That is simply an indication that we are the only major country on earth which does not guarantee health care for all as a right.There is no justice when low-income and working-class mothers are forced to separate from their babies one or two weeks after birth and go back to work because we are the only major country on earth which does not have a paid family and medical leave policy. That is not justice. That is an attack on family values that everyone in this room should be appalled at.There is no justice in our country when youth unemployment exists at tragic levels  with 51 percent of African American high school kids unemployed or underemployed. No. We apparently do not have the funds to provide jobs or educational opportunities for our young people but we sure do have the money to throw them into jails. Today, the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth, and many are serving time in inhumane conditions. That is not justice. That is the destruction of human life.I am not a theologian or an expert on the Bible or a Catholic. I am just a U.S. senator from the small state of Vermont. But I agree with Pope Francis when he says; ""The current financial crisis originated in a profound human crisis: the denial of the primacy of the human person! We have created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose.""He also states; ""There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone. Money has to serve, not to rule.""In his view, and I agree with him, we are living in a nation and in a world which worships the acquisition of money and great wealth, but which turns its back on those in need. And that must end. We need to move toward an economy which works for all, and not just the few.Throughout human history there has been endless discussion and debate about the meaning of justice and the meaning of morality. And I know that here at Liberty University that discussion and debate will continue. I would hope very much that as part of that discussion and part of that learning process some of you will conclude that if we strive toward morality and toward justice, it is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor and working people of our country.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"September 19, 2015",b'Remarks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention in Manchester',"b'New Hampshire plays a unique role in the American political process, and I want to thank all of you for inviting me to be with you today. Your hard work not only makes New Hampshire a better place in which to live and work, but impacts all of America.When I announced my candidacy 4 1/2 months ago, I think that it\'s fair to say that few people took our campaign seriously. But a lot has changed in these last few months.All across the country we have drawn some of the largest turnouts of this campaign, and what I am particularly excited about is that many of those getting involved are young people who have not previously been involved in the political process.Hundreds of thousands of people have signed on with our campaign as volunteers and, as we speak, our volunteers are knocking on doors across the country, are on the phone and are actively engaged in social media for the campaign.We have, I believe, received more individual campaign contributions than any other presidential campaign, well over 400,000. And in this day of super-PACs and huge campaign contributions I am proud to tell you that our average contribution is somewhere around $31.20. I do not represent the corporate agenda or the billionaire class  and I do not want their money and I do not and will not have a Super-PAC. This is a people\'s campaign and we will win or lose based on the support we get from working people and the middle class.I come from a family which did not have a lot of money. My dad came here from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket and we grew up without money in a 3 1/2 room rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, NY. Some of you may recall an old union song which asks: ""Which side are you on?"" Well, I know which side I am on. I am a proud progressive, prepared to stand with the working families of this country; prepared to take on powerful special interests which wield enormous power over the economic and political life of this country. That is what I did yesterday, that is what I do today and that is what I will do if elected president of the United States.Now, let me suggest something that some of you will agree with and some of you may not. In my view, the Republicans did not win the mid-term election last November. We lost that election because voter-turnout was abysmally low, and millions of working people, minorities and young people gave up on ""politics as usual"" and stayed home. Let me be very clear. In my view, Democrats will not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate, will not gain the House and will not be successful in dozens of governor\'s races unless we run a campaign which generates excitement and momentum and which produces a large voter turnout. Democrats win when the turnout is high. Republicans win when the turnout is low.And how do we do that? How do we generate the excitement on the ground, how do we get those who are disillusioned back into the political process, how do we get young people involved, how do we get working class Republicans to stop voting against heir own best interests? With all due respect, that will not happen with politics as usual. The same old, same old will likely not be successful. The people of our country understand that we are much better off economically today than we were 7 years ago when President Bush left office and we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month and the world\'s financial system was on the verge of collapse.But they also understand that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been disappearing and all over NH and VT and across the country millions of people are working 2 or 3 jobs to cobble together enough income and health care to sustain their families and we have more people living in poverty than almost any time in our history.And they understand that while the very, very rich get richer, that while there has been a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top one-tenth of of one percent, and while we have more income and wealth inequality now than at any time since 1928, we do not need more establishment politics or establishment economics. The American people are catching on that we need a political movement which is prepared to take on the billionaire class and create a government which represents all Americans, and not just the people on top and wealthy campaign donors.In other words, we need a movement which takes on the economic and political establishment, not one which is part of it.We need a movement which tells corporate America and the wealthy that they will start paying their fair share of taxes. No. Multi- national corporations are not going to continue stashing their billions in profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens and, in a given year, pay not a nickel in federal taxes  while children in this America go hungry. No. The CEOs of large corporations are not going to continue getting huge compensation packages and incredible pensions, while they cuts the wages, health care and pensions of their workers. No. We\'re not going to continue disastrous trade policies which have cost us millions of decent paying jobs as companies shut down here and move to China and other low wage countries.Corporate greed is destroying this country and, whether they like it or not, that. Greed and destructiveness is going to end.We need a movement which tells Wall Street that when a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. That we will reinstate Glass-Steagall and break up those huge banks which have a stranglehold over our economy. That we will create a financial system which provides affordable loans to small and medium size businesses, not maintain a financial system which is an island unto itself  designed to make huge profits for the few.We need a movement which will work with the trade union movement to end our disastrous trade policies, and that includes defeating the disastrous TPP.We need a movement which says that every worker in America deserves a living wage, and that we will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years; that we will provide pay equity to women workers and that we will end the international disgrace of being the only major country on earth that does not provide at least 12 weeks of family and medical leave, not to mention paid sick time and vacation time.We need a movement which says that, when real unemployment is over 10 percent and youth unemployment is off the charts, we need to create millions of decent paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.We need a movement which tells the Koch Brothers and the billionaire class that they will not be able to continue buying candidates and elections and that we will overturn this disastrous Citizen\'s United Supreme Court decision and move toward public funding of elections. And we will not allow Republican governors and legislatures to get away with Voter suppressionWe need a movement which understands that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and that we need to lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And that includes defeating the Keystone pipe line line.We need a movement that says, in a highly competitive global economy, that all of our people who have the ability, the qualifications and the desire, will be able to get a college education regardless of the income of their families because we will make public colleges and universities tuition free  and we\'re going to pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.We need a movement which, once and for all, will end institutional racism in our country and reform a very, very broken criminal justice system. We must not continue being the country in the world with more people in jail than any other  disproportionately people of color. We must become the country in the world which invests in jobs and education, not in jails and incarceration. And when we talk about bringing our country together, we cannot forget that there are 11 million people here who are undocumented. We must provide legal protections for them, we must pass comprehensive immigration reform and we must provide a path towards citizenship. And we must be clear that the racist and unAmerican idea that we are going to round up millions of people in the dead of night is unacceptable in this great country of ours. You are looking at a former Congressman who did not believe George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld and who voted against the war in Iraq, one of the worst foreign policy blunders in modern American history. And you are looking at a senator who will stand with President Obama in preventing Iran from getting a nuclear, but will do it in a way that prevents another war.Let me conclude by saying this: We will win in 2016, not just the White House, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, but state houses all across the country because we are going to create an unprecedented grass-roots movement which taps into the American people\'s desire for real change in this country.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"September 24, 2015",b'Interview with Dana Bash of CNN',"b""BASH: And, Senator, thank you very much. I actually was able to see you from my perch in the visitor's gallery, the press gallery, during this speech. You, just like really pretty much all of your colleagues, were watching so intently. What did you think? SANDERS: I thought he did a wonderful job. And I think he is just an extraordinarily unusual person. A leader not just of the Catholic Church, but one of the great moral and religious leaders of our time and in modern history. And I think he came here today and touched on some very, very important issues that a lot of people would prefer not to talk about, and that is the issue of poverty, the issue of environmental degradation, immigration, the death penalty, the need to do everything we can to create a peaceful world. And I think he did it in a very dignified and non-partisan type way.BASH: Right, because before he actually spoke and before we saw the text of what he was going to say, there was some trepidation really on both sides of the aisle about whether he would kind of give a scolding, which would be tough to take from somebody like the pope. SANDERS: Right.BASH: But it didn't come across that way. SANDERS: No, it didn't. And he is not only - he's a very smart man, but he also, he understands the politics of the United States. He understands that he was invited by the Republican leadership and it would have been totally inappropriate, I think he believed, to suddenly become partisan and make veiled attacks. And that's not what he did. But I think it - the remarks that he gave today are consistent with his views that we need a world economy that works for everybody and not just for the wealthy few. That we must pay attention to environmental degradation and climate change. That we have so much poverty that we just cannot turn our backs on it. I think that was the message that came out today and I appreciate it. BASH: I mean this pope, if you look at where he has decided to be most vocal, it could be a Sanders for president, you know, long bumper sticker. SANDERS: Yes.BASH: I mean he really does - he really is in line with where you - where you think. SANDERS: Yes, he is. But, you know, one of the four Americans that he cited was a woman named Dorothy Day. BASH: Right.SANDERS: Most people don't know who Dorothy Day was. I think that's fair to say. She was -BASH: They do now. SANDERS: They do now. She was a very, very progressive woman, a socialist, who organized working people and the poor to stand up to the wealthy and the powerful and to fight for social justice. The fact that he cited her is, not to mention Martin Luther King Jr., as one of people that he appreciated tells you exactly where this man is coming from in the global world. BASH: The fact that he talked about a socialist? SANDERS: Yes. The fact that he talked about somebody who spent her life fighting for the poor and fighting for justice. BASH: And that's on those issues, but then, of course, when he talked about climate change, saying that it is human made -SANDERS: Right.BASH: It's manmade.SANDERS: Yes.BASH: Talking about immigration -SANDERS: Yes.BASH: In a way that, as you said, you know, saying it was a golden rule. SANDERS: Right.BASH: You know, a lot of issues certainly appeared to make Republicans a bit uncomfortable.SANDERS: Yes. Yes.BASH: But then it's the same on the progressive side. I mean he did - he didn't - maybe he wasn't as aggressive in talking about the issue of abortion or same-sex marriage -SANDERS: Right.BASH: But he made clear what his personal beliefs are. SANDERS: Yes.BASH: What the - what the doctrine of the church is. SANDERS: Look, I think he handled himself in a very dignified way. He was an invited guest and he was not here to make partisan points or to embarrass anybody. And I respect that. And, you're right, certainly for me and for many other progressives, we disagree with the church on issues regarding a woman's right to choose or gay marriage. I support those. BASH: Now, one last question. You have been around here for a few years. SANDERS: A few years.BASH: Seen a few speeches. SANDERS: Yes.BASH: From presidents, heads of state. Have you ever seen the chamber filled with lawmakers so intently focused? SANDERS: I think not. I think that's a good point. And, you know, I could have lived without people standing up and applauding, by the way. But I think there was great attentiveness and great respect for the pope and I think that's a good thing. BASH: Why could you have lived without people applauding?SANDERS: Because I didn't want to -BASH: Even on things that you agreed with? SANDERS: Yes, absolutely. I mean this - you know, of course I was one of those who stood up, but I think - it was fine, but mostly we're there to listen to what a very great man is telling us. BASH: Thank you, Senator. Appreciate it. SANDERS: Thanks. Thank you."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"October 13, 2015","b'Interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC\'s ""Hardball""'","b""MATTHEWS: I've got a great guest here tonight. I've got Senator Bernie Sanders joining us now from the debate. We're in the so-called spin room, which is sort of a postmodern reference to anything. Thank you very much. You know, I was watching you tonight and I thought you -- I was telling everybody I thought you won. It all these guys are arguing with me. I thought you had a constant theme tonight, which was the role of huge money in American politics corrupting the system and the need for some kind of redressing and the whole thing. It was a constant thing. Can that win the election? That theme? SANDERS: Well, the fact that the wealthy are getting richer, the fact that almost all new income and wealth in this country is going to the top 1 percent, the fact that now as a result of Citizens United that the winners and millionaires are spending huge amounts of monies to elect the candidates of their choice, that is the issue. How do we create an economic system which works for the middle class, not billionaires? How do you create a political system where everybody can participate equally and the Koch brothers can't spend 900 million bucks? MATTHEWS: What about the way the politicians go along. I know the game they play and you're not playing it, is they don't know about PACs, the super PACs just happened to be there with their brother in law running or something, and they don't know anything about it. Do you think they are part of the corruption? The ones that allow super PAC did become their shadow candidate -- campaign. Hillary has got one. SANDERS: Well, more than one actually. MATTHEWS: Is that corrupt? SANDERS: I think the system is absolutely corrupt. MATTHEWS: Is she corrupt? SANDERS: No. I think she is doing what she can within the system. MATTHEWS: But you're not. But you're not. SANDERS: I have chosen to put, in a sense, my money where my mouth is. I have said no. I do not represent the billionaire class. I don't represent corporate America. I'm not going to take their money. And super PACs are distorting American democracy, undermining American democracy. MATTHEWS: Didn't Obama start this when he refused the federal money back in '08, said, I'm going with the money because I got more? SANDERS: Look, you know, everything leads to everything else, you know, blah, blah, blah.But the point is that right now the system is corrupt. We have to overturn Citizens United. And I'll tell you something, in my view, we've got to move to public funding of elections. That's my view. MATTHEWS: Everything you stand for is what I have believed for in the '60s, OK, and it's familiar. SANDERS: Don't get old and cynical on me. MATTHEWS: I'm not getting cynical. Look, if this elections were being held four years ago, everything you said would be called class politics. You can't engage in class politics. I was just down in one of your rooms here, a bunch of kids him a people our age. Not as old, gung ho, loving what he said about billionaires.What has changed in the last couple cycles that now it's fair game? People think there is something wrong with the billionaires calling the shots? [crosstalk]SANDERS: What has changed? MATTHEWS: There are more billionaires. SANDERS: What has changed is the reality of American life. And that is just seeing the proliferation of millionaires and billionaires. You know, you can remember, somebody is a billionaire, wow. MATTHEWS: Yes.SANDERS: Now, they're dining with us and they are all over the place. Meanwhile, the average worker is working longer hours for lower wages. We have more kids, a higher percentage of childhood poverty than any other country on earth. So people are saying enough is enough. We need a system, a political system, economic model that works for all of us and not just very top. MATTHEWS: Why don't more people get -- Adelson out here at the Venetian out there, he's making billions in Macau and everywhere else.SANDERS: Right.MATTHEWS: And he's got this little bird chirping for him, Marco Rubio. SANDERS: That's right. MATTHEWS: Who will sing his symphony every night to get his sweet money. SANDERS: Chris, why are these people outrage -- MATTHEWS: He offends people as a sock puppet. Doesn't that bother people? SANDERS: Well, it should. The Koch brothers even more. One family spending more money than the Democratic -- [crosstalk]MATTHEWS: How many Democrats you know in New York are making tons of money as equity people, tons of money, were giving them to the Democrats? Is that one of the reasons why Hillary is a reformer rather than a revolutionary?SANDERS: It's one of the reasons -- MATTHEWS: You said that Wall Street regulates Congress. I thought that was your best line. SANDERS: Well, thank you.MATTHEWS: Everybody else likes the sweetness of you helping Hillary on Benghazi. I thought your most powerful line tonight was: Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Most people believe that. SANDERS: Of course. It's true. There's no doubt about it.MATTHEWS: Why are you not leading the race? SANDERS: Hey, if I was sitting here with you five months ago, you would have said, you are a nice guy, but you are a fringe candidate. Admit it. MATTHEWS: Yes. SANDERS: OK. MATTHEWS: I would have said half of it. SANDERS: No, I'm not a fringe candidate. We are winning in a few states. We're gaining. I think we are doing better and I think we've got a real shot to win this. MATTHEWS: You used some great language in rousing your people. And that's a right word. You used revolution. You know, are you for structural change in America like we used the term?SANDERS: Yes, look.MATTHEWS: That used to scare -- in other words, we are not going from a pure market system where money rules to something different. SANDERS: Yes, absolutely. Look, I think we see some models out there. Yes, it is -- MATTHEWS: You cannot say Denmark again. SANDERS: I'm not going to say Denmark. MATTHEWS: Denmark it's going to give you trouble. SANDERS: Honorary citizenship or something, I don't know -- MATTHEWS: It's a beautiful, by the way, they celebrate the Fourth of July over there. It's one country that really likes us. SANDERS: Look, but I think everybody knows, it's not complicated. Everybody understands there is something wrong when we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and very few people know that because they are working longer hours for lower wages and they can't afford to send their kids to college, can't afford childcare. The people of this country, in my view him understand that we have to take on the big-money interests. That we need millions of people to begin to stand up and fight back. That is what my campaign is about. MATTHEWS: OK, let me go to one thing because I think after all this Obamacare, I think we're going to end up with a single-payer system at some point. It's simple and most efficient. SANDERS: That's right. MATTHEWS: Where does the financing -- you are probably a paperboy, you start as a paperboy and have your first job at a drugstore. By the time you are 65 or 70, you have worked 50 years for your Medicare, for may be the last 10 years in life, your mail is fewer, OK? How do you do it if you have health care for everybody their whole lives? Where does that money come from? SANDERS: First of all, it comes from you not having to pay any private health insurance. You know, what has been very dishonest -- MATTHEWS: That works financially? That covers our health care.SANDERS: We are spending our dysfunctional system is the most expensive per capita in the entire world. MATTHEWS: I agree with that. SANDERS: Perfect. I should probably go out. MATTHEWS: You got to go. By the way, this is part of the spin move. Thank you for coming. SANDERS: Thank you, Chris."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"October 24, 2015",b'Remarks at the Iowa Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Des Moines',"b""Iowa, thank you.Thanks to all of you here tonight for your patriotism, for your love of country and for doing what too few Americans today are doing.You are not standing on the sidelines complaining. You are not turning your backs on the political process.You are standing up and fighting back. That's what you are doing. And that's what my campaign is about.When you see the middle class of this country disappearing, and people working two or three jobs so their families can survive, you don't shrug your shoulders. You fight to raise the minimum wage and pay equity for women workers. You fight for a massive federal jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good paying jobs. You fight for an economy that works for working families and the middle class, for our kids and our seniors  and not just for the people on top.When you see the United States having more income and wealth inequality than almost any major country on earth, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent, you know that that is not moral or sustainable and you demand a tax system that tells Wall Street, corporate America and the wealthiest people in this country that, yes, they are going to have to pay their fair share of taxes.When you see the United States having more people in jail than any other country on earth  disproportionately African-American and Latino  you are demanding that we invest in jobs and education for our young people, not more jails and incarceration.When you saw the United States Supreme Court, in the Citizens United case, vote to allow the wealthiest people in this country to spend unlimited amounts of money to elect the candidates they want, you are fighting for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and a presidential candidate who made it absolutely clear that any nominee of his to the court would vote to overturn that disastrous decision.While many in the Republican Party continue to deny the reality of climate change, you have demanded that we work with other countries in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energies and that we leave our kids and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable.You are not on the sidelines. You are fighting back and that's what this campaign is doing.Six months ago, when I began my campaign for president of the United States and announced that we were going to take on the political and economic establishment of this country, very few pundits took the campaign seriously. I was not widely known. We were at about 3 percent in the polls. We had no money and no political organization.Well, in the last six months things have changed. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers in every state in this country are working hard on this campaign, including some 7,000 here in Iowa. We have brought out to our rallies and town meetings over 300,000 Americans and have drawn some of the largest crowds of any campaign. And today, I can tell you that we have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country, at this point in a campaign, averaging all of $30 apiece.The pundits said that, in this day and age, you can't win a campaign without a super PAC, without raising millions from the wealthiest people in this country. Well I am the only Democratic candidate for president who does not have a Super PAC and we are going to prove them wrong. We will win this election without a Super PAC.And by the way, eight years ago the experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president, Barack Obama, couldn't win. How he was unelectable. Well Iowa, I think we're going to prove the pundits wrong again. I believe we will make history.My political life is not as well-known as some other candidates, so let me take a moment to tell you about some of the difficult choices I have had to make, some of the forks in the road I have encountered in my career as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, as a U.S. congressman and as a U.S. senator.When I was elected mayor of the largest city in my state by 10 votes, I think it would be fair to say it was a shock to the establishment. Nobody thought I would win that election. The Board of Alderman opposed me at every turn. I faced a fork in the road  capitulate or take them on. We decided to fight. The result was that two years later we came close to doubling voter turnout and we elected a slate of progressive candidates prepared to fight for working families. We went to work, implementing innovative housing policies, creating a people oriented waterfront, revitalizing the economy and creating great programs for our kids. Now Burlington is one of America's most livable cities.I learned valuable lessons from that experience. Lessons that must be applied today. And that is that when you stand with the middle class and working families and are prepared to take on powerful special interests, people will come out to vote in large numbers.After I came to Congress, corporate America, Wall Street, the administration in the White House and virtually all of the corporate media pushed for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. I didn't believe their arguments. It didn't make sense to me then that American workers should compete with people making a fraction of our wages. I also opposed CAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. History proved me right. Since 2001 we have lost nearly 60,000 factories in this country and millions of decent-paying jobs.And let me be clear about the current trade deal that we are debating in Congress, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It is not now, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements. I did not support it yesterday. I do not support it today. And I will not support it tomorrow. We had a chance months ago to stop it in its tracks on the vote for fast track authority. That vote was the fork in the road and I'm glad I took the right road at the right moment in time.In 1996, I faced another fork in the road  another very difficult political decision. It was called the Defense of Marriage Act  brought forth by a Republican-led Congress. Its purpose was to write discrimination against gays and lesbians into law. Let us remember, that support for gay rights back in 1996 was not what it is today.And I'm sorry to tell you that that bill won by an overwhelming majority of 342 to 57 in the House and 85 to 15 in the Senate, big majorities which included too many Democrats. That was not a politically easy vote. Today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. Let us be clear. That's just not true. There was a small minority opposed to discriminating against our gay brothers and sisters. Not everybody held that position in 1996.Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and it already is causing massive devastation all across our planet. It is a very sad moment in American history when almost all Republicans running for president reject science and the need for bold action to combat climate change. Sadly, they prefer to take the super PAC campaign contributions from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry rather than to protect the planet for our kids and grandchildren.And if you agree with me about the urgent need to address the issue of climate change, then you would know immediately what to do about the Keystone pipeline. Honestly, it wasn't that complicated. Should we support the construction of a pipeline across America and accelerate the extraction of some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world? To me, that was a no-brainer and that is why I have opposed the Keystone Pipeline from the beginning.My friends, I want to bring you back to a very eventful year and a tragic moment in the modern history of our country. The year is 2002. The issue is whether Congress should vote to invade Iraq. Public opinion and most of the media were for the war. And it turned out that big majorities in Congress were too. The vote was 296-133 in the House 77 to 23 in the Senate voted to give President Bush the authority to go to war. Let me tell you that I listened to what Bush had to say, to what Cheney had to say, to what Rumsfeld had to say. I didn't believe them and I voted no.If you go to my website, you can see exactly what I said at that point and the fears that I had about the destabilization of that region if we invaded Iraq. It gives me no joy to say that I was largely right about the war. I am proud to tell you when I came to that fork in the road I took the right road even though it was not the popular road at the time.Throughout my years in Congress I have voted time and again to rein in Wall Street, the big banks and the big insurance companies that control too much wealth and wield too much power in our country. In 1999, I voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, including ending the Glass-Steagall Act. The House vote was 362 to 57. Yes, I was in a small minority. Yes I took on Wall Street which spent $5 billion lobbying for this deregulation. But the vote I cast was the right vote.At a time when the top six banks in this country have assets of almost 60 percent of our gross domestic product and have incredible economic power, the truth is that it is not Congress that regulates Wall Street, it is Wall Street that regulates Congress. That is why I favor breaking up the big banks, because if a bank is too big to fail it is too big to exist.And today those Wall Street interests are trying to buy the government of the United States with their bundled contributions and their super PACs. Well I don't take their money and I never will. And I don't have a super PAC either. Telling the big banks to cut it out is not going to work unless we cut it out. We have to cut out our reliance on their money if we expect to rein them in. That is why we have built a campaign that has received more than a million contributions from hundreds of thousands of contributors. It is unprecedented, and it is a real-world demonstration that together we can beat the old, corrupt and toxic system of campaign finance that is keeping in place a rigged economy that sends all the new wealth to the top. It's time to break the link between money and special interest favors in politics, and as your president I will.So my friends, those are the choices I made when I came to the forks in the road. I think they tell you a lot about the choices I will make as president. And my message to you today is the same as it was yesterday, and will be tomorrow.I promise you tonight as your president I will govern based on principle not poll numbers. I pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests. I will not abandon any segment of American society  whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor or working class  just because it is politically expedient at a given time.So as we go forth tonight, our job in this election is to build a winning coalition of voters beginning here in Iowa and spreading across this nation who will elect the next Democratic president. I believe I can build that coalition because I know we have begun to build it in huge rallies and small gathering. People are excited to be part of a political revolution that will change this nation and give us a future to believe in.In conclusion, let me leave you with words that have inspired me and I think fit our circumstances today. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison wrote them when attacking the evils of slavery: I am in earnestI will not equivocateI will not excuseI will not retreat a single inchand I will be heard.Well my friends, let us make sure that everyone knows that on the issues of equality, and justice, and ending a rigged economy that is held in place by a corrupt political system, on battling climate change, on halting the draining of American jobs to faraway places, on these issues and so many more:We are in earnest;We will not equivocate;We will not excuse;We will not retreat a single inch;And on the evening of February 1st, in every precinct, in living rooms, in high school gymnasiums, and all across Iowa, we will send a message to our nation and the world We will be heard!Thank you, and I ask for your support in the caucuses."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"November 9, 2015","b'Remarks at the Fair Immigration Reform Movement Strategy Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada'","b'Let me begin by thankingLawrence Benito, the Executive Director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, for that kind introduction.In the brief time that I have I want to focus on three issues: I want to talk about the stain of racism in this country, I want to talk about the need for real immigration reform and I want to talk about what executive actions I will take as President to make sure that we have an immigration policy that is fair and just.As you all know, throughout history, for whatever reason racism has been a stain on human existence. As many of you may know, I lost many members of my family in Europe to Hitler and we know that all over this world including the United States, including North America, racism has existed and has done terrible, terrible things. Racism has plagued the United States since its inception. The atrocities committed against the native people are unspeakable as is the abomination of slavery perpetrated against people of African descent. Millions of people died as a result of that racism and that exploitation of one group of people thinking they are superior to another group of people because of differences of color or of language or of customs. But racism in our country has not only impacted Native Americans and African Americans, as you all know, it has impacted people who\'ve come from countries from all over the world. Racism has plagued this country for centuries. We should be proud however, that in recent decades we have made significant progress, real progress in overcoming racism and in defeating it, in creating a country where we judge people, as Martin Luther King, Jr. reminded us, not on the color of their skin, not on the language they speak, not on the country where they came from, but on their character and qualities as human beings. We are making progress in this country and there will be no turning back and let me be very clear in stating that no one, not Donald Trump, not anyone else will be successful in dividing us based on race or our country of origin. Yes we can have an honest disagreement about immigration reform, but no we cannot and will not call an entire group of people ""rapists"" and ""criminals."" That type of racism, that type of demagoguery must end.America becomes a greater nation, a stronger nation when we stand together as one people and in a very loud and clear voice we say no to all forms of racism and bigotry. I know something about immigration because my Dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, without much of an education and without knowing the English language. Like immigrants before and since, he worked hard to give his family a better life here in the United States. He never made much money. We lived in a three and a half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, but he worked hard, my mom worked hard, and they were able to create a situation where their two kids went to college. Their story, my story, your story, our story is the story of America, hardworking families coming to the United States to create a brighter future for their kids. It is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope. It is a story that continues to this day in families all across the United States. My remarks this afternoon will focus on issues of specific relevance for the Latino community but also issues that are important to all Americans. But when we talk about the Latino community, and in fact when we talk about America, one critical piece that must be talked about is the need to enact comprehensive immigration reform.Today, we have 11 million people in this country who are undocumented, 99% of whom came to this country to improve their lives, to escape oppression, to flee desperate poverty and violence. Let us be frank, today\'s undocumented workers play an extraordinarily important role in our economy. Without these workers it is likely that much of our agricultural system would collapse. Undocumented workers are doing the extremely difficult work of harvesting our crops, building our homes, cooking our meals and caring for our children. They are part of the fabric of America.Eleven million people came to this country, who are today undocumented so that they could feed their families, escape gang violence and desperate economic circumstances. Let me also be very clear, that people came to this country because they knew that there were jobs here and if anyone thinks that employers throughout this country did not know that the workers that they were hiring were undocumented, they know nothing about what has gone on in this country for 50 years.So where do we go from here? Well, I supported the 2013 Comprehensive Immigration Reform Legislation in the U.S. Senate. While a complicated piece of comprehensive legislation like this can always be improved and should be improved, I believe there should be a responsible path to citizenship so individuals can come out of the shadows, people can walk the streets with safety, people can hold their heads high, so that people can have the protection of the law and participate fully and openly in American society. The Senate bill attempted to accomplish this important goal and the time is long overdue for the U.S. House of Representatives to take up immigration reform. The Senate bill contained the provisions of the DREAM Act that I strongly support. It is my belief that we should recognize the young men and women who comprise the DREAMers for what they are, American kids who deserve the right to be in the country they know as home.This is not to say that I do not have significant criticisms of this long and complicated bill. I believe the pathway to citizenship was unnecessarily linked to border security triggers, measures that many believe were put in place so that the path to citizenship would be delayed or even denied for the millions of undocumented individuals here and I want to change those provisions. I also believe that the penalties and fines in the bill would be a bar for the poor, essentially preventing them from accessing the path to legal residency and eventual citizenship. To be meaningful, a pathway to citizenship needs to be achievable for the millions of workers at the lower end of the economic ladders. These and other barriers in the bill, including the years, often more than a decade, that it would take to achieve citizenship make it a flawed piece of legislation and needs to be improved. As President, passing a legislative solution to our broken immigration system will be a top priority. But, let me be clear: I will not wait around for Congress to act. Instead, beginning in the first 100 days of my Administration, I will work to take extensive executive action to accomplish what Congress has failed to do and to build upon President Obama\'s executive orders.While the Senate passed the DREAM act in its immigration bill and while the House has not acted, I think President Obama did exactly the right thing through his executive order for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). DACA and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) were good first steps, but much more needs to be done. Let me tell you what I would do as President:First, I will expand upon President Obama\'s executive actions to provide broad Administrative relief to the parents of DREAMers, the parents of citizens, the parents of legal permanent residents, other family members and the rest of the immigrant population who would have been legalized if the House of Representatives had only taken a vote on immigration reform. The growth of the immigrant detention and deportation machine and the expansion of militarization on the border has perpetuated unjust policies and resulted in the separation of hundreds of thousands of immigrant families. As President, I will work to unite families, not tear them apart.Second, I will direct immigration officers to immediately stop initiating deportations against those eligible for relief. This would include: dismantling inhumane deportation programs and private detention centers, enhancing access to justice, and reversing the criminalization of immigration. In my view, we should not deny a path to citizenship to an undocumented parent for re-entering the country after being separated from their children or for not having a drivers\' license.Third, I will direct my Administration to extend humane treatment and asylum to victims of domestic violence and unaccompanied minors coming from Latin America as a distinct group of people fleeing persecution. America has always been a haven forthe oppressed. We cannot and must not shirk thehistoric roleof the United States as aprotector of vulnerable peoplefleeing persecution.And, fourth, let\'s be clear: the currentimmigrationsystem discriminates againstwomen, and has got to stop. Womenare often the breadwinners of families, but our current immigration policies, in too many cases, treats them as mere dependents. Wives who come into this country with their families should have the same right to work as their husbands. These are just key elements of a broader set of immigration policies that I will be releasing in the coming days as we seek to aggressively address our broken immigration system. The bottom line is that we cannot and we should not sweep up millions of men, women, and children  many of whom have been here for years  and throw them out of the country. We need a path to citizenship to bring 11 million people out of the shadows. And, that must happen sooner, rather than later. Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to discuss my views. I look forward to taking your questions.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"November 19, 2015","b'Remarks at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.'","b'Thank you. Thank you all for being out on this beautiful day and let me thank Mo and Shweta for that wonderful introduction.I think my message to you all today is a pretty simple one. And that is, our country faces some enormous problems. And these problems are not going to be solved if people turn away from political struggle, if people throw up their hands in despair and say ""I don\'t want to get involved; it\'s all crap.""You are getting a great education here in Georgetown and I hope very much you will learn -- use what you have learned here to fight to create a better world and to follow in the traditions of so many people for so many years who have struggled to create a more democratic and just society. Let me take you now back to the year 1937, and in his inaugural address, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation, in the midst of this terrible depression, and this is what he saw and this what he talked about in his inaugural.He saw tens of millions of people denied the basic necessities of life. He saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them every single day. He saw millions of his fellow Americans denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children. He saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed.And by their poverty -- by their lack of disposal income -- denying employment to many other millions, because when you don\'t have money to spend, you\'re not creating jobs for other people. He saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, and ill-nourished. And he acted -- against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called ""the economic royalists"".Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of Americans back to work, took them out of dire poverty and restored their faith in government. He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our nation. He combated cynicism, fear and despair. He reinvigorated democracy. He transformed our country. And that is exactly we have to do today.And by the way, almost everything he proposed -- almost every program -- every idea he introduced was called socialist. [applause]I thought I would mention that just in passing. [laughter]Social Security -- which all of you know, transformed life for senior citizens in this country -- was defined by his opponents as socialist. The concept of the minimum wage -- that workers had to be paid at least a certain amount of money for their labor was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace, and was described as socialist. Unemployment insurance -- when you lose your job you have something to fall back upon. Abolishing child labor -- ending the fact that children of 8, 10, 12 years of age were working in factories or working in the fields. The 40-hour work week. Collective bargaining -- the rights of workers to engage in negotiations with the Union. Strong banking regulations, deposit insurance and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as socialist.Yet, as you all know, all of these programs, and many more, have become the fabric of our nation and, in fact, the foundation of our middle class. Thirty years later after Roosevelt\'s speech in the 1960\'s, President Lyndon Johnson fought for Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children, persons with disabilities and some of the vulnerable people in this country.Today, Medicare does not seem to be such a terribly radical idea -- to say that when somebody gets old they should have medical insurance. But when it was proposed, once again, we heard right-wing forces describe these programs as socialistic and a threat to the American way of life. That was then. Now is now.Today, in the year 2015, despite the Wall Street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the American people are clearly better off economically than they were in 1937. But here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge, we must address, we must not sweep under the rug, and that is, despite a huge increase in technology -- and I can remember back -- I was mayor of the city of Burlington, Vermont -- anybody here from Vermont? [applause]OK. And when I was mayor in the 1980\'s, a radical development took place. We got computers in City Hall. [laughter]OK? 1980\'s. Despite a huge increase in technology and worker productivity, meaning that almost every worker in America with that technology is producing a lot more than workers that came before, despite major growth in our GDP and a huge increase in the global economy, tens of millions of American families continue today to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families.And I hope none of you will turn your back on that reality. And the truth is -- and, again, this is a truth we must put on the table. Yes, we are better off today economically than we were seven years ago when Bush left office, but the other truth is that for the last 40 years -- 40 years under Republican leadership and Democratic leadership -- the great middle class of our country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.New technology, increased worker productivity, people working longer hours for lower wages, faith in our political system now extremely low. The very rich get richer. Almost everyone else gets poorer. Super-PACs, funded by billionaires, buy elections. Koch Brothers alone -- and a few of their friends -- will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties.Ordinary people, working people, young people don\'t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old politics and economics will not effectively address those crises.If we are serious about transforming our country -- and I hope all of you are serious about our transforming our country. If we are serious about rebuilding the American middle class, if we are serious about re-invigorating American democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. [applause]Now, I know that terms like ruling class -- probably not talked about too often here at Georgetown... [applause]Not too often talked about on CBS or NBC, but that is the simple fact. And in my view, the billionaire class must be told loudly and clearly that they cannot have it all, that our government belongs to all of us; not just a handful of billionaires. [applause]But this goes beyond politics. We need to create a culture -- an entire culture which, as Pope Francis has reminded us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts while children in America go hungry and veterans -- men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us -- sleep out on the streets.Today in America, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. But few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth is going to the people on top. In fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. Problem is, it has gone in the wrong direction. [applause]In the last 30 years, we have seen trillions of dollars flow from the hands of working families and the middle class to the top one- tenth of one percent. A handful of people, top one-tenth of one percent, who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth that they own during that period -- doubling of the percentage of wealth they own.Unbelievably and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of one percent today owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. One-tenth of one percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That is not the kind of America that we should accept. [applause]I can tell you that in my state of Vermont and all over this country, it is absolutely not uncommon to see people working two jobs or three jobs to cobble together the income and the health care they and their families need. In fact, Americans work longer hours than do the people of any other industrialized country.But despite the fact that our people are working so hard -- I go around the country and I see a lot of working people, and you can see the stress and exhaustion on their faces. They\'re working crazy hours. Husbands hardly see wives. People don\'t have the quality time for their kids because they\'re working so hard just to bring up -- bring in the income to survive. And despite all of that -- despite our people working so hard, 58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent.Today in America, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago in inflation adjusted for dollars. Do you know why people are angry? They are angry because they are working terribly hard; and yet, in real, inflation adjusted for dollars, they are earning less. And they\'re looking all over and they say ""What\'s happening? Why is that?""But it\'s not just men. Last year, the median female worker earned more than $1000 less than she did in 2007, and 58 percent of all new income goes to the top one percent.Today in America, the wealthiest country in the history of world -- that\'s what we are today -- more than half of older workers have zero retirement savings. Think about that. You\'re 50, 55 years of age and you\'re thinking, ""All right, how am I going to retire? But because my wages have gone down, I have zero in the bank for retirement.""And, at the same time, all over America, you\'ve got millions of seniors and people with disabilities trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year Social Security. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death, and they are saying ""How am I going to retire with dignity?""And I want all of you -- you can get your calculators out -- not now, when you leave here. Do some arithmetic and try to put yourself in the place of a senior citizen in my state of Vermont where it gets cold in the winter, trying to survive on $13,000 a year and you tell me how you are going to pay for the food that you need, heat your home and buy the medicine that you need. And you know what? You can\'t do it.Today in America, nearly 47 million people are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of African American kids, are living in poverty -- the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any nation on Earth. And what I want you to think about is why is it, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, where we\'re seeing the proliferation of millionaires of billionaires, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth.Today in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are under-insured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. In other words, people do have insurance, but I talk to people every day; they\'ve got a $5000 deductible, $8000 deductible -- they can\'t go to the doctor when they need.And then on top of that, for a wide variety of reasons, our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And doctors tell me all of the time, ""We prescribe something -- a medicine for our patients. They can\'t afford to fill that medicine -- that prescription."" One out of five Americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write. What insanity is that?Today in America, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent. For African American kids it is over 50 percent. Meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country. China -- communist, authoritarian country four times our size, we have more people in jail than China, and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend 80 billion dollars a year locking up our fellow Americans.The bottom line is that today in America, we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure built around that inequality which protects those who have the money. Today, a handful of super wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress. And any member of the United States House or Senate who is prepared to tell you the truth will tell you exactly that.Now, in 1944, in his State of the Union speech, President Roosevelt outlined what he called a Second Bill of Rights. You\'re all familiar with our Bill of Rights. And what Roosevelt outlined was what he called a Second Bill of Rights. This is, in my view, one of the more important speeches ever made by a President. But unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves. So, I\'m going to give it some attention today. [laughter]In his remarkable speech, this is what Roosevelt stated, and I quote, ""We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men"" -- and we would add women -- ""are not free men and women."" In other words, real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt\'s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved and it is time that we did. [applause]In that speech, Roosevelt described the economic rights, r-i-g-h- t-s, rights that he believed every American was entitled to; the right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies, the right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care.What Roosevelt was stating in 1944, what Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today is that true freedom does not occur without economic security. People are not free; they\'re not truly free when they are unable to feed their family.They are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. They are not truly free when they are unemployed, underemployed or when they are exhausted by working 60, 70 hours a week. People are not truly free when they don\'t know how they\'re going to get medical help when they or a family member are sick.So, let me take this opportunity to define for you simply and straightforwardly what democratic socialism means to me. It means building on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans, and it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated, and I quote, ""This country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor,"" end of quote. [applause]My view of democratic socialism builds on the success of many other countries around the world who have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, their elderly citizens, their children, their sick and their poor. Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system which is corrupt, that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.Democratic socialism, to my mind, speaks through a system which, for example, during the 1980\'s, and I want you to hear this, allowed Wall Street to spend $5 billion over a 10-year period in lobbying and campaign contributions in order to get deregulated. They wanted the government off of their backs, they wanted to do whatever they wanted to do -- spent $5 billion over a 10-year period on lobbying and campaign contributions.Then 10 years later, after their greed and recklessness and illegal behavior led to their collapse, what our system enabled them to do is to get bailed out by the United States government, which through Congress and the Fed, provided trillions of dollars in aid to Wall Street.In other words, Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation. And then when Wall Street collapsed, they used their wealth and power to get bailed out; quite a system. And then to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, we were told that the bankers were too big to jail. [applause] And this is the system. Young people who get caught possessing marijuana, they get police records and many, many hundreds of thousands of them have received police records which have impacted their lives in very serious ways.On the other hand, Wall Street CEOs who helped destroy the economy, they don\'t get police records; they get raises in their salaries. And this is what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. meant when he talked about socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.In my view, it is time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just for Wall Street billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations. It means that we should not be providing huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country or trade policies which boost corporate profits while they result in workers losing their jobs.It means that we create a government which works for all of the American people, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for. Among many other things, it means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. [applause]Now, I know that there are some people out there who think this is just an incredibly radical idea. Imagine, in the United States of America, all of us having health care as a right. But I hope all of you know this is not a radical idea; it is a conservative idea.It is an idea and a practice that exists in every other major country on Earth, you know, not just in Scandinavia, in Denmark or Sweden or Finland or Norway; it exists in Canada. I live 50 miles away from Canada; not a radical idea. It exists in France, Germany, Taiwan. All over the world, countries have made the determination that all of their people are entitled to health care, and I believe the time is long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the world. [applause]A Medicare-for-all single-payer program, which I support, would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money -- because all of you should know that our health care system is by far the most expensive per capita of any system on Earth. But a Medicare- for-all single-payer program would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy.Think about it. People who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a copayment. Radical idea; when they\'re sick, they can actually go to the doctor and not end up in the emergency room at a much greater expense to the system. Think about it. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they\'re going to provide health care for their employees.Think about it -- and we don\'t talk about this very much; you\'ve got millions of workers in this country who are staying on jobs -- in jobs which they do not want to stay in, but they\'re there because they have a decent health care program for themselves and their families.Think what it means when young people or anybody else can say, ""You know what? This is the job that I love. This is what I want to do and I\'m going to go out and start this business or do this work and I don\'t have to worry about health care because all of us in America have health care."" [applause]And by the way, what a Medicare-for-all system will bring about is ending the absurdity of the American people paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Now, when I talk about democratic socialism, what that means to me is that in the year 2015, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago. And what that means is that public education must today allow every person in this country who have -- has the ability, the qualifications and the desire the right to go to a public college or university tuition free. [applause]Is this a radical socialistic idea? I don\'t think so. It exists in many countries all over the world. And you know what? It used to exist in the United States of America. We had great universities, like the University of California, the City University of New York, virtually tuition free.Democratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy. It makes far more sense to me to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10 percent. It is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for young people who are unemployed than to lock them up and invest in jails and incarceration. [applause]Democratic socialism means that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty; that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years. [applause]It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong paid family and medical leave legislation now sitting in Congress. [applause]Now, I want you to think about this and I really -- I want you to see what goes on in our country today. It\'s not only that every other major country -- I\'m not talking about Europe or Scandinavia; virtually every country in the world, poor country, small country, reached the conclusion that when a woman has a baby, she should not be forced to be separated from that newborn baby after a week or two and have to go back to work.Making sure that moms and dads can stay home and get to love their babies is a family value that we should support. And that is why I want and will fight to end the absurdity of the United States being one of the only countries on Earth that does not guarantee at least three months of paid family and medical leave. [applause]Democratic socialism to me means that we have government policy, strong government policy, which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet. [applause]And it means to me that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren. [applause]Democratic socialism means that in a democratic, civilized society, the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. [applause]Yes, innovation, entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded, but greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support. [applause]It is not acceptable to me that in the last period of time, last two years, 15 of the wealthiest people in this country, 15 people, saw their wealth increase in this rigged economy by $170 billion. Got it? Two years, 15 people, $170 billion increase in their wealth; that is more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans.Let us not forget what Pope Francis has so eloquently stated, and I quote, ""We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly human goal,"" end of quote.In other words...[applause]We have got to do better than that. Not a political issue, it\'s not an economic issue; it is a cultural issue. We have got to stop worshiping people who make billions and billions and billions of dollars while we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country.It\'s not acceptable to me that major corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion a year in taxes. It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.It is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax. It is not acceptable that Wall Street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on that speculation.Democratic socialism to me does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice and environmental sanity. Of course, it does mean that, but it also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person, one vote.It is extremely sad, and I hope all of you will pay a lot of attention to this issue; it is extremely sad that the United States, one of the oldest, most stable democracies in the world, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country and that millions of young people and working people have given up on the political process entirely.In the last midterm election just a year ago, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t vote; 80 percent of young people did not vote.Clearly, despite the efforts of many Republican governors who want to suppress the vote to make it harder for people of color and old people to participate in the political system, our job together is to make it easier for people to vote, not harder for people to vote. [applause]It is not a radical idea, and I will fight for this as hard as I can as president, to say that everyone in this country who is 18 years of age or older is registered to vote, end of discussion. [applause]So, the next time that you hear me attacked as a socialist, like tomorrow... [laughter]Remember this: I don\'t believe government should take over, you know, the grocery store down the street or own the means of production. But I do believe that the middle class and the working families of this country who produce the wealth of this country deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad. [applause]I believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally start paying the taxes that they should.I don\'t believe in special treatment for the top one percent, but I do believe in equal treatment for African Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that black lives matter. [applause]I despise appeals to nativism and prejudice, a lot of which we have been hearing in recent months. And I do proudly believe in immigration reform... [applause]That gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life. [applause]And while I\'m on that subject, let me just say a real word of concern to what I\'ve been hearing from some of the Republican candidates for president in recent months. People can have honest disagreements about immigration or about anything else; that\'s called democracy. But people should not be using the political process to inject racism into the debate. [applause]And if Donald Trump and others who refer to Latinos as -- people from Mexico as criminals and rapists, if they want to open that door, our job is to shut that door and shut it tight. [applause]This country has gone too far. Too many people have suffered and too many people have died for us to continue hearing racist words coming from major political leaders.Now, I don\'t believe in some foreign ism, but I do believe in American idealism. And one of the pleasures, one of the real joys that I\'ve experienced on this campaign so far, being here today with you and being all over the country, is seeing the huge numbers of young people who are coming out who want to make this country better, who want to use their intelligence and their energy to address the many problems that we have. So, I want to thank all of the young people, here and all over this country, for their idealism and do not, do not, do not become cynical.I am not running for president because it is my turn; not quite. I was born in a three-and-a-half room apartment in a working class family in Brooklyn, New York. I don\'t think... [applause]Oh, OK. So, I got Brooklyn, I got Vermont... [laughter]And by the way, I visited California... [applause]But in seriousness, it is not quite my turn; that\'s not why I\'m running for president. But I am running for president in order for all of us to be able to [inaudible] have been carried into practice for unless there is security here at home there cannot be last peace -- lasting peace in the world, end quote.Now, I am not running for president to pursue reckless adventures abroad but to rebuild America\'s strength at home. I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses about dubious battles with no end in sight. [applause]And as we discuss foreign policy, I know that all of you share with me your shock and your horror at what happened in Paris and you share with me your condolences for the families who lost loved ones and your hopes and prayers that those who were wounded will recover.And also, those same thoughts go out to the families of those who lost loved ones in the Russian flight that we believe was taken down by an ISIS bomb and also those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere.To my mind, it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric ISIS regime and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing, but we cannot and should not do it alone.Our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy. It begins with the acknowledgement that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort... [applause]And that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilization over regions for decades. [applause]It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past, rushing to war, regime change in Iraq or toppling Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953. Mossadegh was the president. CIA and others got rid of him to protect British petroleum interests.The Shah of Iran came in, a brutal dictator, and he was thrown out by the Islamic revolution and that is where we are in Iran today. Decisions have consequences, often unintended consequences.So, whether it was Saddam Hussein or Mossadegh or Guatemalan President Arbenz in 1954 in Guatemala, Brazilian President Goulart in 1964, Chilean President Allende in 1973, this type of regime change, this type of throwing -- overthrowing governments we may not like often does not work, often makes a bad and difficult decision even worse. These are lessons we must learn. [applause]After World War II -- after World War II in response to the fear of Soviet aggression, European nations and the United States established NATO, the North American Treaty Organization, an organization based on shared interest and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy. It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror.We must create a new organization like NATO to confront the security threats of the 21st Century, an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and, importantly, to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts. We must work with our NATO partners, we must work to expand the coalition with Russia, and we must work with members of the Arab League.But let us be very clear. While the United States and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and our political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam and countering violent extremism, and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations with the strong support of their global partners. [applause]Now, this has been my view long before Paris but I am very happy to tell you that these same sentiments have been echoed by people like Jordan\'s King Abdullah II in a speech just Sunday in which he said that terrorism is the greatest threat to our region -- the Gulf region, Middle East -- and that Muslims must lead the fight against it.He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and their religion with generations of intolerance and violent ideology.And let me congratulate King Abdullah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in that region. [applause]A new and strong coalition -- coalition of western powers, Muslim nations and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counterterrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing and to end support for exploiting extremist ideologies.Now, what does that mean? What it means is that, in many cases, we must ask more from those countries in the Gulf region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Lebanon, in their own ways, have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.Equally important -- and this is a point that may make some people uncomfortable, but it is a point that must be made -- countries in the region, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE -- countries of enormous wealth and resources have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. [applause]King Abdullah is absolutely right when he says that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS and that includes and must include some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region who up to this point have done far too little.Saudi Arabia, turns out, has the third largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting ISIS, they are focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by the United States driving Saddam Hussein\'s Iraq out of Kuwait, has been a well-known -- Kuwait -- people in Kuwait have been well known sources of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists.It has been reported that Qatar will spend up to $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event. $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight ISIS. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government there has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups in the region.All of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States, our young men and women and our taxpayers to do it for them. They have got to come up to the plate. [applause]As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation we desperately need.Further, we all understand that Bashar al-Assad, president of Syria, is a brutal dictator who has -- who has slaughtered many of his own people.I am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over the world, known as the International Syria Support Group, set a timetable for a Syrian-led political transition with an open and fair election. These are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and move toward a political transition in Syria.The diplomatic plan for Assad\'s transition from power is a good step in a united front, but our major priority must be to defeat ISIS. Nations all over the world who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorism must make the destruction of ISIS the highest priority. Nations in the region must commit that instead of turning a blind eye, they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq.We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders. This is the model which we must pursue in order to address the global threats that we face.While individual nations obviously have historic disputes -- the United States and Russia now have very strong differences of opinion on some very serious issues, Iran and Saudi Arabia, to put it mildly, do not like each other. [laughter]But the time is now to do everything possible to put aside those differences to work toward a common goal of destroying ISIS. Sadly, as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization called ISIS. Thus, we must work with our partners in Europe, the Gulf region, Africa and Southeast Asia, all along the way, asking the hard questions, whether their actions are serving our unified purpose.The bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone. A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need.Let me conclude by once again thanking all of you for being here today. All across this country there is a significant alienation from the political process. People look to Washington and they throw their hands up and they said what in God\'s name is going on there? Why aren\'t our senators and our congressmen paying attention to our needs? Why aren\'t we developing a rational foreign policy rather than talking again about getting involved in a quagmire in the Middle East which could lead to perpetual warfare?So let me conclude just by saying this. The problems that we face as a nation are indeed very, very serious. I talked -- I\'ve talked on some. There\'s a lot we haven\'t even touched upon.But, by and large, all of these problems were caused by bad human decisions and, if we come together, if we stand together, if we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by race, by whether we\'re gay or whether we\'re straight, whether we\'re born in America, we weren\'t born in America, whether a male or a female, if we stand together and if we focus on how we can create sane foreign policy, how we can rebuild the middle class, how we can combat climate change, how we can create a nation in which we end racism and homophobia, if we are prepared to do that -- if you, as young people are prepared to engage in the political process, I have no doubt that there is nothing, nothing, nothing that together we cannot accomplish.Thank you all very much. [applause]MODERATOR: All right. Senator, again, we can\'t thank you enough for being here today and we\'ve -- the Institute of Politics and Public Service invited all the major presidential candidates. I think it\'s a testament to your vision that you were the first to accept our invitation. Thank you for being here. [applause]And it\'s clear you have a lot of friends in this room.Let\'s get right into it. We received a lot of questions from students as they were waiting in line in -- in the rain this morning, and you covered a lot of ground. Not surprisingly, so do the questions, and the questions are -- are very good.Now, I\'m not editing any of these questions. I am going to group some of them together though where they were on a common theme.So let\'s begin with the central premise, at least of the first part of your remarks, and that was a discussion of democratic socialism. I think your remarks -- you did a very good job of describing what it means to you but as you know, Senator, there\'s a lot of confusion just around the word.Robert France, a freshman from Brooklyn who specifically asked me to shout out Brooklyn, right there, asks, you know, why do you chose to identify as a socialist when it seems in your platforms you are more in the middle of the spectrum between capitalism and socialism?Well, Axel Kayak, a freshman from Paris, France, in the School of Foreign Service, says in France there\'s no problem with the word socialist. Considering myself a socialist, I feel like the cultural and historical pressure pushes you to call yourself a democratic socialist, although I can\'t see the difference between the two.So these two questions alone show some of the differences in -- in -- in how people view the word and you. I\'m wondering if you would comment to that and maybe discuss that confusion and -- and -- and clarify it just a little bit?SANDERS: I -- I think the reason that I have always throughout my political career, going way back when I was mayor of Burlington, defined myself as a democratic socialist is that that, in fact, is my vision. And my vision is not just making modest changes around the edge. It is transforming American society to make it into a much more vibrant democracy and an economy which works much, must better for working families.And by the word socialism, what is implicit in that to me is that it is imperative that if we are serious about change -- and a lot of people want change -- but at the end of the day, real change does not take place unless we have the courage to take on the very powerful special interests that control our country.Now, that\'s my view. Not everybody here may agree with me and certainly most people in Congress would not. But I think at the end of the day, what we have got to recognize is not just that we are experiencing mass income and wealth inequality or declining middle class, but that a small number of people have extraordinary power. And if we are not prepared to take them on and to tell them that they cannot run the government for their own interests, the real change that many of us want will never take place.So when I use the word socialist -- and I know some people aren\'t comfortable about it -- I say that it is imperative that we create a political revolution, that millions of people get involved in the political process and that we create a government that works for all, not just the few. [applause]MODERATOR: Staying on this topic for at least one more question, David Alzate, a -- a sophomore in the school of Foreign Service from Quito, Ecuador, writes -- points out that Margaret Thatcher once said socialists always run out of other people\'s money. My question is how will your policies promote wealth creation to ensure their long-term sustainability rather than simply depend on the redistribution of existing wealth?SANDERS: Well, for a start, David, given the fact that we have seen trillions of dollars being transferred in the last 30 years from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we start from a position that there is already a lot of money out there.And that is an important point that has to be made. You know, we\'re not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and we should be doing a lot better for our working people, should not be having 47 million people living in poverty. But how do you create wealth? Of course wealth is -- has to be created. And one of the points that I made in my remarks -- let me give you one example of it. I believe that we significantly strengthen our economy by having a Medicare-for-all single-payer system which will free millions of people to get involved in creating businesses and in creating jobs who today are trapped at work only because they get the health insurance that that employer is now providing.I think that if you have a trade policy not designed by corporate America to shut down plants in America and move abroad, but a trade policy which works for the American worker, you can create over a period of years millions of decent paying jobs.I believe that when you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it\'s not only the right thing to do but, as Roosevelt talked about in the 1930\'s, when you put money -- disposable income into the hands of people today who have no disposal income, they will then take that money, spend it and create jobs.So I think the policies that I am advocating will, in fact, create wealth, will strengthen the economy. These are diametrically opposed, an opposite, to this trickle-down economic theory that says if we give tax breaks to billionaires at Wall Street, somehow or another that will benefit the middle class and the poor. History has been very clear. That is a false doctrine; it hasn\'t worked. [applause]MODERATOR: I think I\'d probably be run off campus if I didn\'t move to this topic next. And it\'s one that you touched on in your remarks. And that is the cost of college tuition.Julia Friedman, a freshman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, asks under your plan to reduce the cost of college, will the tax on Wall Street speculation be sufficient to cover the cost of the plan?And Zachary Shropfer, a freshman in the business school from Tallahassee, writes as many of us know, one of your main policies is to make all public universities tuition free. In the United States many of the greatest universities are private universities -- Georgetown. [laughter]So how to you plan to combat the high prices of private universities?SANDERS: Good, excellent questions.For a start, the answer to the first question is, yes, the legislation that I\'ve introduced does a number of things. It makes public colleges and universities tuition free. It also addresses the very significant crisis in this country of millions of people paying very high interest rates on their student debt. And I suspect some of you guys are going to be graduating here deeply in debt. I see at least one person there. [laughter]I suspect there are many more. All right?So the -- the -- what we do are two things, all right? Public colleges, universities, tuition free, and then what we also say is that it is a little bit crazy that today you have many people out there who are paying interest rates on their student debt of six, eight, 10 percent when we can refinance our homes at three or four percent.So what our legislation does is allow people the ability and the freedom to get the lowest possible interest rates on their debt that they can get. And that will save people all over this country collectively many, many billions of dollars.Now, if you add those two features together, free tuition at public colleagues, universities, substantially lowering interest rates on student debt, it is an expensive proposition. It costs about $70 billion a year. And yes, it can be paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation.All right, second point about private universities. Of course, we know that Georgetown and -- and many other private universities do an extraordinary job and we\'re all proud of the quality of education they provide. Our legislation includes substantially increasing Pell Grants to make sure that working class and lower income families, middle class families can get the help they need if they choose to send their kids here to Georgetown or Harvard or any place else.We also significantly increase work student -- student work programs so that universities can have funds available to -- to employ students on campus. So your point is well taken. Our legislation also makes private colleges and universities less expensive. [applause]MODERATOR: Let\'s move to the second portion of your speech.Molly Coil, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences from Denver, asks with your strong beliefs in pacifism, how would you address the recent and escalating violence of ISIS? Does being a democratic socialist state entail opening borders to Syrian and other refugees?And Peter Abdo, a freshman in the college from Bethesda, asks given recent attacks by ISIS worldwide, more generally how will you ensure the safety of the American people?SANDERS: OK. First of all, let me respond to the first question and -- you know, and -- and I have a lot of respect for people who may be pacifists; I am not a pacifist.What, in fact, I voted for -- I voted against the very first Gulf war, which I had to vote on about -- within the first month that I was elected to Congress. I think history will record that as the right vote. And then in 2002, after listening to Bush and Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, and listening carefully to what they had to say, I concluded that they were not telling the truth and I voted against the war in Iraq. [applause]But I did vote for the war in Afghanistan because I thought that Osama bin Laden should be held accountable and I did vote for President Clinton\'s effort to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. So no, I am not a pacifist. I think that war should be the last resort, but we have the strongest military on Earth and, of course, we should be prepared to use it when it is necessary.In terms of where we are right now, I think the main point that I try to make in my remarks is I think it would be a terrible mistake for many, many reasons for the United States virtually unilaterally to get involved in the war in Syria or reinvolved in the war in Iraq.And the nightmare is that we send our troops in there in combat, they come back in caskets. We send more troops in, a plane gets shot down. We send more planes in, and 20 or 30 years from how we\'re still talking about how we get out of the quagmire in that region of the world.I agree very, very strongly with King Abdullah who is absolutely right. What is going on there is a struggle for the soul of Islam. There are millions and millions and millions of Muslims who detest and are disgusted with what ISIS and other extremist groups are doing. But now they are going to have to get into the process. It is their troops that are going to be on the ground. We should be supportive, and I support President Obama\'s efforts with airstrikes, with Special Forces. But the leadership must come from the Muslim nations.In terms of how we protect our country, obviously, we have got to be super vigilant against terrorist attacks. I know there\'s a lot of discussion about refugees. Let me say a word on that. I am not happy to hear what I have heard in recent days about people who are talking about going into or maybe closing down mosques in America. I\'m not happy about hearing that we should close our borders to men, women and children who have been displaced, driven out of their homes because of terrorism.And I believe that, yes, after thorough screening, which we have the capability of doing, working with the rest of the world, we should accept refugees from that region. That\'s the moral thing to do and accepting refugees is what America has always done and I think it\'s improper to turn our back on these people now. [applause]MODERATOR: The next couple of questions grouped together come from something that I think created a lot of buzz that you said in the -- in the debates. And it\'s about climate change and, specifically, its link to terror and terrorism.Jonathan Amen, a freshman in the business school from Port Orange, Florida, and Bryce Couch, a freshman in the school of Foreign Service from Texas, both asked very similar questions about can you elaborate on the link between...SANDERS: Absolutely.MODERATOR: ... the two and what\'s your plan to address both?SANDERS: Absolutely.Look. Obviously, as I hope I made clear this afternoon, organizations like ISIS, terrorist organizations, are a major threat. They have got to be destroyed. But if you look into the future -- this is not Bernie Sanders -- this is the CIA, this is Defense Department, this is countries all over the world, this is what they are saying. If we do not get our act together, if there is more drought around the world, if there is more flooding, if there are more extreme weather disturbances, if sea levels continue to rise and flood coastal regions, there will be a massive displacement of people.People need water; people need land to grow their crops. And if they do not have that land and water, they\'re going to migrate and they\'re going to be in competition with other peoples for limited natural resources. And when that happens, according to the CIA, according to our own Defense Department, that lays the groundwork for international conflict.So in my view, it is not debatable. Of course, climate change is a major, major inducement to international -- international conflict and also to terrorism. For example, right now in Syria as a result of a sustained drought, people have left the rural areas, flooded into the cities, causing more instability and becoming people who could succumb to extremist propaganda. Massive instability in Syria.So what we have to do -- and by the way, you know, when I was your age, the challenge of my generation was civil rights. And all over this country -- and I was involved when I was at the University of Chicago -- but young people stood up and they said you know what? We\'re going to end segregation in America. And those of us who were northern schools helped out financially, our brothers and sisters fighting in the south were getting their heads busted open and we did what we could where we were.My guess among many other issues that are out there, one of your great challenges today continue the fight against racism and sexism and homophobia. But also understand that we are fighting for the future of the planet and if we do not move aggressively -- I\'m on the energy committee in the Senate and the environmental committee. I\'ve talked to scientists all over the world and what they are telling us is we have a small window of opportunity to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.We need to take on the fossil fuel industry who are looking at short term profits ahead of the future of this planet. And I hope you will be involved in that effort to transform our energy system. [applause]MODERATOR: Senator, I know you have to leave momentarily and so I want to close with one last grouping here, and I think it\'s an important one because it gets very much at the whole notion of why our institute exists and one of the big points you brought up at the conclusion of your remarks, and that\'s how do we get this done?Ari Shapiro, a sophomore in the School of Foreign Service, says with a -- or asks with a Republican majority in both houses, would you be willing to compromise some of your ideals to get your most important plans passed.And Kameel Asom, a freshman from San Francisco, writes my question is how do you plan on implementing your social programs given the immense opposition in Congress?SANDERS: OK, great questions.Look, when you are in Congress, by definition, you compromise every day. And you all should know that when I was in the House of Representatives -- I was there for 16 years -- on certain years, I ended up getting more amendments passed on the floor of the House than any other member of Congress because when there was an issue out there that I could work with Republicans on, and they were in the majority, we put together a pretty good coalition.Just two years ago, I worked as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans\' Affairs. I worked with people like -- Republicans like John McCain in the Senate and people like Congressman Jeff Miller over in the House who\'s chairman of the Veterans Committee there, to put together the most comprehensive veterans\' health care bill passed in recent memory.So yes, I can compromise. But here is the point that I want to make. On many of the issues that I have talked about, virtually all of them, these are not radical extremist ideas. I am not coming before the American people and saying look, I am this radical wild- eyed socialist, crazy ideas but listen to me. You know, that\'s not the issue.Look at the issues. We want to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, raising the minimum wage widely popular. I want to create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, wildly popular. Pay equity for women workers, wildly popular. Making -- there it is, popular idea, all right. [laughter]Making public colleges and universities tuition free and lowering student debt, widely popular. Combating climate change. There are some Republicans who still don\'t accept it but most Americans do. All right? Asking the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes, vast majority of the Americans think that that\'s right.So here\'s my point, here\'s my point. The real question is sure, you\'ve got to compromise, but the really more important point is why is Congress so far out of touch with where the American people are at? The Republican agenda is among other things to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and give huge tax breaks to billionaires and to ignore the planetary crisis of climate change.How many people believe in that agenda? I don\'t know, five percent, 10 percent. Surely a very small minority of people. So when I talk about the political revolution, when I talk about transforming American politics, what I am talking about is bringing in the voices of millions and millions of people who have given up on the political process, to have their views and their needs being heard by Congress. When that happens, everything that I talked about will be passed.If that does not happen, virtually nothing will be passed. So what this campaign from my perspective is about -- and I say this in every speech that I give -- it\'s not just electing Bernie Sanders to be president, I surely would appreciate your support. [laughter]But very honestly, it is much more than that because no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else, can implement the kinds of changes we need in this country unless millions of people begin to stand up and fight back. And I think right here on college campuses all over this country, we\'re beginning to see that fight back, we\'re beginning to see that fight back among low-wage workers. We\'re going out into the streets and saying you know what, we can\'t make it on $8 or $9 an hour. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.We are beginning to see that movement develop and I hope you will be part of that movement because if you are, we can, in fact, transform this country.Thank you all very much. [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"November 29, 2015",b'Remarks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Manchester',"b'Let me begin by thanking all of you who are here today for doing what too few Americans do. Thank you all, every person in this room, for standing up for American democracy and participating in the political process.Let me also say that if these were normal times many people in our country could be supportive of Establishment politics, Establishment economics and Establishment foreign policy. But these are not normal times. And what I see, from coast to coast is an American people crying out for change, for real change. They do not want the same-old, same-old. They want a political revolution. When, in the last election, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t vote, when 80 percent of young people and low income people didn\'t vote; when millions of people have given up on the political process; when there is profound disgust across the political spectrum with a campaign finance system that allows millionaires and billionaires to buy elections through their super PACs, now is not the time for establishment politics. Now is the time for a political revolution.When most Americans understand that we are living in a rigged economy where almost all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent, where Wall Street continues to dominate our economic and political life, when corporate profits soar while millions of our children live in poverty  now is not the time for establishment economics. Now is the time for a political revolution.When our foreign policy, for the last many decades, has failed the American people, has led to wars, like the war in Iraq which we should never have gotten into. Now is not the time for more establishment foreign policy.We began this campaign seven months ago. We had no organization, no money, very little national name recognition and were at 3 percent in the polls. Today, we have hundreds of thousands of volunteers in every state in the country, including some 5,600 here in New Hampshire. Today, without a super PAC, we have more than 800,000 individual contributors  more than any candidate in the history of our country at this point in a campaign for a first term. And, today, with your help, we are poised to pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of our country. We have come a long way in seven months. The people of this country want real change.I am running for president because we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means little to most Americans because  in a very rigged economy  the rich get much richer while almost everybody else becomes poorer. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time. It is the great economic issue of our time. It is the great political issue of our time. And it is an issue that, together, we will resolve.I am running for president because the great middle class of this country, once the envy of the world, has been disappearing for the last 40 years. Today, husbands and wives, single moms and even grandparents, are working longer hours for lower wages  and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation on earth.I am running for president because we need an economy that works for working families, not just for millionaires and billionaires.I am running for president because we need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years. We need pay equity for women workers. We need to pass the Paid Family and Medical Leave Act now in Congress. Paying $1.38 cents-a-week more is a good investment for families throughout this country who will receive 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. I am running for president because we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, invest $1 trillion in our roads and bridges and rail systems and create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs. I am running for president because when youth unemployment and underemployment is at 30 or 40 or 50 percent we need to invest in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We must not continue to have more people in jail than any other country on earth. We need major reforms in a very broken criminal justice system. We need to stop the killing of unarmed African-Americans by the police. We need to rethink the so-called War on Drugs and take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. We need to treat substance abuse as a serious health issue, not a criminal issue. We need to understand that in New Hampshire, Vermont and across this country, we have a major crisis in opiate addiction and we need a revolution in mental health treatment so that all people  regardless of their income  can get the help they need.I am running for president because 11 million undocumented people cannot continue living in the shadows. We need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.And loudly and clearly, we must tell the Republicans. No. We will not cut Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled veterans. We will expand those benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income and developing a new formula to determine cost-of-living adjustments.I am running for president because it is time that Wall Street, corporate America and the billionaire class understand that they cannot have it all, that they are going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes. It makes no sense that every year we lost $100 billion in tax revenue because large, profitable corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. It makes no sense that large profitable corporations like Pfizer think they can leave this country and become foreign companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, while they continue charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.I am running for president because, in a highly competitive global economy, we need to make certain that all of our young people who have the ability and qualifications are able to get a college income regardless of their family income. That is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and why we are going to substantially lower interest rates on student debt. And that is why we\'re going to pay for it with a tax on Wall Street speculation.I am running for president because as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. In America, millionaires and billionaires should not be able to buy elections. As president, I will fight to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections. I will also move to end the voter suppression imposed by many Republican governors. We should have one of the highest voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest.I am running for president because, in these difficult times, against vitriolic Republican rhetoric, we must protect a woman\'s right to choose and we must defend Planned Parenthood. And today let me send my condolences to the families of those who were killed in Friday\'s attack at Planned Parenthood in Colorado. We must also fight to make certain that our gay brothers and sisters have the right to marry.I am running for president because we must leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren. Despite what many of my Republican colleagues think, climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. It already is causing devastating problems throughout the planet. We must lead the world in combatting climate change, and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Republicans must start worrying about the planet they will leave their kids and grandchildren, not about the campaign contributions they get from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.Because climate change is the greatest environmental challenge of our time, I opposed the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline from day one. And that is why  right here in New Hampshire  I believe the Northeast Energy Direct pipeline that would carry fracked natural gas for 400 miles through 17 communities is a bad idea  and should be opposed. As everybody knows, we live in a difficult and dangerous world, and there are people out there who want to do us harm. As president, I will defend this nation  but I will do it responsibly. We do not need a quote-unquote ""tough foreign policy."" We need a quote-unquote ""smart foreign policy"" that achieves our goals.As a member of Congress, I voted against the war in Iraq in 2002. I listened carefully to what President Bush, Dick Cheney and others in the Bush administration were saying  and I didn\'t believe them. And it gives me no joy to tell you that much of what I feared would happen, in terms of the destabilization of the region, did happen.Today, we are confronted with a barbaric organization, called ISIS  an organization which must be destroyed  but I hope that we learned some of the very painful lessons of the past. And that is that we cannot and should not attempt to do it alone. We cannot and should not be trapped in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.We need to put together a broad coalition including the strong participation of the Muslim countries in the region. While the U.S. and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations  with the strong support of their global partners  the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Russia and Iran.These same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region. Jordan\'s King Abdallah II said in recent speech that terrorism is the ""greatest threat to our region"" and that Muslims must lead the fight against it. He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility, and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology.And let me congratulate King Abdallah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region.What does all of this mean? Well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.Equally important, and this is a point that must be made  countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE  countries of enormous wealth and resources  have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little.Saudi Arabia has the third largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by U.S. troops after the first Gulf War, has been a well-known source of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists. It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event  $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against ISIS. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups, including al Nusra and ISIS.All of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them. As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need.Let me conclude by reminding you all of one important political fact. Republicans win when the voter turnout is low. Democrats win when voter turnout is high. I believe from the bottom of my heart that our campaign is striking a nerve with working people, with young people, with many who have given up on the political process. I believe that our campaign is creating the kind of excitement needed to not only retain the White House but regain the Senate, do well in House races and win governors\' chairs all across this country. This is the campaign of the future. This is the campaign for real change. Please join the political revolution.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"December 16, 2015",b'Interview with Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC',"b""MITCHELL: Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joins me now. Senator, it's great to see you again. Thank you for being with us. SANDERS: My pleasure. MITCHELL: Let's talk about the tech area and what Clinton was proposing yesterday, because you also tweeted right before her speech that we can't return, in terms of security. You said I believe strongly we can protect our security -- excuse me, protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights. I worry we're moving to an Orwellian society. SANDERS: Well, that's right. Look, everybody knows that ISIS and al Qaeda and international terrorism are huge threats to this country. And I believe we've got to crush ISIS. I think we have to do it through an international coalition with Muslim troops on the ground supported by the United States, Western Europe, and Russia. And I think domestically we have got to do everything that we can technologically to make sure that we do not allow sleeper cells to develop, or we allow communication that takes place within ISIS groups. But on the other hand, this is what I do believe. We cannot as a nation going around saying we are a free society and yet undermine the Constitution of the United States of America. So if the question, Andrea, is do I believe we can crush ISIS, that we can destroy international terrorism, but that we can do it in a way that preserves our constitutional rights? I do. So no one is arguing that we should not be vigorous, but some of us believe that we do have a constitution and that freedom in this country is extremely important. MITCHELL: Do you believe that Silicon Valley should do more, should cooperate more with government, to try to take down some of these ISIS communications? SANDERS: I do, absolutely. And these guys understand the issue and have more influence and more understanding of what is going on than any other sector in the world. And they have got to play a vigorous role. But to destroy ISIS, we have got to do a number of things. And as I have said many times, Andrea, in terms of our foreign policy, I think that the war, the invasion of Iraq, was a horrendous mistake. I don't want to see that repeated; I don't want to see the United States alone going into the region. We need a strong coalition. King Abdullah is right when he talks about this being a struggle for the soul of Islam. Muslim boots on the ground supported by the United States. Here in this country, working with the high-tech companies to do everything that we can to shut off the communication capabilities of ISIS and sleeper groups. MITCHELL: I don't know if you had time to watch the debate last night or read or see any of the playback from the debate last night. I wanted to ask you about the Republicans as well. SANDERS: Sure. Yes. MITCHELL: Here's a bit of Ted Cruz trying to explain his carpet-bombing comments from earlier. [begin video clip]TED CRUZ: What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS. You would carpet-bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops. The object isn't to level a city; the object is to kill the ISIS terrorists. [end video clip]MITCHELL: Of course, the point is that ISIS is in cities like Mosul and Ramadi and Raqqa. So I'm not sure how you'd get around that. But what is your approach to the air war against ISIS?SANDERS: I believe we -- I agree with President Obama; we are engaging in air strikes right now. I think, as I mentioned a moment ago, here is my nightmare when I listen to a number of Republicans. And that is they have not learned the lesson from the war in Iraq. And they have not understood that the United States getting involved in perpetual never-ending warfare in that quagmire which is Syria and Iraq would be a disaster for our armed forces and a disaster for the taxpayers of this country. The most important thing we can do is, yes, we need U.S. air power. You know what? We need to coordinate with the Russians and U.K. and France. That needs to be a coordinated effort. But what is most important to me, if we are serious about destroying ISIS and winning this thing in a way that does not get us in perpetual warfare, is there must be a coalition also involving the Islam nations. King Abdullah of Jordan is absolutely right. This is a struggle for the soul of Islam and the Muslim nations themselves have got to be on the ground in a coordinated way destroying ISIS. MITCHELL: Well, there are two points there, because the Arab leaders, the Sunni Arab leaders have talked a big game, but as Ash Carter has been making it clear in his travels just now, and John Kerry, they are not delivering. They haven't even been flying missions, the Jordanians, the Bahranis, the Saudis. Plus do you really want to have the U.S. coordinating with Russia when Russia, according to Ash Carter just yesterday, is not targeting ISIS but targeting the anti-Assad rebels? SANDERS: The answer is, in my view, yes. Obviously we have huge differences with Russia. Obviously, we remain concerned about Assad. But the major focus right now in my view is to bring as many countries as possible, including the Muslim countries, including Russia -- let's not forget, Andrea, they lost hundreds of people on an airliner blown up by ISIS terror. I think we have got to bring together that coalition, understanding that there are geopolitical differences between us. But at the end of the day, if we do not learn the lesson of Iraq, that we cannot do it alone, we cannot be the policemen of the world, I think that would be a real tragedy. We need the coalition, yes. We do need to work with Russia. In fact, we need to work with Iran. The major focus bringing countries together, Muslim countries, Western countries, Russia, must be to destroy ISIS. That must be the focus of our efforts. MITCHELL: And I also wanted to ask you, because I know you're going with Keith Ellison, Congressman Ellison, to visit a mosque today, what is your message in doing that? And your reaction, of course, to Donald trump's ban on Muslims and some of the other anti-Muslim rhetoric coming from the other side? SANDERS: My reaction is that, as a nation, we have struggled for hundreds of years with racism and with other forms of bigotry. We have made progress. Finally in 1960 we elected a Catholic as president. We've elected an African-American as president. I do not want to see the frustration and the despair that so many people feel being picked apart by people like Donald Trump, preyed upon, in order to divide us again. A few months ago we were supposed to hate the Mexicans who according to Trump were all racists and criminals. And now we're supposed to hate the Muslims. That's not what this country is supposed to be about. We are strongest when we stand together. And remember, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Told us that we judge people based on their character, not the color of their skin, not their religion. So let's bring our people together to make sure that we have an economy that works for all people, that we are effective, effective in fighting international terrorism. Let's not let demagogues divide us up by our religion or the country that we come from. MITCHELL: Bernie Sanders, and we saw you with Killer Mike, so you're obviously leaving no stone unturned in your effort to reach out to as broad a coalition as possible. Senator Sanders, it's great to see you. Thank you very much for joining us today. SANDERS: Thank you."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"December 24, 2015","b'Interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN\'s ""New Day""'","b'CUOMO: Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us on NEW DAY, as always. SANDERS: My pleasure. CUOMO: So the Santa Claus of political polls has brought you a gift, the highest number you have reached so far in the new CNN poll, 34 percent. Hillary down eight, you up four. However, still a big gap. Hillary getting 50 percent, commanding lead. What do you make of it? SANDERS: Well, Chris, what I make of it is when we began this campaign, as you will recall, we were three, five percent in the polls. All of the pundits considered us a fringe candidacy. Today we perhaps are in the lead in New Hampshire. We\'re, I think, closing in here in Iowa. And your poll seems to indicate we have national momentum. So I think we have come a really long way in seven-and-a-half months, and we are feeling really good. We have a tremendous volunteer network all over this country. We are raising significant sums of money from small, individual contributions. So at this point, I have to tell you, we\'re feeling good. CUOMO: From the poll, we can glean that the big issue that seems to be holding you back with those potential voters is foreign policy. That\'s where Hillary Clinton has her biggest advantage. There is a perception that you do not have the stomach or the head for what it takes to beat ISIS. Your response, sir? SANDERS: Well, let me assure all the people in our country that I have the stomach, I have the head, I think we have the approach not only to beat ISIS, but to crush ISIS and to destroy ISIS. And what my view is that we have got to learn a lesson from Iraq. And that lesson is, it\'s not god enough just to be tough. We have got to be smart. And what that means is, we cannot do it alone. We cannot and should not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. What we need to do is bring together a grand coalition led, as King Abdullah of Jordan reminds us, by Muslim troops on the ground. What we should do along with the U.K., France, and Russia, and other major powers, is give the Muslim nations on the ground the support they need from the air. We should be training troops. We should be doing special forces when necessary. But ultimately, this war will be won and ISIS will be destroyed with our support and other great nations\' support taking on ISIS on the ground with Muslim troops. CUOMO: The pushback is this talk of coalition has gone nowhere. There\'s been years of Democrats trying to do it, haven\'t gotten it done. What needs to be done here at home is protect the homeland. These refugees you want to let in willy-nilly, they can hurt Americans, they increase American fears. You have to be tougher and put up more restrictions on immigration specifically of those refugees because there are terrorists in those numbers. SANDERS: Needless to say, I disagree with that assertion. What we want to do as we destroy ISIS, we do not want to give up the values that have made us the greatest country in the history of the world, which among other things has been a beacon of hope for people in deep distress. Obviously, it goes without saying that there must be a very, very strong vetting process. I think we have to do a better job at that. But I do not think that what America is about, and I speak as somebody whose dad came to this country at the age of 17, I do not think what America is about is turning our backs on people in distress. CUOMO: Donald Trump says we must look twice at those coming across the southern border. There are bad people among them. His numbers go up. He says we should think about banning all Muslims, at least temporarily. His numbers go up. He points at people like you and Hillary Clinton and says they are weak insiders and I am strong. And he is now the presumptive favorite in every poll in every metric we have. Is America ready for someone like Donald Trump and not ready for someone like you? SANDERS: Well, I think that the more the American people understand what Trump stands for, which, among other things, is his assertion that wages in America are too high. He wants to quote/unquote ""Make America Great."" And here\'s a guy who is a billionaire who thinks that wages in America are too high. He thinks we should not raise the minimum wage. He wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to his millionaire and billionaire friends. But I think creating and playing off the anxiety and the fears that the American people have, the fears about terrorism, the fears about our economy and becoming a demagogue about that, and then trying to get us to hate Mexicans or to hate Muslims, I think that is the strategy that is not what America is supposed to be about. What I believe, in contrast to Mr. Trump, is that we bring our people together to focus on the real issues, which is the disappearing middle class, massive income and wealth inequality, a corrupt campaign finance system, the fact that we\'re not effectively addressing the international crisis of climate change, the fact that our kids can\'t afford to go to college and moms and dads can\'t afford childcare, those are the issues we have to focus on. And we have to look at the greed, the greed of corporate America, the greed of Wall Street which has had such a terrible impact on our economy and on millions of people. So I\'m trying to bring people together to take on the wealthy and the powerful who have done so much to hurt the middle class. Trump is trying to play on fears and divide us up. At the end of the day, I believe that our approach will win. [commercial break]CUOMO: There are many who see what you\'re suggesting right now as an assault on the American dream, that you want to burden those who have been successful, even though they already pay 80 percent of the taxes in this country with a burden of paying for all of these free goodies that you want to give people. And that\'s not what America is about. In a capitalist society, you make money if you\'re good and you don\'t if you\'re not good enough. Everybody has the right to succeed or fail on their own merits. Why burden those who are successful with the needs of everybody else? SANDERS: Well, Chris, let\'s talk about reality. And here\'s the reality, that in the last 30 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. Trillions of dollars in wealth have gone from working families to the top 0.1 percent whose percentage of wealth that they now own has doubled. So what we are see also is a situation where the average American is working longer hours for low wages; 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. We have a massive difference in terms of wealth and income inequality in America today. And I want to change that. I think what this country is about is a great middle class, not a handful of billionaires receiving almost all of the new wealth and income. So, yes, I believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition-free. We pay for that. We pay for that by a tax on Wall Street speculation. Yes, I do believe that we should rebuild our tumbling infrastructure, create 13 million new jobs, rebuilding our bridges and our roads. We pay for that by doing away with all of these huge tax breaks, which allow corporate America to put their money in the Cayman Islands and in Bermuda and, in a given year, end up not paying a nickel in taxes. And, yes, I do believe that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in America who are doing phenomenally well while the middle class continues to disappear, yes, I do believe that they\'re going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes.CUOMO: But they say they do pay their fair share, they pay 80 percent and when they look at your suggestions, whether it\'s Glass-Stegall or what you want to do with Dodd-Frank or the interest rate move with the Fed, they say that you want to regulate them and tax them out of existence. And at the same time, you want to force them to lend to people that are risky, which is how they say we got into the mess back in 2008 in the first place.SANDERS: Well, Chris, that is wrong, wrong, wrong. This is the reality. Either we are going to be a nation in which we have a strong middle class or we are going to be a nation which moves to an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of very, very wealthy families control the economy and the political life of this country. Today -- and let the American people make this decision -- the top 0.1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Today, 20 of the wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, 150 million Americans. That is not what America is supposed to be about. That is not an economy that works for working families. That is a rigged economy. So bottom line here, Chris, is rich becoming much richer. Most Americans becoming poorer. The gap is growing wider. I intend to do something about it, whether corporate America or the billionaire class likes it or not.CUOMO: One political point: headlines were made about this data breach. The firewall goes down. The Sanders campaign winds up looking at data it wasn\'t supposed to. The campaign acts quickly; you get rid of somebody, you suspend some other people. Why doesn\'t it just end there? Why does this call for a broader investigation and wanting the Clinton campaign involved? It sounds like a smokescreen.SANDERS: Look, Chris, I hope that we can resolve this. I think the DNC understands, I think the Clinton people understand, we understand. This is not a great thing. We made a mistake. We have dealt with that mistake. We want to get it beyond us and I hope that that will happen. We\'re in negotiations right now with the DNC.CUOMO: But what\'s all of this other stuff about a broader investigation and let\'s see what else happened? Why that distraction? Why not -- you owned what happened? [crosstalk]SANDERS: Right, well, we did own what happened, Chris. But here\'s what happened, and everybody has got to understand this, there has not only been one breach recently, there was another breach. And in that breach, we also ended up with information from the Clinton campaign. And our people went running to the DNC and said what is going on here?You\'ve got a problem. So, I want to make sure we understand what\'s happened in the past and that it does not happen again. This serves nobody\'s purpose. Let\'s end it.CUOMO: That\'s just the only piece I don\'t understand. What else do you think might have happened? What have you heard or what do you think you can show that adds to the understanding? SANDERS: Well, what we believe, what we know has happened is this is at least the second breach. There was another breach a couple months ago. Our campaign ended up with information from Clinton\'s campaign and we went to the DNC right away. Nobody looked at it. Well, if there\'s a breach, it\'s a breach as a whole information you get to both sides. So we would like to take a look at that. We\'re not making any accusations. But I think it\'s fair to understand why these breaches occur and what the DNC is going to do to make sure that they do not happen again.[commercial break]CUOMO: You started off this interview using Donald Trump as a point of contrast. His popularity at this point is inarguable. How he is becoming popular has become a source of a lot of argument and criticism. The most recent volley, what he said about Hillary Clinton\'s break during the debate. What he said about how he characterized her loss to Barack Obama. You\'re a guy who grew up in Brooklyn. You probably know the word that he used. Maybe you never heard it used as a verb before. But why is it working so well for him? Well, Chris, you\'re going to have to ask the media precisely why. I mean, Trump is a smart guy. He is a media guy. He ran -- you know, he did a TV show. I\'ll give you one example, all right, a recent study showed that on ""ABC Evening News,"" Trump, over a period of time, got 81 minutes of time. Bernie Sanders got 20 seconds. Now you tell me why.CUOMO: Well -- SANDERS: And I think it has to do with the fact that Trump is very smart. He knows that media is not so interested in the serious issues facing this country. They love, you know, bombastic remarks. They love silly remarks. If he says that somebody is sweating, my God, that is a major story and all that silly business, the personal attacks, that kind of works. So I think this is more of an indictment of the media, actually, than it is of Trump.CUOMO: Yes, I don\'t see it. Look, do we cover him more? Yes, why? He\'s number one in the polls. He\'s highly relevant. He drives the discussion.SANDERS: But, Chris, Chris, but, Chris, explain to me how he becomes number one. He boasts of the fact -- this is what he says, he says, hey, I don\'t even have to pay for commercials. The media\'s going to put me on all of the time. Explain to me -- and I know CNN may been different here. And you have been, you know, very generous with me. But you explain to me how a major network in the evening news has 80 minutes of Trump, 20 seconds of Bernie Sanders. Does that make sense to anybody?CUOMO: Well, look -- SANDERS: In many ways, I think it\'s fair to say -- yes, go ahead.CUOMO: There\'s no question that Trump drives ratings and that\'s always an influence in everything that we do. Or if you weren\'t as handsome and charismatic as you are, Senator, maybe you wouldn\'t get the time that you get.But you can\'t just wipe off all of this popularity that he has with a growing base of the GOP. They\'re putting him first in the polls. [crosstalk]CUOMO: They\'re say they hate the media. They just love Trump.SANDERS: Chris, this is what I think is going on. I think that Trump is very effectively playing to the fears and the anxieties that millions of people in this country have -- and have legitimately so.We\'re all concerned about the possibility of a terrorist attack against this country. We\'re all concerned about ISIS. We\'re all concerned about a disappearing middle class. You have in this country people who don\'t understand why it is that with increased productivity and technology, they\'re working longer hours for low wages. They\'re worried to death about their kids. They\'re worried about the economy. And Trump comes along and he says I\'ve got the solution. And what the solution is is Mexicans coming into this country. Let\'s throw them all out. That will solve all of our problems. It\'s Muslims, they\'re all terrorists. We have to hate them. Well, that is not the solution to our problems. That is simply scapegoating minorities, playing one group off against another. It\'s what demagogues have always done. But what we have got to do as a people is come together and say, yes, why is it that the middle class is in fact disappearing and almost all new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent? Let\'s talk about it. And sometimes, Chris, to be honest with you, it can\'t be done in a 6-second sound bite. Why is it that we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth? Why is it that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth?Why is it that we\'re the only nation on Earth that doesn\'t have health care for all people as a right?These are the kind of debates that we have to have. And I would urge and beg the media to allow us to have that debate and not just pick up on Trump\'s one-liners. CUOMO: Well, Senator Sanders, as you know, that\'s what we\'re doing right now. That\'s what NEW DAY is about. We always appreciate you being on the show.SANDERS: And I do know that, Chris. Chris, I do know that and I appreciate the good work you\'re doing.CUOMO: You\'re not easy to get. I\'ve got people hashtag, #FeelingTheBern, coming after me, saying you don\'t have Sanders on enough. I can\'t get you on. You\'re too busy running around the country. Tell your people, lay off.SANDERS: Well, all right. We will -- we will do our best to be with you.CUOMO: You\'re always welcome to talk about what matters on this show. Senator, best to you and the family. Thank you for being on NEW DAY.SANDERS: All right and a happy -- Merry Christmas and a Happy Holidays to everybody.CUOMO: Appreciate it.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 3, 2016","b'Interview with Martha Raddatz of ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b'RADDATZ: Bernie Sanders is hard at work on the campaign trail this holiday weekend. And he joins me this morning from New Hampshire. Happy new year, Senator Sanders.We noticed that today is the 25th anniversary of your first day in Congress. Twenty five years, what do you say to critics who say the country needs a president from outside Washington and not a career politician?SANDERS: Well, what I say is if you study my record, I\'m not exactly a career politician. Martha, during my tenure in the Congress, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest from Wall Street to the insurance companies to the pharmaceutical industry to the military- industrial complex. What my campaign is about is standing up to the billionaire class today, and making certain that we do not continue to see the decline of the American middle class, where people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. That is the issue that I find that the American people are most concerned about, the decline of the middle class, massive income and wealth inequality, and a corrupt campaign finance system.RADDATZ: Well, let me take you back to 1990 on election night. This is what you said. ""We need a mass movement of tens of millions of people prepared to say that we want national health care, that we want the millionaires and multi-national corporations who are not paying their fair share, to pay their fair share.""That sounds an awful lot like Bernie Sanders 2015, but you haven\'t really been able to create that mass movement. How can we imagine that you\'ll do it now?SANDERS: Well, Martha, we\'re doing pretty well. You know, I started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls. There were some polls that had me out recently at 39 percent. Come to my meetings. They\'re huge all over the United States of America.And what we are seeing is mass dissatisfaction on the part of the middle class. We\'re seeing people who are really upset that they can\'t afford to send their kids to college. They can\'t afford childcare. The rich are getting richer; almost everybody else is getting poorer. And what people are saying is, you know, it\'s absurd. That with massive income...RADDATZ: Let me turn to Iowa.SANDERS: ...and wealth inequality...RADDATZ: Let me turn to Iowa, Senator Sanders. This is what you recently said at a campaign stop.[begin video clip]SANDERS: Let me tell you a secret, don\'t tell anybody. I don\'t want to get Secretary Clinton nervous. [cheers] I think we\'re going to win here in Iowa. [cheers][end video clip]RADDATZ: I don\'t know how nervous Secretary Clinton is about that. She has consistently led in the polls in Iowa through the latter part of 2015. What can you possibly do to try to stop that momentum in just four weeks?SANDERS: Martha, should have been with us in our last trips to Iowa. The turnouts that we\'re seeing in big towns and in small towns are extraordinary. The enthusiasm is very, very strong. I think that people are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics. And they are also tired of a corrupt campaign finance system in super PACs that allows billionaires to purchase elections. That\'s not what the American people want.And one of the manifestations of that is the kind of incredible fundraising that we have been doing in terms of small, individual donations. We have 2.5 million small, individual contribution-style campaign. That is more than any campaign in the history of the United States of America, and I think that speaks to the enthusiasm and support that we\'re getting at the grassroots.RADDATZ: Hillary Clinton has Bill Clinton joining her on the campaign trail there in New Hampshire this week. Donald Trump and Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus think Bill Clinton\'s sexual history is fair game. Do you?SANDERS: No, I don\'t. I think, you know, we have enormous problems facing this country and I think we got more things to worry about than Bill Clinton\'s sexual life. I think -- interestingly enough, maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change, understand that climate change is not a hoax, as he believes that it is, that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country, which he opposes, and maybe we should not be giving huge tax breaks to fellow billionaires like Donald Trump.So I think maybe he should focus on those things.RADDATZ: You have had some very harsh words for Donald Trump recently and you said you wanted to stay away from personal attacks...SANDERS: Yes.RADDATZ: ...in this campaign.SANDERS: Right.RADDATZ: Some of the things you\'ve said, like calling him a pathological liar, have been pretty personal.SANDERS: Yes. The truth is I do not get engaged in personal attacks, but Trump really is over the edge. He has attacked me very ferociously and has called me a liar because I point that out, that nobody else has seen on television thousands of Muslims celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers.Time after time, this guy just comes up with things off the top of his head that are lies. And somebody has got to say that he is a pathological liar.RADDATZ: Senator Sanders, President Obama is reportedly considering executive action that would require unlicensed gun dealers to get licensed by the ATF and conduct background checks on potential buyers. Recent polling shows three in four Americans thinks it\'s important that there be bipartisan consensus before implementing gun control. Is an executive action that circumvents Congress the right way to do it?SANDERS: Well, I wish that we could get bipartisan action on gun safety legislation. I think the American people have been horrified by the mass shootings we\'ve seen over the last couple of years. What I think we need to do, among many other things, is do away with the so- called gun show loophole where people are -- do not have to go through the instant background check.Martha, there is a wide consensus, overwhelming majority of the American people believe we should expand and strengthen the instant background checks so that people who should not have guns, are i.e. criminals or people with mental issues, mental health issues, should not guns. I think that\'s what the president is trying to do and I think that will be the right thing to do.RADDATZ: And very quickly, Senator Sanders, on the campaign trail last week, you said that the retaking of Ramadi in Iraq is a model for destroying ISIS and that training of Iraqi troops may have turned things around. Eighty percent of the reason Ramadi is falling is because of coalition air strikes, though. That\'s what you think should continue?SANDERS: Right. I think it has to be Muslim troops on the ground who are fighting for the soul of Islam, supported by U.S., French, U.K., German, other major powers, and using our air superiority.RADDATZ: Might be very difficult to get those ground troops, but thank you very much, Senator Sanders.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 5, 2016",b'Remarks on Wall Street and the Economy in New York City',"b'The American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans  half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.Millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.Greed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.So, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year\'s Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.We will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.While President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionairesEnding ""Too Big To Fail""That means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of ""too big to fail.""We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy  making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were ""too big to fail."" Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.If Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say ""break \'em up."" And he would be right.And, here\'s how I will accomplish that.Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a ""Too-Big-to Fail"" list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.Within one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.And, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let\'s be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.In my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other ""too- big-to-fail"" banks into pieces. And that\'s exactly what we need to do. And that\'s what I commit to do as president.Now, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.Secretary Clinton is wrong.Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks  something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.Let\'s not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.And, let\'s not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn\'t just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: ""Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully  Hillary Clinton\'s proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street\'s excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can\'t be watered down  busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.""Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to ""cut it out"" and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to ""cut it out."" The reality is that Congress doesn\'t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.Ending Too-Big-To-JailIt is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don\'t vote. They don\'t believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don\'t think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair  and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions  somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.That will change under my administration. ""Equal Justice Under Law"" will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.The business model on Wall Street is fraudIt seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.Some people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn\'t illegal?Let me help shatter that myth today.Since 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.Here are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.In August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.In November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years\' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba.Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.CNN Headline, May 20, 2015: ""5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies."" Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.Headline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): ""Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices."" The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.Headline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): ""Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.""Headline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): ""In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy,"" which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.Headline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): ""How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico\'s murderous drug gangs."" This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: ""Wachovia\'s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.""Yet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank\'s $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.And, if that\'s not bad enough, here\'s another one.Headline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: ""J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures."" Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.And, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.According to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.More than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.Nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.Twenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.Here\'s what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: ""If you ain\'t cheating, you ain\'t trying.""Here\'s what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, ""Let\'s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.""This country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street.Under my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.As president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.Tax on Wall Street SpeculationAnd, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy. We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it\'s Wall Street\'s turn to help the middle class.Reforming Credit Rating AgenciesWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings  ratings that they knew were bogus.And, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.Under my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.Cap Credit Card Interest Rates and ATM FeesIf we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.In my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.The Bible has a term for this practice. It\'s called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.Today, we don\'t need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don\'t need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.Today, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.We must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM.Big banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.Allow Post Offices to Offer Banking ServicesWe also need to give Americans affordable banking options.The reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go? You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable. We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that\'s what I will fight for.Reforming the Federal ReserveFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed\'s boards and handpick its members and staff.Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.ConclusionFinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.What this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together  black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American  young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions. Yes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.Yes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don\'t have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change. Yes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.And so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can\'t crash our economy again.Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I\'m president? You better believe it.Thank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 13, 2016",b'Interview with Thomas Roberts of MSNBC',"b'ROBERTS: Joining me now from the capital is presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. Sir, thanks for your time today and I want to get right to this because I need to point out that this week\'s NBC news polling still has you trailing in Iowa by three points. But say you win in Iowa and you get a lock in New Hampshire, do you have the campaign infrastructure and the support from the DNC to take this all the way? SANDERS: Well, maybe not the support from the DNC, but we have the support from the American people. Thomas, as you know, we have raised more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States of America. 2.5 million contributions averaging $27 a piece. So we are getting small contributions from the middle class, from working families. Not only do we have enough money to wage a very strong campaign in Iowa and in New Hampshire, we are working hard in Nevada, in South Carolina, and in many other states as well. So to answer your question, I think the American people are tired of establishment politics, establishment economics. They want to see leadership stand up to the billionaire class. Our message is resonating all across this country. And yes, we have the energy, we have the funding to take this to the convention. ROBERTS: I want to talk about the legal battle with the DNC coming up in a moment, but first the next Democratic debate is this Sunday on NBC News and recently Hillary Clinton hit you on the issue of guns and health care. I want to play you what she told NBC\'s Savannah Guthrie about those points. Take a look. [begin video clip]HILLARY CLINTON: One of the big ones, as you\'re aware, is on gun safety where Senator Sanders has been a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby and I have been standing against them for a long time.We have a difference on health care. I want to build on the Affordable Care Act. We have to make some changes because we have to improve it. He\'s been talking very generally about a single payer system. He\'s introduced legislation nine times that have laid out a very specific plan to take everybody\'s health care and roll it into great big bundle and hand it to the states.[end video clip]ROBERTS: So, let\'s start with guns on this issue... SANDERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me just start off by saying that Secretary Clinton is really quite inaccurate on both of those charges. I have a D-minus - D-minus...[crosstalk]SANDERS: ... voting record from the NRA. ROBERTS: Correct. SANDERS: In 1988 I probably lost a congressional election because I said maybe we should not have assault weapons being sold in America. So, to say that I\'m kind of a supporter of the NRA is really a mean spirited, and unfair and inaccurate statement. ROBERTS: Then do you regret or apologize for voting to give gun manufacturers immunity protection from lawsuits? SANDERS: There were things in that bill that I supported, there are things in that bill that do not make sense and are wrong. And as I have said for the last several months, I am willing to absolutely take a look at the onerous parts of that bill. But let me also say, you know, I have asked Secretary Clinton, and let me repeat it right now, in 2008 when she was running against Senator Barack Obama, he proposed expanding -- extending the life of Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income. We\'ve taken that idea. And we say that we should expand benefits so that people in this country who are trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year, elderly people, disabled vets, should see an increase in their Social Security benefits by lifting the cap above people making $250,000 a year or more. I am waiting to hear whether Secretary Clinton has changed her views from 2008 and whether or not she will support an expansion of Social Security benefits for millions of elderly people who just cannot make it on $12,000 OR $13,000 a year. ROBERTS: Senator Sanders, let me ask you, though, about the issue with the ACA, and Obamacare and the fact that you\'d like to rip that up and get back to the beginning.SANDERS: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. ROBERTS: A single payer public health care system, correct? SANDERS: Well, you know what, yes. Medicare for all single payer system. You know, it\'s funny, Thomas. Again in 2008, you may recall that then Senator Clinton was attacking then Senator Barack Obama because she supported universal health care, health care for everybody. Well, I support that as well. And I believe that the most effective way to provide health care to every man, woman, and child in a cost effective way is through a Medicare for all singer payer system. Now she\'s attacking me because I support universal health care. In 2008 she was attacking Obama because Obama was attacking her because she supported universal health care. I would hope that Secretary Clinton will tell the American people does she support universal health care. Is she prepared to end the absurdity of the American people paying far, far more per capita on health care...[crosstalk]ROBERTS: We know that she\'s on the stump talking about the fact that you\'d like to rip up Obamacare, which would...SANDERS: It\'s not rip it up.ROBERTS: ... make one assume that she supports it and would let the ACA stand if she were elected.SANDERS: But the ACA...ROBERTS: How would you pay for it? SANDERS: First of all, we would pay for it obviously through increased premiums. Right now the American people are spending $3 trillion a year on health care, and a lot of that money is going into the private insurance companies and the drug companies which is why we pay far more per capita than do the people of any other country. When you get rid of the private insurance companies, when you force the drug companies to lower their prices, you can provide health care for a middle class family and save thousands and thousands of dollars compared to the outrageous cost of health care today. So, yes, we will take away and do away with private health insurance premiums and move that to public health insurance premiums. Health care is not free, but we can do a lot better in lowering the cost of health care for a middle class family than is currently the case. ROBERTS: Sir, I want to talk to you, though, when it comes to money, we had the vice president recently praise your efforts regarding income inequality. But he also said that Clinton was, quote, ""relatively new to that fight."" Do you take that as a bit of an endorsement for your style on that issue from the vice president? SANDERS: Well, you know, I have known Joe Biden for many, many years. He comes from a working class background as I do. And both of us understand that it is totally absurd that the top one-tenth of 1 percent today in America own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That is disgraceful. I have been a leader in the fight to end income and wealth inequality. Joe Biden has been strong on that issue and I\'m very, very glad that he has noticed that this is an issue that I have been leading on for many, many years. ROBERTS: When we look at the race on the right, and we just had Donald Trump on. He sends you his warmest regards. SANDERS: I\'m sure that he does. ROBERTS: He does. But if it were a match up between the two of you, and the fact that he\'s gotten very asymmetrical with his campaign attacks to Hillary Clinton over her husband\'s past indiscretions, is it any sign to you that you\'re not being attacked...SANDERS: Well, let me just say this...ROBERTS: ... by an asymmetrical way and that they think you could be a weaker contender in the general? SANDERS: Well, I would suggest that Mr. Trump take a look at all of the recent polling that\'s been out there, not just the polling in New Hampshire and the polling in Iowa, which in match ups between Trump and myself I defeat him and defeat him very handily. I think, Thomas, that the last New Hampshire poll had me defeating him by 19 points in New Hampshire. The last national Quinnipiac poll had me beating him 13 points nationally. I would love to run, frankly, against Donald Trump. His views on so many issues and his attitude toward minorities in this country is so different than mine. It would give me great joy not only to run against him, I think we would beat him by a pretty significant margin. ROBERTS: You bring up New Hampshire. Yesterday Chelsea Clinton made her debut there campaigning for her mom. She was on the attack about you. Do you think that she\'s a powerful voice among her mother\'s campaign? SANDERS: Well, you know, all I will say, I can\'t give a statement on that, I don\'t know. But I think what she said was wrong. And one of the points that she made is that a Medicare for all single payer system, which would guarantee health care to all people, her point was, well, in states where we have Republican governors, that plan would not be implemented. That is factually incorrect. And I hope the Clinton campaign stops saying that. The way the legislation that we have introduced in the past was written, and obviously is what we believe in, is that if a Republican governor doesn\'t want it, it will be implemented by the federal government. This is a plan for 50 states. Bottom line here is, we are the only major country on earth that doesn\'t guarantee health care to all people. 29 million people still have no health insurance. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and we end up spending far, far, far more per capita on health care than do the people of any other country. That\'s got to change and I do believe strongly in universal health care through a Medicare for all single payer system. ROBERTS: Senator Bernie Sanders, sir, I\'m going to let you get back to work because I know you have a busy day ahead of you, but I do appreciate your time and I hope to speak to you again soon. Thank you. SANDERS: Thank you very much, Thomas.ROBERTS: Absolutely.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 17, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News\' ""Meet the Press""'","b""TODD: Let me start with one of the issues that is likely to come up tonight at the debate and that's the issue of gun safety. Last night in what the Clinton campaign is referring to as a debate-eve conversion you came out in favor of essentially repealing immunity for gun manufacturers when it comes to being held liable for gun deaths. That's a switch of your positions. What brought you to this conclusion?SANDERS: Well, not really. You know, I understand that Secretary Clinton and her campaign understand that, you know, they're losing ground. We've started this campaign off at 3 percent in the polls and now we're closing in, in Iowa. And we're doing really well in New Hampshire. So I think in the next few weeks you're going to see a lot of nonsense being thrown around. Look, I have --TODD: This is nonsense -- I mean you did change your position on this.SANDERS: What I said -- what I said Chuck -- what I said several months ago, having a D-minus voting record from the NRA having voting to ban assault weapons way back in 1988, yes, that was a piece of legislation that I wanted to relook at.But what that legislation had among other things is a prohibition on armor-piercing ammunition designed to kill police officers. It had language in it for a child lock safety for our kids -- important provision. There were things in it that I did o not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it.TODD: All right. Another thing that's going to come up on the issue of gun safety is the issue of a waiting period. The Clinton campaign is hitting you for supporting only a three-day waiting period or instant background checks and not being in favor supportive of something longer like a five-day or seven-day window. And the reason this is being brought up is that if Dylann Roof -- the man who killed those nine folks in Charleston last year -- if there had been a longer waiting period he might have been prevented from buying a gun.SANDERS: Look, what we saw here in Charleston is a tragedy of unspeakable dimensions. I sit in prayer with people that takes out a gun and shoots nine people. I hope we don't have to politicize that issue. I believe very strongly in instant background checks. I think we have to expand it. I think we have to make sure 100 percent that we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have that, people with criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. That has been my view from day one.But you know, Chuck, I think the reason that the Clinton campaign is getting defensive is they see that we have the momentum. They see that the issues that we are talking about, a disappearing middle-class and almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, a corrupt campaign finance system where people like Secretary Clinton can raise millions of dollars through super PACs. Those are kind of issues which they don't want to discuss.So tonight we're going to be discussing a lot of issues and the main issue for me is why the rich get richer, almost everybody else gets poorer and the fact that we have got to stand up to the billionaire class and change those dynamics.TODD: So you're not in favor of a longer background check? A five, seven-day background check?SANDERS: We are willing to look at anything that makes sense that keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. But I'm not going to be defensive on that issue.I lost an election in 1988, probably lost an election because I had the courage back then to say that assault weapons should not be sold in America.TODD: Let me ask you quickly about the Iran deal. Is Iran still an enemy of the United States given what's going on? The improved diplomatic relations?SANDERS: Well, you know, it's funny. If you think back to I think it was 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama. She was critical of him, a question was asked to Obama and said would you sit down and talk to the Iranians? And he said yes, I would. The point being that you talk to your adversaries, you don't run away from that.Secretary Clinton I think called him naive -- turns out that Obama was right. Mo clearly we have many, many issues and many concerns with Iran but clearly also we want to improve our relationship with this very powerful country.I think the agreement to make certain Iran does not get a nuclear weapon was a huge step forward. The fact we had the prisoner release today was a good important step forward. So I hope that we can continue to go forward to improve relations with Iran.TODD: All right. Senator Sanders -- I'll leave it there. We look forward to seeing you, Secretary Clinton and Martin O'Malley on stage tonight on NBC. Thank you, sir."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 21, 2016","b'Remarks in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire'","b""Thank you! [applause] Whoa, thank you. Thank you so much for -- love you, too! [applause] Thank you so much for coming out this evening. This is a wonderful, wonderful turnout. Let me also thank my dear friend Bill McKibben. I trust all of you know that Bill is not only an outstanding writer, he really is a great writer, and not only the subject matter that he deals with so thoroughly, he really writes very, very well, but Bill is also not just one of the leaders of the movement to combat climate change in this country, Bill is one of the international leaders. He founded, as you know, 350.org, which has played a role all over the world in bringing people to stand up in the fight to save our planet. [applause] And when Bill talks about organizing at the grassroots level, there is nobody I know who does it better than he does. About a year- and-a-half ago, I think it was, we were in New York City, 400,000 people, a lot of young people, a lot of people of color, people from all over the world were marching to demand that Congress and governments all over this planet recognize the seriousness of what we are going through now and move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause] So when you hear from Bill, you're hearing from a guy who is an international leader on one of the most important issues facing our country. And I'm going to get into that in a moment. Let me say a few words about our campaign, before I get into the thrust of my remarks. We began this campaign about nine months ago. And when we began we had no money, no organization and, frankly, my name recognition around much of the country was not very, very high. And a lot of the media pundits were saying, well, you know, Bernie Sanders combs his hair outstandingly. [laughter] And I want some recognition. I just got a haircut here. That's worth something, you know? [applause] My wife said enough is enough, you gotta get a haircut, so we did that. [laughter] And you know, and I was considered, this campaign was considered to be a fringe candidacy. Interesting, but not significant. Well, I think a lot has happened in nine months. [applause] With your help, we've got a real shot to win here in New Hampshire. We're are doing better and better in Iowa. A recent poll, actually a poll a few hours old, had us ahead in Iowa. [applause] And I think it is fair to say that we have a lot of momentum. In my view, we will win in Iowa, we will win in New Hampshire if -- and here is the big if -- if there is a large voter turnout, if working people and young people and older people decide that it is important enough to make a statement, and that's what your state does, that's what Bill was saying, you're making a statement that will be heard not only all across our country, it will be heard all over the world. And the statement is that we have had enough of establishment politics, establishment economics, we need to move in a new and bold direction. [applause] Now, when you come within a week or two weeks or two-and-a-half weeks of an election, suddenly you start hearing a lot of strange things being said. And one of the things that my opponent, Secretary Clinton, is saying is that Bernie Sanders is unelectable, he just cannot defeat a Republican candidate in a general election. So it gives me some pleasure to give you some facts that suggest that that might not just be the case. [applause] Here in your state of New Hampshire, a state where people know Hillary Clinton very well, she ran here in 2008, she's running hard now, a state where people know me well, when we were compared in a recent poll from CNN and WMUR just the other day, in terms of how well we would do against Republican candidates, this is the result from New Hampshire. Secretary Clinton loses to Marco Rubio by one point; we beat him by 18 points. [applause] Secretary Clinton and Governor Kasich are tied; we beat Kasich by 21 points. [applause] And here is my favorite. [laughter] Because it deals with my good, good friend Donald Trump. Secretary Clinton defeats Mr. Trump by nine points, we beat him by 23 points. [applause] All of which -- all of which -- reaffirms my love for the smart people in the state of New Hampshire. But it's not just New Hampshire. The results are not quite as strong, but they're also strong in Iowa where we do a lot better than Secretary Clinton against Republicans, in polls, and also nationally. There was an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that came out the other day. Secretary Clinton defeated Trump by 10 points; we defeated him by 15 points. [applause] And the main -- even more importantly than polls, polls go up and down, but even more importantly is the thrust of our campaign. Here is a political fact, and the fact is that Republicans win national elections when people are demoralized and they don't come out and vote. And last year in the midterm election, Republicans won a landslide victory, they won a huge victory all over this country because 63 percent of the American people didn't vote, 80 percent of young people didn't vote. And what is going on in this campaign, I think any objective observer would note, that the campaign that has the excitement, that has the energy, that's bringing working people, that's bringing young people in, a campaign that has spoken to 450,000 already, all over America, that has spoken to over 27,000 people in meetings like this in New Hampshire, that our campaign is the campaign of excitement, energy, momentum, which will result in a large voter turnout, which mean victories for the Democrats from the top on down. [applause] And let me also say this. When we began this campaign, as I said, we didn't have money and we didn't have an organization, name recognition not all that high. And one of the problems that we had to face right away is the fact that, as all of you know, to run for president of the United States, sad but true, you need to raise an unbelievable amount of money. And what the pundits and the experts were saying, well, the only way that a candidate in this day and age with this disastrous Citizens United decision, the only way that a candidate can raise the kinds of money you need is to set up a super PAC. And the truth is that my Democratic opponents set up super PACs and that almost all Republican opponents set up super PACs. But to my mind, as somebody who does not represent the billionaire class, does not represent corporate America, I decided that I was not going to establish a super PAC, I was not going to ask them for millions and millions of dollars in money. [applause] But then, you know, that's a very lovely statement, but that still doesn't bring you any money. So how do you do it? Well, what we did is kind of an old-fashioned way. We reached out to the middle class and working families of this country. And what happened is -- and this I would not have in a million years dreamed that we could do. In the last nine months, we have received 2 1/2 million individual contributions. [applause] That is more than any candidate in the history of the United States of America, up to this point in a campaign. [applause] And at a time when candidates are so proudly leaving rooms with millionaires and coming out with 5 million or 10 million bucks, our average contribution is $27. [applause] So what all of that means is we have already accomplished something enormous, and that is we have shown the American people that despite this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, despite all of the super PACs, one can still run a strong and, I believe, winning campaign based on the support from working families and the middle class. And I'm very proud of that. [applause] And today in New Hampshire, we have many thousands of volunteers, and we have a wonderful, wonderful organization. And with your help, if we can get a good voter turnout on February 9th, I believe we can win this state and I ask for your help to make that happen. [applause] Now, one of the reasons that I think our campaign is doing well is because we are treating the American people as if they were intelligent human beings. [laughter] Now, that's a radical idea for a politician. You know, when we we are often seen on TV in six-second sound bites or when the media will tell you what the most important issues are, we have chosen to go a different direction. And what we have tried to say is the most important issues facing us is not what appears on television tomorrow, the most important issues are the issues that you are struggling with today in terms of your lives, your children's lives and your parent's lives. Those are the issues that we have got to address, whether the media finds them interest or exciting or not. [applause] Now, what do I mean by that? I'll just give you a few examples, OK? A couple of weeks ago I was in Nevada. A woman, early 30s, I think, came up to me. She has a 5-year-old child and she said, Bernie, I am trying to make it with a 5-year-old kid, earning $10.45 an hour and paying off my student debt. And tears started running down her cheeks. I don't know if I can do that, I don't know what happens to my child. In my state, and it's no different here in New Hampshire, we have many, many seniors who are trying to get by on 11, 12, $13,000 a year Social Security. And if you just do the arithmetic, you can't get by on 11, $12,000 Social Security. And some of those seniors are literally cutting up their medicine, their pills in half, which is not a good thing to do, but they don't have the money they need to buy the medicine that they require. I fought very hard to expand the Meals on Wheels program; Republicans resisted. But all over this country, there are seniors who are on waiting lists trying to get Meals on Wheels because they're having a hard time eating at least one decent, nutritious meal a day. [applause] And what a disgrace that is. And then I go all over the country and I talk to people. Young people stand up. I spoke to a kid the other day. Senator, I will be graduating college very shortly. I'm going to be $60,000 in debt, having a hard time finding a job. I'm supposed to pay back $1,200 a month. I have no clue as to how I can do that. Saw another young man, late 20s, two kids, married. He's working in sustainable energy. He's devoted to the environment. He says he's paying 53 percent of his limited income on student debts. Talk to moms and dads all over New Hampshire, all over Vermont, all over this country, who desperately want quality, affordable child care for the little ones, can't find that. Talk to 55-year-old workers who are scared to death about going to work someday and finding the employer say, Joe, thanks for working for us for 30 years, but we can hire somebody at half your age for half the wages. Talk to the kids graduating college and have a hard time finding jobs commensurate with their education. Talk to people, and I do all of the time, who are working two or three jobs, trying to cobble together some income and some health care. Talk to husbands and wives whose marriages are being stressed out and strained because people are working so hard and they don't have enough time to spend with their kids. Now, the truth is, although my Republican friends deny it, our economy today is obviously today in a lot better shape than it was when George W. Bush left office. [applause] When Bush left office, we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month. That is unbelievable. Our deficit was a record-breaking $1.4 trillion. And oh, by the way, the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse. Other than that, we were in really good shape. And these people have the nerve to attack Barack Obama. [applause] So we have made progress. We've cut the deficit by more than two-thirds. The world's financial system is now, at this moment anyhow, not on the verge of collapse. And we are growing jobs rather than hemorrhaging jobs. But having said that, what we must also be honest about and that is is to acknowledge that under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations for the last 40 years, the great middle class of this country, the middle class that was once the envy of the entire world, has been disappearing -- has been disappearing. If you are a male worker in the middle of the American economy, half the people on top, half the people below, you are earning today in inflation-adjusted-for dollars 700 bucks a year less than you made 41 years ago. Productivity expanding, technology exploding, and yet you're making $700 less than you made 41 years ago. If you are a woman, you are making a thousand dollars less in adjusted income than you made in 2007. Well, that's the reality. Now, the reality is also and why people are so angry is they're working harder and harder, many of them are slipping into poverty, everyone is worried about the future of their kids -- which, by the way, if we do not get our act together, the kids, our kids, will be the first generation in modern American history to have a lower standard of living than we do. So what people are asking is, what's going on? Technology exploding, global economy, worker productivity going on, but the middle class for 40 years has been in decline and more and more people living in poverty. Well, I would suggest to you that a lot of why that is happening has to do with the fact that we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families of our country to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, trillions of dollars that were owned by the middle class are now gone while the top one- tenth of 1 percent has seen a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own. And to my mind, together, as we try to turn this country around, one of the areas that we absolutely must focus on is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality we are experiencing today. [applause] Now, let me just blur you for a moment with a few facts, but I think it's important for you to know it. They don't usually get reported in the media, but it's important that people know it. And that is, in America today the top one-tenth of 1 percent, not 1 percent, one-tenth of 1 percent, owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Got that? Today in America, the wealthiest 20 people -- 20 people -- that's the front row here, not these guys, though... [laughter] ...the wealthiest 20 people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 150 million people. Today in America, one family, the Walton family that owns Walmart, one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. And by the way, when I walk about the Walton family, let me mention to you that I know that you hear a lot from politicians about welfare reform. Right? We hear a lot about welfare reform, people ripping off the welfare system. So let me tell you who the major welfare recipient family in America is. It's not some poor family down the road. The major welfare recipient in America is the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America. And they are the major recipient because you as taxpayers are paying taxes for Medicaid and food stamps and affordable housing that Walmart employees need because the Walton family is not paying them a living wage. [applause] So when we talk about a rigged economy, an economy where the rich get much richer while almost everybody else gets poorer, it seems a little bit absurd that the middle class has got to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country. [applause] So I say to the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, get off of welfare, start paying your workers a decent wage. [applause] That's wealth. When we talk about income, despite the fact that so many of our people are working such long hours, turns out that 58 percent of all new income generated goes to the top 1 percent. So you ready for a radical idea? Why not. What about creating an economy that works for working families and not for the 1 percent? [applause] But when we talk about the economy, it is not only the grotesque level, and it is a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, it is also about jobs. Now, every month, the federal government issues a set of reports on unemployment. The report most of you see on the front pages of the paper is the official unemployment report, which is now about about 5 percent. What the official unemployment report does not include are those people who have given up looking for work and those people who are working part time who want to work full time. If you add that together, we're close to 10 percent unemployment. And here's something that is almost never discussed at all, but it is a huge and tragic issue, and that is the problem of youth unemployment -- youth unemployment. A couple of months ago, I asked some economists to do a study for me. And I said, tell me what real youth unemployment is in this country for kids who graduate high school, not drop out. And this is what they said: Kids who are white, 33 percent unemployed or underemployed, 33 percent; Latino 36 percent; African American 51 percent. Now, if anybody in this room thinks there is not a connection between that outrageously high level of youth unemployment and the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, I believe you would be mistaken. [applause] Today in America, we have 2.2 million people in jail. We spend $80 billion a year locking them up. So here's my second radical idea of the evening, and that is maybe it makes a lot more sense for us to be investing in education and jobs rather than jails and incarceration. [applause] Our goal should be to have the best-educated population on earth, not more people in jail than any other country on earth. [applause] And when we ask ourselves why it is that people are working such long hours, why? You know, it's a funny story, but it's not really so funny. If you remember the history books that we read when we were in school, there were pictures of workers a hundred years ago, marching down streets, holding up big placards. And you know what those placards were saying? They were saying we want the 40-hour work week. Well, a hundred years have come and gone and we still want the 40-hour work week. [applause] Turns out that we in the United States work the longest hours. I don't know if you know this. We work the longest hours of any people in the industrialized world. The Japanese are very hard workers, we work longer hours than they do. And one of the obvious reasons as to why people work such long hours is that wages in this country are too damn low. [applause] So let me be very clear. The federal minimum wage today of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next few years. [applause] And when we talk about equitable wages, I hope that every man in this room will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity for women workers. [applause] There is no rational economic reason why women should be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. That is just old-fashioned sexism, and together we are going to change that. [applause] Now, in New Hampshire, for better or for worse, you see a whole lot of politicians trotting through your state. And if they are Republicans, you may hear them talking about family values. They just love families. Stay up nights worrying about families. [laughter] Especially if they're very wealthy families who can contribute to their campaigns. But you all know what they mean by family values, which is not a laughing matter. What they mean is that no woman in this room, in this state, in this country, should have the right to control her own body. I disagree. [applause] What they mean by family values is that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I think we should expanding funding for Planned Parenthood. [applause] And what they mean by family values is that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to get married. I disagree. [applause] Now, my wife, Jane, and I have been married for 27 years, we have four great kids. You saw my son Levi. We've got seven beautiful grandchildren, three of them here in New Hampshire, and we're very proud of our family. And we believe very strongly in family values. But when I talk about family values, my values are a little bit different than the Republicans. And when I talk about family values, I talk about ending the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that does not provide paid family and medical leave. [applause] Now, the good and beautiful news is that here in New Hampshire today and in Vermont and all over this country, women are giving birth and for those of you who are parents you know what an extraordinary day that is. And it's a pretty big day for the baby as well. [laughter] But here's the story. If that woman who gives birth today is a working-class woman or a lower-income woman, the likelihood is that she will have to basically give up her baby, lose contact with her baby, separate from her baby and go back to work in a week or two in order to earn enough money to take care of her family. That is not a family value. That is the opposite of what a family value is. [applause] Virtually every government on earth, and not only wealthy nations, developing nations, poor nations, understand that mom and dad should have the right to stay home with their newborn baby in what amounts to the most important weeks and months of that human being's life. But it's not just childbirth. All of you know that kids get sick. It happens once in a while. And mom or dad should have the right to stay home with their child when their child is sick. Parents get sick. Sons and daughters should have the right to tend to their mothers or fathers. That is why I am strongly supporting and will make happen as president three months of paid family and medical leave for every family in America. [applause] That is not a radical idea. My goodness, every other country on earth could do it, or virtually every country. I think we can as well. And when we talk about the economy, obviously we're talking about job creation. And when real unemployment is 10 percent and youth unemployment is higher than that, in my view, we need a massive federal jobs program to put our people back to work. [applause] We should be hiring teachers, not firing teachers. [applause] When we have a dysfunctional child care and pre-K system, which for many families is unaffordable and where child care workers are earning minimum wage or a little bit more, we need to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for well-trained, well-paid child care workers in this country. [applause] And when we have an infrastructure, roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, and I'm not just talking about Flint, Michigan, I'm talking about municipalities all over this country where water systems are leaking and in bad trouble, we need to rebuild our rail system to catch up with Europe and Japan and even China. [applause] We can create 13 million decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure with a $1 trillion investment. And I intend to make that investment. [applause] Well, people say that's a great idea, but it's an expensive proposition, even in Washington. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. Where are you going to get the money? I will tell you where we get the money. We are going to end this outrageous tax loophole that allows major, billion-dollar, profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. [applause] We are losing a hundred billion dollars a year. You have corporations that make billions of dollars in profit, not paying a nickel in a given year in federal income tax. That's wrong. We're going to change that. We are going to invest in our infrastructure, create millions of good-paying jobs. [applause] And by the way, not only do we need to create millions of good- paying jobs, we need to stop the loss of millions of jobs through a disastrous trade policy that allows corporate America to shut down plants here and move to low-wage countries abroad. [applause] When I talk about an economy that is rigged, when I talk about a campaign finance system that is corrupt, when I talk about a criminal justice system that is broken, it turns out that we see all of that in a recent story that was in the papers about a week ago. And here is the story that tells you how corrupt our economic and political and criminal justice system is. About a week ago, it was announced that Goldman Sachs, one of the major financial institutions on Wall Street, was going to reach a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion -- $5 billion -- and they were reaching that settlement because they had sold subprime mortgage packages that were worthless and cheated investors. Investors thought they were buying something that was worth something, but it was worthless and Goldman Sachs knew that. Now, over the last 30 years, Goldman Sachs has operated what we call a revolving door. A revolving door means that people leave Wall Street and corporate America, go into government, do the bidding of Wall Street and corporate America, and then go back to the private sector. In fact, in the last 30 years, Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of the treasury, one under a Republican administration, one under a Democratic administration. That's how the system works. Big money gets their people into government, works for big money. And then it turns out that the guy who is head of Goldman Sachs, the financial institution that has paid $5 billion in settlement with the government, is a billionaire who a couple of years ago went to the Congress and he said, you know what, Congress, you have got to cut Social Security, you've got to cut Medicare, you've got to cut Medicaid, we can't afford to sustain these programs. This is coming from a billionaire whose company now paid a $5 billion fine for ripping off the American people. Now, when we talk about why the American people are angry and why they are increasingly alienated from the political process, it has a lot to do with the fact that there are kids in New Hampshire, kids in Vermont, who get arrested for possessing marijuana and they get... [applause] ...and they get a police record. And you know what? When you get a police record, sometimes it's a little bit hard to go out and get a job. And yet, when you are the CEO or a major executive of a multi-multi-billion-dollar financial institution which helped crash the economy because of their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior, helped create a situation in which millions of people lost their homes, their life savings, their jobs, when you are that person, somehow you do not get a police record. That is wrong. That has got to change. [applause] And by the way, to make a bad situation even worse, this particular company, Goldman Sachs, spends huge amounts of money on campaign contributions and on speakers fees to unnamed candidates. [laughter] But that's how the system works. That is how the system works. That's what power is about. That's why the 1 percent gets richer and while everybody else gets poorer. And when I talk about a political revolution and when I talk about bringing millions of people into the political process, what our job is to end that type of corruption and power-mongering and to create a government that works for all of us, not just a handful of people. [applause] And speaking about campaign contributions, it turns out ironically that today is the sixth anniversary of one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of this country, and that is the Citizens United decision. And what Citizens United did was to say to the very wealthiest people in this country you already own much of the economy, now we're going to give you an opportunity to purchase the United States government, and that is precisely what they are trying to do. You have one family and a few of their friends, the Koch brothers, second-wealthiest family in America, and they're very, very nervous and unhappy. You see, they're trying to catch up to the Waltons and they're only in second place, so they're working really hard and figure they could become even richer if they can elect candidates who hold their views, which is not just to cut Social Security or Medicare, it is to end Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and the Environmental Protection Agency. That's a family that is spending $900 million on this campaign cycle. Now, when you've got one family, second-wealthiest in America, spending more money in a campaign than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, you're not looking at a democratic society, you're looking at an oligarchic form of society. And together, we are going to stop that. [applause] And the reason, the reason that that issue is so important, is that it touches on every other issue. You name the issue. And if people are elected to office to represent the wealthy and the powerful, the needs of the middle class and working families, the needs of women, the needs of children, the needs of the environment, will not be addressed. And then there are -- so let me conclude that by telling you, and here's a promise, that no nominee of mine to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is crystal clear that they will vote to overturn Citizens United. [applause] Everybody in this room knows we live in a highly competitive, global economy. And if we're going to succeed, we need the best- educated workforce in the world. There was once a time when we did. That time is not anymore. Now, it seems to me to be totally absurd, beyond comprehension, that when we need the intellectual capabilities of all of our people, we have hundreds of thousands of young Americans who are able, who are qualified, but who cannot get to college for one reason and one reason alone, and that is their families lack the money. That is why I believe that in the year 2016 we must make public colleges and universities tuition free. [applause] And I say that not just for the obvious reason, that it means that bright young people will be able to go to college and people will not leave school deeply in debt, but there is a more profound reason. I grew up in a family that never had a lot of money. And my dad came from Poland, he had dropped out of high school, my mom graduated high school. But the people, like every milieu, the people you associate with, your family associates with, in my family and other families, you associate with people with similar economic backgrounds. And the people that we associated with just did not have college education. And that's true all over America. There are kids who don't know anybody who went to college. If we can make public colleges and universities tuition free, if every parent in this country, every teacher in this country, every child in this country, kids who in the sixth grade, the eighth grade, understand that if they do their schoolwork seriously, if they pay attention in school, that they will be able to get a college education regardless of the income of their families. That is revolutionary. [applause] And when we talk about our responsibilities as adults, as inhabitants of this earth, as parents, as grandparents, it seems to me that we have a moral responsibility to make sure that the planet that we leave our kids and grandchildren is healthy and habitable. [applause] I sit on the Senate Environmental Committee and on the Senate Energy Committee. And in that capacity, I've met scientists all over our country, all over the world. And what they say is very clear: Climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, it is already causing major problems in our country and around the world. And what they also say, and this is scary stuff, is that if we do not get our act together, this planet earth, our only planet, could become five to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century. And what that means is more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances, more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels, more international conflicts as peoples fight for limited natural resources. If elected president, I will lead our country into working with Russia, China, India, countries all over the world, to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause] And let me connect some dots here and show you how everything is related to everything else. Today we have a major political party, it's called the Republican Party, where not one of their candidates for president, and they have many candidates for president, not one of them has stood up and said, you know, I've read the literature, I've talked to the scientists, we've got a problem, climate change is real, we better do something about it. Not one. And in the Congress, there are very, very few of them. There are some, but very few who are prepared to talk the truth about climate change. Now, some may say, well, you know, Republicans are dumb or something like that. But that's not the case. Some of you may think it's the case, but it's not the case. Not here. I'm on a lot of committees and I serve with Republicans and we discuss issues, like cancer and Alzheimer's disease and heart disease, on the Health Committee and so forth, and they ask the same rational questions anybody else would ask. They don't go around attacking cancer researcher or Alzheimer's researchers. But on this issue, on this issue things are very, very different. And the reason for that is a corrupt campaign finance system which tells the Republicans that if one of them were to stand up and say, you know what, climate change is real, we've got to do something about that, on that day they would lose their funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. [applause] And that is just one example of many as to why we need campaign finance reform. [applause] When we talk about America and when we talk about the future of our country, what I am trying to do in this campaign is to get people to think big, not small. In other words, if we were an impoverished country, we would have one type of discussion. But we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And that calls for a different type of discussion. Today there is one major country on earth -- one -- the country that you live in, that does not guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right. [applause] Now, I have been criticized for believing that health care is a right, not a privilege. People want to criticize me, that's fine, that is what I believe. [applause] Now, I am a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, and in that capacity spent an enormous amount of time working on the Affordable Care Act. And in my view, the Affordable Care Act has done some very, very important things. It has ended the private insurance company obscenity of preexisting conditions. [applause] And in 20 years from now or 50 years from now, people will look back and they'll say I really cannot believe you had a system where insurance could tell somebody, oh, you had breast cancer five years ago, we will provide you insurance, but not for breast cancer because it may recur. It's like saying I'm going to give you fire insurance, except if you have a fire. [laughter] You know, it is totally, totally insane. That's gone. What we have also done through the ACA is provided health insurance for some 17 million Americans who otherwise would not have it. We have made it much fairer to women, who do not have to pay higher prices for insurance than men. So there's a lot of good stuff in there. But let's also be clear. Today, 29 million Americans have no health insurance. Many more are under-insured with high deductibles and co-payments. There are people in this room who have high deductibles. Anybody have a high deductible? Would you mind telling us? Anyone want to tell us what their deductible is? Six thousand, $4,000, $10,000. OK. [laughter] Whatever I do, they say I always feel like a Vermont auctioneer, you know. [laughter] Sorry to say, you won unless somebody can go higher than $10,000. But what that means is that all over this country people do have insurance, but they have high deductibles and they have high co- payments. And what does that mean? It means in real world that people hesitate to go to the doctor when they're sick because they just don't have the money in their pocket. And what that also means, and I've talked to a whole lot of doctors in Vermont and all over this country, is sometimes people go into the doctor's office and they are really, really, really sick. And the doctor said, why didn't you come in here six months ago? And the person says, well, I didn't have any health insurance or maybe I had a high deductible and I couldn't afford it. Sometimes those people do not make it. Sometimes they end up in the hospital at great expense and at great suffering. In my view, when we have a system which has 29 million people uninsured, more under-insured, when we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, which is a huge problem, when we end up spending almost three times more than the British spend, who provide health care to all of their people, 50 percent more than the French spend to provide health care to all their people, far more than our Canadian neighbors spend who provide health care to all of their people, I think we need to move forward toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. [applause] And because Medicare for all takes the private insurance companies out of the equation, and you all know their function is simply to make as much money as possible, when we'll be able to negotiate prices with the drug companies, we end up through a Medicare-for-all program saving middle-class families thousands of dollars a year on their health care costs. [applause] When we talk about issues in America, I know that all of you share with me our fatigue, our disgust, our anger at seeing videos on television of innocent people being shot to death by police officers. [applause] And often, those people are African American or Latino. Now, I was, as you all know, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont for eight years and in that capacity worked very, very hard with our police department. And in my view, the vast, vast majority of police officers in this country are honest, hardworking and are asked to do an enormously difficult job. [applause] It is not easy being a police officer in the year 2016. But as is the case with any other public official, if a police officer breaks the law, that officer must be held accountable. [applause] We need major reforms in our criminal justice system. We need to demilitarize local police departments. [applause] We need to make police departments look like the diversity of the communities that they serve. [applause] We need to take a hard look at the so-called war on drugs. [applause] Right now under the Federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug, right next to heroin. Now, I don't have to tell the people of New Hampshire about the horror of heroin. I don't have to tell the people of my state about the horror of heroin. It's a growing problem all over this country, a problem, by the way, in terms of opiate addiction and heroin addiction we have got to get a handle on. [applause] Which means that we need a revolution in mental health treatment in this country. [applause] Which means that when people need treatment for substance abuse, they get the treatment when they need it, not six months from when they need it. [applause] And I am aware -- I just met a mother earlier today, lost, I believe, it was her daughter to drugs, and I know how serious that problem is in your state and how serious that problem is in my state. But when you have marijuana next to heroin, I think that makes no sense to me at all. [applause] And what I worry about is young people who get police records for possession of marijuana and then find it really hard to go out and get a job and get their lives together. And that is why I have introduced legislation to take marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act. [applause] In America today, we have about 11 million undocumented people. Many of them are being exploited and many of them are living in fear. I have talked to young Latinos with tears running down their cheeks who worry that their parents could be deported or that they could be deported. As president, I will be as aggressive as I can in moving toward comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. [applause] Now, we can have honest disagreements about any issue, including immigration reform. But what we should not be having in the year 2016, what we should not be having are candidates using racism and bigotry to attack... [applause] The idea that somehow in the middle of the night we're going to pick up and round up 11 million people and throw them out of the country, the idea that people like Donald Trump are referring to Latinos who come into this country as criminals and rapists is unacceptable -- unacceptable. [applause] This campaign is about not just electing a president. It is about transforming America. Bill McKibben mentioned to you a little while ago that it's not good enough to elect a president. What we need to do is to transform this country. And no president can do it alone. We need to be working together, we need to raise political consciousness, we need to have an understanding about what's going on in Washington and politically in a way that we have not had for a very, very long time. [applause] But here is the bottom line. The bottom line is that we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We are a country in the last 30 years that has seen a massive transfer of wealth away from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. I believe that if we stand together, if we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up, if we are Latino or if we are Muslim, but if we stand together, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish. [applause] Please don't tell me that the United States of America, our great country, cannot guarantee health care to all people as a right. Don't tell me that we cannot make certain that all of our young people, regardless of the income of their families, are able to get a college education if they have the ability to do so. And don't tell me that we can't train carpenters and plumbers and sheet metal workers who need that training to get good jobs. Don't tell me that we have to have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth at the same time as we have more childhood poverty than any other country on earth. Don't tell me that we have to maintain a crumbling infrastructure. Don't tell me that cannot address the fact that the wealthiest people in this country often pay an effective tax rate lower than what you pay. [applause] When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. That is what this campaign is about. And that is what a Sanders administration is about. Thank you all very much! [applause]"""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"January 26, 2016","b'Remarks in a Meeting with Steelworkers in Des Moines, Iowa'","b'AUDIENCE: Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! SANDERS: Thank you. Well, let me -- let begin by thanking you for inviting me to be with you today, thanking Steve for his introduction, and most of all, thanking the steelworkers for their long, long support of what I\'ve been trying to do throughout my entire political career. I don\'t get any money and I don\'t want any money from corporations. Never got a nickel. [applause] Don\'t want any money from the billionaire class. [applause] But I am very grateful for the support that I\'ve received from the steelworkers throughout my entire political career. Thank you, guys, very, very much. [applause] When I went to college, I studied some economics, but the real economic lesson that I learned was when I was a kid. I grew up in a home where my dad had come from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. Never made much money. Mother graduated high school. I lived in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and we lived not poor, but our family lived on the financial stress as is the case with millions and millions of families in our country today. So the major economics lesson that I have had in my life was not in high school and not in college, it was as a kid understanding what financial stress does to a family, understanding that every decision that is made has got to be thought about, whether you can afford to do this or whether you can afford to do that. And that, brothers and sisters, is a lesson I have never forgotten and I never will forget. [applause] You know, one of the reasons I think our campaign is doing well is because we try to talk about the real issues impacting the American people. Don\'t do necessarily do what the media wants us to do, but talk about real issues. Just turned out yesterday -- just happened. We were in Iowa Falls, had a few hundred people out to a meeting. And I kind of opened up the discussion to ask people what was going on in their lives, what was going on in their lives in terms of trying to make it on $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And suddenly what was it like in their lives if you can\'t afford the prescription drugs that you need. And I want to thank the nurses, our sisters and brothers; are there nurses here? [applause] Who know these issues, who know what it means to be treating patients who can\'t afford prescriptions. And I opened it up, the discussion. One woman gets up there and says the medicine her family need -- I think it was her husband needed -- shot way up, shot way up to an outrageous price. And we all know that tomorrow, if you walk into a drug store to refill your prescription, the price could be double or triple than what was paid today. Some of you have that experience, right? Because the pharmaceutical industry is ripping off the American people. [applause] So people talk -- we don\'t have a lot of money. The cost of prescription drugs goes way up. Then another woman says -- you know, I was using the point -- making the point, millions of people in this country -- we don\'t talk about it terribly much -- trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year on Social Security. You do the arithmetic. Tell me how you pay for health care. Tell me how you pay for prescription drugs. How do you heat your home. How do you buy the food you need on $12,000 or $13,000 a year? And the answer is exactly right, you don\'t. You don\'t. [applause] And then we got Republicans going around the country lying, as they occasionally do...[laughter]...and they\'re saying Social Security is going broke. We have to cut Social Security benefits. AUDIENCE: No! SANDERS: Now, just stop and think about it. Forget politics. Tell me how somebody can go around the country when we know that millions of people -- seniors, disabled vets, people with disabilities, people who can\'t make it on $1,000, $13,000 a year, and they\'re talking about cutting Social Security benefits. There\'s a thing that a lot of people have not heard of. It\'s called the chain CPI. Anybody know what the chain CPI is? It\'s a fancy term from Washington to cut Social Security benefits, and it argues, the theory behind it is that the COLAs, the cost-of-living adjustments that seniors are getting today are too generous. Does anybody here know what seniors got in their COLA last year? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Zero! SANDERS: Zero! Too generous. Got to cut it. Anyhow, at Iowa Falls we heard from people who told us no, I\'m not getting $12,000, $13,000 a year, I\'m trying to live on $10,000 a year. And then we heard another woman talk about what it means to have minimum wage jobs and how difficult it is to survive. And that is the reality for millions and millions of people in this country. It\'s a reality we don\'t talk enough about and it\'s certainly a reality that we are not effectively addressing. Now, here\'s the story. If we were a poor country -- and there are poor countries around the world -- you have a certain type of discussion. And you say, you know, it\'s unfortunate that we have to live in poverty, but that\'s who we are. We\'re a poor country. We can\'t have good education, we can\'t have good health care, we can\'t have decent paying jobs. We\'re a poor country. But the truth is, as everybody here knows, the United States of America is not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But -- but most people don\'t know that because almost all of the new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent. And brothers and sisters, what a Sanders administration is about is a very radical idea. You ready for a radical idea? We\'re going to create an economy that works for working families, not just billionaires. [applause] And not only that. In the last 30 years, as everybody in this room knows, technology has exploded. Almost every worker in America is more productive than he or she was 20 years, 30 years ago, right? You\'re producing more. Question. If you are more productive, if we are producing more, why are millions of people working longer hours for lower wages? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: Why is almost all new income and wealth going to a small number of people? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: You guys are a smart group here. All right. and that\'s what we\'re going to deal with. So we are going to tell billionaires who pay an effective tax rate lower than many of you do, we\'re going to tell large multi-national corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profit and stash their money in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year may pay zero in federal income taxes, we\'re going to tell them that it is time for them to accept their responsibility as Americans to start paying their fair share of taxes. [applause] And when we eliminate the Cayman Islands loophole and when we raise a trillion dollars in new revenue, you know what we\'re going to do with that? We\'re going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs. [applause] This is the United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. You tell me why our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our waste water plants, our levees, our dams, our airports, our rail system are deteriorating or crumbling? AUDIENCE: Republicans! [laughter] SANDERS: All right. We need to invest in a $1 trillion investment, which I believe we should make, creates 13 million decent paying jobs. [applause] Including a lot of good steelworker jobs. [applause] Now, every person in this room -- because of the steelworkers or one of the great unions in our country, you understand the history of the trade union movement. And you understand that change, real change, never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom on up. [applause] And you understand that way back when employers did not say, ""Well, you know, I think it\'s a great idea for workers to have a union. We\'d love to sit down and do some collective bargaining with you because we think that\'s fair and that\'s right."" That\'s not the way it happened. The way it happened is way back when, workers went on strike, workers fought and workers died, workers were beaten, workers were fired from their jobs in order to make sure that working people could organize, could engage in collective bargaining, could sit down at a table and fight for decent wages and decent working conditions. That\'s the history of the trade union movement and we should be proud of that. But what all of you know is that over the last several decades, despite the fact that millions of workers want to join a union, it has become harder and harder for workers to in fact create unions, to become members of unions. You know and I know that employers have acted illegally with the support of the NLRB so that if workers tried to organize, the organizers there would be fired, and if by some miracle people actually did organize a union, employers would refuse to engage in a first contract, collective bargaining, [inaudible]. And that is why I believe that the middle class does not grow unless the trade union movement grows. [applause] The middle class does not prosper unless workers are engaged in strong collective bargaining. Now... [applause] Now, what a lot of people -- what a lot of non-union people don\'t understand is that to the degree they get anywhere near decent wages -- decent wages, it has a lot to do with the success of the trade union movement because you\'re driving wages up. [applause] In any case, after decades of illegal action on the part of employers, it seems to me we have got to make it easier, not harder for workers to join unions. That\'s why we have introduced a new FCOP piece of legislation, and it says very simply that if 50 percent of workers in a unit plus one sign a card saying they want to be in a union, they will have a union. [applause] Here\'s the truth. Here\'s the truth. Not going to tell you that every worker in America wants to join a union, but what I will tell you is that millions of them do. Millions of them understand that workers who have a union get better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. And our job is to say that the American people must be able to exercise their constitutional right to organize unions without illegal impediments on the part of employers, and that is what I intend to do. [applause] I mentioned earlier that there are millions of seniors and disabled veterans in this country. And by the way, as the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, let me thank all of the men and women in this room and in this country for their service to our country. [applause] For their putting their lives on the line to defend this country. And here\'s a promise I make, is that we will do our best, absolute best, and there should not be any debate about this whether you\'re a conservative, progressive, Democrat or Republican. When people put their lives on the line to defend this country and they come home, they are going to get the best health care available. They\'re going to get the benefits that they earned. [applause] But here\'s the difference that Secretary Clinton and I have on a very important issue. I believe that when millions of seniors and disabled vets are struggling to get by on $12,000 or $13,000 a year, it is not good enough to say -- and I\'ve led the effort on this, that we\'re not going to cut Social Security. That is an abomination. What we must do is say, ""Of course we\'re not going to cut Social Security, but we are going to expand Social Security benefits."" [applause] And here is how we are going to do it. It is not complicated. Right now, somebody makes $5 million a year, somebody makes $118,000 a year, they both contribute the same amount into the Social Security trust fund. If you lift that cap and you start at $250,000 and above, top 1.5 percent of the American people, what we can do is increase Social Security benefits for those now living under $16,000 a year by $1,300 a year. That\'s not insignificant for people who are struggling. [applause] And when we do that, we also extend the life of Social Security from 19 years to 50 years. Now, that is my view. I think -- I think that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting much wealthier, you know what? I think it is just appropriate, just right to lift that cap, and ask the wealthiest people in this country to make sure that all seniors can live in dignity. [applause] That is my view, if Secretary Clinton drops in, ask her her view. I don\'t think she agrees. Now, when we talk -- and Steve raised this issue. When we talk about why it is that the great middle class of this country is disappearing, why it is that we have 47 million people living in poverty, why it is that we have massive wealth and income inequality, one of the important reasons is our disastrous trade policies. [applause] You are looking at a former United States congressman. I represented Vermont in the Congress for 16 years, and a senator today. You are looking at a member of the Senate, who in his life, voted against NAFTA, against CAFTA, against PNTR with China. [applause] And by the way, is helping to lead the opposition to the TPP. Now... [applause] Look -- look, everybody in this room understands what these disastrous trade agreements are about. You all know who wrote these trade agreements. Not complicated. The steelworkers did not write these trade agreements. They are written by corporate America to benefit corporate America, people who could care less about what these trade agreements did to working families. Here\'s what they\'ve done. Since 2001 in America, we have lost 60,000 factories. Got that? In my state, in Iowa, all across this country -- 60,000 factories. Not all of that, to be fair, is attributable to trade. There are other reasons why factories shut down, but a lot of it is attributable to trade. And when you lose 60,000 factories, many of them attributable to disastrous trade agreements, you\'re talking about the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs. [applause] Everybody knows what the purpose of these trade agreements were supposed to do. They did exactly what corporate America wanted them to do -- what they were designed to do is to say, why should we pay workers in the United States $20, $25, $30 an hour, provide decent benefits, negotiate with unions, protect the environment, why would any corporation want to do that when they could shut down in America, throw people out on the street, move to China, move to Mexico, move to low-wage countries, pay people pennies an hour, not have to worry about the environment, not have to do deal with unions and then they can bring their products right back in this country? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: The simple truth is, and it\'s indisputable, these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country. They have benefited the CEOs of large multinational corporations. No one can deny that reality. I am proud to tell you that way back when I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA and helped lead the opposition against all of these trade agreements. But I got to tell you also, these trade agreements have been supported not just by Republicans but by some Democrats as well. We\'ve got to acknowledge that. Where we are today is to say that when our country is de- industrializing -- do you know what I mean by that? What I mean, you tell me how are we a great nation if we\'re not purchasing the products that we need that are made in our country? Can you be a great country? Can you be a great country where everything you buy is made in China? I don\'t think so. I don\'t think so. And by the way -- this is another important point to be made. It is not only the loss of jobs, it is what we call the race to the bottom. So here\'s what\'s going on. People are saying -- and this is a good thing -- people are saying, well, you know what? We\'re seeing an uptick in manufacturing in America. Good. Take a look at the wages that those new manufacturing jobs are paying. There was once a time when manufacturing jobs, unionized manufacturing jobs, were the gold standard for the working class of this country. You had a good job in a manufacturing plant, you had a union, you were making middle-class wages and middle-class benefits. But then -- I\'ll tell you a story. A couple years ago in Louisville, Kentucky, General Electric announced that they were expanding their manufacturing capabilities, creating a couple hundred jobs. Some people were very excited about it. And they asked this guy from GE, they said, why are you doing this? He said, well, it turns out that if you add all of the these things together, transportation costs and the fact that wages in America have gone down, it is actually more competitive to do manufacturing in America now than in China because wages have gone down so much. So they\'re paying people in manufacturing $10, $12 an hour. Now, if manufacturing workers are getting paid $10, $12 an hour, what do you think other workers are going to be getting? This is the race to the bottom, what they have always wanted. Not to bring Chinese wages up to where we were, it\'s to bring our wages down to where Chinese wages were. [applause] So this TPP; they want us to support the TPP. They want our people to compete against workers in Vietnam. I have nothing against workers in Vietnam. I was there, they work very hard. Minimum wage in Vietnam is 65 cents an hour. I do not want American workers to have to compete against people who are making 65 cents an hour. [applause] So we have to take a deep breath. We have to understand that our trade policies have failed and we have to begin an entirely new set of policies. And the bottom line for me is that every major corporation in America wants all of us to buy their products. Can\'t turn on the TV, buy this, buy that, buy that. Well, if they want us to buy their products, they damn well better start manufacturing those products back in the United States and not in China. [applause] Let me touch on another important issue and I\'m glad our brothers and sisters from the nurses union -- and we thank you so much for your support. [applause] The reason that the nurses are supporting our campaign is that these are serious people who want to be able to do their job as well as they can. All right. Thank you job is to prevent disease. Their job is to take care of people who are sick. But right now they and many, many other people in the health care profession are unable to do the job that they were trained to do. Now, I think the Affordable Care Act has made some important steps forward and one important step forward that we are not going to allow to go forward is the so-called Cadillac Tax. We have delayed that and we will continue to push that back. Workers who gave up wage increases and other benefits for decent health care should not be penalized for those sacrifices. [applause] But the Affordable Care Act, which I voted for and strongly supported, did a couple -- number of good things. It did away with this obscenity called pre-existing conditions. You all know what that is? [applause] This private insurance obscenity which said if you had a disease years ago, they would not cover you for the disease that you needed coverage for. It\'s like getting fire insurance except that if you have a fire, then they don\'t pay. We got rid of that. We have expanded health insurance to some 17 million Americans. We have made it fairer for women who are forced to pay higher rates than they should have for the crime of being a woman. So we kind of eliminated that. But having said that, here\'s the reality of health care today. And what our campaign is about is asking the American people to think big, not small. Here we are. The United States of America today is the only major country on earth -- the only one, that doesn\'t guarantee health care to all people as a right. They do it in England. They do it in France, do it in Germany, do it all over Scandinavia. I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border, they do it. Every major country does it. In America today, 29 million people today have no health insurance at all. Millions more have high deductibles and high co-payments. Sound familiar? OK. And by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. At a time when one in five Americans are unable to afford the prescription drugs their doctors are prescribing, at a time when seniors are cutting their pills in half because they can\'t afford to buy what they need, the three major drug companies in America last year made $45 billion in profit. And because they are so powerful, because they provide hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions, because they have 1,400 lobbyists in Washington, D.C., there is no legislation on the books to prevent them from doubling, tripling, quadrupling the price you pay for medicine. They are getting away with murder and in some cases, they are committing murder. [applause] We hear from oncologists who are hearing from cancer patients and they\'re telling us our cancer patients can\'t afford the medicine that they need. We are dealing in some cases with folks who have Hepatitis C. A new drug, a very effective drug out, do you know what that costs? A thousand dollars a pill. What we have got to tell the pharmaceutical industry -- now, let me back up and tell you a story for a minute. Late 1990s, when I represented Vermont in the Congress, I took a bus load of women from northern Vermont over the Canadian border to Montreal. And the reason we went is that I knew is that prescription drugs in Canada were much less expensive. Women who were dealing with breast cancer, working class women, walked into the pharmacy. They purchased the breast cancer medicine that they needed -- this is not generic, brand name medicine for one-tenth the price they\'re paying in the United States. I was the first member of Congress to do that. Others followed. Now millions of people, by the way, get their medicine from Canada. We should not have to get medicine from Canada. Pharmaceutical industry has got to stop ripping us off. [applause] Now, when you got 29 million uninsured, even more underinsured, when we\'re paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, it turns out that we are spending per person in health care almost three times more than they do in the United Kingdom where they guarantee health care to all of their people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French who guarantee health care to all of their people, much more than the Canadians who guarantee all of -- health care to all of their people. It seems to me that the time is now for us to say loudly and clearly that in the United States of America, health care is a right for all people. [applause] And we are going to pass a Medicare for all single payer programs. [applause] And when we do that -- when we do that, not only do we make the nurses and the doctors\' jobs easier, because they\'re going to be able to treat everybody in a comprehensive way, we\'re going to save the middle class many thousands of dollars a year on health care costs. [applause] We began our campaign for the presidency of the United States nine months ago, and when we began it, I think we were at three, four percent in the polls. We didn\'t have any money. We didn\'t have any organization, and frankly, not so many people outside of Vermont knew who Bernie Sanders was. But the message that we have been bringing forth to the American people, a message which says that the economy today is rigged, that it benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of everybody else, that the campaign finance system that exists today is corrupt and undermining American democracy... [applause] That message is resonating all across this country. And here we are in Iowa, and one week from yesterday there will be the first caucus in the country. I believe that we have an excellent chance to win that caucus if -- and here is the if. If we have a large voter turnout. [applause] It is going to be a very, very close election, but I believe that if working people want to be part of a campaign which says enough is enough, our government has got to represent all of us and not a handful of campaign contributors, if those people come out and vote, we will win and we\'ll win big. [applause] Let me also say this. Let me also say this. This campaign is different from other campaigns, not just because of the fact that I am perhaps the most progressive member of the Senate and my agenda in this campaign is the most progressive. This campaign is more than that. And that is what I say every single day and I repeat to you now from the bottom of my heart. No president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody else, can do it alone. All right? [applause] Now, I want to tell you a painful truth that you understand as proud trade unionists, but not all people in America understand. And that is the powers that be -- Wall Street, whose greed and recklessness and illegal behavior brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, they have endless supplies of money, endless. In fact, somebody on Wall Street now, I think just announced is going to spend $600,000 in ads against me here in Iowa this week -- $600,000 from one guy. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Give them hell, Bernie! SANDERS: We surely will. [applause] So, you got the power of Wall Street. I want to remind you something about Wall Street. You know, Congress, against my vote, helped to bail them out because the banks were too big to fail. You remember that? Well, you won\'t be shocked to know that three out of the four largest banks in this country are bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. And you know what I think? When you have a handful of huge financial institutions with incredible economic and political power, maybe it is time we broke them up. [applause] But it\'s not just Wall Street. You deal all of the time with corporate America, whose greed, whose unquenchable greed, they want more and more and more, and they are prepared to step on every working person in this country to get more and more and more. We got to take them on. Got to take on the corporate media that decides what we see and what we hear. We got to take on the large campaign contributors. That\'s not an easy fight, and no one president alone can do it. And that is why, what this campaign is about is a political revolution. [applause] We need trade unionists. We need millions of people to stand up and be involved in the political process in a way that we have not seen for a very, very long time. What we are fighting for, brothers and sisters, is not only for our well-being, we are fighting for our kids. We are fighting for our parents. We are fighting for the planet. This is a fight that we cannot afford to lose. And together we will not lose. Thank you very much. [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 1, 2016",b'Remarks in Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucus',"b'Thank you. Iowa, thank you.Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state. We had no political organization. We had no money. We had no name recognition. And we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America. And tonight, while the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie. And while the results are still not complete, it looks like we\'ll have about half of the Iowa delegates. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary Clintonand her organization for waging a very vigorous campaign. And I want to thank Gov. O\'Malley. It\'s never easy to lose. I\'ve lost more than one campaign. But he should know that he contributed a whole lot to the dialogue, that he ran an issue-oriented campaign, and he won the respect of the American people. As I think about what happened tonight, I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment. That is given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. What the American people have said  and by the way, I hear this not just from progressives; I hear it from conservatives; I hear it from moderates  and that is we can no longer continue to have a corrupt campaign finance system. I am the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity not only have I worked hard to try to protect the interests of our veterans, I have the privilege of meeting so many men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us and to protect our way of life. And what they were protecting is an American democracy of one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections.I am overwhelmed and I am moved by the fact that millions of people throughout this country have helped volunteer in our country. That we have received in this campaign 3.5 million individual contributions. People who went to BernieSanders.com. And you know what the average contribution was? It was $27. We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class, Wall Street, or corporate America. We don\'t want their money. And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a super PAC. And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa, the reason I believe we\'re going to so well in New Hampshire and in the other states that follow, the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy. They no longer want to see an economy in which the average American works longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1%. What the American people understand was based and is based on fairness  on fairness. It is not fair when the top 0.1% today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America.So are you guys ready for a radical idea? Well, so is America. And that radical idea is we are going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the billionaire class. And yes, when millions of our people are working for starvation wages, we are going to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. And yes, we are going to have pay equity for women. Now, I\'ve been all over this beautiful state of Iowa. We have spoken to some 70,000 people. And in meeting after meeting, I hear people standing up and they say, ""Bernie, I went to college. I graduated college. Now I am $60,000, $80,000, $90,000 in debt."" That is crazy. That is crazy. People should not be punished financially because they want to get a decent education. And that is why I believe that in year 2016 public colleges and universities should be tuition free. And then my critics say, ""Well, Bernie, that\'s a great idea. All this free stuff. How are you going to pay for it?"" I will tell you how we\'re going to pay for it. We\'re going to impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. The greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this economy to its knees. The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it\'s Wall Street\'s time to help the middle class. And when we talk about transforming America, we will end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country  disproportionately African-American and Latino. What we are going to do is provide jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration.And I\'ll tell you something that really does astound me. I\'m on the Senate Energy Committee. I\'m on the Senate Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. The debate is over. Climate change is real. And we have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.And what amazes me  what totally amazes me  is that we have not one Republican candidate for president prepared to come up and tell us and agree with what virtually all scientists agree with. And you know why they are not prepared to do that? Because on the day that they do acknowledge the reality of climate change and call for change, you know what happens? They\'re going to lose their campaign funds from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. So I say to the Republicans, ""Stop worrying about your campaign funds from Big Oil or the Koch brothers or the coal industry. Worry about the planet you\'re going to be leaving your children and your grandchildren."" Now, I have been criticized during this campaign for many, many things. Every single day. That\'s okay. That\'s okay. But let me repeat what I believe. I believe that at a time when every major on Earth guarantees health care to people as a right that I believe that we should do the same in the United States of America. So for all of my critics out there  the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and in corporate America, wherever you may be, let me tell you straight up. Yes, I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. And that is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single-payer program which will not only guarantee health care to all, it will not only end the pharmaceutical rip-off of the American people, but it will save the middle family  the average middle class family  thousands of dollars a year in health care costs.Let me conclude by saying what no other candidate for president will tell you. And that is that no president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody else, will be able to bring about the changes that the working families and the middle class of this country, that the children, that the seniors  our seniors deserve. No one president can do it because the powers that be  Wall Street with their endless supply of money, corporate America, the large campaign donors  are so powerful that no president can do what has to be done alone. And that is why what Iowa has begun tonight is a political revolution  a political revolution that says when millions of people come together including those who have given up on the political process  they\'re so dismayed and so frustrated with what goes on in Washington, with young people who before have never been involved in the political process  when young people and working people and seniors begin to stand up and say loudly and clearly ""Enough is enough!"" That our government  the government of our great country belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires. When that happens, we will transform this country. Thank you all very much!'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 9, 2016",b'Remarks in Concord Following the New Hampshire Primary',"b""Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. [Applause] Shortly after the polls closed, Secretary Clinton called and was very gracious in her congratulations. I thank her for her call, and I congratulate her and her supporters for the vigorous campaign that they ran in New Hampshire. And, let me take this opportunity to thank the many, many thousands of volunteers here in the granite state who worked so tirelessly. Our volunteers worked night and day, made phone calls, and knocked on a heck of a lot of doors, and we won because of your energy. Thank you all so much. I want to thank Julia Bond and our great campaign staff. We have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors, and their Super PACs. Nine months ago we began our campaign here in New Hampshire. We had no campaign organization, we had no money, and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America. Tonight, with what appears to be a record breaking voter turnout, because of a huge voter turnout -- and I say huge, we won. Because we harnessed the energy, and the excitement that the Democratic party will need to succeed in November. What happened here in New Hampshire in terms of an enthusiastic, and aroused electorate, people who came out in large numbers. That is what will happen all over this country. Let us never forget, Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high. Republicans win when people are demoralized, and voter turnout is low. Tonight, we served notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy, and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages, while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1%. I want to take this opportunity again to congratulate Secretary Clinton and her organization and supporters for waging a vigorous campaign. I hope that in the days ahead we can continue to wage a strong, issue oriented campaign, and bring new people into the political process. But, I also hope that we all remember -- and this is a message not just to our opponents, but to those who support me as well. That we will need to come together in a few months and unite this party, and this nation because the right-wing Republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the presidency. As we all remember, the last time Republicans occupied the White House, their trickle down economic policies drove us into the worst economic downturn since the depression of the 1930's. No, we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires, we will not allow packed -- huge cuts to social security, veterans needs, Medicare, MedicAid, and education. No, we will not allow back into the White House a political party which is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change [inaudible]. The people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment. What the people here have said is given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for the same old, same old establishment politics, and establishment economics. The people want real change. What the American people are saying -- and, by the way, I hear this not just from progressives, but from conservatives and from moderates, is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign finances system in which Wall Street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections. Americans, no matter what their political view may be, understand that that is not what democracy is about. That is what oligarchy is about, and we will not allow that to continue. I do not have a Super PAC, and I do not want a Super PAC. I am overwhelmed, and I am deeply moved far more than I can express in words by the fact that our campaigns financial support comes from more than one million Americans who have made more than 3.7 million individual contributions. That is more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States up until this point in an election. And, you know what that average contribution was? $27 dollars. I am going to New York City tonight and tomorrow, but I'm not going to New York City to hold a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I'm going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to Berniesanders.com and contribute. Please help us raise the funds we need, whether it's $10 bucks, $20 bucks, or $50 bucks. Help up us raise the money we need to take the fight to Nevada, South Carolina, and the states on Super Tuesday. So, there it is, that's our fundraiser. Pretty quick. Now, what the American people understand is that our great country was based on a simple principal, and that principle is fairness. Let me be very clear, it is not fair when we have more income and wealth inequality today than almost any major country on Earth. And, when the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, that's not fair. It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people. So, are you guys ready for a radical idea? Together we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%. And, when millions of our people are working for starvation wages, yep, we're going to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. And, we are going to bring pay equity for women. And, when we need the best educated workforce in the world, yes, we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And, for the millions of Americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt, we are going to substantially ease that burden. In America people should be financially distressed for decades for the crime, the crime of trying to get a higher education, that's absurd. Well, my critics say, you know, Bernie, that's a great idea, you're into all this free stuff. How are you going to pay for it? I will tell you how we're going to pay for it. We're going to impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. The greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior drove our economy to its knees. The American people bailed out Wall Street, now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle class. And, when we talk about transforming America, it means ending the disgrace of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world, disproportionately African-American, and Latino. Not only are we going to fight to end institutional racism, and a broken criminal justice system, we are going to provide jobs and education for our young people, not jails and incarceration. And, Let me say that as a member of the energy committee in the Senate, and the environmental committee, the debate is over. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world. We have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now, I have been criticized during this campaign for many, many things. Every single day, that's OK, that's alright. They're throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink, and I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well. But, what our campaign is about is thinking big, not small. It's about having the courage to reject the status quo. It's about saying that in a time when every major country on Earth guarantees healthcare to all of their people, we should be doing the same in our great country. In my view, under President Obama's leadership, the Affordable Care Act has been an important step forward, no question about it. But, we can, and must, do better. Twenty-nine million Americans should not remain uninsured, an even greater number should remain under- insured with large deductibles and co-payments. We should not be paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time -- listen to this, when the top three drug companies in this country made $45 billion dollars in profit last year. That is an obscenity, and let me tell you something. When we make it to the White House, the pharmaceutical industry will not continue to rip-off the American people. Further, it makes no sense that as a nation we continue to spend far, far more per capita than do the people of any other nation, all of whom guarantee healthcare to all of their people. That is why I believe in a Medicare for all, single-payer program which will not only guarantee healthcare for all, but will save the average middle class family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs. My friends, we all know that we live in a dangerous and complex world. As president I will defend this nation, but I will do it responsibly. I voted against the war in Iraq, and that was the right vote. While we must be relentless in combating terrorist who would do us harm, we cannot, and should not be the policeman of the world. Nor should we bear the burden of fighting terrorism alone. In the Middle East, the United States must remain part of an international coalition sustained by nations in the region that have the means to protect themselves. Together we must, and will, destroy ISIS, but we should do it in a way that does not put our young men and women in the military into perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East. My friends, we must fix our broken immigration system that divides families, and create a path towards citizenship for hardworking people who are living in the shadows. We must strengthen and expand Social Security, and increase the benefits that seniors, and disabled vets receive so that people can live in dignity in their retirement. We must rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and when we do that, we create millions of decent paying jobs. We must pursue the fight for women's rights, for gay rights, for disability rights. We must against stronger, and stronger, opposition protect the right of a woman to control her own body. We must protect the men and women who serve our nation in uniform, and protect our veterans who put their lives on the line to defend us. My friends, we must tell the billionaire class and the 1% that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start their paying their fair share of taxes. My friends, I am the son of a Polish immigrant who came to this country speaking no English, and having no money. My father worked everyday of his life, and he never made a whole lot. My Mom and Dad, and brother and I grew up in a small three and a half room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. My Mother, who died at a young age, always dreamed of moving out of that apartment, getting a home of her own, but she never realized that dream. The truth is that neither one of my parents could ever have dreamed that I would be here tonight standing before you as a candidate for President of the United States. This is the promise of America, and this is the promise we must keep alive for future generations. What began last week in Iowa, what voters here in New Hampshire confirm tonight, is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution. It is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together. It will bring together working people who have given up on the political process. It will bring together young people who have never participated in the political process. It will bring together blacks, and whites, latinos, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, straight and gay, male and female. People who were born in America, and people who immigrated here. We will all come together to say loudly, and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us, not just a few wealthy campaign contributors. That is what this campaign is about, that is what the political revolution is about. So, New Hampshire, thank you again. And, now it's time. Thank you, New Hampshire. And, now it's on to Nevada, South Carolina, and beyond."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 14, 2016","b'Interview with Chris Wallace of ""Fox News Sunday""'","b""WALLACE: Senator Sanders, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. SANDERS: My pleasure.WALLACE: There is already a fierce argument after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats say the president should name and the Senate should confirm his successor. Republicans say that should be left to the next president. Where do you stand, sir?SANDERS: No, I think we want a full contingent on the United States Supreme Court. We are dealing with enormously important issues. The Constitution is pretty clear. The president makes the appointment, Senate confirms, let's get on with that business.WALLACE: You disagreed with Justice Scalia on a judicial basis, not a personal basis, on almost every issue. What do you think his legacy is, sir?SANDERS: Well, clearly, he was a brilliant man. A very colorful man. Aa very outspoken man. And I happen to respect people who are willing to come under public scrutiny and serve their country. So you're right, Chris, he and I had very different points of view, but I respect people who are willing and prepared to serve their country.WALLACE: Senator Sanders, let's turn to politics. The Clinton campaign strategy now is that they have a firewall as the campaign turns west and south in states with much larger minority voters. She's beating you by 10 points according to the latest polls in Nevada, 30 points in South Carolina. Just how strong is the Clinton firewall?SANDERS: Well, you know, when we began this campaign, Chris, we were at 3 percent in the polls nationally. We were 50 points behind in Iowa, 30 points behind in New Hampshire. But clearly the results in both of those states turned out to be very different than when we were -- where we were when we started.I think we're going to surprise people in Nevada. I think we're going to surprise people in South Carolina. I am talking to you right now from Denver, Colorado, where we just had 18,000 people coming out to a rally. I think we're looking really good with a whole lot of momentum for Super Tuesday as well.WALLACE: But when you were talking about those polls, that was six months before the voting actually took place. We're talking a week or two before the voting takes place in South Carolina and Nevada. And, also, the Clintons have such long, deep ties to the African- American community. Why should a black voter choose you over Hillary Clinton? SANDERS: Well, I think because if you look at my life's work, if you look at the agenda and -- that we are bringing forth in terms of economics and criminal justice, this is an agenda that works for all Americans, but especially for those who are hardest hurt, hardest hit economically. We're talking about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next several years. We're talking about pay equity for women. We're talking about creating millions of decent paying jobs, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We are talking about focusing on the outrageously high rate of youth unemployment in the African- American community. We are talking about having the United States join the rest of the industrialized world guaranteeing health care to all, making tuition at public colleges and universities free so all of our kids, regardless of income, can get the higher education that they need. And we're also tackling, in a very aggressive way, a broken criminal justice system in which we have, Chris, as a nation, more people in jail than any other major country on earth, disproportionately African-American and Latino. We need a whole lot of work to make sure that we are providing education and jobs for our kids, rather than jails and incarceration.WALLACE: Senator, Priorities USA Action, the super PAC that is supporting Hillary Clinton, has just announced that it is going to spend $5 million now to help her instead of waiting until the general election. When you brought up that super PAC during the debate this week, she denied there was much of a relationship. Watch.[begin video clip]HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you had a super PAC, like President Obama had, which now says it wants to support me. It's not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.[end video clip]WALLACE: Senator, how close are Clinton's ties to that super PAC and, straight out, do you believe that the millions of dollars she's gotten in campaign donations and also in speaking fees from Wall Street, do you believe that they have bought influence with Secretary Clinton?SANDERS: Well, Chris, obviously -- I mean I don't think there is any debate, but that this super PAC is one in which the secretary has worked very, very hard to raise a whole lot money. If my memory is correct, in the last reporting period, they raised $25 million, $15 million of it coming from Wall Street.Now, she's obviously not the only candidate out there. Many Republicans are raising huge amounts of money from Wall Street as well. You know, every candidate says, hey, all of that money coming in from Wall Street, fossil fuel industry, it doesn't impact me. Every candidate says that. Well, the question that we ask are -- is Wall Street and all of these others billionaires and wealthy individuals, are they really so dumb? Why are they contributing so much money? I'll let the American people make that decision. WALLACE: Senator, one of the central points in your campaign, you say it over and over again, is that the American economic system is, in your words, rigged. But I want to go over some numbers with you. In 1981, the top 1 percent paid 17 percent of all income taxes. Now the top 1 percent pays 37 percent. Question, sir, if the wealthy have rigged the system, why have they done such a lousy job of it?SANDERS: Oh, Chris, I think you are missing the major point here. And that is, what we have seen in recent years is a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, whose percentage of wealth in America has doubled. We're talking about trillions of dollars going from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.WALLACE: But, sir, isn't a lot of that because of the economic policies of President Obama and of the Federal Reserve, which put interest rates at basically zero?SANDERS: No. These are policies that have gone on for a long, long time on the Republican administrations and Democratic administration. Now, are we better off today than we were when President Bush left office and we were losing 800,000 jobs a month? Of course we are. But for the last 40 years, what we have been seeing is a middle class disappearing, people working longer hours for low wages and today, as it happens, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. That's a rigged economy to my mind, Chris.WALLACE: Senator, you and Hillary Clinton got into it in this last debate over universal health care, Medicare for all as you call it. You say that it's a good deal for the American people.[begin video clip]SANDERS: The family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 more in taxes and get a reduction in their health care costs of $5,000.[end video clip]WALLACE: But, senator, Kenneth Thorpe (ph), who's a health care expert, who, in fact, helped devise the single payer plan in Vermont, says that you're wrong. That, in fact, your plan comes up about $1 trillion a year short and that 71 percent of families would be worse off under your plan than they are under the current system.SANDERS: Well, Kenneth Thorpe can say whatever he wants to say. A lot of the assumptions that he made in his analysis are absolutely incorrect. Chris, here's where we are as a nation. This is not debatable. We have 29 million people without any health insurance. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Millions of our people have huge deductibles and co-payments. And, yet, per capita, we are spending almost three times more than the British, who cover all their people, 50 percent more than the French, and far more than the Canadians.WALLACE: Kenneth Thorpe says that it's exactly -- the problems with your plan are exactly the reason that you're own state of Vermont had to drop single payer.SANDERS: Kenneth Thorpe, I mean, you know, you've quote one guy. I think there was just a piece in one of the newspapers today by some of the most -- foremost experts on single payer systems who really denounced Kenneth Thorpe and his analysis. I respectfully disagree with Mr. Thorpe.WALLACE: Finally, sir, the Republicans have held debates on all the networks, but the Democrats, so far, have refused to hold a debate on Fox. You are coming on here tonight. We're very grateful. I hope you feel that you haven't been mistreated. Would you be willing to participate in a Democratic debate on Fox News?SANDERS: If we went -- were clear to understand what the game -- the guidelines were and what the rules were and to make sure that they were fair and the DNC was in favor of it, I would have no objection.WALLACE: Well, you -- I assume you've seen this interview we just did. I hope you've seen the interviews we've done with the Republicans.SANDERS: Well, I have seen this interview -- Chris, I have seen this interview, but I have also seen other interviews. So if I could have a guarantee and knew who the questioners were and if the framework for the debate was fair, I would have no objection.WALLACE: Well, I'll take that as a definite maybe. Senator Sanders, we want to thank you so much for coming on. Please come back, sir.SANDERS: OK. Thank you very much, Chris."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 25, 2016","b'Remarks with Chris Matthews at the MSNBC ""Hardball"" College Tour at the University of Chicago'","b'MATTHEWS: Well, I didn\'t know I was going to do this, Senator. Thank you for doing this.But I have to ask you the meaning of those lyrics to you, Woody Guthrie?SANDERS: Just turns out yesterday we were in Oklahoma. Woody Guthrie means a lot to me. He was one of the great song writers in modern American history. There\'s a museum in Oklahoma, Tulsa, for him. We use his song, ""This Land is Your Land"" at many of our rallies. I think what he did is capture the spirit of working Americans, of poor people. In an extraordinary way, he brought together people like Ledbetter, Pete Seeger and Woody -- and others to create a whole moment for folk music in this country. An extraordinary man. MATTHEWS: I know that you did an album -- SANDERS: Oh, God, please. [laughter] You\'re using Woody Guthrie\'s name and my name in an album, not a good idea, no. [laughter]MATTHEWS: Well, this could be serious business. The presidency of the United States, the American presidency, has four hats the way I can figure. The first hat, of course, is chief executive, responsibility of the entire federal government and its efficiency and honesty. Secondly, head of state. You represent the American people to the world and to themselves. Head of government through your legislative program. And the one I want to talk about first is commander-in-chief. SANDERS: Well, you forgot one important thing, Chris. MATTHEWS: Go for it. SANDERS: To represent the American people. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: Represent working people and poor people and elderly. People who are being shafted today who need in the wealthiest country in the history of the world the right to have a decent standard of living and the right know that their government is not controlled by billionaires in a corrupt campaign finance system. So, one of the reasons I\'m running for president, everything you said is true, is to transform American society to take on a corrupt campaign finance system, a rigged economy and a broken criminal justice system. So, when I look at what my agenda is, it\'s everything that you said -- MATTHEWS: Yes.SANDERS: -- but it\'s more than that. MATTHEWS: Let me ask you about the role of commander-in-chief however. Can you see yourself -- I\'ve heard -- your speeches are resounding and you have a powerful message and an agenda probably clear than most candidates have ever had. When it comes to the job, it brings certainly responsibilities you may not look for, but you\'re going to get.SANDERS: Of course.MATTHEWS: Sitting in the Situation Room, calling in a lethal drone strike. Can you see yourself in that position now? SANDERS: Absolutely, absolutely. Look, I am very proud of my achievement in terms of foreign. I\'ve been all over the world, talked to a whole lot of people.Chris, as you well know, the most important decision that Congress made in many, many years in terms of foreign policy was the war in Iraq. Now, it\'s not just that I voted against the war, which is the right vote. It\'s not that I led the opposition, helped lead the opposition against the war. Check out what I said on the floor of the House. Check out what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein, a vicious dictator, was overthrown. Pretty good judgment. And I think when you talk about my views now and how we destroy ISIS through a coalition, through Muslim troops on the ground, I think my positions are pretty clear and in fact right. MATTHEWS: How do we -- you as the president convince potential adversaries and current ones that we\'re not a country and you\'re not a person to be messed with? How do you establish that -- remember, Kennedy got in trouble because of the Bay of Pigs then came the Cuban missile crisis. Once you look weak, then they come at you. SANDERS: Well -- MATTHEWS: How do you deal with that? SANDERS: Well, first of all, I don\'t know that I accept your basic assumptions here. Obviously, anyone who knows my political history, I\'ve taken on every special interest in this country. I am fairly tough guy. When I was mayor of Burlington, I take on everybody. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: I am prepared to take on Putin and everybody else. But let\'s -- MATTHEWS: How do you let them know that? SANDERS: You let them know that we have the strongest military in the world. We have a great military and we are prepared to use that when necessary. But let me also say, that I think the kind of regime change the United States has brought forth over many, many years has been counterproductive, all right? It\'s not the war in Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, that was a terrible mistake, leading to where we are today. You go way back and you talk about the overthrowing of Mossadegh. You remember Mossadegh in Iran? MATTHEWS: We were wrong about it.SANDERS: Oh, he was -- he wanted to nationalize oil there. The British were upset. The Eisenhower administration worked with him. And you know we ended up with Khomeini? All right? We overthrew Salvador Allende in Chile, who was elected democratically. And you know what we ended up with? A lot of anti-American sentiment in Latin America.So, what foreign policy is about is not just power. It is judgment. I think we got to be a little bit careful about regime change. Hillary Clinton sees as a mentor of hers, Henry Kissinger. So, let me be very clear: I do not see Henry Kissinger as a mentor of mine. I think he was one of the worst secretaries of state in the history of this country. MATTHEWS: Well, let\'s add to the list, Arbenz down in Guatemala.SANDERS: That\'s right, exactly.MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about that. Let\'s talk about Trujillo. We had something to do with that baby.SANDERS: That\'s right. MATTHEWS: And something to do probably with Patrice Lumumba. We had a long history of -- but now we have something as you say regime change. So, instead of unofficial or official assassination policy, we now have a regime change policy. You know I\'m looking at Libya, what did you think of that? SANDERS: Not much.MATTHEWS: We ended up killing the leaders anyway. We got rid of Gadhafi, Saddam Hussein -- SANDERS: And what happened? What happened the day after? Look, you know, Saddam Hussein, a brutal murdering thug, no question about it. A Gadhafi equal, bad guy. So, Hillary Clinton and other people worked hard. They got rid of him. He was killed. And what happened right now? ISIS now has a foothold in Libya, which can be a testing ground, an operational strength, stronghold for them in terrorist attacks. So, here\'s the point. All of us agree you have a lot of bad, bad people running countries around the world. But it\'s not good enough to say Assad is a terrible guy. He is. What happens the day after Assad is gone? What is the best way to transition to democracy? So, on this area, I would say Hillary Clinton and I have a difference. It\'s not just the war in Iraq which she supported, I opposed. It is -- I\'m a little more cautious in terms of regime change. MATTHEWS: So, you\'re sitting in the White House and you\'re reading the op-ed page in ""The Washington Post"" and ""The New York Times"" and ""The Wall Street Journal"", and they start the drum beat for another regime change. You know what happened last time, page after page -- SANDERS: You got it, man. MATTHEWS: -- day after day, they start pounding the door. They said, ""We got to get rid of Bashar Assad."" What do you do? SANDERS: You stand up to them. Look, you\'re absolutely right. The war drums for the war in Iraq, I remember like it was yesterday. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: Initially, the American people were very nervous about that war. You remember that? MATTHEWS: I remember it all. SANDERS: And the media kept pounding, well, you\'ve got to be tough and he\'s a terrible guy and they have weapons of mass destruction. The trick is not just to understand that we\'ve got a lot of bad people around the world. The trick is to understand what happens the day after you get rid of those people. This is a lesson I think I have learned not just from Iraq. It\'s a lesson I knew a long, long time ago. MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about an alternative world if you were president after 9/11. 9/11 happened, let\'s go back, I know there\'s really good arguments to be made that if you\'re secretary of state, you came in, and said, al Qaeda is about to attack United States, you probably would have done something. SANDERS: Sure. MATTHEWS: Right?SANDERS: Of course.MATTHEWS: OK, let\'s talk about afterwards. The president had the country united. He stood down there at Ground Zero. He had the firefighter right next to him. Everybody was with him. He went to Afghanistan. Would you have done that? Would you have done that? SANDERS: Well, first of all, what you want is -- and what I believe also very importantly, if what the lesson of Iraq is, very simply, United States of America cannot and should not be doing it alone. You can\'t do it alone. You need coalition. You need coalition. And especially when you\'re dealing with countries and Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria, you need people on the ground. And this is -- I understand, this is tough stuff. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: President Obama -- MATTHEWS: What happens when nobody joins your posse? SANDERS: Well -- MATTHEWS: Korea, they joined us. We had the Turks on our side. We had South Koreans fighting on our side.SANDERS: We are not the policeman of world. We\'ve got people sleeping out on the street a few blocks away from here. You\'ve got 29 people who have no health insurance. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: We are spending more money than the following bottom that the next nine countries of this world on the military. So, yes, we have got to be strong. We have got to protect our allies around the world. We have to protect ourselves from the dangers of terrorisms. No ifs, buts and maybes.My foreign policy would be a little different I think than Secretary Clintons. MATTHEWS: So, if we don\'t have allies, we don\'t go? SANDERS: Look, you\'re asking me a hypothetical. But in general -- MATTHEWS: No, we have a situation now where nobody is going to help with ISIS.SANDERS: Look, what I am telling you -- MATTHEWS: It\'s not hypothetical, Senator. Nobody is joining us in fighting ISIS. There\'s nobody over there on the ground fighting.SANDERS: Well, they damn well better start working with us. MATTHEWS: Nobody from our side.SANDERS: That\'s not quite true. That\'s not quite true. MATTHEWS: Well, we have -- SANDERS: It\'s not quite true. You have King Abdullah of Jordan that\'s making it very clear the way you destroy ISIS is with Muslim troops on the ground. We have got to provide air supports and other types of supports. MATTHEWS: But are they there? Are the Jordanians fighting?SANDERS: We have to build that -- we are making, as you know, thank God, a little bit of progress. Now, nobody here believes that the Iraqi army has been an effective fighting force. But the truth is, finally, with American help, they were able to retake Ramadi, as you know. ISIS has lost 40 percent of the territory it controlled in Iraq over the last year. So, maybe, knock on wood, we are making progress.MATTHEWS: Why did we tear apart the Iraqi army? SANDERS: Well, don\'t ask me. I mean, ask the Bush administration. You\'re right. You know, so what we said to the Baath people, ""Well, you\'re terrible, awful people. You\'re not going to lose your jobs. You\'re going to lose your money."" Right? ""Your income, you\'re not going to be able the take care of your family."" Aren\'t we shocked? MATTHEWS: And they all joined ISIS.SANDERS: Yes.MATTHEWS: What a shock that was. SANDERS: OK. Let\'s talk about. This is a tough one and I don\'t have the answer that\'s why I\'m giving you the question, all right? Gitmo. There are people in Gitmo -- we can argue about the numbers. There\'s numbers of men down there, men, who we\'re scared of. We think they are true terrorists. We know they\'re going to get us the minute we let them go, but we can\'t bring them to court for lack of evidence, because they may not have committed a crime by our laws. What do we do with them? Well, you shut down -- I think the president is right. You shut down Gitmo. MATTHEWS: But what do you do with these people? SANDERS: Well, you -- MATTHEWS: Dangerous people you can\'t convict. SANDERS: Well, you put them in American jails and you do the best -- look -- MATTHEWS: What happens though when the ACLU, good organization, comes forward and says, these people deserve a trial, you have to release them? I know it happens because they\'re on U.S. territory. Isn\'t that we have on Gitmo, so they\'re not in U.S. territory? SANDERS: Well, I actually visited Gitmo. You know, I was there. And all I can tell you is that Gitmo is -- sends a signal to the entire Muslim world, the much of the world, the United States talks a good game about democracy, but take a look at Gitmo. You know, they\'re running a prison camp. So -- MATTHEWS: But what do you do with these guys? SANDERS: I don\'t -- I don\'t have all the answers but I do believe we should shut down Gitmo. MATTHEWS: But if we let them go under your watch then you\'re responsible for their conduct. SANDERS: They\'re not going to go and I\'m not going to let them go and start, you know, waging terrorist attacks against the United States. Let me get to one point. MATTHEWS: Sure, good.SANDERS: All those issues are important. Let me get to an issue that\'s more important, if I might, all right? And that issue is we\'re going to change nothing in the United States unless we address a corrupt campaign finance system. And I\'ll tell you something very interesting, Chris. You know, I go all over the country as I campaign. You know what I find, it\'s not just progressives. It is conservatives.MATTHEWS: I agree.SANDERS: OK? Who are saying, what is going on in America when you have billionaires now spending unlimited sums of money buying elections?And what this campaign is about is trying to bring about a political revolution. MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: Because I acknowledge at every speech that I give is that no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else can do it alone. And you know why? Because Wall Street and corporate America and the big campaign donors and the corporate media, by the way, are so powerful that we are not going to change America unless millions of people stand up and fight back. That is the most important issue. MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about that when we come back. I want to focus on you would get a Supreme Court associate justice nominee, at least given respect by the Republican-dominated Senate.SANDERS: That\'s right.MATTHEWS: Because without doing that, you can\'t change the court, you can\'t get rid of Citizens United. We\'ll be right back with Senator Bernie Sanders. [applause]We\'re live at the University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics with ""Hardball"" college tour. [commercial break][applause]MATTHEWS: Welcome back to the ""Hardball"" tour with Senator Bernie Sanders in University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics.We were talking about Citizens United. And it\'s a big issue for you and the country, I agree. The question is, how do we replace the Supreme Court seat left by Antonin Scalia? How do you get the Republican leadership led by Mitch McConnell who\'s one of your colleagues, even to give a hearing? The president doesn\'t seem to be able to move these people. SANDERS: Look, Chris, what we have and, you know, I\'m in the Senate and have been throughout Obama\'s tenure, we have a level of obstructionism which I believe is unprecedented in the history of the United States. And what happened, as you know, literally on the day that Obama was sworn in, these guys got together and they said, all right, how do we make sure that Obama is as ineffective as possible? How do we stall, stall, stall? I\'m there and I\'ve seen them. We can\'t get an assistant, you know, sanitation worker approved without going through all kinds of processes. So, this is just a continuation of that. And you asked me the question of what do we do about it? First of all, let me be very clear, I will do everything that I can to see that the president does make a nomination and that the United States Senate holds the hearings to either approve or disapprove. That\'s what the Constitution mandates. There\'s no debate about that, is there? MATTHEWS: Nope.SANDERS: And the idea -- MATTHEWS: Article 2 says name a nominee. SANDERS: That\'s right.MATTHEWS: It\'s his job, the president. SANDERS: It is as clear as the nose on our faces, and yet these people are so obstructionist they don\'t even want to give this president the right to fulfill his constitutional duty. So, I will do everything that I can to make it happen. But you raised a broader question. You asked, well, what do we do about it?And I\'ll tell you, this is what the campaign is about. I know it\'s outside of mainstream thinking. Are you ready for this one, Chris? MATTHEWS: Yes. SANDERS: All right.MATTHEWS: I think I can take it. SANDERS: All right. Take it. I don\'t want anyone collapsing on me here.It is to revitalize American democracy on issue after issue. And it\'s not just Republican obstructionism on this issue. You have a Congress that does the bidding of the billionaire class, of the campaign dollars. You know. You\'re there all the time. Half the members of Congress are spending their life raising money, right? And it\'s getting worse and worse and worse.So, this is what you got to do. What you need to do is rally the American people. Give you an example -- raising the minimum wage, overwhelming support for raising the minimum wage. Congress does not want to do it. Pay equity for women workers. Congress doesn\'t want to do it. MATTHEWS: Obama can\'t do this, but you can. How? SANDERS: I\'ll tell you. What you need and what I say is you need a political revolution. And that is you need these young people to understand and working people and low income people, if they are not involved actively in the political process, it will be the billionaire class who makes decisions for them and not necessarily in their interest. MATTHEWS: But you get elected. Let\'s say you get elected, you take off next January 20th. And you walk up to the Senate and you meet with the leadership and say, I have a program here. I want to have free -- I mean, government-funded tuition for public universities. There\'s things I want done on Social Security to increase benefits and things I want done on health care, so it can become like Medicare for life. You\'ve got very strong positions. SANDERS: Right.MATTHEWS: And Mitch McConnell looks at you the way he looked at President Obama and says, ""Forget about it"". SANDERS: And then you know what I say? I\'d say, ""Hey, Mitch, take a look out the window. There\'s a million young people out there who don\'t want to be in debt for half their life for the crime of going to college. If you want to antagonize those million people and lose your job, Mitch, if you don\'t want to lose your job, you better start listening to what we have to say."" That\'s the point. That\'s how change takes place. MATTHEWS: But how do you squeeze a guy like him? SANDERS: It\'s not him. Mitch is -- MATTHEWS: All the Republicans. SANDERS: I know Mitch McConnell. These are smart -- MATTHEWS: How do you squeeze 60 senators? You need 60 senators. You need 60 senators. SANDERS: All right. Let me tell you this. Absolutely, positively, 100 percent, if we rally young people in this country to say, you know what, Germany, Scandinavia, other countries, they have free tuition in public college and universities. I have been all over this country, Chris. I talked to kids $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $100,000 in debt paying a huge percentage of their income, OK?Young people stand up and say we are sick and tired of it. We don\'t want to go in debt for our whole lives because we got a college education. You know what? We\'ll win that fight immediately. But the trick is not to appeal to Mitch McConnell. It\'s to say, Mitch, take a look at your e-mails. MATTHEWS: OK. What evidence do you have this has worked for you? Have you increased the turnout in these elections? SANDERS: Look -- MATTHEWS: You know, have you as a senator been able to get 60 votes for anything? Have you ever been able to do this, what you\'re talking about doing? When you say I can get 60 senators -- [crosstalk]SANDERS: Well, I am not the president of -- MATTHEWS: OK.SANDERS: What I am saying to you, Chris -- MATTHEWS: What evidence do you have you can do it? SANDERS: What evidence do I have?MATTHEWS: That you can do it.SANDERS: The evidence that I have is that\'s the only way change is about --MATTHEWS: Right, I agree with you.SANDERS: -- in this country. That\'s what the civil rights movement was about. That\'s what the women\'s movement, gay movement. MATTHEWS: It\'s necessary, but is it sufficient? SANDERS: That\'s called, that\'s the way -- MATTHEWS: Is it sufficient to get it done? They\'re running their own states with their own conservative constituencies that will say, fine, Bernie Sanders is a liberal president. SANDERS: Let me give you an example.MATTHEWS: He\'s a progressive. I\'m not one -- [crosstalk]SANDERS: Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example.MATTHEWS: How do you know you can do it? SANDERS: How do I know? I don\'t know anything. I think that we do the best that we can do. We try. But let me give you an example, all right? If you and I were sitting here 10 years ago, and I said to you, you know, Chris, I think in 2015, gay marriage will be legal -- MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: -- in every state in this country, what would you have told me? You would have told me I\'d be crazy, right? Honestly? That\'s what you would have told me. Are you thinking about it? [laughter]MATTHEWS: I can\'t see the future. SANDERS: All right.MATTHEWS: But you\'re right it moved very quickly. The country moved very quickly.SANDERS: It moved quickly because people in the gay community and their straight allies said, people in this country have a right.MATTHEWS: Yes.SANDERS: The law, whoever they want. And then, suddenly, do you see any Republicans -- MATTHEWS: How does this relate? How does this relate to Citizens United?SANDERS: Chris, let me answer your question. MATTHEWS: I don\'t see the connection. [crosstalk]SANDERS: I see all the connection. MATTHEWS: OK.SANDERS: You\'re asking me how we make change. [applause]And I\'m tell you, you make change not by sitting down with Mitch McConnell. You make change when millions of people in this country demand change. That\'s the way change has always been. [cheers and applause]Chris, it\'s not just -- I use gay rights, which is a good example, contemporary example for these young people to understand. Take the [inaudible] gay rights what\'s the big deal? Trust me 10 years ago, 20 years ago, when I voted against DOMA in 1996, that was a very difficult vote. But what about the civil rights movement? What about the women\'s movement? It always happened when millions of people demand change? And right now, where we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the top 1/10th percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, you know what, we do need -- [crosstalk]MATTHEWS: It seems to me that the reason we got gay marriage, same sex marriage, is when to Prop 8 in California, they couldn\'t find anybody, Ted Olson knows this, there was nobody on the other side. California didn\'t have a case. There was no damage done by gay marriage.And that\'s what happened. There were no losers. Now, when you\'re offering -- SANDERS: Whoa, whoa. MATTHEWS: Well, they couldn\'t make a case against it. Now, what you\'re offering -- SANDERS: Hold it. I don\'t agree with it. No, I don\'t agree with that.MATTHEWS: OK, go ahead.SANDERS: You have all of these fundamentalists. MATTHEWS: But they didn\'t lose. SANDERS: All of these people -- MATTHEWS: They disagree but they didn\'t lose. SANDERS: I think they lost. MATTHEWS: OK, let me ask you about money. If we get tuition money, it has to come from someone. Those will be the people who lose. If you have larger Social Security benefits, the higher income people during their working lives will be the ones who lose. We get arithmetic here. So, there will be tremendous forces against everything you\'ve advocated here. SANDERS: That\'s right.MATTHEWS: It\'s not like saying, nobody is staying up all night worrying about gay marriage, because -- SANDERS: OK, good point.MATTHEWS: But this thing they are losing money. SANDERS: Right.MATTHEWS: The interests at work here, the very interests you\'ve talked about are still going to be the day after you\'re inaugurated. SANDERS: That\'s right.MATTHEWS: So, what do you with that? [crosstalk]SANDERS: Let me rephrase it. What you\'re saying, correct me if I\'m wrong, is you\'ve got a very powerful billionaire class who wants it all and will resist any change. MATTHEWS: Anyone with substantial wealth or in 401(k), or mutual fund will want to hold on their money. [crosstalk]SANDERS: What you\'re talking about is the Koch brothers and corporate America -- MATTHEWS: And everyone in the stock market. SANDERS: And people who will have -- who are very, very wealthy. So, let me just -- MATTHEWS: Anyone in the stock market. SANDERS: Chris, let me just say this -- not anyone, all right? [crosstalk] Let me just say this if I might, all right?In the last 30 years, you know what\'s happened? There\'s been a massive redistribution of wealth. You know that?MATTHEWS: I agree completely. SANDERS: It\'s gone from the middle class and working families to the top 1/10th of 1 percent. I didn\'t hear the establishment moaning about how radical and crazy it was when trillions of dollars left the pockets of middle class. Now, when I\'m talking about giving the middle class a break, all these guys -- MATTHEWS: No, you\'re giving a normative argument, I agree with it. The question, how do you get it done, with all these powers arrayed against you? SANDERS: Then, let me -- MATTHEWS: The finance committee [inaudible], how do we have to raise taxes on Wall Street? [crosstalk]If you go to 50 cent tax on $100, we have to get that tax passed. Then, somewhere [inaudible] you have to be dedicated to paying for tuition bills. These are hard things to get done.SANDERS: What are you saying? Let\'s be clear, OK? Let me be very clear. I believe in the year 2016, a college degree today is about the equivalent of a high school degree 50, 60 years. MATTHEWS: I agree with that. SANDERS: All right. So, I believe that when we talk about public education, it shouldn\'t be first grade through 12th. It should be through college, OK?I believe that public colleges and universities, not the University of Chicago, sorry guys -- but public colleges and universities should be tuition free, so that every kid in this country -- look, I grew up in family that didn\'t have a lot of money. My parents never went to college. I want every kid who has the ability to do so, to go to college. Now, I also want to deal with an issue you guys are worried about is student debt, is that true? AUDIENCE: Yes.SANDERS: All right. We got millions of people really being crushed with student debt. My idea is to merge the two, OK? Now, you\'re asking me how to pay for it. I\'ll tell you -- MATTHEWS: I haven\'t asked you that. I\'ve asked you, how do you pass it through the Senate? How do you get 60 votes for any of this?SANDERS: We\'re going to pay for it through tax on Wall Street. MATTHEWS: Who\'s going to pass that tax? SANDERS: The American -- MATTHEWS: The Senate\'s going to pass that. SANDERS: Chris, you and I look at the world differently. You look at it inside the beltway. I\'m not an inside the beltway guy. I\'m an outside the beltway guy. MATTHEWS: But the people that vote on taxes are inside the beltway.SANDERS: And those people are going to vote the right way when millions of people demand they vote the right way on this issue. I have no doubt that as president of the United States I can rally young people and their parents to say that if Germany does it, Scandinavia does it, countries around the world do it, we can do it. And yes, we bailed out Wall Street. It\'s Wall Street\'s time to help the middle class. [applause]MATTHEWS: The next Senate leader, Democratic leader is probably Chuck Schumer of New York. Can you deliver his votes tonight? Can you tell me one senator who\'s going to follow you for these proposals? They are all good, decent proposals. In fact, the moral proposals. Tell me the votes. Who\'s going to vote with you? SANDERS: Yes, I know Chuck very, very well.MATTHEWS: Is he going to vote with you?SANDERS: Well, call him up. I don\'t know. [laughter]MATTHEWS: You gave us one vote. You say I will give you 60 votes and pass it, and you can\'t give me one vote. Your vote, but you won\'t be in the Senate anymore.SANDERS: Chris, I didn\'t say I can give you one vote.Look, what you\'re not catching -- I have to say this respectfully, all right? You\'re a nice guy. You\'re missing the point. All right? You\'re missing the point. If you look at politics today as a zero sum total -- MATTHEWS: Right.SANDERS: If you\'re looking at 63 percent of the American people not voting, 80 percent of the young people not voting. Billionaires buying elections, you\'re right. I\'m not looking at that world. MATTHEWS: How is that going to change the day you\'re in office? You won\'t have a Supreme Court on your side, do you? How are you going to get -- [crosstalk]SANDERS: What I will have is millions of people demanding -- MATTHEWS: You need 60 votes to get a Supreme Court nominee. SANDERS: We\'re going around in circles here. MATTHEWS: No, we\'re starting at the very point of, can you do what you say you will do? SANDERS: Yes, damn right, I can do what I say. [crosstalk]MATTHEWS: How you do it?SANDERS: Because when I get elected -- MATTHEWS: Have you ever done anything like this? Have you ever got 60 votes for anything in the Senate? SANDERS: Yes, actually we have. MATTHEWS: Yes, what was it? SANDERS: My veterans bill.MATTHEWS: OK.SANDERS: A comprehensive veterans bill, strongest veterans bill passed in many, many years.But that as a senator. Now, I\'m hopefully the president of the United States and we have the bully pulpit.So, the difference that you and I have -- MATTHEWS: So is Obama.SANDERS: The difference that you and I have is you\'re looking at politics in the way it is today.MATTHEWS: Yes.SANDERS: But I am trying to do is not just pass legislation. I\'m trying to change the pace of American politics, getting working people to stand up and fight for their rights. I think when we talk about issues like creating millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. MATTHEWS: I know. I\'m with that. [crosstalk]SANDERS: Yes.MATTHEWS: Suppose you propose, all this legislation and nothing happens, you just sit in office for four year years? SANDERS: I suspect not. MATTHEWS: Well, what would you do? Suppose they say no?SANDERS: Look, first of all -- MATTHEWS: You assume everything is going to change. A million people will not stand stay outside your window for four years. They\'re not going to be out the window. They may come once. SANDERS: Well, you are assuming and this is the difference between our views. You are assuming that the American people are not going to be engaged in the political process. But I think by definition -- MATTHEWS: No, I\'m watching the turn out figure this is year and they\'re not going up. SANDERS: Wait a minute, wait a minute. MATTHEWS: Not on the Democratic side.SANDERS: Let\'s -- first of all, let\'s jump into that. Barack Obama in 2008 ran, in my view, one of the great campaigns in the history of the United States of America. You and nobody else heard me say that, you know, we\'re going to run a better than he did. It was a brilliant campaign.But this is what I will tell you, Chris, when I started this campaign I was at 3 percent in the polls. In the last ten days there have been four national polls that I\'ve seen, three of them had me in the lead, one, two points down.We have come a long, long way. In terms of voter turnout, no. The voter turnout was not what Obama did in 2008. And by the way, though, in that election to talk about little politics, you had John Edwards, you had other candidates in there bringing in vote. The voter turn out actually in Iowa was strong, in New Hampshire, very strong. In Nevada not strong, which is why we lost.So, our job is, in fact, to make sure that these young people come out, working class people come out to vote.MATTHEWS: Is everybody here going to vote? [applause]MATTHEWS: We\'ll be back with questions from the audience right here at University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics. The Hardball college tour with Senator Bernie Sanders continues after this.[commercial break]MATTHEWS: Welcome back to the Hardball College Tour.By the way, look at that picture. That\'s Chamberlain House, one of the dorms here at the University of Chicago, where Senator Bernie Sanders lived when he was a student here. We\'ll have more on his career here in the excitement of those days that involved a lot of activities by this guy here.Anyway, we want to get our first question from the students. Go ahead.QUESTION: Thank you very much for all you\'re doing.Earlier in the campaign you notably decided not to focus on Hillary\'s emails. Now, as the campaign has increased in intensity, do you believe it\'s time to bring up the millions of dollars that the Clinton Foundation received from foreign government when she was secretary of state?SANDERS: Look, what I have tried to do as somebody who has never run a negative campaign, a negative ad in my entire life, is to try to focus on the issues I think are impacting the American people.You raise an important issue. I understand that. And I have talked about the fact that illary Clinton has received many millions of dollars from Wall Street for her campaign and her super PACs. She\'s received very large speakers fees from Goldman Sachs, I think those are important issues.And by the way I agree with The New York Times editorial. I don\'t know if anyone saw it today where they urged Secretary Clinton to release the transcripts of the speeches that she gave behind closed doors to Wall Street.So, those are issues that I am going to focus on.But right now my focus is to contrast my views on how we can improve life for the middle class and working families of this country. But thanks very much for that question.MATTHEWS: Go ahead.QUESTION: Hi, Senator Sanders. Welcome back. My name is Igala Obe (ph).Your opponent\'s new line is that she is the one who can break down barriers that all people face. However, the reality is that many of the barriers in place especially for low income individuals and people of color were created by the policies put in place during the Clinton administration.Given this reality, do you feel that this claim of breaking down barriers is a little ironic and how are you in a better position to do so?SANDERS: Thank you very much. Very good question. And I think you make a good point. As I mentioned the other day we had a press conference on this.In 1996, the Clinton administration, then First Lady Clinton was very active in so called welfare reform. You familiar with what that was? And welfare reform really picked up on the Republican agenda. And it said that one of the basic problems in America is that poor people and, by the way, African-Americans, were ripping off the welfare system.Well, everybody believes in welfare reform if it means helping people get the education, the child care and the jobs they need to improve their lives. That\'s not what that bill did. That bill ended up increasing very significantly, extreme poverty in America. It caused a lot of suffering for some of the most poorest and most vulnerable in this country.So, I think your point is exactly correct. And I think that\'s an issue we will be talking about a whole lot. Thank you.MATTHEWS: You\'re up next. This is fast.QUESTION: Senator Sanders. Thank you for being here. My name is Patrick Quinn. My question is the recent firing of Chicago Police Superintendent McCarthy highlights the fact that even intended reformers can fail in the face of institutional power.As president, how would you reform our criminal justice system?MATTHEWS: Great question. And it\'s an issue that is very, very high on my agenda.We have a broken criminal justice system. Everybody in this room and everybody in this country should be ashamed that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people, more than China, largely African-American and Latino.So, let me tell you some of the things that I would do. First of all, what we do is try to prevent people from getting into the criminal justice system.What does that mean? Today, if you\'re an African-American kid between 17 and 20 and you graduated high school, you didn\'t go to college, do you know what your unemployment and underemployment rate is? Unemployment and underemployment rate it? It is 51 percent. 51 percent.So, my view is we will invest in jobs and education for those kids rather than jails and incarceration.Second of all, we have to create, and the federal government can play an important role dealing with local municipalities, creating a model program for police departments.For example, lethal force should be the last resort, not the first resort.Second of all, if a individual is killed by a police officer or dies in police custody, that should automatically trigger a Department of Justice investigation.Thirdly, we want to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of their diversity. [applause]SANDERS: Fourthly, we want to demilitarize police departments.Fifthly, we want to take a hard look at the so-called war on drugs. Million of people in this country have police records, and disproportionally African-American by the way, because of possession of marijuana. I find it interesting in criminal justice that people on Wall Street who\'s illegal behavior destroyed our economy, they don\'t get a police record. Some kid in Chicago gets picked up with marijuana, he or she gets a police record. That\'s not right. [applause]QUESTION: Hi, Senator Sanders. My name is Sid Jayne. Thank you for being here, first of all. So, my question is, I was hoping you could elaborate more on the Apple privacy debate and what your broader plans are, once elected, to tackle the issue of government surveillance?SANDERS: That\'s a huge issue. And it\'s a very, very important issue. You\'re looking at a guy who voted against the USA PATRIOT Act. And that was a hard vote. You know, sometimes it becomes easier -- this is after 9/11, it wasn\'t such an easy vote.And my concern then and my concern now is that the NSA and the government, they\'re keeping records on all of your phone calls, on many of your phone calls. They have the ability, and occasionally use it, to go into the websites you visit and check out your emails.But you know what, it is not just the government, it is corporate America as well who knows a whole lot about your purchasing habits, maybe your banking records, maybe your medical records as well. So, the bottom line here...MATTHEWS: Explain how they use that.SANDERS: Well, I don\'t know.Well, if I know the products that you buy, then I know how to advertise and get to you.But the bottom line here is there has been a revolution in technology in the last 20 years. Public policy has in no way kept pace with the transformation of our society.Now, to answer your question, this is a tough issue. On one hand, do we want to keep tabs on ISIS recruiting efforts? Yeah, you\'re damn right we do. On the other hand, do we want to open the door so that the federal government now knows much too much about you more than they should. How do you achieve that balance is not easy. That\'s the issue that we have got to answer. MATTHEWS: Where are you on Snowden?SANDERS: You know, I think Snowden broke the law. That\'s true. And I think he deserves his day in court to make his case.On the other hand, there would not be a whole lot of discussion that we\'re hearing today if Snowden did not come forward and tell us what the NSA was doing.MATTHEWS: So, you wouldn\'t throw the book at him?SANDERS: No, I would not throw the book at him.MATTHEWS: OK. We\'re going to come right back. We\'re going talk about to the senator what he was like when he was the age of you guys here at this school. There are some amazing stories I want him to talk about.Much more from Senator Sanders when we come back. You\'re watching the Hardball College Tour live from the University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics.[commercial break]MATTHEWS: OK, that\'s the Red Dirt (ph) brass band. They\'re all students at the University of Chicago. Those guys are heading to New Orleans, as you can tell.Anyway, it\'s great having them.We\'re back with the Hardball college tour. Live from the University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics.Let me get to some of these things about you.SANDERS: About me. I\'d rather talk about you.MATTHEWS: We don\'t want to fight anymore. I can\'t fight it. I\'ve done my fighting.Let me ask you about the \'60s. And I always try to tell -- I\'m only a few years behind you. And I always tell people -- my kids love to talk about the -- my grandkids, if I live long enough -- they love the \'60s. What did it feel like? What was the zeitgeist like in the 60s here when you were here?SANDERS: Well, you know, to be honest with you, I don\'t say that just because I\'m on TV, I was not much into drugs. My hair was a little bit long, not that long.MATTHEWS: We\'ve got pictures. We\'ll show one up.SANDERS: For me, coming here to the University of Chicago I think in 61 or 62, what was mind blowing for me was beginning to get involved with a whole lot of people who are very different from the people I grew up with this Brooklyn.And I became involved in the civil rights movement. I think one of the first jobs that I ever had here in Chicago was with what was called the Packing House Workers of America. And this used to be of major...MATTHEWS: Mostly African-Americans.SANDERS: Often African-Americans, right, that\'s right. And, you know, that\'s all gone now.But I learned about the trade union movement here. I learned about the civil rights movement. I learned about foreign policy and the peace movement.MATTHEWS: What was it like to get involved in it to the extent for you to be arrested?SANDERS: Here\'s what it was, the hard work and the dangerous work was being done in the south, that\'s where people were getting killed.MATTHEWS: Chaney (ph) and Goodman.SANDERS: Exactly. And their heads bashed off or getting killed.This is what we did here. We said we are going to provide -- you know, I didn\'t have any money, but, you know, we\'re going to provide some financial support for our friends in the south. But we have got to look at what\'s going on here in Chicago as well.And I want to say this to the young people here at the University of Chicago, back in the early 1960s -- the University of Chicago, as you know, owns a lot of property, owns a lot of apartments. In those days, many of those apartments were segregated. They were segregated.And what we did, Chris, is we would send a black couple, husband and wife, to an apartment. And they\'d say, do you have any apartments available? And the guy there would say, well, no, we\'re sorry we don\'t. An hour later, we would send the white couple. They say, oh, what would you like to see? We have all kinds of apartments available.And then we got focused on -- so, the demand was that the University of Chicago end the segregated housing that it owned.Then, I got involved in a broader issue at that point. The schools in the Chicago were pretty segregated. And I got involved in that. And that\'s where I got arrested.MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about what you\'ve done some recent things that -- let\'s take a look where you stood up against a guy who showed bigotry about gay people. Let\'s watch this from the Senate floor, the House floor.[begin video clip]REP. DUKE CUNNINGHAM, (R) CALIFORNIA: Is there any shocking doubt the same people that would vote to cut defense $177 billion, the same ones that would put homos in the military, the same ones that would not fund BRAC, the same ones that would not...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Chairman.CUNNINGHAM: No, I will not. Sit down you socialist.SANDERS: My ears may have been playing a trick on me, but I thought I heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote, unquote about homos in the military. Was I right in hearing that expression?CUNNINGHAM: Absolutely. Putting homosexuals in the military.SANDERS: You said something about homos in the military. Was the gentlemen referring to the many thousands and thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country? Was that the the group of people that the gentlemen was referring to?CUNNINGHAM: I am talking about the military people in the military do not support...SANDERS: That\'s not what you were talking about. You used the word homos in the mlitary. You have insulted thousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line...CUNNINGHAM: I\'m talk about you and liberals like you.[end video clip]MATTHEWS: Wow. What year was that?SANDERS: Who knows.MATTHEWS: How long -- \'85. That was \'95.SANDERS: And by the way, you know who that was, that was Duke Cunningham.MATTHEWS: He\'s busy now, isn\'t he?SANDERS: Yes. I don\'t know if he\'s still in jail or not, but he\'s -- he was sent to jail for bribery.MATTHEWS: Have you sent any cards or anything?SANDERS: No, I have not.And here\'s an example of somebody on the floor of the House making grossly homophobic statements that had to be dealt with. And I dealt with them.MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about your ideology, because I\'ve never quite figured it out in -- back here when you were a student, you were not only involved in the civil rights. You joined a group called the Young People Socialist League.A lot of people grew up, I\'m not that younger than you, a few years, a couple. Socialism was a hard thing to grab onto. How did you grab on to it? How did you feel comfortable enough to get involved. Because a lot of kids here -- how many people are comfortable calling themselves socialist?Well, that was -- the hand was enough. That\'s right. How many again, let me see the signal.It\'s some. It\'s not a huge number.I\'d say...SANDERS: More over there, I think.MATTHEWS: Maybe if it was back then it would be harder to even get your hand up.SANDERS: Look, what it was to me was trying to connect the dots, to try to understand what money and power was about, the impact it had on society. Why it was that we had so much -- and it\'s worse today than we then income and wealth inequality.But Chris, what I talk about...MATTHEWS: It\'s worse now, right?SANDERS: Yes, it is worse now.But when I talk about democratic socialism, what I talk about today is looking at countries around the world who have had labor governments or social democratic government who have brought health care to all of their people as a right, who have made public colleges and universities tuition free, who have managed to make sure that when elderly people retire they can live in dignity, who have much higher voter turnouts than we do, a more vibrant democracy. That\'s kind of what I\'m talking about.MATTHEWS: Can we -- do we have to make some other changes? We spend all our money defending the world with our military, right? We\'re paying national debt through the roof. It seems -- you know, you\'re into the budget. So much if it doesn\'t go to helping people today, it goes to either paying off debt or paying for a military that\'s a World War II/Cold War budget. You know, Sweden doesn\'t have that problem.SANDERS: We\'re not Sweden.MATTHEWS: I mean, smaller socialist countries. They don\'t have the burden we have.SANDERS: But they don\'t have the resources we have as well. They don\'t have the collective wealth that we have as well. Look, bottom line is we need a strong military. Do I think it is bloated? Absolutely.Do you know how many administrators we have in the military? It\'s not the men and women in uniform, we have I think one and a half people to administer every man and woman who is in uniform.Right, you have huge cost overruns in the military. You have got a lot of fraud that goes on there. The U.S. Department of Defense cannot sustain independent order, one of few agencies of government.But also, I think you have to address the level of income and wealth inequality and the transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent.MATTHEWS: We\'re getting back to the big picture when we come back. I think you\'re going to like this segment.More questions from the audience when we come back at the University of Chicago\'s Institute of Politics. Back with Senator Bernie Sanders.[commercial break]MATTHEWS: We\'re back with Senator Bernie Sanders on the Hadrball College Tour. I have one question fell off my list in our tussle there in the second block. Black Lives Matter. What\'s your reaction to the whole movement? It\'s real movement.SANDERS: It\'s real movement, and these people are raising an enormously important issue that I think the white community is not familiar with.African-Americans worry about when they let their kids out on the streets. They worry when they get in their car. African-Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than whites despite the fact that both groups smoke it about the same. Their sentences are longer when they are put in jail. I think the Black Lives Matter have raised this issue. And that tells me, and what I believe very strongly, is we need major, major criminal justice and police reform in this country.MATTHEWS: What do you think when you see a picture officer shooting a guy as he\'s running away or you see a big, heavyset guy being choked to death right on camera?SANDERS: Well, let\'s -- Eric Garner who you are talking about. His daughter is very active in our campaign.It is indefensible. It is horrible. And the American people, and it\'s not just the African-American community, are sick and tired of this. And the bottom line here is we need radical reforms in our police departments and -- I was mayor. I worked with cops all the time. Most of them are working hard, doing a good job. But when a police officer breaks the law like any other public official, that officer must be held accountable. [applause]MATTHEWS: Let\'s get a question in.QUESTION: Thank you, Senator Sanders. My name is Chelsea Fine.We have talked a bit about your background here at the University of Chicago. But one thing you haven\'t discussed as much on the campaign trial is the fact that you\'re Jewish.As a Jewish student, I would like to know what is your relationship as your faith and what would it mean to you to become the first Jewish president. MATTHEWS: We have about a minute.SANDERS: OK. Obviously being Jewish is very, very important to me. I\'m very proud of my heritage. What comes to my mind so strongly is a kid growing up in Brooklyn and seeing people with numbers on their wrists. You probably have not seen that. But those were the people who came out of concentration camps. And knowing that my -- a good part of my father\'s family was killed by the Nazis.And that lesson that I learned as a very young person is politics is serious business. And when you have a lunatic like Hitler gaining power, 50 million people died in World War II.So, I\'m very proud to be Jewish and I""m proud of my heritage.MATTHEWS: Thank you, senator. Thank you.Senator Bernie Sanders.And thank you all at the University of Chicago for having us here at the Institute of Policy.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 28, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News\' ""Meet the Press""'","b'TODD: It was a tough night Saturday for my next guest, Bernie Sanders with Hillary Clinton enjoying a big victory in the South Carolina primary, that makes Super Tuesday even more crucial if he\'s going to keep his hopes alive for securing the Democratic nomination.Senator Sanders, welcome back to ""Meet the Press"", sir. SANDERS: My pleasure.TODD: A month ago, senator, a month ago you said I think we\'re picking up more and more African-American support. Frankly IK think we can win there, referring to South Carolina.You lost African-American voters 84 to 16, worse than any poll had shown.Senator, what happened?SANDERS: Well, we got decimated, that\'s what happened. Among older African-Americans it was pathetic from our perspective. But by the way, what was the glimmer of positive news for us is that we won the 29 years of age or younger vote. And we did well with African- American young people as well as white young people.But no question Secretary Clinton won that state and she won it big, but I\'m in Minnesota now. I think we got a real shot at Minnesota. I think we got a shot at Colorado, Oklahoma, Massachusetts and Vermont. So we\'re looking to the future, not looking back.We had two rallies yesterday in Texas. 10,000 people out in Austin, 8,000 people out in Dallas. I think the future for us it\'s going to be a tough fight. I think we can pull it off, Chuck.TODD: Look, the game is delegates now. It\'s not where you win states, it\'s about accumulating delegates. Your campaign is targeting states that are worth 288 delegates on Super Tuesday, Secretary Clinton is targeting six states that are worth 571. If you both do well in the states you\'re targeting, she\'s going to have at least a 200-delegate lead on you if you\'re not careful at that point.As much as that -- this is -- why aren\'t you trying to win more delegates than her on Super Tuesday?SANDERS: Well, we are trying to win every delegate that we can. And not only are we fighting for Super Tuesday, we\'re looking ahead to California, the largest state of all, New York State. We think we\'re going to do well in Michigan.Look, Chuck. Let\'s be clear. We began this campaign nine and a half months ago at 3 percent in the polls, 3 percent, 70 points behind Hillary Clinton.In the last two weeks some polls nationally have actually had us in the lead. We have come a long, long way fighting for the message that we\'re going to end income and wealth inequality and a broken criminal justice system and a corrupt campaign finance system.We have developed enormous momentum all over this country. It is a tough fight, we knew that from the beginning. But I think we\'re going to do well on Super Tuesday. We\'re going to do well in many states after that. And we look forward to those state by state struggles.TODD: You know, there was a long story in The New York Times today detailing Secretary Clinton\'s role in pushing the president on Libya at the time, helping to step in to overthrow Gadhafi.Let me ask you this, would Libya be in better shape today if Gadhafi were still in power?SANDERS: Let me say this, Secretary Clinton and I have very strong differences of opinion on foreign policy. I helped lead the opposition to this disastrous war in Iraq. She supported it.To answer your question, no one can speculate. Nobody knows. But I think in terms of regime change, whether it is Gadhafi, whether it is Assad in Syria these are terrible dictators, but you\'ve got to be thinking about what happens the day after the kind of political vacuum that occurs in Libya of course as a result of the overthrow of Gadhafi, ISIS now has a strong foothold.I would have done it differently if I were president of the United States.Secretary Clinton also believes -- no, I would have worked more patiently. I know that it was a difficult situation. But you can\'t just go forward with regime change. You\'ve got to be thinking about the day after.And I think the same thing is true in Syria. Secretary Clinton disagrees with President Obama and myself regarding a no-fly zone. I fear that can get us entangled more into that war. I certainly hope that the cease-fire that they have now holds negotiated by Secretary Kerry.But I think her approach to foreign policy and mine are just quite different.TODD: You know, earlier this week as the back and forth on the crime bill gone you had said you supported the House version of the crime bill because it had an assault weapons ban in it, but that turned out not to be the case.So why did you put out a statement that was misleading...SANDERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No. That\'s not my understanding.TODD: It was not in the House bill that you voted. It was in a senate bill, but it was not in that House bill.SANDERS: To the best of my knowledge -- hold it. To the best of my knowledge there were two important provisions. And that is violence against women act which was very important. I\'ve worked very hard to prevent domestic violence. And on my understanding there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.Look, I spoke on the floor of the House about the harmful impacts of that bill. But weighing the pros and the cons I voted for it.And by the way I also voted against the so-called Welfare Reform Act that Secretary Clinton then supported, which has had a horrible impact on the poorest of the poor people in this country.TODD: All right.Senator Sanders, I have to leave it there. I know you have another interview coming up. I appreciate it. Stay safe on the trail. We\'ll be watching on Tuesday.SANDERS: Thank you.TODD: You got it.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"February 28, 2016","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b""STEPHANOPOULOS: We're joined now by Bernie Sanders. He joins us this morning.Thank you for joining us, Senator Sanders. Appreciate you being with us this morning.So what do you make of what happened in South Carolina last night. Nearly a 50 point win for Senator Clinton -- Secretary Clinton. SANDERS: We got decimated, George. We got decimated. The only positive thing for us is we won the actually -- the 29 years of age and younger vote. And that was good. But we got killed.But I'm in Minnesota now. We think we're going to do very well in Minnesota on Super Tuesday, Colorado we're going to do well, Oklahoma we're going to do well. I think we're going to win in Massachusetts. And I believe we're going to win in Vermont. And we're going to do better than people think in other states.George, we began this campaign, as you know, at 3 percent in the polls, 60 or 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. We have come a very long way. Our message about a rigged economy -- rich get richer, everyone else gets poorer -- is resonating.And I'll tell you what else is resonating, a corrupt campaign finance system that's allowing billionaires to buy elections.I think we have the momentum. I think it's going to be a tough fight. I think we can win this thing.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and Senator Sanders, from the very start you've been a straight talker to come right out and say you were decimated. You're continuing that tradition as well.Let me just follow up on South Carolina for one second. You saw that vote in the African-American community, something like 85 percent for Hillary Clinton. You've got going forward about 25 percent of the voters in the Democratic primaries are African-Americans. Aren't you going to have to do much better, reach out to that community, to have a chance for this nomination?SANDERS: Yes. Absolutely. But I do think -- no argument with you. You are correct. But I think you're going to see us doing -- and I think the polls indicated it, much better within the African- American community outside of the deep south. You're going to see us much better in New York State where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.But you're right, we're going to have to do a lot better.But I think what we are doing is putting together a coalition of working class people, of young people, of many other folks who understand that economy today is not working for the middle class, it's working for the people on top, people who have strong reservations about Secretary Clinton's foreign policy, a vote the war in Iraq.So we think we have come a long way; we think we've got a lot of work in front of us. But, George, I think we can win this.STEPHANOPOULOS: Looking ahead to Super Tuesday, new polls out this morning show Secretary Clinton with large leads in those Southern states you just talked about: Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. She's going to build up delegates there.You're going to win big in your home state of Vermont.Where else can you win on Super Tuesday?And if you don't win in other states, how can you go on?SANDERS: Well, we're going to go on to California, by the way, where we think we have a real shot and where most -- that's the state with the most delegates -- Barb Reich (ph), former Clinton Secretary of Labor, just endorsed me the other day. I think we have a good chance to win in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, a lot of young people are burdened with this outrageous student debt. The young people and their parents want public colleges and universities, to be tuition free and they want the wealthy and large corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes.We were in Oklahoma the other day, in Tulsa. We had a wonderful, wonderful turnout. We're going to Oklahoma City later today. We were in Texas just yesterday, George. We had 10,000 people out in Austin; 8,000 people out in Dallas. It's a tough state for us. But I think we're going to do better than that polling indicated.So I think we have a shot to win a number of states on Super Tuesday, do better than people thought and think in other states. And I think in some of the larger states like Michigan, New York State, California, we've got a shot to win those states.STEPHANOPOULOS: And as you say, on to California; thanks for joining us this morning, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Thank you."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 1, 2016","b'Remarks in Essex Junction, Vermont Following the ""Super Tuesday"" Primaries'","b'Thank you! It is good to be home! [applause] You know, I have been all over this country, but the truth is, it is great and great to come home and see all my friends. [applause] You know, we want to win in every part of the country, that goes without saying. But it does say something and means so much to me that the people who know me best, the people who knew me before I was elected, who knew me as mayor, knew me as congressman, and know me as senator, have voted so strongly to put us in the White House. Thank you so much. [applause] This campaign  as I think all of you know, this campaign is not just about electing the president. It is about transforming America. [applause] It is about making our great country the nation that we know it has the potential to be. [applause] It is about dealing with some unpleasant truths that exist in America today and having the guts to confront those truths. [applause] It is about recognizing that in our state, we have town meetings and people come out, they argue about budgets, and then they vote. One person, one vote. [applause] In Vermont, billionaires do not buy town meetings, and in America, we are going to end a corrupt campaign finance system.(Applause)  We can disagree in a democracy, and thats what a democracy is about, but I hope all of us agree that were going to not allow billionaires and their super PACs to destroy American democracy. [applause] In our state  in our state, you all know that we have many, many thousands of Vermonters who are working not just one job, theyre working two jobs, theyre working three jobs. And you all know that while our people are working so hard, almost all of the new wealth and income generated in America is going to the top 1 percent.(Booing) Well, together, what we are going to do is create an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top. [applause] And together, we are going to end and reform a broken criminal justice system. [applause] This country, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, should not be having more people in jail than any other country on earth. Thats wrong. [applause] So we are going to invest for our young people in education, in jobs, not jails or incarceration. [applause] Now, I know many of my Republican colleagues think that climate change is a hoax.(Booing) Well, I believe that you dont develop real public policy unless you listen to the science, and the science is clear. [applause] Together, we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause] Now, I know that Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I dont think so.(Booing) So let me go on the record and say as you have heard me say for years, health care is a right for all people. [applause] And let me also say that in the United States of America, when we talk about public education, its not just first grade through 12th that has got to be expanded to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.(Applause) What I have said from day one in this campaign and I suspect many of you were down on the lake with me when we announced on that beautiful day. [applause] What I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about making a political revolution. [applause] What that revolution is about is bringing millions of millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people who have never been involved. What the political revolution is about is bringing our people together. Black and white, Latino, Asian-American. [applause] Gay and straight. People born in America, people who have immigrated to America. When we bring our people together, when we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up. [applause] When we bring our people together and when we have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class and tell them they cant have it all. [applause] That our government belongs to all of us, not just super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors. [applause] Now, tonight, youre going to see a lot of election results come in. And let me remind you of what the media often forgets about. These are not  this is not a general election. It is not winner-take-all. If you get 52 percent, you get 48 percent, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates. [applause] [audience chants ""Bernie, Bernie, Bernie""] Ten months ago, as you know better than any other group in America, when we were out on the lake, we were at 3 percent in the polls. We have come a very long way in 10 months. [applause] At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted, 35 states remain. And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for a world of peace to every one of those states. [applause] Now, Wall Street may be against us and the super PACs may be against us. But you know why were going to win? Because our message is resonating and the people when we stand together will be victorious. [applause] So on a personal note, I want to thank all of you for the love and the friendship that you have given our family. You have sustained me. [applause] And I am so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country. [applause] So thank you again for helping us win here in Vermont tonight. [applause] And I look forward this evening to just saying hello to so many old friends. So thank you all very much! [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 8, 2016","b'Remarks in Miami, Florida Following the Michigan and Mississippi Democratic Primaries'","b""[in progress...]points down a few days ago, who repudiated the pundits who said that Bernie Sanders was not going anywhere.And, I want to thank the many thousands of volunteers that we had in the state of Michigan for knocking on doors and for making the phone calls that made this kind of enormously successful night for us.In the last week we have won three caucuses, and two of them with -- were record breaking turnouts. And, whether we win or lose tonight in Michigan, basically the delegates here are going to be split up because of proportional representation.And, what tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about, is strong in every part of the country and frankly we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen. We're going to do very, very well in the West coast and other parts of this country.What the American people are saying is they are tired of a corrupt campaign finance system, and super PACs funded by Wall Street and the billionaire class. They are tired of a rigged economy in which people in Michigan, people in Illinois, people in Ohio, are working longer hours for lower wages, worried to death about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top one percent.And, the people of America are tired of a broken criminal justice system in which we have more people in jail, largely African American, Latino, Native American. More people in jail than any other major country on Earth.So, we started this campaign, as many will remember, 10 months ago. We were 60 or 70 points down in the polls, and yet we have -- what we have seen is in poll after poll, state after state, what we have done is created the kind of momentum that we need to win.So, once again, this has been a fantastic night in Michigan, we're very grateful for all of the support that we have gotten from this state, and we look forward to going to Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and the other states that we will be competing in next week. Thank you all very much."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 21, 2016","b'Remarks on Policy in the Middle East in Salt Lake City, Utah'","b'I was invited along with other presidential candidates to be at the AIPAC conference in Washington, but obviously I could not make it because we are here.The issues that AIPAC is dealing with are very important issues and I wanted to give the same speech here as I would have given if we were at that conference.Let me begin by saying that I think I am probably the only candidate for president who has personal ties with Israel. I spent a number of months there when I was a young man on a kibbutz, so I know a little bit about Israel.Clearly, the United States and Israel are united by historical ties. We are united by culture. We are united by our values, including a deep commitment to democratic principles, civil rights and the rule of law.Israel is one of America\'s closest allies, and we  as a nation  are committed not just to guaranteeing Israel\'s survival, but also to make sure that its people have a right to live in peace and security.To my mind, as friends  long term friends with Israel  we are obligated to speak the truth as we see it. That is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times.Our disagreements will come and go, and we must weather them constructively.But it is important among friends to be honest and truthful about differences that we may have.America and Israel have faced great challenges together. We have supported each other, and we will continue to do just that as we face a very daunting challenge and that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.I am here to tell the American people that, if elected president, I will work tirelessly to advance the cause of peace as a partner and as a friend to Israel.But to be successful, we have also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people, where in Gaza unemployment today is 44 percent and we have there a poverty rate which is almost as high.So when we talk about Israel and Palestinian areas, it is important to understand that today there is a whole lot of suffering among Palestinians and that cannot be ignored. You can\'t have good policy that results in peace if you ignore one side.The road toward peace will be difficult. Wonderful people, well-intentioned people have tried decade after decade to achieve that and it will not be easy. I cannot tell you exactly how it will look  I do not believe anyone can  but I firmly believe that the only prospect for peace is the successful negotiation of a two-state solution.The first step in that road ahead is to set the stage for resuming the peace process through direct negotiations.Progress is never made unless people are prepared to sit down and talk to each other. This is no small thing. It means building confidence on both sides, offering some signs of good faith, and then proceeding to talks when conditions permit them to be constructive. Again, this is not easy, but that is the direction we\'ve got to go.This will require compromises on both sides, but I believe it can be done. I believe that Israel, the Palestinians, and the international community can, must, and will rise to the ocassion and do what needs to be done to achieve a lasting peace in a region of the world that has seen so much war, so much conflict and so much suffering.Peace will require the unconditional recognition by all people of Israel\'s right to exist. It will require an end to attacks of all kinds against Israel.Peace will require that organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah renounce their efforts to undermine the security of Israel. It will require the entire world to recognize Israel.Peace has to mean security for every Israeli from violence and terrorism.But peace also means security for every Palestinian. It means achieving self-determination, civil rights, and economic well-being for the Palestinian people.Peace will mean ending what amounts to the occupation of Palestinian territory, establishing mutually agreed upon borders, and pulling back settlements in the West Bank, just as Israel did in Gaza  once considered an unthinkable move on Israel\'s part.That is why I join much of the international community, including the U.S. State Department and European Union, in voicing my concern that Israel\'s recent expropriation of an additional 579 acres of land in the West Bank undermines the peace process and, ultimately, Israeli security as well.It is absurd for elements within the Netanyahu government to suggest that building more settlements in the West Bank is the appropriate response to the most recent violence. It is also not acceptable that the Netanyahu government decided to withhold hundreds of millions of Shekels in tax revenue from the Palestinians, which it is supposed to collect on their behalf.But, by the same token, it is also unacceptable for President Abbas to call for the abrogation of the Oslo Agreement when the goal should be the ending of violence.Peace will also mean ending the economic blockade of Gaza. And it will mean a sustainable and equitable distribution of precious water resources so that Israel and Palestine can both thrive as neighbors.Right now, Israel controls 80 percent of the water reserves in the West Bank. Inadequate water supply has contributed to the degradation and desertification of Palestinian land. A lasting peace will have to recognize Palestinians are entitled to control their own lives and there is nothing human life needs more than water.Peace will require strict adherence by both sides to the tenets of international humanitarian law. This includes Israeli ending disproportionate responses to being attacked  even though any attack on Israel is unacceptable.We recently saw a dramatic example of just how important this concept is. In 2014, the decades-old conflict escalated once more as Israel launched a major military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli offensive came after weeks of indiscriminate rocket fire into its territory and the kidnapping of Israeli citizens.Of course, I strongly object to Hamas\' long held position that Israel does not have the right to exist  that is unacceptable. Of course, I strongly condemn indiscriminate rocket fire by Hamas into Israeli territory, and Hamas\' use of civilian neighborhoods to launch those attacks. I condemn the fact that Hamas diverted funds and materials for much-needed construction projects designed to improve the quality of life of the Palestinian people, and instead used those funds to construct a network of tunnels for military purposes.However, let me also be very clear: I  along with many supporters of Israel  spoke out strongly against the Israeli counter attacks that killed nearly 1,500 civilians and wounded thousands more. I condemned the bombing of hospitals, schools and refugee camps.Today, Gaza is still largely in ruins. The international community must come together to help Gaza recover. That doesn\'t mean rebuilding factories that produce bombs and missiles  but it does mean rebuilding schools, homes andhospitals that are vital to the future of the Palestinian people.These are difficult subjects. They are hard to talk about both for many Americans and for Israelis. I recognize that, but it is clear to me that the path toward peace will require tapping into our shared humanity to make hard but just decisions.Nobody can tell you when peace will be achieved between Israel and the Palestinians. No one knows the exact order that compromises will have to be made to reach a viable two-state solution. But as we undertake that work together, the United States will continue its unwavering commitment to the safety of Israeli citizens and the country of Israel.Let me just say a word about an overall agenda for the Middle East.Of course, beyond the Palestinian question, Israel finds itself in the midst of a region in severe upheaval.First, the so-called Islamic State  ISIS  threatens the security of the entire region and beyond, including our own country and our allies. Secretary of State Kerry was right to say that ISIS is committing genocide, and there is no doubt in my mind that the United States must continue to participate in an international coalition to destroy this barbaric organization.While obviously much needs to be done, so far our effort has had some important progress, as airstrikes have degraded ISIS\' military capacity, and the group has lost more than 20 percent of its territory in the past year.So we are making some progress.But we are entering a difficult period in the campaign against ISIS.The government in Baghdad has yet to achieve a sustainable political order that unites Iraq\'s various ethnic and sectarian factions, which has limited its ability to sustain military victories against ISIS. Unless there is a united government, it\'s going to be hard to be effective in destroying ISIS.More inclusive, stable governance in Iraq will be vital to inflict a lasting defeat on ISIS. Otherwise, ISIS could regain its influence or another, similar organization may spring up in its place.In Syria, the challenges are even more difficult. The fractured nature of the civil war there has often diluted the fight against ISIS  exemplified by the Russian airstrikes that prioritized hitting anti-Assad fighters rather than ISIS. And, just like in Iraq, ISIS cannot be defeated until the groups that take territory from ISIS can responsibly govern the areas they take back. Ultimately, this will require a political framework for all of Syria.The U.S. must also play a greater role disrupting the financing of ISIS and efforts on the Internet to turn disaffected youth into a new generation of terrorists.While the U.S. has an important role to play in defeating ISIS, that struggle must be led by the Muslim countries themselves on the ground. I agree with King Abdullah of Jordan who a number of months ago that made it clear what is going on there right now is nothing less than a battle for the soul of Islam and the only people who will effectively destroy ISIS there will be Muslim troops on the ground.So what we need is a coalition of those countries.Now, I am not suggesting that Saudi Arabia or any other states in the region invade other countries, nor unilaterally intervene in conflicts driven in part by sectarian tensions.What I am saying is that the major powers in the region  especially the Gulf States  have to take greater responsibility for the future of the Middle East and the defeat of ISIS.What I am saying is that countries like Qatar  which intends to spend up to $200 billion to host the 2022 World Cup  Qatar which per capita is the wealthiest nation in the world  Qatar can do more to contribute to the fight Against ISIS. If they are prepared to spend $200 billion for a soccer tournament, then they have got to spend a lot spend a lot more against a barbaric organization.What I am also saying is that other countries in the region  like Saudi Arabia, which has the 4th largest defense budget in the world  has to dedicate itself more fully to the destruction of ISIS, instead of other military adventures like the one it is pursuing right now in Yemen.And keep in mind that while ISIS is obviously a dangerous and formidable enemy, ISIS has only 30,000 fighters on the ground. So when we ask the nations in the region to stand up to do more against ISIS  nations in the region which have millions of men and women under arms  we know it is surely within their capability to destroy ISIS.Now the United States has every right in the world to insist on these points. Remember  I want everybody to remember  that not so many years ago it was the United States and our troops that reinstalled the royal family in Kuwait after Saddam Hussein\'s invasion in 1990. We put these people back on the throne. Now they have the obligation to work with us and other countries to destroy ISIS.The very wealthy  and some of these countries are extraordinarily wealthy from oil money or gas money  these very wealthy and powerful nations in the region can no longer expect the United States to do their work for them. Uncle Sam cannot and should not do it all. We are not the policeman of the world.As we continue a strongly coordinated effort against ISIS, the United States and other western nations should be supportive of efforts to fight ISIS and al-Qaeda. But it is the countries in the region that have to stand up against these violently extremist and brutal organizations.Now I realize that given the geopolitics of the region this is not going to be easy. I realize that there are very strong and historical disagreements between different countries in the region about how ISIS should be dealt with.I realize different countries have different priorities. But we can help set the agenda and mobilize stronger collective action to defeat ISIS in a lasting way.Bottom line is the countries in the region  countries which by the way are most threatened by ISIS  they\'re going to have to come together, they\'re going to have to work out their compromises, they are going to have to lead the effort with the support of the United States and other major powers in destroying ISIS.Another major challenge in the region, of course, is the Syrian Civil War itself  one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent history.After five years of brutal conflict, the only solution in Syria will be, in my view, a negotiated political settlement. Those who advocate for stronger military involvement by the U.S. to oust Assad from power have not paid close enough attention to history. That would simply prolong the war and increase the chaos in Syria, not end it.In other words, we all recognize that Assad is a brutal dictator. But I think that our priorities right now have got to be destroy ISIS, work out a political settlement with Russia and Iran to get Assad out of power.I applaud Secretary Kerry and the Obama administration for negotiating a partial ceasefire between the Assad regime and most opposition forces. The ceasefire shows the value of American-led diplomacy, rather than escalating violence. It may not seem like a lot, but it is. Diplomacy in this instance has had some real success.Let me also say what I think most Americans now understand, that for a great military power like the United States it is easy to use a war to remove a tyrant from power, but it is much more difficult to comprehend the day after that tyrant is removed from power and a political vacuum occurs.All of us know what has occurred in Iraq. We got rid of Saddam Hussein, a brutal, brutal murderer and a tyrant. And yet we created massive instability in that region which led to the creation of ISIS. I am very proud to have been one of the members in Congress to vote against that disastrous war.And the situation is not totally dissimilar from what has happened in Libya. We got rid of a terrible dictator there, Colonel Gaddafi, but right now chaos has erupted and ISIS now has a foothold in that area.Bottom line is that regime change for a major power like us is not hard. But understanding what happens afterward is something that always has got to be taken into consideration.In my view, the military option for a powerful nation like ours  the most powerful nation in the world  should always be on the table. That\'s why we have the most powerful military in the world. But it should always be the last resort not the first resort.Another major challenge in the region is Iran, which routinely destabilizes the Middle East and threatens the security of Israel.Now, I think all of us agree that Iran must not be able to acquire a nuclear weapon. That would just destabilize the entire region and create disastrous consequences.Where we may disagree is how to achieve that goal. I personally strongly supported the nuclear deal with the United States, France, China, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran because I believe it is the best hope to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.I want to thank the Obama administration for doing a very good job under very, very difficult circumstances.I believe we have an obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.You know it is very easy for politicians to go before the people and talk about how tough we are, and we want to wipe out everybody else. But I think if we have learned anything from history is that we pursue every diplomatic option before we resort to military intervention.And interestingly enough, more often than not, diplomacy can achieve goals that military intervention cannot achieve. And that is why I supported the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table and allowed us to reach an agreement.But let me tell you what I firmly believe. The bottom line is this: if successfully implemented  and I think it can be  the nuclear deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And preventing Iran from getting the bomb makes the world a safer place.Does the agreement achieve everything I would like? Of course not.But to my mind, it is far better than the path we were on with Iran developing nuclear weapons and the potential for military intervention by the United States and Israel growing greater by the day.I do not accept the idea that the ""pro-Israel"" position was to oppose the deal.Preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon will strengthen not only the United States\' security, but Israel\'s security as well.And I am not alone in that idea. While Prime Minister Netanyahu is vocally opposed to the accord, his is hardly a consensus opinion in Israel and it\'s important that everyone understand that. Dozens of former security officials, including retired Army generals and chiefs of the Shin Bet and Mossad intelligence agencies support the agreement. Netanyahu may not, but many others in Israel do.But let me be clear: if Iran does not live up to the agreement, we should re-impose sanctions and all options are back on the table.Moreover, the deal does not mean we let Iran\'s aggressive acts go unchecked. The world must stand united in condemning Iran\'s recent ballistic missile tests as well as its continued support for terrorism through groups like Hezbollah.Going forward, I believe we need a longer-term vision for dealing with Iran that balances two important objectives.First, we must counter the destabilizing behavior of Iran\'s leaders.But secondly we must also leave the door open to more diplomacy to encourage Iranian moderates and the segments of the Iranian people  especially the younger generations  who want a better relationship with the West. While only a small step in the right direction, I was heartened by the results of the recent parliamentary elections in which Iranian voters elected moderates in what was, in part, a referendum on the nuclear deal.I know that some say there is just no dealing with Iran  in any way at all  for the foreseeable future. And that is the position of some. After all, Iran is in a competition with Saudi Arabia and its allies for influences over that region.But a more balanced approach toward Iran that serves our national security interests should hardly be a radical idea. We have serious concerns about the nature of the Iranian government, but we have to be honest enough, and sometimes we are not, to admit that Saudi Arabia  a repressive regime in its own right  is hardly an example of Jeffersonian democracy.Balancing firmness with willingness to engage with diplomacy in dealing with Iran will not be easy. But it is the wisest course of action to help improve the long-term prospects of stability and peace in the Middle East  and to keep us safe.Lastly, these are but some  not all  of the major issues where the interests of Israel intersect with those of the United States. I would address these issues and challenges as I would most issues and that is by having an honest discussion and by bringing people together.The truth is there are good people on both sides who want peace, And the other truth is there are despots and liars on both sides who benefit from continued antagonism.I would conclude by saying there has been a disturbing trend among some of the Republicans in this presidential election that take a very, very different approach. And their approach I think would be a disaster for this country. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion  something unprecedented in our country\'s history.Now this would not only go against everything we stand for as a nation, but also  in terms of our relationship to the rest of the world  it would be a disaster.Let me just conclude by saying this: the issues that I\'ve discussed today are not going to be easily solved.Everybody knows that. But I think the United States has the opportunity, as the most powerful nation on earth, to play an extraordinary role in trying to bring people together  to try to put together coalitions in the region to destroy ISIS.And that is a responsibility that I, if elected president, would accept in a very, very serious way. We have seen too many wars, too much killing, too much suffering. And let us all together  people of good faith  do everything we can to finally, finally bring peace and stability to that region.Thank you all very much.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 21, 2016","b'Interview with Chris Hayes of MSNBC\'s ""All In""'","b'HAYES: All right. Senator Sanders, let me start with this. It was another example of some real upsetting violence at a Trump rally. A Trump supporter beating up a protester. He was arrested. This comes in the wake of a lot of protests, the roadblock. There are some commentators who were saying, as responsible is Donald Trump is for what is happening at his rallies, that the protest efforts now at those rallies, the disruptions are essentially playing into his hand. What do you think of that? SANDERS: Well, look, I think, you know, that Trump has been incredibly divisive. I think he\'s insulted almost every group in America. I think his policies are outrageous, but in America, people have a right to hold rallies. So, I think my own feeling is it\'s absolutely appropriate for thousands of people to protest at a Trump rally, but I am not a great fan of disrupting rallies. So, people want to be outside. They want to talk about attacks on Mexicans. His outrageous attacks on Muslims and African-Americans, that is absolutely appropriate. But I think in some ways you\'re right. I think it plays into Trump\'s hands. It\'s counterproductive. Protests yes, disruptions, no. HAYES: That is not the answer I would have expected from you. SANDERS: Why not? I don\'t believe -- you know, people have a right to give a speech. People have a right to protest. I\'m not great fan of disrupting people\'s speeches. HAYES: There was an article, I believe it was in ""Politico"", about Democratic senators talking about you and Hillary Clinton and your campaigns, and basically I think urging you to enter a phase of your campaign not to stop campaigning, but essentially to target Donald Trump as opposed to Hillary Clinton because they believe or claim that you don\'t have a clear path to nomination and you were damaging or potentially damaging Hillary Clinton. I wanted to get your response to that. SANDERS: Well, let me -- let me respond in a couple of ways. We do have a path to victory. You know, Secretary Clinton has done very, very well in the Deep South and in states that have had elections there. We\'re now out of the Deep South. We\'re heading West. We think we have an excellent chance to win in Washington state, in the state of California, in Oregon. We think we\'ll do well this week in Utah. We think we\'re going to do well in Arizona, we\'re right now here in Boise, Idaho. We have 6,000 people next door. We had 14,000 people out a few days ago in Salt Lake City. Most importantly to me, Chris, in almost all the exit polls, we are winning the people 45 or 50 and younger. The future of the Democratic Party is with us. People are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics.People want to United States to join the rest of the industrialized world with a national health program, Medicare for all. People believe fervently that in the year 2016, we should make public colleges and universities tuition free. We got to impose tax on Wall Street speculation. These are the ideas that are generating enthusiasm. So, of course, I\'m taking on Donald Trump. I\'m very proud in almost every national poll, we are running much stronger against Trump than Clinton is. Last NBC poll I think had us 18 points up. Clinton was 13 points up. If you can believe it in the state of Utah, which is not elected, voted for a Democrat in 50 years, we were beating Trump by 11 points. Hillary Clinton by two points. One of the points many people are saying all over this country is Bernie Sanders is, in fact, the strongest candidate against Donald Trump. HAYES: You gave an interview to Rachel Maddow the other night when she talked with you about Merrick Garland, has been nominated by the president to fill Scalia seat on the Supreme Court. And you said you would, if you were elected, it was a lame duck session, you would ask for him to withdraw and name your own Supreme Court justice. And you\'ve talked about Citizens United as a kind of litmus test for you.SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: I wonder your views about Heller which is the opinion in 2007 by the Supreme Court, 2008, finding that basically the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. Do you think that was properly decided? Would you look for a justice who would overturn it? SANDERS: Chris, Chris, Chris -- Chris, I\'m not going to go through every Supreme Court decision. But this is what I will tell you. I don\'t go around coming up with litmus tests every other day. I\'m obviously pro-choice, 100 percent voting record for women\'s rights, for the environment and so forth and so on, and to hold a lot of criteria out there. But I worry, very much, about the future of American democracy. The degree to which we are going to have a vibrant democracy if Citizens United continues to stand. So, this, to me, is a very fundamental issue underlying the whole nature of American society. And I will not appoint or nominate anybody to the Supreme Court who is not loud and clear, making it very public that not only will they vote to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court but they will push it to come up as soon as possible, to be heard by the Supreme Court.HAYES: One of the things Citizens United gave rise to, right, of course, are super PACs. And I\'m really curious. Have you -- I will say that I have actually genuinely been surprised by what a disaster they have been in a strict tactical sense in this campaign. I mean, literally hundreds of millions of dollars lit on fire, $145 million to get Jeb Bush, four delegates. Are you surprised how seemingly ineffectual that kind of big money has been thus far? SANDERS: I think that\'s a wrong characterization of the situation. Look, the political world is changing rapidly. What the establishment has learned, what the Democratic accomplishment, the Republican establishment, the media establishment is the world is not quite what they thought it was. With the middle class disappearing, with people working longer hours for low wages, people working for the future of their children, what you are seeing a lot of discontent at the grass roots level all over this country. And that\'s what\'s going on right now.Trump is tapping that anger in a very destructive way, scapegoating Mexicans and Muslim.What we are doing is trying to bring people together to create an economy that works for all of us, not just Wall Street. But to underestimate the long term impact of Citizens United, of the Koch brothers, of Sheldon Adelson, would be a very, very serious mistake. That is one of the worst decisions in the history of Supreme Court decisions. It\'s got to be overturned. HAYES: This connects to something else about your career in politics that I wanted to ask you. You\'re nothing, if not consistent. You\'ve been remarkably consistent on a whole set of principles since you really entered public life, particularly since you entered Congress. I think that consistency is a large part of your appeal. People don\'t think you\'re making up this position about banks or, you know, money in politics just because you think it will work. You really believe it. Are there things that you\'ve changed your mind on about politics since you got into Congress or even since you started campaign? Are there things that you had a conversion or thought to yourself, you know, I was wrong about that, in your time as a politician? SANDERS: Well -- well, let me say this, you know, to be honest with you, I almost, what I fervently wish is we had more time. Right now, I\'m speaking to you and I can hear in the background a crowd of 5,000 or 6,000 people in Boise, Idaho. We have 14,000 people out in Salt Lake City. What I think I underestimated is the degree we can, in fact, bring people together around a strong economic message. People will disagree. I am pro-choice. I am pro-gay marriage. I have -- you know, feel fervently about climate change. But I think there\'s even more opportunity than I had previously believed to bring people together around basic economic issues ending this disastrous these trade policies that have cost us millions of jobs, raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour. I do believe that a majority of American people want health care.If I had to do it over again, I would have put more emphasis on bringing working class people together to fight for a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors. HAYES: That\'s not saying -- so when you said more time, I thought you were talking about you and I or before you -- you\'re saying the runway for the Bernie Sanders plane, that you wish it was longer. That you think you found something here that if it was longer, you would be in a better position to take advantage of? SANDERS: Look, I think, two things, number one, the Democrats need a 50-state strategy. I think with intelligent planning, cultivating good leadership in the South and there is some right there bringing blacks and whites together, Democrats can make huge advances in the South. I think in other parts of this country, whether it\'s Kansas or Utah or Idaho, I think it\'s insane for the Democrats to abdicate those states in that entire region. And I think if elected president and becoming leader of the Democratic Party, we\'re going to put resources in there. And I think we can bring people together. You say you may disagree with me on gay marriage, OK? But you do need to see your kid go to college. You need to have a decent minimum wage. I think we can bring a lot of people together on those issues.[commercial break]HAYES: More now in my conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders on a day of massive political headlines Israel and Cuba. I asked the presidential hopeful about both those topics and pressed him on how his worldview differs from his Democratic rivals.SANDERS: She is obviously much more hawkish than I am. I think she has apologized for her vote against the war in Iraq. But I don\'t think that that was a mistake on her part, that is the type of aggressiveness and hawkishness that is what she is part of.I think the role that she played in Libya in the overthrow of Qadhafi without fully understanding the long-term implications of regime change there, and the vacuum it created for ISIS to come in is also a mistake. The fact that she would go in with a debate, debate with me and talk about the praise that she received from Henry Kissinger, Henry Kissinger, one of the most destructive secretaries of state in American history, she was proud to get his praise. I mean, that tells you where she is coming from.We have a very different outlook.HAYES: You just characterized her views. But I\'m curious, you say she\'s more hawkish. Characterize your own views. Do you think of yourself as dovish, do you think of yourself as a internationalist? How would you characterize your own views in contrast to her?SANDERS: In 12 seconds or less, look it\'s not -- I voted against the war in Iraq. I voted against the first Gulf war. I think war is the last option of a great military power like us. I think we need to focus on building coalitions. Yes, ISIS must be destroyed, but it should be destroyed by a coalition of Muslim nations on the ground with the support of the United States and the other major powers in the air and in training the troops there.I think also, when you talk about what goes on in the Middle East, look, I absolutely -- I spent many months on a kibbutz in Israel. So, I know something about Israel. Israel has got to be defended, has a right to exist. But you cannot ignore the needs of the Palestinian people.Yes, I am more than aware of what Iran is doing in supporting terrorism. But I am also aware that the government of Saudi Arabia is no great model of Jeffersonian democracy, that money from Saudi Arabia has gone in to terrorist extremists, that also that when you look at the Middle East, we have to play with a much more level -- even-handed approach than I think we have had.So, it is not just, you know, long term, I think we want to make sure that we do everything that we can to stop the support of terrorism from Iran. But long-term, and I think the agreement of the Obama administration reached in stopping the development of a nuclear weapon in Iran is a step forward. I want to see that continued.I want to see pressure being put on Saudi Arabia not only to stop funding terrorists, but instead of being in Yemen to play a more active role again ISIS . In other words, what we have got to do, we are all aware of the centuries old division between Shiites and Sunnis. But you know what, they\'re going to have to sit at the table. We can play a role in trying to resolve some of the differences so they work with us against ISIS and terrorism in general.HAYES: You use the phrase even-handed in terms of our sort of navigating the difficulty geopolitics in the Middle East. Hillary Clinton today when she was speaking to AIPAC mocked Donald Trump, seemed to mock Donald Trump, who talked about being neutral between Israel and Palestinian negotiations in achieving some kind of two-state solution and peace deal. Who\'s right about that? Should the U.S. be neutral or not?SANDERS: No, it\'s not a question of being neutral and it\'s not a question of Donald Trump.I mean, you know, Donald Trump is an embarrassment even to the Republican Party. What I mean is that when you look at somebody like a Netanyahu, to simply not understand that this is a right wing politician, a guy who kind of crashed the United States congress to give his speech there, ignoring President Obama, not even consulting with him, using it for political purposes back home, a guy who has supported the growth of settlements, I think the overreaction and the destruction of Gaza went too, too far. Israel should not be bombing schools or homes, just terrible damage there.So, point being, Israel has an absolute right to exist, not only to exist, but to exist in way that they\'re not under threat of terrorism. And I support that 100 percent.But you have also got to reach out to the Palestinian people and to the Arab communities, that is the only hope, I think, for lasting peace in the Mideast. Is this going to be easy? Of course it\'s not. Wonderful people have tried for decades without success. But we keep doing it. We just cannot be 100 percent supportive of people like Netanyahu and ignore the rest of the region.HAYES: Clinton also -- and then I\'m going to move to Cuba. But Clinton also today talked about the boycott, divest, sanction movement, which is an international movement. Some of the people who advocate those tactics believe that Israel should be a binational state. They don\'t believe in Zionism. Some are Zionists, but they want to see Israel support a two-state solution more strenuously, move away from the settlements. She linked to it racism, to anti-Semitism basically. She said -- she connected BDS to anti-Semiticism. Do you think that\'s a fair linkage?SANDERS: I think there is some of that, absolutely. Look, Israel has done some bad things. So has every other country on Earth. I think if people want to attack Israel for their policies, I think that is fair game but not to appreciate that there is some level of anti-Semitism around the world involved in that I think would be a mistake.HAYES: You are the first Jewish individual to get this far, to come this close to the presidency in American history. How much does that shape how you think about your role should you become president with respect to Israel, a place where you did live at a certain point?SANDERS: My role if elected president -- I\'ve got to look at foreign policy and look at the United States approach to every country on Earth. Clearly the Middle East has been a cauldron. It has been so volatile, so horrible in so many years that it\'s an area you have got to pay attention to. But you have got to pay attention to China. You have got to pay attention to Latin America.I would say that being Jewish, what has been most significant in my life is understanding what a Hitler, what horrible politics can mean to people. And I think that\'s been one of the motivating factors in my life in fighting against racism and bigotry of all kinds, because when it gets out of hands as we have seen and we are -- it obviously it has unbelievable repercussions. HAYES: Today the president is in Cuba and it\'s a remarkable thing for a lot of people to witness given the decades of American policy there. It\'s something you have oppose. You opposed the embargo for a long time.Do you have a message today if there are Cuban dissidents, some of whom were protesting today, some of whom were arrested during protests. To those folks or to people in Miami who feel like even if they didn\'t support the embargo also feel negatively about the Castro regime?SANDERS: Well, you know, there\'s a lot to feel negatively about. But I think in terms of the nature of the continuation of the Cold War, which has gone on so long between Cuba and the United States, I applaud the president for aggressively trying to end it. And I hope we will not only full diplomatic relations but that the trade embargo will end. I think that will be good for the people of Cuba. And I think it\'s a little bit absurd that here in the United States we can get on plane, we can go to China, we can go to Saudi Arabia, we can go anyplace we want, countries that are not democratic, but for some reason we can\'t go to Cuba, businesses in America can\'t do business in Cuba. I think that that is stupid.So, I hope very much and applaud the president for his efforts in that direction and hope that in the not too distant future -- and if I have anything to say about it as president, we will work aggressively to develop normal relations in every respect with the people of Cuba.HAYES: Final question here, senator. You\'ve been very critical of the media\'s role in this campaign. And some of those critiques I find pretty compelling, I have to say. Is there a question that you wished you got asked more that you don\'t get asked?SANDERS: Look, it\'s not just a question. For the media, 90 percent of the coverage is process is soap opera is polls, is raising money. Go to the rallies that I have and listen to the people coming up to me. Yesterday, a woman comes up to me with tears her eyes, Bernie I am working 60 hours a week. I\'m not making any money. I don\'t have time to spend with my daughter.Listen to the kids who leave school 50,000 or 60,000 a year in debt. Talk to the people who have no health insurance and what that means to their life.I\'m running for president of the United States because we have a disappearing middle class, we got 47 million people living in poverty. The amount of time that the media pays to those issues is minimal. And I think that is my critique, Chris, that the media has got to look at the pain in America today and then look at how the candidates are responding to that pain. Campaigns and elections are not a game. They\'re not a game. They\'re about trying to change America. We\'re the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We should not be having Flint, Michigans or African-American communities all over this country where schools are failing.Those are the issues we got to pay attention to and not look at this as some kind of silly game. And that is the critique that bothers me. That\'s what bothers me about media coverage. HAYES: All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, candidate for president of the Democratic Party, senator from Vermont. Thanks for all your time. Really appreciate it.SANDERS: Thank you, Chris.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 29, 2016",b'Interview with Erin Burnett of CNN',"b'BURNETT: And now, Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is here with me in Milwaukee. Thank you so much, Senator. I appreciate your being with me. SANDERS: Great to be with you. BURNETT: This is a crucial state. You just heard Hillary Clinton say your campaigns are talking to each other about another debate. You\'ve asked for one. Of course, as you\'re aware, earlier today, a Clinton campaign spokesman said your requests for debates are a quote/unquote, ""publicity stunt."" Do you think she\'s serious about debating you? SANDERS: I certainly hope so. Look, there are huge issues facing this country. Our middle class disappearing. Grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. A campaign finance system that is corrupt and a broken criminal justice system. And in New York State, there are additional problems. So I would hope that we would have a good debate. My understanding is she would like to do it in Brooklyn. I was born in Brooklyn. Let\'s do it! BURNETT: Game on for Brooklyn. SANDERS: Game on. BURNETT: The other big news, of course, you heard at the top of the program, you saw the video today from a Trump rally. But of course, Donald Trump\'s campaign manager charged with simple battery for an altercation with a reporter recently. Moments ago, he just defended that campaign manager. He said, ""I know it would be easy for to discard people. I don\'t discard people."" Should Trump fire Corey Lewandowski? SANDERS: Well, let\'s see what happens in the legal process. He\'s been charged, and we don\'t find people guilty until you go through a process. But my campaign manager does not assault female journalists, let me just say that. BURNETT: You know, John Kasich came out and said he would if this had happened to him. He would go ahead and fire his campaign manager.[crosstalk]BURNETT: If the roles were reversed, were you?SANDERS: Well, let me just say this. Let me just say this. What has concerned me very much about Donald Trump is the edginess of calls to violence around his campaigns. What I found absolutely shocking, not only this campaign manager\'s action. But he was prepared - or at least indicated that he was prepared -- to pay the legal fees for somebody who quite openly sucker-punched somebody - right, knocked them down. And when you say you\'re going to pay the legal fees for someone who commits a gross act of violence, what you\'re really telling your supporters is that violence is okay. But Erin, to me, all of that stuff is interesting political stuff. But what we are trying to focus on in this campaign are the issues that impact the American people. Which, frankly, is why I think our campaign is doing so well. One of the key issues that we are dealing with is a rigged economy in which millions of people today are working longer hours for lower wages. A broken trade system right here in Wisconsin. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost because companies shut down here, moved to Mexico, moved to China. We need a trade policy that works for workers, not just the CEOs of large corporations. BURNETT: Now, you\'re obviously making this case here in Wisconsin. You have the landslide wins on Saturday, right, in three crucial states. SANDERS: Yeah.BURNETT: Now you\'re here in Wisconsin. It\'s huge, right? You\'ve got 86 delegates --SANDERS: Absolutely. BURNETT: -- 96 (ph) if you count the ones up for grabs. Are you going to win Wisconsin? Are you confident? SANDERS: I\'m never into speculation. I will tell you that the night of the election, all right? I\'ll tell you exactly what the results are. But it\'s silly to be talking about it. All I can say is we\'re going to work very, very hard. We have a lot of volunteers here in the state. We\'re going to be knocking on doors, we\'re going to be making phone calls. And our message about the need to create an economy that works for all people is in fact resonating here in Wisconsin. And I think you\'re going to see us do very well. BURNETT: So, one of the arguments you\'re making on that front, right, is free college. SANDERS: No, no, no -BURNETT: -- free public university -SANDERS: You see, every time I\'m on a show, somebody says free college. It is free tuition at public colleges and universities. BURNETT: OK, so on that front, though -- because it is important how you word it, your plan -- we have a federalist (ph) system. You would be chipping in money to the states, and they would then have the decision to make. SANDERS: Yes. BURNETT: Hillary Clinton says that\'s just not going to happen in a state like Wisconsin. SANDERS: Yes. BURNETT: Let me just play what she said, basically about you this afternoon. Here she is. [begin video clip]HILLARY CLINTON: His plan depends upon governors like your governor -- [audience boos] -- putting in a lot of money. Now, I\'ve got to tell you, having followed from afar -- [audience laughter] -- the wrecking ball that Scott Walker has used against higher education, I don\'t think it\'s all that realistic to say, well, you\'ll get free college as long as Scott Walker chips in about, you know -- yeah, about $300 million.[end video clip]BURNETT: I mean, Scott Walker turned down half a billion dollars in Obamacare. SANDERS: OK, let me just say the danger - let me just say this. Number one, in the year 2016, we have got to recognize that a college degree is pretty much the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. The world has changed. The economy has changed. We need to have the best educated work force in the world. Young people should not be denied the opportunity because they don\'t have the money. Or they should not have to leave school $50,000, $100,000 in debt. So we do believe, I do believe very strongly in making public colleges and universities tuition-tree. Now, what Secretary Clinton said is that Scott Walker may not go along with that. Well, you know what happens to the state of Wisconsin if he does not? California will, Vermont will, states all over this country will, and young, bright people will be leaving Wisconsin. And I think the people of Wisconsin will tell Scott Walker, you know what? This will be a disaster for the future of our state. Because when kids leave, sometimes they don\'t come back. So I think the idea is sound. It is paid for, Erin, by a tax on Wall Street\'s speculation. When Wall Street\'s illegal behavior destroyed our economy, middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class. BURNETT: What about, though, the issue on terms of the pure pay force, right? During the midst of the financial crisis when people said, let Bank of America go under. Let them go under. They don\'t deserve to survive, you know? You\'re not just talking about tens of thousands of people that would have worked for that bank, but also the millions of Americans that have -- own shares of that bank and their 401(k), their IRA. [inaudible] millions of Americans own stocks now. Middle class Americans who could end up paying for them.SANDERS: No, no, the vast majority of that speculation tax will be paid by upper-income people. And that\'s the way we\'ve designed it. But at the end of the day, look, this campaign is not your typical campaign. It\'s not your Hillary Clinton campaign. We are thinking bigger and bolder. Now, you tell me, if Germany can provide in fact free college education, Scandinavia can do it, other countries around the world can do it, why can\'t we do it? Why can\'t we have the best educated work force in the world, which we\'re going to need if our economy is to survive? And let me also add this. In the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent. I know you don\'t talk about it too much in the media, but that is the fact. We\'re talking about trillions of dollars. So yes, I am running for president, and am telling the top one-tenth of one percent they\'re going to have to pay more in taxes. BURNETT: And just a question, let me take a step back about the whole idea. You say you want the best educated work force. When you look at the top-ranked countries, you\'re looking at places like Canada, like South Korea, like Japan. All of them require people to pay in most instances about what people pay here for public education. SANDERS: Listen, trust me. People are going to be paying for Harvard and Yale and all kinds of private schools. The way I see it, Erin, is that right now, and for the last hundred years, we have had public education which says that no matter what your income is, right? You\'re rich or poor, you can go from the first grade to the 12th grade for free. We take it for granted. All I am saying is that in the year 2016, with a radically changing economy, where young people need more education, let\'s extend that concept beyond the 12th grade through public colleges and universities. BURNETT: All right. Senator Sanders is staying with me. We\'re going to have much more in our exclusive conversation in just a moment in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels. We\'re going to talk about that and the fight against ISIS. And we\'re also going to be counting down, of course, to the town hall for the GOP. Trump, Cruz, Kasich, less than an hour from now right across town here in WisconsinWe\'ll be right back.[commercial break]BURNETT: Welcome back. We are live tonight in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where in less than an hour, the three remaining Republican presidential candidates will be going before voters at our town hall across town here and make their case. And of course, right now, I\'m talking exclusively to Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also come campaigning here in this must-win state up against Hillary Clinton. Senator, let\'s continue our conversation. The open primary here in Wisconsin is important. That means people can switch over. They can vote for whomever they would like, Democrats, Republicans. We\'ve seen this across the country, people choosing between you and and Donald Trump. Some union workers, we understand here, are deeply considering whether they should vote for you or Donald Trump. Do you think they\'re crazy? What do you say to people who are making that choice? SANDERS: Well, I think we\'ll get the vast majority of the union workers. Trump will get some, but I think we\'ll get a lot more. I think what\'s going on, Erin, is there is a lot of anger in this country. For your average guy, he is asking why he has to work longer hours for lower wages. Why he\'s really worried or she is worried, mother really about the future of their children. And yet, almost all income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. People are angry. What Trump is doing is taking that anger and saying, it\'s the fault of the Mexicans or it\'s the fault of the Muslims. We\'ve got to scapegoat people. Well, beating up on Mexicans who make eight bucks an hour is not going to deal with the real issues facing --BURNETT: Are you, though, blaming rich people for it? SANDERS: It\'s not rich people, no. We are blaming a economic system right now where factually almost all the income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Where you have billionaires and large corporations that are not paying their fair share of taxes; there are some major corporations make billions a year in taxes, stash their money in the Cayman Islands, don\'t pay a nickel in taxes. And what I want to do is take that money, do away with that loophole, invest it in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We can create 13 million jobs over a five-year period with a trillion-dollar investment. That\'s roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants. It\'s not a question of blaming, it\'s a question of understanding the reality. It is a rigged economy. People on the top are doing phenomenally well; everybody else is doing worse. We\'ve got to change that. BURNETT: Susan Sarandon is a supporter of yours, as you know. The actress, she said, ""Some people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in."" Is Donald Trump more likely to bring about a revolution in this country -- and you\'ve been having revolutionary talk. I know not of the violent sort, but in terms of making changes in this country. Is he more likely to accomplish that --SANDERS: Well, I\'m not sure -- I heard that. I didn\'t really see here Susan\'s context -- Susan\'s comment within a broader context. I think Trump will be a disaster for this country. I think the idea of insulting women and veterans and African-Americans and Mexicans and Muslims is precisely what this country does not need and does not want. Look, in every poll that I\'ve seen, including a CNN poll, we were 20 points ahead of Trump. I do not believe Trump is going to become president of the United States. BURNETT: You do win in those head-to-heads, of course, in the polling. We spoke to some female Donald Trump supporters yesterday in Arizona. It was a fascinating conversation about why they do believe in Donald Trump, why they support him. Here\'s what one of them had to say. [begin video clip]UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What you see is what you get with this man. And that is what I want. I like transparency. I like to know what I can expect. And I feel that he will deliver what he says. And there\'s just no secrecy.[end video clip]BURNETT: Do you understand his appeal to women? SANDERS: I do. Well, it\'s not only -- no, I don\'t understand his appeal to women. I don\'t think he\'s particularly popular with women in general. You can\'t go around insulting women everyday and expect to gain support. But I understand where that woman is coming from. Look, people are sick and tired of establishment politicians. Politicians say one thing, they do another thing. You know, the Congress has a favorability rating of 15 percent or something. And Trump is, of course, very blunt and straightforward. But you\'ve got to look at what he is saying. Does that woman really believe the billionaire class should receive hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks over a 10-year period? I doubt it. Does she not think that we should raise the minimum wage? Trump does not. Does she really think we should insult Muslims all over the world? I don\'t think she does think that. So, I think the appeal of Trump is his bluntness, is his straightforwardness. And by the way, this guy is a good entertainer. He has done a very good job manipulating the media. He is a professional at that. And he has been successful doing it.BURNETT: So, let me talk about Muslims and the issues that he has brought up on that. I was in Brussels last week. I spoke to a young man, and it was 10 to 15 people who have gone to Syria to fight with ISIS. I spoke to the brother of the Paris attacker - of one of the Paris attackers a few months ago in Brussels. He told me he knows many young men who are in Syria training to fight with ISIS. And they\'re coming back now. And yet, you can still, without a visa, get on a plane in Brussels and fly to the United States. How do you prevent these young men who say their ultimate goal is to attack the United States from coming here without racially profiling, as Donald Trump suggested? SANDERS: You do everything that you can. And that means you have information, and we have -- that\'s what intelligence services are all over the world. And you share that information. And if people are going to Syria, if they\'re going to training camps, they\'re not going to come -- or if they come back into Brussels or they come into the United States, they\'re going to be arrested in five minutes. We have zero tolerance for people who are going to hurt Americans or people anyplace else in the world. BURNETT: But intelligence services haven\'t been coordinating. When people -- I know people in Brussels who said my son - one of - the bomber here, they said, my son is in Syria. And authorities didn\'t care. So if they don\'t know the names who\'s there, they don\'t know who\'s coming back. SANDERS: But Brooke (sic), look. No one is saying -- first of all, let\'s look at the broader issue. Number one in Iraq right now, ISIS on the defensive. They have lost about 40 percent of the territory they controlled. And I believe that if we\'re smart, if we do a good job in training the Iraqi army, and the Muslim nations, they can be destroyed in a year or two. That certainly is the goal. And second of all, we\'ve got to do everything that with can. No one has any magical solutions. But we do have to improve our intelligence capabilities. We do have to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement is much better coordinated in preventing these types of attacks. BURNETT: Before we go, federal officials, as you know, this week say they\'ve unlocked the iPhone of one of the shooters in San Bernardino. Now, they had been suing Apple to force Apple to do just that. They figured out how to do it themselves. I know you\'ve said you\'re fearful of Big Brother in America. But this is a terrorist\'s phone. Is it a good thing the FBI broke into it? SANDERS: Look, I think that clearly, we need to get all of the information that we can to stop terrorism. But at the same time, we have to be mindful that in a free society, you do not want the government, I suspect, into your telephone. Would I be correct in saying that? BURNETT: Mm-hmm. SANDERS: So, what the correct balance is what we have to determine. But I am concerned about civil liberties --BURNETT: Even protecting someone\'s phone that massacred Americans? SANDERS: No, not protecting -- that\'s the balance. Of course, you\'re going to go after people who are killing Americans. That goes without saying. But it is one thing to go after a terrorist; it is another thing to have millions of people being -- having their e-mails or their websites surveyed when the vast majority of them have nothing to do with terrorism. So how you balance in a free society, the civil liberties and the constitutional rights of our people, while on the other hand, going after terrorists. That is the balance that we\'ve got to establish. BURNETT: All right. Well, Senator Sanders, thank you very much for your time. Nice talking to you tonight. SANDERS: Nice to see you.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"March 30, 2016","b'Interview with Rachel Maddow of MSNBC in Madison, Wisconsin'","b'MADDOW: Welcome back to this super-sized edition of ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" tonight. Senator Bernie Sanders is riding high today, in today\'s presidential politics. Just a few days after his huge double-digit wins over the weekend in Alaska, and Hawaii and Washington State. Bolstered by those huge margins he got in the caucuses in those states this weekend, the Sanders campaign appears to now be feeling its proverbial oats. They\'re e not de demanding more debates with Hillary Clinton. The Sanders campaign is now calling Secretary Clinton a weak Democratic front-runner. The Sanders campaign is also committing to campaign heavily at some of the big states coming up, including New York State, where Senator Sanders will be tomorrow, and in the great state of Wisconsin, which votes on Tuesday, and where Senator Sanders has already been holding some big rallies. A brand new poll from Marquette University just out today puts Bernie e Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by four points. Looking down the barrel at that it is a good day to be Bernie Sanders. Today the senator held a big town hall event at the Orpheum Theater in Madison, Wisconsin. And the senator joins us from backstage at that theater now. Senator Sanders, thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate your time tonight. SANDERS: Good to be with you, Rachel. MADDOW: So congratulations on this big weekend that you had, not just wins in those three caucuses, but blowouts. Now there aren\'t that many more caucuses on the calendar, even though you\'ve done some well with them. The next big state is Wisconsin on Tuesday. Do you expect that you\'re about to win Wisconsin as well? SANDERS: Well, this is what I think -- I think that if there is a large voter turnout, if working-class people who have given up on the political process come out the vote, if young people who have never participated come out to vote, if there\'s a good turnout, we will win. If there\'s a low turnout, we\'ll probably lose. So we\'re doing everything that we can to create a high voter turnout. MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I\'m not going to ask you to play pundit. I am going to ask you about some stuff going on in the Republican field in just a second. But before we do that, I was struck by the cover story that ""Rolling Stone"" had recently, where they put you and Secretary Clinton on the cover. They called it ""the good fight,"" basically contrasting the fight between you two with what\'s happening on the Republican side, saying that the Democratic primary has been policy driven, and decent and intelligent. It\'s been an argument to be proud as a country. They also said it\'s been ""game-raising"" for both of you, basically that it\'s made you both better candidates. I wanted to know if you agree with that, if you think this has been a good fight to be proud of thus far and if you think it has changed you over time? SANDERS: Well, Rachel, let me say that comparing us to the Republicans, you know, the bar -- that\'s a pretty low bar to overcome. Uh, and I think what is really a -- a national disgrace -- and I think this is not just what, you know, average Americans are saying, but what many sane Republicans are saying. This country faces enormous crises. You know, massive levels of income and wealth inequality, a declining middle class, climate change, uh, the pay equity issue for women. And what Republican candidates have now stooped to is to starting attacking each other\'s wives. I mean this is an international embarrassment. I think people around the rest of the world think we are pretty crazy. So I think compared to that, at least, you know, what Secretary Clinton and I are trying to do, and while we have very different points of view, we are trying to discuss the real issues facing the American people and I think most objective Americans appreciate that a lot more than the kind of circus that is taking place on the Republican side. MADDOW: I had a chance to speak with Secretary Clinton earlier today and I asked her this question, as well. I\'m going to -- I\'m going to ask you because I think it is possible that you two might have a difference of opinion on this. Um, last night the Republican candidates gave up on what had been their previous pledges that they would all support their party\'s eventual nominee in the fall. Because of that, I think whether or not the Republicans nominate Donald Trump, there are plenty good odds now that are good portion of the Republican Party won\'t support whoever that party runs for president. Now, as a -- as somebody who\'s running in the Democratic -- for the Democratic nomination, do you look at that on the Republican side and say basically, you know, good riddance, it\'s about time for the Republican Party in this country to blow up... SANDERS: Well... MADDOW: -- I hope they come back with something better? Or are -- are you concerned, because our party -- party has a two party system and we need both parties to be strong and -- and sane in order to make this system work? SANDERS: Well, uh, first of all, I don\'t necessarily take at value -- face value what they say. I think at the end of the day, they probably will come together. But the other point, I think the more -- the deeper point, Rachel, is the Republican Party today has moved very, very far to the right. Uh, they are way out of touch with where the American people are. And I think if we had a media in this country that was really prepared to look at what the Republicans actually stood for rather than quoting every absurd remark of Donald Trump, talking about Republican Party, talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two tenths of 1 percent, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid, a party which with few exceptions, doesn\'t even acknowledge the reality of climate change, let alone do anything about it, a party which is not prepared to stand with women in the fight for pay equity, a party that is not prepared to do anything about a broken criminal justice system or a corrupt campaign finance system, I think, to be honest with you -- and I just don\'t, you know, say this rhetorically, this is a fringe party. It is a fringe party. Maybe they get 5, 10 percent of the vote. What you really need in this country is a progressive party standing with the working class and the middle class of this country. And yes, a conservative party that, you know, has, you know, is more fiscally conservative. That is where we should be as a country. But the Republican Party today now is a joke, maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues. So that -- that\'s my two cents on that. MADDOW: Well, if the -- let me try to get three cents out of you on that. If they\'re a -- a fringe party and a joke and they\'re no longer the conservative party that they appear to be, they\'re being propped up by a media that doesn\'t call them on what it is they\'re actually offering, does that mean that you would applaud if the Republican Party really did blow up? I mean some people say that the nomination of Donald Trump and the process they\'re going through now by which they -- they might nominate him is enough to maybe destroy that party, maybe end the Republican Party. Do you think that would -- that would be a good thing? SANDERS: Well, I\'m not going to give the Republican leadership, you know, really any ideas on how they can reorganize their party. All I can tell you is that it is absolutely imperative for the future of this country and for future generations that we do not have a Republican in the White House, whether it is Trump or Cruz or anybody else. And one of the things that I\'m proud of, Rachel, uh, and it hasn\'t gotten, I think, quite the attention that it deserves, is that in national poll after national poll, what you find is that, uh, I am leading, you know, people like Trump -- a poll came out a few days ago, CNN, by 20 points and a significantly larger number than Hillary Clinton is. So I think one of the points that we\'re trying to get across is if Re -- if the Democratic Party wants a strong candidate that will defeat Trump or some other Republican and beat them badly, I think I am the candidate, because we appeal not only to Democrats, but to a lot of Independents and actually some Republicans, as well. MADDOW: Your campaign has talked about those head-to-head match-ups, those hypothetical match-ups in November, uh, as essentially the case that you might make to the super delegates. And you -- you and I have talked about this, uh, before. But since we last spoke about it, your campaign has gone into more -- to more detail about this. Tad Devine, uh, said to Greg Sargent at ""The Washington Post"" this week that your campaign would try to convince super delegates to support you at the convention on this -- on the strength of what you just said there, that you have a better chance in the general election, that they would try to flip those super delegates to support you even if, at the convention, you\'re behind both in the pledged delegates and in the popular vote. Um, I felt... SANDERS: Well... MADDOW: -- I thought that was surprising. I just wanted to find out if that really is your campaign strategy. SANDERS: Well, look, I don\'t want to get into -- too deeply into process here. First of all, we hope to be ahead in the delegate count. That\'s the important thing. Uh, but what I do believe is that, uh, there are a lot of Republican -- a lot of super delegates who have signed onto Hillary Clinton a long, long time ago, uh, and then you have other super delegates who are in states where we have won by 20, 30, 40 points. And the people in those states are saying you know what, we voted for Bernie Sanders by 30 or 40 points, you\'ve got to support him at the convention. So we\'ll see what happens down the line. But our main task right now is to, in fact, come out of this whole process after California with more delegates, uh, than Secretary Clinton. MADDOW: Are you working now on -- on lobbying some of the super delegates? We should say super delegates... SANDERS: We are... MADDOW: -- [inaudible] elected officials and -- and party leaders. Are you working now on... SANDERS: Well... MADDOW: -- on trying to persuade them? SANDERS: -- yes, we are. We -- we are. We have started off by going to those states, you know, states like Utah, uh, states like Hawaii, uh, states, um, that have given us, uh, very large, uh, victories and trying to get to those people and say you know what, your state voted overwhelmingly for us, listen to what your state has to say. MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I have -- I promise I won\'t ask you only process questions here, but I do want to ask you about something, uh, that arose this week from your campaign that I, um, I -- I disagree with on factual grounds. And I\'ll tell you what it is. Your campaign said this week that Secretary Clinton is leading overall basically because you chose not to compete, um, in eight states -- in Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee. Uh, and the reason I say I take factual issue with that is because, you know, I -- I saw the footage of your rallies in -- in Texas and Virginia, at least. SANDERS: Right. MADDOW: We reported you were first on the ground ahead of Clinton... SANDERS: Right. MADDOW: -- in Alabama, Virginia, Texas, Tennessee. Why is your campaign now saying that you... SANDERS: Well, I don\'t -- look... MADDOW: -- simply didn\'t try in those states? SANDERS: Rachel, you\'re talking -- you say you don\'t want to talk about process, this is exactly what we\'re talking about. One person said that. I don\'t know the context of that. Once we were in Texas. We had great rallies in Dallas, in Houston, uh, and in Austin. Of course we campaigned there. I think perhaps what Tad meant by that is we did not put a lot of money into TV advertising that we know those states would be difficult states for us and we used our resources elsewhere. But to be honest with you, we put a lot of money into South Carolina and we did poorly. So of course we did compete in Mississippi, Alabama, not a whole lot, to be honest with you. But I think what Tad was meaning is that we did not put a lot of resources into those states. MADDOW: You told me, uh, in -- in January, you articulated it a few other places, that the Democratic Party really needs to run a 50 state strategy and that people in places like South Carolina... SANDERS: Absolutely. MADDOW: -- and Mississippi specifically... SANDERS: Absolutely. MADDOW: -- need strong Democratic campaigns there so that their voices get heard. How do you say that with... SANDERS: Absolutely. MADDOW: -- with not running that hard in a place like Mississippi? SANDERS: Well, I will tell you how. If there were -- if we had a -- a lot longer time, that\'s exactly what I would do. But the difficult choices you have to make -- right now, I\'m in Wisconsin. Well, you know what, I should be in New York, I should be in New Jersey, I should be in California. But what you had to do in the midst of a campaign is to say where is our time, where are our resources? Let\'s allocate it if we\'re going to win this thing. Truthfully, we knew from day one we were never going to win in Mississippi or Alabama. But the point you make is a different point. It is the correct point. I believe that starting yesterday, the Democratic Party has got to start planting flags in all of those states. Now, they may not win it in 2016 or 2018. But you\'re never going to win it unless you begin somewhere, unless you mobilize the grassroots in those states, come forward with good, strong candidates. So it\'s really not a contradiction. I do believe very strongly if elected president, I will create a situation where the DNC is a 50 state party. You cannot ignore half the states of America, including those states who are -- have the poorest people, the highest levels of unemployment, the worst health care system in the country. Democrats have got to pay attention to all 50 states. MADDOW: Senator Sanders, will you stay with us for just a moment? I have -- I have more to ask you, I promise. SANDERS: OK. MADDOW: My conversation with Senator Sanders continues in just a moment. Stay with us. [commercial break]MADDOW: Joining us once again from Madison, Wisconsin is Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator Sanders, thank you again for being with us tonight. Appreciate it. After, uh, the word spread that Donald Trump had made those remarks today about abortion, that a woman needs to be punished, uh, if she seeks an abortion and abortion should be banned, you said today that was shameful. What is shameful about it? SANDERS: Well, I think it is -- shameful is probably understating that position. First of all, to me, and I think to most Americans, women have the right to control their own bodies and they have the right to make those personal decisions themselves. But to punish a woman for having an abortion is beyond comprehension. I -- I just -- you know, one would say what is in Donald Trump\'s mind except we\'re tired of saying that? I don\'t know what world this person lives in. So obviously, from my perspective, and if elected president, I will do everybody that I can to allow women to make that choice and have access to clinics all over this country so that if they choose to have an abortion, they will be able to do so. The idea of punishing a woman, that is just, you know, beyond comprehension. MADDOW: And Mr. Trump has made -- is making headlines on -- on this issue today, obviously, because of what he said. It\'s sort of, you know, taken the media day by storm. Um, that said, I think there may be a case to be made -- and I\'d love your -- just your response to this, your perspective on this, uh, that his opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, is more extreme on this issue. And I say that, in part, because one of his national co-chairs on his Pro-Lifers for Cruz coalition, is a man named Troy Newman, who once wrote a book saying that abortion providers should be executed. Is Ted Cruz even further out on this issue than Donald Trump is? SANDERS: Well, you -- you know, you\'re living in crazy world there. And that is why, uh, you know, the Republican Party, if they continue in this direction, will be, as I mentioned a moment ago, a fringe party. Uh, look, they have nothing to say. All they can appeal is to a small number of people who feel very rabid, very rabid about a particular issue, whether it\'s abortion or maybe whether it\'s gay marriage. That is their constituency. They have nothing of substance. You know, you mentioned a moment ago, Rachel, that the media is paying attention to Donald Trump. Duh? No kidding. Once again, every stupid remark will be broadcast, you know, for the next five days. But what is Donald Trump\'s position on raising the minimum wage? Well, he doesn\'t think so. What is Donald Trump\'s position on wages in America? Well, he said in a Republican debate he thinks wages are too high. What\'s Donald Trump\'s position on taxes? Well, he wants to give billionaire families like himself hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. What is Donald Trump\'s position on climate change? Oh, he thinks it\'s a hoax perpetrated, shock of all shock, by the Chinese. You know, on and on it goes. But because media is what media is today, any stupid, absurd remark made by Donald Trump becomes the story of the week. Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. Donald Trump will not look quite so interesting in that context. MADDOW: Are you suggesting, though, that the media shouldn\'t be focusing on his call to potentially jail women who have abortions? Because that\'s another stupid -- SANDERS: I am saying that every day he comes up with another stupid remark, absurd remark, of course it should be mentioned. But so should Trump\'s overall positions. How much talk do we hear about climate change, Rachel? And Trump? Any? MADDOW: He said that he cares more about nuclear climate change, which is a term that he\'s invented. SANDERS: Nuclear climate change? MADDOW: That\'s just what he comes up with when he\'s asked on the subject. SANDERS: All that I\'m saying is that Trump is nobody\'s fool. He knows how to manipulate the media and you say an absurd thing and the media is all over it. And my concern is that today in America, you\'ve got millions of people who are struggling economically. They want to know how we\'re going to expand the middle class. Overwhelmingly, people think we should raise the minimum wage. Vast majority of people think climate change is real and a threat to our planet. They want to do something about that. What do we do? Vast majority of the people think the wealthiest people in this country should start paying their fair share of taxes. But if we don\'t discuss those issues, it creates the climate for people like Donald Trump to do much better than he really has a right to do. MADDOW: Senator, you have been a fierce critic of the influence of the wealthy and big business on our politics, not just on who gets their way but who sets the agenda. As Republican legislators and governors have recently been weighing new laws that are discriminatory, particularly against LGBT people in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Missouri and Indiana, big business, including Bank of America, today in North Carolina, has weighed in strongly against those discriminatory laws. Do you think those businesses should butt out of those issues? Is it inappropriate for them to try to wield political influence even when they do it in a progressive way? SANDERS: Well, look, they have -- when we look at politics in America, you have CEO\'s of major corporations who have children who are gay, who have friends who are gay, whose wives or daughters have had abortions -- they live in the real world and they\'re responding to the type of very right win reactionary policies and I understand that and I appreciate that. When I talk about money in politics, what I talk about is the Koch brothers and billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars, along with Wall Street, to create a situation where politicians will be elected who represent the wealthy and the powerful. MADDOW: On one of the issues that the Koch brothers and their networks have supported in a way that I think has been stealthy but very effective is an issue concerning veterans. And you were the former chairman of the Veterans Committee in the senate, and in that capacity, you worked closely with Senator John McCain on a number of issues. He\'s praised you in this campaign. You\'ve talked about your ability to work with him on veterans\' issues. But right now, Senator McCain is actually pushing a proposal to effectively privatize large parts of the VA, which is something that the Koch brothers and their networks have pushed. What\'s your response to that? Do you have plans to try to stop him on that, particularly given your past relationship? SANDERS: Of course. Categorically disagree. What you have is a group called The Concerned Veterans of America. They appear on and have appeared on stations like CNN time and time again without being identified as being funded by the Koch brothers. And what they are doing is taking legitimate criticisms of the VA and blowing them up and then coming to the conclusion that at least partially, if not totally, we should privatize the VA. Look, this is an issue that I have dealt with. And what I will tell you is having talked to the American Legion, the VFW and the DAV and the Vietnam vets and virtually every veterans organization, what they tell you is that once veterans get into the VA system, the care is pretty good. It is pretty good. The problem has been getting back -- getting into the VA system and also legitimately how people who live 50, 60, 100 miles away, 200 miles away from a VA facility. Should they have to travel 200 miles to get their health care? The answer is no, they should not. But the idea of privatizing the VA would be, in my mind, a huge mistake and a great disservice to the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend us. MADDOW: Do you feel like the way that veterans have advocated for themselves, the way that\'s changed since the Vietnam era and through to today\'s generation of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, do you feel like there\'s any lessons there, uh, in terms of bringing about social change in this country? You talk about a political revolution and people getting their voices heard, particularly people who otherwise get boxed out of a system stacked against them. Have -- have veterans, in a way, sort of shown us a way around some of those, uh, those structural barriers to political change? SANDERS: Well, I think you have organizations that do a very good job -- and obviously I know them all, because I was chairman of the committee -- who represent veterans\' interests. What I don\'t think we have at this point is the kind of grassroots activism at the local level that we should be having. So there\'s a lot of good groups in Washington, the DAV, the VFW, the American Legion, the Vietnam vets and others who are really there, who are fighting for veterans rights. But I would like to see more grassroots activism take place. MADDOW: One last question for you, Senator. I know you\'re kind of tight today. Uh, and it is about your prodigious fundraising. After those huge wins this weekend in those three caucus states, we know that within something like 24 hours, your state had raised $4 million. Um, you have shown an incredible ability to tap large numbers of people for small amounts of money that really, really add up and you\'ve got, ostensibly, infinite resources to stay in this campaign as long as you want... SANDERS: Well... MADDOW: -- no matter what lese happens. I have to ask, though, if you have thought about whether or not you will, at some point, turn your fundraising ability toward helping the Democratic Party more broadly, to helping their campaign committees for the House and the Senate and for other -- for other elections? SANDERS: Well, right now, Rachel, as you are more than aware, our job is to -- what I\'m trying to do is to win the Democratic nomination. And I\'ll tell you something, I never in a million years, Rachel, would have believed that we could have, uh, received over six million individual campaign contributions averaging 27 bucks apiece, a very different way of raising money than Secretary Clinton has pursued. So right now, we are enormously appreciative. You\'re right, without that type of support, we would not be where we are right now. We would not be able to continue this campaign to the Democratic convention. So I am just blown away and very appreciative of all of the kind of support that we have gotten from grassroots America. MADDOW: Well, obviously your priority is the nomination, but I mean you raised Secretary Clinton there. She has been fundraising both for the nomination and for the Democratic Party. At some point, do you think -- do you foresee a time during this campaign when you\'ll start doing that? SANDERS: Well, we\'ll see. And, I mean right now, again, our focus is on winning the nomination. Secretary Clinton has access, uh, to kinds of money, uh, that we don\'t, that we\'re not even interested in. So let\'s take it one step at a time. And the step that we\'re in right now is to win the Democratic nomination. MADDOW: Vermont senator, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you so much for your time tonight. I know you\'re stretched very thin. Thank you, sir. SANDERS: Thank you, Rachel. Take care. MADDOW: All right.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 1, 2016",b'Interview by The Daily News Editorial Board',"b'DAILY NEWS: We are very well aware of the broad themes of your campaign by now. So we\'d like to hone in on some of the more particular issues to get a sense of how your presidency might evolve. Youve said that the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. So if we can get particular: For example, in corporate America, Apple happens to be celebrating, today, its 40th birthday. It\'s a company that grew from nothing to 115,000 permanent employees. And I\'m wondering, is Apple destroying the fabric of America SANDERS: No, Apple is not destroying the fabric of America. But I do wish they\'d be manufacturing some of their devices, here, in the United States rather than in China. And I do wish that they would not be trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Well, would you name, say, three American corporate giants that are destroying the national fabric? SANDERS: JPMorgan Chase, and virtually every other major bank in this country. Let me be very clear, all right? I believe that we can and should move to what Pope Francis calls a moral economy. Right now, there are still millions of people in this country who are suffering the results of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street. And when you have companies like Goldman Sachs and many other major banks reaching settlements with the United States government, as you\'re aware, for many billions of dollars, this is an implicit admission that they have engaged in illegal activity. DAILY NEWS: I understand that. I wanted to draw a distinction, though. Because in your speech you mention the financial industry and you focused on corporate America, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America. So I wanted to get a sense of corporate America, as the agent of American destruction. SANDERS: General Electric, good example. General Electric was created in this country by American workers and American consumers. What we have seen over the many years is shutting down of many major plants in this country. Sending jobs to low-wage countries. And General Electric, doing a very good job avoiding the taxes. In fact, in a given year, they pay nothing in taxes. That\'s greed. That is greed and thats selfishness. That is lack of respect for the people of this country. DAILY NEWS: And so how does that destroy the fabric of America? SANDERS: I\'ll tell you how it does. If you are a corporation and the only damn thing you are concerned about is your profits. Let\'s just give an example of a corporation that\'s making money in America, today, but desiring to move to China or to Mexico to make even more money. That is destroying the moral fabric of this country. That is saying that I don\'t care that the workers, here have worked for decades. It doesn\'t matter to me. The only thing that matters is that I can make a little bit more money. That the dollar is all that is almighty. And I think that is the moral fabric. To me, what moral is, I\'ve got to be concerned about you. You\'ve got to be concerned about my wife. That\'s moral to me. That\'s what I believe in. And if the only thing that matters to you is making an extra buck, you don\'t care about my family, I think that\'s immoral. And I think what corporate America has shown us in the last number of years, what Wall Street has shown us, the only thing that matters is their profits and their money. And the hell with the rest of the people of this country. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Do you weigh in the balance at all, the fact that a company that\'s moving jobs overseas, that the competitive climate may be such that they feel that they must, to compete in the United States? SANDERS: No. I think, firstly, we have to appreciate these guys wrote the rules in the first place. So they wrote the trade agreements. And then, yes, I do understand you can make more profits by paying people in Mexico, or China, or Vietnam pennies an hour, I do understand that. But I believe that people have...and, by the way, I\'m not anti-trade. We live in a global economy, we need trade. But the trade policies that we have allowed to occur, that were written by corporate America have been disastrous for American workers. So I think we need trade. But I think it should be based on fair trade policies. No, I don\'t think it is appropriate for trade policies to say that you can move to a country where wages are abysmal, where there are no environmental regulations, where workers can\'t form unions. That\'s not the kind of trade agreement that I will support. DAILY NEWS: So how would you stop that? SANDERS: I will stop it by renegotiating all of the trade agreements that we have. And by establishing principles that says that what fair trade is about is you are going to take into consideration the wages being paid to workers in other countries. And the environmental standards that exist. DAILY NEWS: So you\'re talking NAFTA. You\'re talking the Pacific. You\'re talking all of it. SANDERS: Yeah. Look, these trade agreements, let\'s be frank. Now, people may disagree with me, all right. My understanding, talking to many economists is, NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements have cost this country millions of jobs. You go to Flint, Michigan, today. And everyone looks at Flint, Michigan today because they\'re seeing children being poisoned by the water systems. What people forget is that in the 1960s, Flint, Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America. Very prosperous city, because you had GM manufacturing plants there. That city is a disaster right now. And that is not just Flint, Michigan. It is cities all over this country have lost their tax base. They\'ve lost their decent-paying jobs because of disastrous trade policie. DAILY NEWS: Another one of your potential opponents has a very similar sounding answer to, or solution to, the trade situation  and that\'s Donald Trump. He also says that, although he speaks with much more blunt language and says, and with few specifics, ""Bad deals. Terrible deals. I\'ll make them good deals."" So in that sense I hear whispers of that same sentiment. How is your take on that issue different than his? SANDERS: Well, if he thinks they\'re bad trade deals, I agree with him. They are bad trade deals. But we have some specificity and it isnt just us going around denouncing bad trade. In other words, I do believe in trade. But it has to be based on principles that are fair. So if you are in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 65 an hour, or you\'re in Malaysia, where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions, no, I\'m not going to have American workers ""competing"" against you under those conditions. So you have to have standards. And what fair trade means to say that it is fair. It is roughly equivalent to the wages and environmental standards in the United States. DAILY NEWS: At what point in history, in the recent history of the United States, do you think the balance began to tip against the American worker? SANDERS: In the early \'70s. I think it was in the late \'60s/early \'70s. I think Lyndon Johnson\'s, maybe even earlier than that, the victory over Goldwater, in \'64 got the ruling class in this country very nervous. And I think there became a very organized effort, on the part of corporate America, and very powerful forces, to say, ""Look, we are in trouble. And we\'re going to have to fight back."" And I think what you have seen in a number of ways, trade being one way, attacks on trade unions being another way, to really reestablish and strengthen the power of the few against the many. DAILY NEWS: And do you trace all of that, do you ascribe, are those the forces in your mind that have led to wage stagnation since then? SANDERS: I think there\'s been a very concerted effort to take on trade unions. No question about that. You\'re seeing that every day, or in the last few years, in Wisconsin, what the governor there, Scott Walker, is about. That is a perfect metaphor for what I think corporate America...much, I\'m not going to say all of, but much of corporate America has wanted to privatize everything that can be privatized. To destroy trade unions. To make it harder for people to get health care. To give tax breaks to the very wealthiest people in this country. Yeah, I think that has been a very concerted effort. DAILY NEWS: Now, switching to the financial sector, to Wall Street. Speaking broadly, you said that within the first 100 days of your administration you\'d be drawing up...your Treasury Department would be drawing up a too-big-to-fail list. Would you expect that that\'s essentially the list that already exists under Dodd-Frank? Under the Financial Stability Oversight Council? SANDERS: Yeah. I mean these are the largest financial institutions in the world. DAILY NEWS: And then, you further said that you expect to break them up within the first year of your administration. What authority do you have to do that? And how would that work? How would you break up JPMorgan Chase? SANDERS: Well, by the way, the idea of breaking up these banks is not an original idea. It\'s an idea that some conservatives have also agreed to. You\'ve got head of, I think it\'s, the Kansas City Fed, some pretty conservative guys, who understands. Let\'s talk about the merit of the issue, and then talk about how we get there. Right now, what you have are two factors. We bailed out Wall Street because the banks are too big to fail, correct? It turns out, that three out of the four largest banks are bigger today than they were when we bailed them out, when they were too-big-to-fail. That\'s number one. Number two, if you look at the six largest financial institutions of this country, their assets somewhere around $10 trillion. That is equivalent to 58% of the GDP of America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards in this country, and about one-third of the mortgages. That is a lot of power. And I think that if somebody, like if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, he would look at that. Forgetting even the risk element, the bailout element, and just look at the kind of financial power that these guys have, would say that is too much power. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Well, let\'s assume that you\'re correct on that point. How do you go about doing it? SANDERS: How you go about doing it is having legislation passed, or giving the authority to the secretary of treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail. DAILY NEWS: But do you think that the Fed, now, has that authority? SANDERS: Well, I don\'t know if the Fed has it. But I think the administration can have it. DAILY NEWS: How? How does a President turn to JPMorgan Chase, or have the Treasury turn to any of those banks and say, ""Now you must do X, Y and Z?"" SANDERS: Well, you do have authority under the Dodd-Frank legislation to do that, make that determination. DAILY NEWS: You do, just by Federal Reserve fiat, you do? SANDERS: Yeah. Well, I believe you do. DAILY NEWS: So if you look forward, a year, maybe two years, right now you have...JPMorgan has 241,000 employees. About 20,000 of them in New York. $192 billion in net assets. What happens? What do you foresee? What is JPMorgan in year two of... SANDERS: What I foresee is a stronger national economy. And, in fact, a stronger economy in New York State, as well. What I foresee is a financial system which actually makes affordable loans to small and medium-size businesses. Does not live as an island onto themselves concerned about their own profits. And, in fact, creating incredibly complicated financial tools, which have led us into the worst economic recession in the modern history of the United States. DAILY NEWS: I get that point. I\'m just looking at the method because, actions have reactions, right? There are pluses and minuses. So, if you push here, you may get an unintended consequence that you don\'t understand. So, what I\'m asking is, how can we understand? If you look at JPMorgan just as an example, or you can do Citibank, or Bank of America. What would it be? What would that institution be? Would there be a consumer bank? Where would the investing go? SANDERS: I\'m not running JPMorgan Chase or Citibank. DAILY NEWS: No. But you\'d be breaking it up. SANDERS: That\'s right. And that is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves. That\'s not my decision. All I am saying is that I do not want to see this country be in a position where it was in 2008, where we have to bail them out. And, in addition, I oppose that kind of concentration of ownership entirely. You\'re asking a question, which is a fair question. But let me just take your question and take it to another issue. Alright? It would be fair for you to say, ""Well, Bernie, you got on there that you are strongly concerned about climate change and that we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. What happens to the people in the fossil fuel industry?"" That\'s a fair question. But the other part of that is if we do not address that issue the planet were gonna leave your kids and your grandchildren may not be a particularly healthy or habitable one. So I can\'t say, if you\'re saying that were going to break up the banks, will it have a negative consequence on some people? I suspect that it will. Will it have a positive impact on the economy in general? Yes, I think it will. DAILY NEWS: Well, it does depend on how you do it, I believe. And, I\'m a little bit confused because just a few minutes ago you said the U.S. President would have authority to order... SANDERS: No, I did not say we would order. I did not say that we would order. The President is not a dictator. DAILY NEWS: Okay. You would then leave it to JPMorgan Chase or the others to figure out how to break it, themselves up. I\'m not quite... SANDERS: You would determine is that, if a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. And then you have the secretary of treasury and some people who know a lot about this, making that determination. If the determination is that Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase is too big to fail, yes, they will be broken up. DAILY NEWS: Okay. You saw, I guess, what happened with Metropolitan Life. There was an attempt to bring them under the financial regulatory scheme, and the court said no. And what does that presage for your program? SANDERS: It\'s something I have not studied, honestly, the legal implications of that. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Staying with Wall Street, you\'ve pointed out, that ""not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy."" Why was that? Why did that happen? Why was there no prosecution? SANDERS: I would suspect that the answer that some would give you is that while what they did was horrific, and greedy and had a huge impact on our economy, that some suggest that...that those activities were not illegal. I disagree. And I think an aggressive attorney general would have found illegal activity. DAILY NEWS: So do you think that President Obama\'s Justice Department essentially was either in the tank or not as... SANDERS: No, I wouldnt say they were in the tank. I\'m saying, a Sanders administration would have a much more aggressive attorney general looking at all of the legal implications. All I can tell you is that if you have Goldman Sachs paying a settlement fee of $5 billion, other banks paying a larger fee, I think most Americans think, ""Well, why do they pay $5 billion?"" Not because they\'re heck of a nice guys who want to pay $5 billion. Something was wrong there. And if something was wrong, I think they were illegal activities. DAILY NEWS: Okay. But do you have a sense that there is a particular statute or statutes that a prosecutor could have or should have invoked to bring indictments? SANDERS: I suspect that there are. Yes. DAILY NEWS: You believe that? But do you know? SANDERS: I believe that that is the case. Do I have them in front of me, now, legal statutes? No, I don\'t. But if I would...yeah, that\'s what I believe, yes. When a company pays a $5 billion fine for doing something that\'s illegal, yeah, I think we can bring charges against the executives. DAILY NEWS: I\'m only pressing because you\'ve made it such a central part of your campaign. And I wanted to know what the mechanism would be to accomplish it. SANDERS: Let me be very clear about this. Alright? Let me repeat what I have said. Maybe you\'ve got a quote there. I do believe that, to a significant degree, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. And you asked me, you started this discussion off appropriately enough about when I talk about morality. When I talk about it, that\'s what I think. I think when you have the most powerful financial institutions in this country, whose assets are equivalent to 58% of the GDP of this country, who day after day engage in fraudulent activity, that sets a tone. That sets a tone for some 10-year-old kid in this country who says, ""Look, these people are getting away from it. They\'re lying. They\'re cheating. Why can\'t I do that?"" DAILY NEWS: What kind of fraudulent activity are you referring to when you say that? SANDERS: What kind of fraudulent activity? Fraudulent activity that brought this country into the worst economic decline in its history by selling packages of fraudulent, fraudulent, worthless subprime mortgages. How\'s that for a start? Selling products to people who you knew could not repay them. Lying to people without allowing them to know that in a year, their interest rates would be off the charts. They would not repay that. Bundling these things. Putting them into packages with good mortgages. That\'s fraudulent activity. DAILY NEWS: All right. You say also that the big financial institutions and the wealthy have rigged the game against regular Americans. And you\'ve also criticized Hillary Clinton for saying, ""We just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the finance industry."" SANDERS: Yep. DAILY NEWS: You\'ve also pointed out her financial ties, if you will, to Wall Street. So given all of that, is Secretary Clinton trustworthy on this issue? SANDERS: Let me get back to your first point, about a rigged economy, which is absolutely what I have said. Thank you. You got my quotes right. A rigged economy is about an economy, for example, where the wealthiest family in this country, the Walton family of Walmart, pays its workers wages that are so low that the middle class has to pay more in taxes to provide food stamps and Medicaid for Walmart employees. A rigged economy is when you have corporations making billions of dollars a year in taxes, billions of dollars a year in profit, and not paying a nickel in taxes. A rigged economy is where you have companies able to shut down as a result of trade agreements that they have written, and move abroad and pay people pennies an hour. That is a rigged economy. A rigged economy is when, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. If that\'s not a rigged economy, I don\'t know what a rigged economy is. Now, Hillary Clinton, Ill let the AmericanIve tried to run a campaign, which is an issue oriented campaign. Where I have expressed my strong disagreement with Secretary Clinton on trade issues. She has supported virtually all of these trade agreements. On how we raise money. I don\'t have a super PAC. She has several super PACs, which have raised a lot of money. She has given speeches to Wall Street. I have not attacked her personally. I will let the American people make a determination about her trustworthiness. That is not an area that I\'m comfortable DAILY NEWS: Okay. Let\'s take it out of the character question then. If you look at the facts, a rigged economy, Hillary Clinton saying that she would impose some fees and extra costs, and you finding that insufficient. And youre also saying that she has been taking money, including personal funds, from financial industry interests. Were she to be elected, do you think that the American people could have the expectation or the trust that she would be aggressive enough against the banks and financial institutions? SANDERS: That\'s a very fair question and I think the answer is they will probably have the expectation she would not be aggressive enough. Look, I will not shock anybody in this room in suggesting what everybody in America knows, that Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the Democratic establishment. Alright, you don\'t get $15 million from Wall Street by accident. She is an establishment candidate. To my point of view, the terms of her issues and views are far, far preferable to any of the Republican candidates. But I think what she has basically said is, not to expect bold change from her. She talks about incremental change. I think that\'s a fair statement, is it not? Alright, I believe that in the midst of the kinds of crises that we face with a disappearing middle class and massive levels of income and wealth inequality, the only major country on earth not guarantee to healthcare to all people, only major country not to provide paid family and medical leave, it is time to get beyond establishment politics. So to put your question in maybe a simpler way, is she a candidate of the establishment? The answer is, of course she is. That does not make her an evil person. Im not judging her character DAILY NEWS: I wasn\'t suggesting that. SANDERS: I know that. But that\'s all. DAILY NEWS: With a couple of those points in mind, there\'s a lot of speculation that if she were to win the nomination, would your followers and your supporters vote for her? Or would their absence in the voting in November help whomever the Republican nominee is? Whether it\'s Trump or Cruz. With that in mind, and this might be putting the cart ahead of the horse a little bit, would you ever consider running as her vice-president? SANDERS: Well, I think you have put the cart ahead of the horse on that one. We\'re in this race to win. We think weve got a shot to win. And that\'s what we\'re focusing on right now. There are millions of people. I am very grateful millions of people are supporting me. How they will vote, I don\'t know. DAILY NEWS: But are you concerned? Not to interrupt you, about the specter of there not being enough support rallying around her from your camp? SANDERS: What I am concerned about, what I think would be a disaster for the United States of America, is to see a Donald Trump or some right wing Republican become President of the United States. I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening. DAILY NEWS: Senator, I wanted to ask you. Because you\'ve got this enormous support from young people, as President Obama did in 2008 and 2012. And you\'re promising a political revolution. But, if nothing changes in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, how are you going to be able to get anything done? I mean the real issue to me seems to be, what happens in the Senate? And what happens in the House of Representatives? SANDERS: Two things. We are talking about a political revolution and we are already delivering on a political revolution well before Election Day. What do I mean by that? What I mean is this country, and what I say in every speech that I give, no President, not me or anybody else, can do it alone. We need to revitalize American democracy, get people engaged in the political process, in a way that we have not seen for a very, very, very long time. And the reason I say that, getting back to the questions right here, is, in my view, the powers that be in this country  Wall Street, large campaign contributors, corporate America  are so powerful, no President alone could do it. So what we are seeing already, in this campaign, is, we have received over six million individual campaign contributions. That\'s a political revolution, you know that? That\'s unprecedented, I believe, at this point in the campaign, in history. We are seeing...and when you talk about young people, please do not think that these are 23-year-olds or younger. In virtually every primary and caucus process, we have won the votes of people 45 years of age or younger. They\'re not just kids. And we\'re seeing, I think, a revitalization of American democracy. I never believed that we could have voter turnouts higher than Obama did in 2008. Because I thought his 2008 campaign was one of the great campaigns in American history. And, yet, in at least five states, the voter turnout in this campaign so far has been higher. So we are striking a nerve. People want to get involved in the political process and Im very proud of that. Now, to answer your question. You can\'t look at politics as a zero-sum game, and say, ""Okay..."" First of all, if I win, it will almost by definition mean that there will be a very large voter turnout. That\'s what I believe. If there is a very large voter turnout, I think the odds are pretty strong Democrats will regain control of the Senate, do better in the House. Can they win the House? I don\'t know. But they will do better. But more importantly, if I win, it will mean that millions of people now want to be involved in the political process in a way that has not previously existed. Every item that I am talking about on my agenda is, I believe, supported by the majority of the people in this country. My major job is to mobilize the American people to demand that Congress listen to them and their needs rather than just the big money interests. That\'s how you make change take place. For example, as you know, I\'ve talked about the need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Do I believe we can deliver on that? Absolutely, because I believe that millions of young people and their parents understand that that\'s what we should be doing right now. And I think if Republicans or some Democrats want to vote against it, they will pay a very heavy political price. DAILY NEWS: I want to follow up on something you\'ve just said. I have heard very, very little in this campaign, about education. What do you think about that, considering what\'s going on in this country? But also very specifically there is a trend in this country of wealthy suburbs being better funded in education than urban districts. In this state, there\'s even a lawsuit where the plaintiffs prevailed but nothing changed. What would a Sanders administration... SANDERS: That was the same thing with South Carolina, by the way. DAILY NEWS: Yeah, I know. There\'s a few of them, but what would or could a Sanders administration do about this? SANDERS: We could do a lot. Number one, your point is absolutely right and I think there has not been enough discussion. I\'ve kind of focused on, at the university level, public colleges, universities being tuition-free only, student debt. But your point is a very important point. There is a major effort for a start to privatize public education in America, which I think is a disastrous idea. I think we have got to adequately fund education. I think in the broader sense what we have got to do is make the American people understand how important education is to our quality of life and to our economy. So what does that mean? It means that we have to start off with the lowest link. Right now, every psychologist in the world will tell you that zero through four are the most important years of a human being\'s life, alright? No debate, really. Our childcare pre-K system is dysfunctional. You\'ve got teachers out there or instructors or somebody, I don\'t know what their title is, who make less than McDonald\'s workers. They have no benefits, theyre making $10 an hour. These are the people we are trusting with the youngest kids in America. That\'s insane. DAILY NEWS: Okay, I\'d like to switch topics here to... SANDERS: No, let me just say that I think education is an enormously important topic. DAILY NEWS: No question. DAILY NEWS: Can I ask one question? DAILY NEWS: Yes, you may. Of course. DAILY NEWS: Having lived in Vermont quite long myself and a fellow Vermonter. SANDERS: Whered you live? DAILY NEWS: Well, I have a place in Morristown. SANDERS: Yeah, sure. DAILY NEWS: But when you were mayor of Vermont... SANDERS: Burlington. DAILY NEWS: Mayor of Burlington, I\'m sorry. I guess you\'re mayor of Vermont too. When you were mayor of Burlington and you revitalized the city to what it is today and you had a lot of opposition when you became mayor. One of the ways you were able to succeed in making all the changes in a very pragmatic way is that you had a lot of grassroots organizations... SANDERS: That\'s right. DAILY NEWS: ...that were able to put a lot of influence with local government. SANDERS: Yes. DAILY NEWS: Is that possible to be able to do that at the federal level? SANDERS: Absolutely. And that\'s something I was just talking in response to your question. Okay. People say to me, ""Well, Bernie, how are you going to bring about change?"" You\'ve got Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan or whatever it is. Are they going to do the things you want? And the answer is no. But the way change happened in Burlington is we had tremendous opposition. By the way, I ran as an independent...it was mostly Democrats who opposed me at that point. We rallied the people in the city, the grassroots organizations. A year later, we won more seats on the city council to give us veto power. And mostly the Democrats understood that the sentiments were changing. They started working with me. That\'s what I\'m talking about. What I\'m talking about is millions of people. For example, let me give you just a concrete example of that, two examples. Right now, I gather yesterday it was, correct me if I\'m wrong, the governor and legislature reached an agreement here for $15 an hour minimum wage. Correct? DAILY NEWS: Correct. SANDERS: Okay. Now if you and I were sitting here five years ago and I said, ""You know, I think in 2016, there\'ll be a $15-an-hour agreement,"" you would have said I was crazy, correct? DAILY NEWS: I\'m not sure. SANDERS: Many people would have. But what happened? What happened is a grassroots movement developed. Remember, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, it\'s a big jump. DAILY NEWS: Yeah, right, it is. SANDERS: Okay. It happened because people stood up and fought back, alright? In the Congress right now, massive effort on the part of Republicans to cut Social Security, and some Democrats. I formed a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. They haven\'t cut Social Security. We rallied senior citizens. So to answer your question, that is exactly the model I am talking about. DAILY NEWS: Okay, well, now let me... JANE SANDERS: We doubled voter turnout. I think it\'s important to... SANDERS: Thats my spokesman. DAILY NEWS: Good, thank you. So I want to focus you on some international issues, starting with Israel. While speaking forcefully of Israel\'s need for security, you said that peace will require an end to attacks of all kinds and recognition of Israel\'s right to exist. Just to be clear, does that mean recognition of Israel\'s right to exist as a Jewish state? SANDERS: Of coursethat\'s the status quo. DAILY NEWS: Okay. You\'ve called not just for a halting construction of so-called settlements on the West Bank, but you\'ve also called for pulling back settlements, just as Israel did in Gaza. Describe the pullback that you have in mind. SANDERS: Well, that\'s the Israeli government\'s plan, but I think that right now...I\'m not going to run the Israeli government. I\'ve got enough problems trying to be a United States senator or maybe President of the United States. DAILY NEWS: No, but if you are President, you will, I assume, become deeply enmeshed in attempting the peace process. SANDERS: I assume that\'s something... DAILY NEWS: And where you start on the negotiations is important. SANDERS: Here\'s the main point that I want to make. I lived in Israel. I have family in Israel. I believe 100% not only in Israel\'s right to exist, a right to exist in peace and security without having to face terrorist attacks. But from the United States\' point of view, I think, long-term, we cannot ignore the reality that you have large numbers of Palestinians who are suffering now, poverty rate off the charts, unemployment off the charts, Gaza remaining a destroyed area. And I think that for long-term peace in that region, and God knows nobody has been successful in that for 60 years, but there are good people on both sides, and Israel is not, cannot, just simply expand when it wants to expand with new settlements. So I think the United States has got to help work with the Palestinian people as well. I think that is the path toward peace. DAILY NEWS: I was talking about something different, though. Expanding settlements is one thing; coming into office as a President who said as a baseline that you want Israel to pull back settlements, that changes the dynamic in the negotiations, and I\'m wondering how far and what you want Israel to do in terms of pulling back. SANDERS: Well, again, you\'re asking me a very fair question, and if I had some paper in front of me, I would give you a better answer. But I think if the expansion was illegal, moving into territory that was not their territory, I think withdrawal from those territories is appropriate. DAILY NEWS: And who makes the call about illegality, in your mind? SANDERS: Well, I think that\'s based on previous treaties and ideas. I happen to think that those expansions were illegal. DAILY NEWS: Okay, so if we were to find Israeli settlements, so-called settlements, in places that has been designated to be illegal, you would expect Israel to be pulling them back? SANDERS: Israel will make their own decisions. They are a government, an independent nation. But to the degree that they want us to have a positive relationship, I think they\'re going to have to improve their relationship with the Palestinians. DAILY NEWS: Okay, but I\'m just talking about, youd be getting involved in the negotiations, and this would be setting a benchmark for the negotiations that you would enter the talks, if you do, having conveyed to both parties, including the Palestinians, that there\'s a condition here that you want Israel to remove what you described as ""illegal settlements."" That\'s going to be the baseline. Now, if you\'re really... SANDERS: Well, theres going to be a lot of things on the baselines. There are going to be demands being made of the Palestinian folks as well. When you sit down and negotiate, obviously... DAILY NEWS: And what are those demands? SANDERS: Well, for a start, the absolute condemnation of all terrorist attacks. The idea that in Gaza there were buildings being used to construct missiles and bombs and tunnels, that is not where foreign aid should go. Foreign aid should go to housing and schools, not the development of bombs and missiles. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Now, you have obviously condemned Hamas for indiscriminate rocket attacks and the construction of the military tunnels. But you\'ve also criticized Israel for what you described as a disproportionate response. SANDERS: Yep. DAILY NEWS: And I\'m going to look at 2014, which was the latest conflict. What should Israel have done instead? SANDERS: You\'re asking me now to make not only decisions for the Israeli government but for the Israeli military, and I don\'t quite think I\'m qualified to make decisions. But I think it is fair to say that the level of attacks against civilian areas...and I do know that the Palestinians, some of them, were using civilian areas to launch missiles. Makes it very difficult. But I think most international observers would say that the attacks against Gaza were indiscriminate and that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed. Look, we are living, for better or worse, in a world of high technology, whether it\'s drones out there that could, you know, take your nose off, and Israel has that technology. And I think there is a general belief that, with that technology, they could have been more discriminate in terms of taking out weapons that were threatening them. DAILY NEWS: Do you support the Palestinian leadership\'s attempt to use the International Criminal Court to litigate some of these issues to establish that, in their view, Israel had committed essentially war crimes? SANDERS: No. DAILY NEWS: Why not? SANDERS: Why not? DAILY NEWS: Why not, why it... SANDERS: Look, why don\'t I support a million things in the world? I\'m just telling you that I happen to believe...anybody help me out here, because I don\'t remember the figures, but my recollection is over 10,000 innocent people were killed in Gaza. Does that sound right? DAILY NEWS: I think it\'s probably high, but we can look at that. SANDERS: I don\'t have it in my number...but I think it\'s over 10,000. My understanding is that a whole lot of apartment houses were leveled. Hospitals, I think, were bombed. So yeah, I do believe and I don\'t think I\'m alone in believing that Israel\'s force was more indiscriminate than it should have been. DAILY NEWS: Okay. We will check the facts. I don\'t want to venture a number that I\'m not sure on, but we will check those facts. Now, talk about Hamas. What is it? Is it a terrorist organization? SANDERS: Yes. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Hezbollah too? SANDERS: Yes. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Now switching more broadly to the Middle East and some of the other troubled areas, with ISIS. The Obama administration has been using this drone program, right? What are your thoughts on that, their use of... SANDERS: Well, first off, let me just talk about the Middle East. I talked about one of the differences that exists between Secretary Clinton and myself. I think we can argue reasonably that the most important and significant and far-reaching debate that we\'ve had on foreign policy in this country in recent years was on the war in Iraq. Not only did I vote against the war in Iraq, not only did I lead the opposition to the war, helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq, if you look at the statements that I made on the floor of the House in 2002, sadly to say, much of what I feared would happen actually has happened. Hillary Clinton\'s views were very different. She supported the war in Iraq. Now, in terms of ISIS, this is a barbaric organization that obviously has got to be destroyed. But it must and can be destroyed without the United States getting involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East, something that I fear very, very much. So my view is that, very similar to what King Abdullah of Jordan said, that essentially the war against ISIS is a war over the soul of Islam. And the war must be won by Muslim troops on the ground with the support of the United States and other major powers. That is what I believe. And I think President Obama, who has been criticized roundly by Republicans and others for being ""too soft,"" ""too weak,"" whatever. In fact, that strategy is, under very difficult circumstances, actually beginning to prove to be a success. ISIS has lost about 40% of the territory it controlled in Iraq. We\'ve seen the Iraqi army maybe, maybe God willing [knocks on wood], show some fighting spirit, being able to take back Ramadi. And so, we\'ve seen some success. DAILY NEWS: Okay, while we were sitting here, I double-checked the facts. It\'s the miracle of the iPhone. My recollection was correct. It was about 2,300, I believe, killed, and 10,000 wounded. President Obama has taken the authority for drone attacks away from the CIA and given it to the U.S. military. Some say that that has caused difficulties in zeroing in on terrorists, their ISIS leaders. Do you believe that he\'s got the right policy there? SANDERS: I don\'t know the answer to that. What I do know is that drones are a modern weapon. When used effectively, when taking out ISIS or terrorist leaders, that\'s pretty impressive. When bombing wedding parties of innocent people and killing dozens of them, that is, needless to say, not effective and enormously counterproductive. So whatever the mechanism, whoever is in control of that policy, it has to be refined so that we are killing the people we want to kill and not innocent collateral damage. DAILY NEWS: Okay. American Special Forces recently killed a top ISIS commander, after they\'d hoped to capture him. They felt, from what the news reports were, that they had no choice at that. What would you do with a captured ISIS commander? SANDERS: Imprison him. DAILY NEWS: Where? SANDERS: And try to get as much information out of him. If the question leads us to Guantanamo... DAILY NEWS: Well, no, separate and apart from Guantanamo, it could be there, it could be anywhere. Where would a President Sanders imprison, interrogate? What would you do? SANDERS: Actually I haven\'t thought about it a whole lot. I suppose, somewhere near the locale where that person was captured. The best location where that individual would be safely secured in a way that we can get information out of him. DAILY NEWS: Would it be in the United States? SANDERS: Would it be in the United States? It could be, yeah. DAILY NEWS: Yeah. I mean, some of these places are lawless lands. You\'ve got Libya, you\'ve got Yemen. If Special Forces... SANDERS: If the question is do I believe that terrorists could be safely imprisoned in the United States, the answer is yes. DAILY NEWS: Yeah. Okay. DAILY NEWS: I have just a couple New York, quick questions. Will there be a New York debate? SANDERS: Well, that\'s a good question. If I have anything to say about it, there would. It\'s hard for me to imagine that somebody who was a United States senator here for eight years would not be willing to debate issues of importance to New York and issues of importance to the United States of America. So the answer is, we have asked for that debate. I think the staffs are talking. My understanding is that the Clinton people are kind of dragging their feet. So the answer is I would love to see a debate, yes. DAILY NEWS: I know you\'ve got to go in a second. When was the last time you rode the subway? Are you gonna a campaign in the subway? SANDERS: Actually we rode the subway, Mike, when we were here? About a year ago? But I know how to ride the subways. Ive been on them once or twice. DAILY NEWS: Do you really? Do you really? How do you ride the subway today? SANDERS: What do you mean, ""How do you ride the subway?"" DAILY NEWS: How do you get on the subway today? SANDERS: You get a token and you get in. DAILY NEWS: Wrong. SANDERS: You jump over the turnstile. DAILY NEWS: We would like our photographer to be there when you jump over the turnstile. SANDERS: I\'m like anybody when I. DAILY NEWS: Returning to another New York issue. We\'re just a few blocks away from the World Trade Center. SANDERS: Yup. DAILY NEWS: Down in Guantanamo, there\'s Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect. I believe you\'re against the death penalty. Are you against the death penalty for him? SANDERS: Yup. DAILY NEWS: You are. Why is that? SANDERS: Because I think the death penalty does not prove to be effective in stopping the crimes that we want to see stopping. And second of all, at a time when virtually every major country on Earth has eliminated the death penalty, for right reasons. In a world of as much violence as currently exists, I don\'t believe government, our government, should be involved in killing. DAILY NEWS: But you place Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, if you do, I\'m asking, in the same moral basket as the street criminals under that... SANDERS: No. I place him as a murderous disgusting terrorist, and we have seen in this country terrible crimes have been...I don\'t need to explain to anybody in this room people coming out with automatic weapons and killing children in Sandy Hook. Disgusting crimes. I happen to believe that, in the long run, from a moral perspective, and from an effectiveness perspective, the death penalty does not work. DAILY NEWS: But you would have no hesitation about killing him if a drone found him on a battlefield? SANDERS: Well, unfortunately we live in a...that\'s right. There is a difference. If I have you captured and I kill you, it\'s different than killing you on the battlefield. I think that is a very different moral...but if you\'re asking me am a pacifist, don\'t believe in killing people in war, that\'s not my position. DAILY NEWS: So speaking of New York and issues important to New York and speaking of death. Last year, after the Oregon Community College shootings, you promised a comprehensive gun control agenda. When are we going to see that and what can you tell us... SANDERS: Well, I\'ve talked about it, you have seen it. What the agenda is is very similar to where to where President Obama is. President Obama said at that Oregon speech with a great deal of emotion. That he thought this was an issue that\'s never going to be permanently solved. Nobody can guarantee that some lunatic is not going to pick up a gun today and kill people. But we have to do the best that we can to prevent those type of killings. And what we do, in my view, is significantly strengthen and expand the instant background check. What we do is do away with the gun show loophole, where people now are buying guns from unlicensed dealers. What we do is do away with the straw man provision, where you can buy a gun legally and then sell it to somebody who\'s a criminal. I think what we also is significantly expand mental health capabilities to try to address the fact that we have thousands of people walking in this country today who are suicidal and homicidal. So I support pretty much the President\'s agenda. DAILY NEWS: Just to be clear, the press release your campaign put out the day of that announcement of the forthcoming comprehensive plan, you made that announcement, those were the four points you made then. Have you moved any further beyond that? SANDERS: Well, I don\'t know that anyone has moved...I think that\'s the President\'s vision, that\'s my position. DAILY NEWS: There\'s a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded? SANDERS: Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question? DAILY NEWS: Correct. SANDERS: No, I don\'t. DAILY NEWS: Let me ask you. I know we\'re short on time. Two quick questions. Your website talks about... SANDERS: No, let me just...I\'m sorry. In the same sense that if you\'re a gun dealer and you sell me a gun and I go out and I kill him [gestures to someone in room]. Do I think that that gun dealer should be sued for selling me a legal product that he misused? [Shakes head no.] But I do believe that gun manufacturers and gun dealers should be able to be sued when they should know that guns are going into the hands of wrong people. So if somebody walks in and says, ""I\'d like 10,000 rounds of ammunition,"" you know, well, you might be suspicious about that. So I think there are grounds for those suits, but not if you sell me a legal product. But you\'re really saying... DAILY NEWS: Do you think that the discussion and debate about what defines a legal product, what should be a legal product, hence AR-15s, these automatic military-style weapons...which is the grounds of this suit at the moment is that this should have never been in the hands of the public. SANDERS: Well, you\'re looking at a guy...let\'s talk about guns for one second. Lets set the record straight because ofunnamed candidates who have misrepresented my views. You\'re looking at a guy who has a D, what was it, D minus voting record from the NRA? Not exactly a lobbyist for the NRA, not exactly supporting them. But it\'s interesting that you raised that question. If you\'ll remember this, if you were in Vermont in 1988 [gestures to Vermonter in the room], three people were running for the United States Congress. We have one seat, Vermont. Two of them supported assault weapons. One candidate, Bernie Sanders, said, in 1988, ""No, I do not support the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country."" I lost that election by three points. Came in second. And that may have been the reason, that I was opposed by all of the gun people, okay? So to answer your question, I do not believe, I didn\'t believe then and I don\'t believe now that those guns should be sold in America. They\'re designed for killing people. DAILY NEWS: So do you think then, with that in mind, that the merits of the current case are baseless? SANDERS: It\'s not baseless. I wouldn\'t use that word. But it\'s a backdoor way. If you\'re questioning me, will I vote to ban assault weapons in the United States, yeah, I will. DAILY NEWS: Two quick questions. One is your website talks about physical violence perpetrated by the state against African Americans. SANDERS: Yeah. DAILY NEWS: It also says, ""We need new rules on the allowable use of force."" Such as? SANDERS: Such as do what many other countries are doing. Look, you\'ve got somebody who\'s clearly mentally ill outside, right? Ranting and raving, and maybe they have a knife in their hands. Are there ways to deal with that issue other than shooting that person? We have seen instances in my own state, all over this country, where the way that was dealt with by killing that person. There are ways to deal with that. So I think what I am suggesting here very forcefully is that we have got to train police offices to use lethal force as a last resort, not a first resort. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Last question. If you are elected, alums of James Madison High School will be atop all three branches of the United States government, Congress, the Senate, the presidency, and the Supreme Court. SANDERS: Well, not quite the Supreme... DAILY NEWS: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. SANDERS: Well, she is there, but she\'s not...she\'s like a...yeah. DAILY NEWS: Yeah, no. So what happened? What has happened to education in America that James Madison High School is not that type of production line anymore? SANDERS: That\'s a good question. And with all due respect, you went to Midwood... DAILY NEWS: No, I live in Midwood. SANDERS: Oh, you live in... DAILY NEWS: Yeah. SANDERS: All right, all right. Midwood was a pretty good school as well. DAILY NEWS: My daughter is in Bronx Science. SANDERS: Okay. First off, we still have some great schools. Let\'s not dismiss that. On the other hand, we have schools that everybody knows are drop-out factories, that are terrible. The answer to the question, I think, has to do with devaluing the role of education in our society. I was in Wisconsin just the other day, talking to teachers, and they said, if you can believe this, that young people do not want to become teachers anymore. Because especially in that state, teachers in public education have been so vilified. Can you imagine bright young people not wanting to do the enormously important job of teaching? So we\'ve got to change that culture. Teaching, education, is of the highest importance in this country. Teachers deserve to be well-paid, well-respected. When I grew up in that community, this was a community of immigrants, largely immigrants who understood the power of education. We had great teachers and we had great schools. I think we can do that again. DAILY NEWS: Okay. Thank you very much. SANDERS: Thank you'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 15, 2016",b'Remarks at a Conference Hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences in Vatican City',"b'I am honored to be with you today and was pleased to receive your invitation to speak to this conference of The Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. Today we celebrate the encyclical Centesimus Annus and reflect on its meaning for our world a quarter-century after it was presented by Pope John Paul II. With the fall of Communism, Pope John Paul II gave a clarion call for human freedom in its truest sense: freedom that defends the dignity of every person and that is always oriented towards the common good.The Church\'s social teachings, stretching back to the first modern encyclical about the industrial economy, Rerum Novarum in 1891, to Centesimus Annus, to Pope Francis\'s inspiring encyclical Laudato Si\' this past year, have grappled with the challenges of the market economy. There are few places in modern thought that rival the depth and insight of the Church\'s moral teachings on the market economy.Over a century ago, Pope Leo XIII highlighted economic issues and challenges in Rerum Novarum that continue to haunt us today, such as what he called ""the enormous wealth of a few as opposed to the poverty of the many.""And let us be clear. That situation is worse today. In the year 2016, the top one percent of the people on this planet own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent, while the wealthiest 60 people  60 people  own more than the bottom half  3 1/2 billion people. At a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable.The words of Centesimus Annus likewise resonate with us today. One striking example: Furthermore, society and the State must ensure wage levels adequate for the maintenance of the worker and his family, including a certain amount for savings. This requires a continuous effort to improve workers\' training and capability so that their work will be more skilled and productive, as well as careful controls and adequate legislative measures to block shameful forms of exploitation, especially to the disadvantage of the most vulnerable workers, of immigrants and of those on the margins of society. The role of trade unions in negotiating minimum salaries and working conditions is decisive in this area. (Para15) The essential wisdom of Centesimus Annus is this: A market economy is beneficial for productivity and economic freedom. But if we let the quest for profits dominate society; if workers become disposable cogs of the financial system; if vast inequalities of power and wealth lead to marginalization of the poor and the powerless; then the common good is squandered and the market economy fails us. Pope John Paul II puts it this way: profit that is the result of ""illicit exploitation, speculation, or the breaking of solidarity among working people . . . has not justification, and represents an abuse in the sight of God and man."" (Para43).We are now twenty-five years after the fall of Communist rule in Eastern Europe. Yet we have to acknowledge that Pope John Paul\'s warnings about the excesses of untrammeled finance were deeply prescient. Twenty-five years after Centesimus Annus, speculation, illicit financial flows, environmental destruction, and the weakening of the rights of workers is far more severe than it was a quarter century ago. Financial excesses, indeed widespread financial criminality on Wall Street, played a direct role in causing the world\'s worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.We need a political analysis as well as a moral and anthropological analysis to understand what has happened since 1991. We can say that with unregulated globalization, a world market economy built on speculative finance burst through the legal, political, and moral constraints that had once served to protect the common good. In my country, home of the world\'s largest financial markets, globalization was used as a pretext to deregulate the banks, ending decades of legal protections for working people and small businesses. Politicians joined hands with the leading bankers to allow the banks to become ""too big to fail."" The result: eight years ago the American economy and much of the world was plunged into the worst economic decline since the 1930s. Working people lost their jobs, their homes and their savings, while the government bailed out the banks.Inexplicably, the United States political system doubled down on this reckless financial deregulation, when the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of deeply misguided decisions, unleashed an unprecedented flow of money into American politics. These decisions culminated in the infamous Citizen United case, which opened the financial spigots for huge campaign donations by billionaires and large corporations to turn the U.S. political system to their narrow and greedy advantage. It has established a system in which billionaires can buy elections. Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, we have been left with an economy operated for the top 1 percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind. And the billionaires and banks have reaped the returns of their campaign investments, in the form of special tax privileges, imbalanced trade agreements that favor investors over workers, and that even give multinational companies extra-judicial power over governments that are trying to regulate them.But as both Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis have warned us and the world, the consequences have been even direr than the disastrous effects of financial bubbles and falling living standards of working-class families. Our very soul as a nation has suffered as the public lost faith in political and social institutions. As Pope Francis has stated: ""Man is not in charge today, money is in charge, money rules."" And the Pope has also stated: ""We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.""And further: ""While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results from ideologies which uphold the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control to States, which are themselves charged with providing for the common good.""Pope Francis has called on the world to say: ""No to a financial system that rules rather than serves"" in Evangeli Gaudium. And he called upon financial executives and political leaders to pursue financial reform that is informed by ethical considerations. He stated plainly and powerfully that the role of wealth and resources in a moral economy must be that of servant, not master.The widening gaps between the rich and poor, the desperation of the marginalized, the power of corporations over politics, is not a phenomenon of the United States alone. The excesses of the unregulated global economy have caused even more damage in the developing countries. They suffer not only from the boom-bust cycles on Wall Street, but from a world economy that puts profits over pollution, oil companies over climate safety, and arms trade over peace. And as an increasing share of new wealth and income goes to a small fraction of those at the top, fixing this gross inequality has become a central challenge. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great economic issue of our time, the great political issue of our time, and the great moral issue of our time. It is an issue that we must confront in my nation and across the world.Pope Francis has given the most powerful name to the predicament of modern society: the Globalization of Indifference. ""Almost without being aware of it,"" he noted, ""we end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people\'s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else\'s responsibility and not our own."" We have seen on Wall Street that financial fraud became not only the norm but in many ways the new business model. Top bankers have shown no shame for their bad behavior and have made no apologies to the public. The billions and billions of dollars of fines they have paid for financial fraud are just another cost of doing business, another short cut to unjust profits.Some might feel that it is hopeless to fight the economic juggernaut, that once the market economy escaped the boundaries of morality it would be impossible to bring the economy back under the dictates of morality and the common good. I am told time and time again by the rich and powerful, and the mainstream media that represent them, that we should be ""practical,"" that we should accept the status quo; that a truly moral economy is beyond our reach. Yet Pope Francis himself is surely the world\'s greatest demonstration against such a surrender to despair and cynicism. He has opened the eyes of the world once again to the claims of mercy, justice and the possibilities of a better world. He is inspiring the world to find a new global consensus for our common home.I see that hope and sense of possibility every day among America\'s young people. Our youth are no longer satisfied with corrupt and broken politics and an economy of stark inequality and injustice. They are not satisfied with the destruction of our environment by a fossil fuel industry whose greed has put short term profits ahead of climate change and the future of our planet. They want to live in harmony with nature, not destroy it. They are calling out for a return to fairness; for an economy that defends the common good by ensuring that every person, rich or poor, has access to quality health care, nutrition and education.As Pope Francis made powerfully clear last year in Laudato Si\', we have the technology and know-how to solve our problems  from poverty to climate change to health care to protection of biodiversity. We also have the vast wealth to do so, especially if the rich pay their way in fair taxes rather than hiding their funds in the world\'s tax and secrecy havens- as the Panama Papers have shown.The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial, because as a world we are rich enough to increase our investments in skills, infrastructure, and technological know-how to meet our needs and to protect the planet. Our challenge is mostly a moral one, to redirect our efforts and vision to the common good. Centesimus Annus, which we celebrate and reflect on today, and Laudato Si\', are powerful, eloquent and hopeful messages of this possibility. It is up to us to learn from them, and to move boldly toward the common good in our time.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 17, 2016","b'Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News\' ""Face the Nation""'","b'DICKERSON: Turning now to the race for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton spent most of her weekend in California. Our Battleground Tracker has her up there by 12 points over Bernie Sanders 52 to 40 percent. And in her adopted home state of New York, she holds on to her 10-point lead; 53 percent of Democratic primary voters say they will support her and 43 percent are going for Bernie Sanders. As for Bernie Sanders\' weekend, he is back from his trip to the Vatican, where he met briefly with Pope Francis.And he joins you us now from New York. Welcome, Senator. What has happened to the Democratic race there? ""The New York Times"" described you having a ferocious performance in the debate this week. SANDERS: Ferocious, I\'m not quite sure what that word means. I think what has happened is that I have become a little bit tired of being beaten up by the negativity of the Clinton campaign. And we\'re responding in kind. Look, the differences that we have in how we raise money, she has super PACs and raises whole lot of money from Wall Street and other powerful special interests.She is $12 minimum wage. That\'s not good enough. I am for $15-an-hour minimum wage. Her views on foreign policy, whether it\'s the war in Iraq, Libya, Syria, are very different than mine. Our views on fracking, whether or not we will have clean water in the United States of America and around the world, are very different than mine. So, I think what we are doing, at least I am doing, is making it\'s very clear that my views are out there, representing the needs of working families, the middle class. And I am prepared to take on powerful special interests. I don\'t...[crosstalk]DICKERSON: What negativity has got you so irritated from Hillary Clinton? SANDERS: Oh, you name it. She came into -- after we had won eight out of nine caucuses and primaries, I think they made it very clear that what their goal was -- and I think I quote appropriately here -- disqualify, defeat and then reunite the party later on. They have gone after us in every single area in a way that just misrepresents my views, the idea that they have said in the past that I attack Planned Parenthood, when I regard Planned Parenthood, for example, as one of the great organizations in this country. I want to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. But on and on it goes. But I think what you are seeing now is the real differences of opinion between Secretary Clinton and myself. And probably most significantly is we raised seven million individual campaign contributions, more than any candidate in American history at this point, averaging $27. She is out there raising money from the wealthy and the powerful, and I think you can judge a candidate based on how you raise money and who you ultimately become dependent upon. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about that. In the debate, you were asked to name an example where the money she raised from Wall Street had influenced her, and you didn\'t offer an example. She said that proved the attack was phony. SANDERS: Well, first of all, I did offer an example. But, second of all, let me offer another one now. She voted for a bad bankruptcy piece of legislation which benefited Wall Street, at the expense of the hard-pressed consumers in this country. That\'s an example. But you never can say, John, just because you vote for something, that that was caused by something else.[crosstalk]DICKERSON: But isn\'t that the implication of what you\'re offering in the critique of her? Isn\'t that kind of what you\'re saying? SANDERS: No. No.The broader critique is, after Wall Street\'s greed and illegal behavior destroyed our economy and drove us into a major recession, in my view, the proper response, and the response of many economists and many Americans, is, look, these people are running a fraudulent operation.We can\'t trust them. They have too much wealth, they have too much power, too much concentration of ownership. The proper response, my view then, my view today, is break them up. That is not Hillary Clinton\'s response. That is the best example, but bankruptcy legislation is another piece of legislation where she was on the wrong side of the issue. DICKERSON: You have also tied her -- the money she takes to her position on the minimum wage with a tough ad in which you mentioned the $200,000 speech fees that she gets and then that she doesn\'t support the $15 national minimum wage. Aren\'t you kind of fuzzing up what is an economic policy dispute you have with her and making it seem like she\'s just being stingy? SANDERS: No, it\'s not a question of being stingy. It is, look, if you can go before Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley end up after an hour\'s work or 20 minutes\' work with a $250,000 check, and that is your life, and then refuse to support the fight for $15, the need to have a $15-an-hour national minimum wage, I think you are living in world far removed from where working people are. The truth is the minimum wage today is a starvation wage; $12 an hour for you is not enough. The American people in state after state now are moving to 15 bucks an hour. She\'s behind the curve. DICKERSON: But you are suggesting, Senator...SANDERS: And all I\'m saying is, maybe if you make $225 in an hour, you maybe don\'t know what it\'s like to live on 10 bucks minimum wage, 10 bucks an hour. DICKERSON: On the crime bill, there has been a lot of discussed of the -- discussion of the 1994 crime bill, which you voted for, which she supported. Do you regret your support for that crime bill now, in retrospect? SANDERS: Look, that bill -- whenever you have a piece of legislation that has -- it\'s a big bill and lot of stuff in it, it has the Violence Against Women Act, and I -- during my tenure as mayor of Burlington worked very hard against domestic violence and had the ban on assault weapons, something that I believe in fervently -- I believed back in 1988 when I ran for office, believed it on that vote.But there is no debate that that legislation has resulted in massive incarceration, that we today have more people in jail than any other country, that we have a broken criminal justice system. And I am leading the effort now to make certain that we have very strong reforms of the criminal justice system right now. People are in jail who should not be in jail. We have to prevent people from going into jail. We need a parole system. We need to end the so-called war on drugs, which has resulted in a disproportionate number of African-Americans being arrested. There\'s an enormous amount of work that has to be done now to address the crisis in criminal justice. DICKERSON: Now a quick political question here at the end. Donald Trump says the Democratic nomination is stacked against you because of the superdelegates. Do you agree? SANDERS: Well, it\'s not only that.I will tell you, the answer is, yes, that we -- Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the establishment. And she has many, many times more superdelegates than we have. But I will tell you something that also is of concern to me. We\'re going to go -- we\'re going into Tuesday here. We\'re fighting hard. I think we have real shot to win on Tuesday if there is a large voter turnout. But even here in New York state, you have a voting system which makes it impossible for independents to participate in the Democratic primary, that makes it impossible for people to register on the day of the election, which many states do, which is going to result in a lower voter turnout than I would like to see. But at the end of the day, because we are defeating Trump by much larger numbers than is Secretary Clinton, in poll after poll, national polls and in state polls, I think lot of these superdelegates are going to conclude that Bernie Sanders is the candidate to prevent what must not be allowed to happen. And that is Donald Trump becoming president of the United States. DICKERSON: All right, Bernie Sanders, thanks so much for being with us. SANDERS: Thank you.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 17, 2016","b'Interview with Dana Bash of CNN\'s ""State of the Union""'","b'BASH: Clooney\'s next-door neighbor, a Sanders supporter, hosted a dueling fund-raiser for him with tickets priced at $27. Joining me now is Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. And, Senator Sanders, you heard Clooney there. He almost sounds like he\'s feeling the Bern. [laughter]SANDERS: Well, I have a lot of respect for George Clooney\'s honesty and integrity on this issue. He is right. One of the great tragedies of American life today is the degree to which big money is buying elections, in which elected officials become responsive to the needs of Wall Street and wealthy campaign contributors, rather than the needs of ordinary people. And, Dana, I\'m so proud that, in this campaign, we have now raised almost seven million individual contributions averaging $27 apiece. That is unprecedented in American history. BASH: But you realize, Senator, that he just raised millions of dollars for your opponent. So, is he backing the wrong horse here? SANDERS: Well, I think he is. But he is honest enough to say that there is something wrong when few people, in this case wealthy individuals, but in other instances for the secretary, it is Wall Street and powerful special interests, who are able to contribute unbelievably large sums of money. That\'s not what democracy is about. That is a movement toward oligarchy. And that is why we have got to overturn Citizens United and why I have run this campaign on the basis of saying we\'re going to make it on contributions averaging 27 bucks apiece, rather than being dependent on big money. But this is the issue of American politics today. Do we have a government that represents all of us or just the 1 percent? And you\'re not going to have a government that represents all of us so long as you have candidates like Secretary Clinton being dependent on big-money interests. BASH: Senator, you just visited the Vatican, where you had a meeting with the pope. Vice President Joe Biden was asked about your trip. I want you to listen to what he said. [begin video clip]VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: I just think that Bernie making a trip is a good thing. But to suggest that the pope would -- embraces Bernie\'s policies, I don\'t think that\'s the case. I don\'t know. I doubt it. [end video clip]BASH: Senator, what\'s your response to that? SANDERS: Well, you know, I love Joe, and no one is suggesting that the pope is embracing my policies. What I will tell you is, I was very proud to have been invited by the Vatican to an important conference dealing with morality in economics. And, in my view, that is exactly the issue of the day. We have got to create an economics which is based on morality, dealing with the needs of working families and the elderly and the children and the sick and the poor, rather than an economy which is based on greed and the needs of Wall Street and big corporations. And the fact that I was invited there was very -- for me, a very moving experience. And that\'s the fight that we are going to continue to wage. We have levels of income and wealth inequality in this country. The rich are getting richer. Almost everybody else is getting poorer. We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. We need to create millions of decent-paying jobs. And I have been so impressed ever since Pope Francis came into power of his willingness to take on special interests, to talk about climate change, and the need to transform our energy system. So, you know, I have probably been one of the members of Congress talking more often about the extraordinary role that Pope Francis is playing in raising issues that so rarely get discussed. BASH: Senator, let\'s return to what you were talking about before, money in politics. At this week\'s debate in Brooklyn, I asked you to name one decision Hillary Clinton made as senator that shows she was influenced by the donations she got. You really didn\'t answer the question. So, let\'s try it again. Can you point to a decision that Hillary Clinton made as senator that shows she favored banks because of the donations she received? SANDERS: Well, as a matter of fact, she voted for a bad bankruptcy legislation. But -- and whether that is a result of contributions from Wall Street or elsewhere, you know, no one can say that, Dana. But what I would also repeat to you is, the most important issue is, what is your stand on Wall Street? And I think, to me, when you have it being very clear that Wall Street\'s greed and illegal behavior -- you know, Goldman Sachs just paid a $5 billion settlement with the government. When you have that kind of greed and illegal behavior, bringing our economy into the worst economic recession since the \'30s, I think the immediate response must be to break up these large financial institutions. BASH: Now...SANDERS: That is my view. That is the view of a number of leading economists. That is not Hillary Clinton\'s position. BASH: Now, also at the debate, you were asked about Sandy Hook families who want to sue gun manufacturers. You said -- quote -- ""They have the right to sue.""But just last week, you told ""The Daily News"" the opposite. Listen. [begin audio clip] SANDERS: Do I think the -- the right...QUESTION: Yes. SANDERS: ... of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer. That\'s your question?QUESTION: Correct. SANDERS: No, I don\'t. [end audio clip] BASH: So, Senator, what changed? SANDERS: Well, what changed is, I think -- I think, if you go into that interview a little bit longer, you will see the nuance of that interview. Of course they have the right to sue. Anybody has the right to sue. And they just won an initial decision in their favor last week. But if you go into that discussion a little bit longer, do I end up believing that, if a gun store owner, a small gun store owner in rural Vermont or anyplace else, sells you a weapon legally, you come in with all the proper identification, you pass the instant background check, you legally purchase the gun, and you go out and you shoot somebody, that that small gun store owner should be held liable?No, I don\'t. I really don\'t. But I have got to tell you also, on this issue of these assault weapons, let\'s be clear. Back in 1988, in Vermont, I likely lost an election because I alone stood up to the gun people and said, no, I don\'t think that assault weapons should be sold and distributed in America. That was my view then. That\'s the type of weapon that caused that horrific tragedy in Sandy Hook. Those weapons should not be made available in the United States of America. So, in that sense, I agree with the Sandy Hook parents. But it\'s a question of how you go forward. BASH: Let\'s talk about something in the news that will be on your plate as a sitting U.S. senator. Saudi Arabia has told the Obama administration that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars of American assets if Congress allows the Saudi government to held -- to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the 9/11 attacks. How do you intend to vote as a senator?SANDERS: Well, I need more information before I can give you a decision. But, clearly, I have, as you have heard me say, a whole lot of concerns about the role that Saudi Arabia has been playing for many, many years, not just the individuals who came from Saudi Arabia who attacked us on 9/11, but their support for ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The Saudi family is a huge family, many hundreds, if not thousands of people in the ruling family worth many hundreds of billions of dollars. BASH: But if I may, Senator, in general, should Saudi Arabia be -- should it be possible to hold them liable in U.S. courts? SANDERS: Well, you\'re going to hear -- you\'re asking me to give you a decision about a situation and a piece of legislation that I am not familiar with at this point. And I have got to have more information on that. So, you have got to get some information before you can render, I think, a sensible decision. But I do have a lot of concerns about the role, in general, that Saudi Arabia has played and the royal family has played in supporting Wahhabism, which is the extreme right-wing Islamic movement, which is part of what ISIS and al Qaeda are about. BASH: And, finally, Senator, on Friday, you released last year\'s tax returns. Secretary Clinton has posted her tax returns from the past eight years. So, will you do the same? SANDERS: We will post more of them. Yes, we will. I mean, I don\'t have -- to be honest with you, our tax returns showed us that we made more money -- we made less money in a given year than Secretary Clinton made in one speech. We don\'t have a bunch of -- Jane and I don\'t have a bunch of accountants working for us. We will get it out. I think we have all that information, and we will get them out as soon as we can, which... BASH: By when, sir? SANDERS: ... which will be very soon. We got out one. We will get out more. BASH: Like this week? SANDERS: Probably. BASH: OK. Senator, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. Good to talk to you. SANDERS: Thank you, Dana.'"

Now, one of the disadvantages we have, as you know, is under New York state law, independents cannot participate in the Democratic primary. We usually win the independent vote 2-1. So, we\'re kind of spotting Secretary Clinton a whole lot in that regard.But if the voter turnout is high, if working people come out to vote, if young people come out to vote, we can win this thing.CUOMO: You\'re just back from the Vatican?SANDERS: Yeah.CUOMO: You hit the ground running, you go to Brooklyn, you talk for about 30 minutes. High energy. Where does the energy come from? What is motivating you through this schedule?Because it\'s killing us. So, where is the energy coming from?SANDERS: It\'s coming from a belief that in this day and age, it is absolutely imperative that we change course in America, that we get people involved in the political process, that we stand up to the one percent, that we create an economy that works for all our people.Chris, I worry so much about the major crises facing our country. I worry about climate change, and what happens to our kids and grandchildren if we don\'t transform our energy system, worrying about kids leaving college, $50, $70,000 in debt. I\'m worried about this country moving toward an oligarchic form of society.We have a handful of billionaires raising huge sums of money to elect candidates who are there for the rich and the powerful, and ignore the needs of working families and the poor. That is what motivates me.CUOMO: The problem, painfully obvious to many. What is hard is figuring out how to solve it.One of the things that you\'ve been dealing with in this campaign, the criticism of, well, what are you going to do? That has two prongs where you\'re involved.One is, you\'ve been in Congress a long time.SANDERS: Yes.CUOMO: You\'ve been saying these things for a long time.SANDERS: Yes.CUOMO: You haven\'t been able to achieve what you\'re saying you\'ll be able to achieve now.Fair criticism?SANDERS: Not really. I mean, when you\'re a member of Congress, you have a certain role to play, and I\'m very proud of my role. And I\'ll compare it to Secretary Clinton\'s any day. She was in the Senate for eight years. We passed a major bill to improve veterans\' health care, major provision of the Affordable Care Act is something I offered $11 billion for community health centers, major piece of environmental legislation.I\'m pretty proud of my record. The president is in a different position. And the question of how you pay for it, Chris, has got to be put in the context. But over the last 30 yes, there has been trillions of dollars transferred from working families to the top one-tenth of one percent.This is not a poor country. This is the richest country in the history of the world. And there\'s no reason why we should have people living in abysmal poverty.CUOMO: But the problem becomes, well, then how do you fix it? It\'s not a new problem.You point out, hey, free college would help it, that\'s what I want to do. But you need to have a plan to make that work.SANDERS: Sure. There\'s a plan.CUOMO: A lot of economists attack your plan and say you\'ve burst the deficit to levels that they\'ve never seen before.SANDERS: No. No, that\'s just not accurate. I mean, you know, look, when you come up with ideas that run counter to what the one percent want, all of their economists are going to tell us how crazy I am.In terms of making public colleges and universities -- not all colleges -- public colleges and universities tuition free, we impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. Not a radical idea. It is done elsewhere.It will raise more than enough money to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, huge problem.We end the loophole that now exists so that major corporations can stash their money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, and in a given year, pay not a nickel in federal taxes.CUOMO: The -- I don\'t know, I\'m sure you\'ve been too busy. But you are a frequent either guest or subject on Saturday Night Live.You had Larry David on there, on Saturday Night Live, and they were singling out what\'s -- let\'s just call, the ""yada, yada, yada"" problem. They used the ""Seinfeld"" skit to talk about how you\'ll be able to get these things done.You know, how are you going to break up the big banks? Well, I\'ll sit them down, yada, yada, yada, I\'ll break them up.How a big a problem do you think it is that people don\'t think, that group of voters that you want who don\'t think Bernie can\'t get it done. I know he believes it, it sounds great -- but he can\'t break up those banks, he can\'t get free college, it\'s too hard or he can\'t pay for it?SANDERS: Well, let me respond in this way. If you and I were sitting here and five years ago, not a long time. And I say, ""Chris, you know, I think the $7.25 federal minimum wage is a starvation rage. We have got to raise it to 15 bucks an hour.""CUOMO: I was talking to you five years ago. You were saying that. [laughter]SANDERS: But most people would have thought that that was a crazy idea. Right? Fair enough? You wanted double the minimum wage.Well, guess what, California, New York, Los Angeles, Oregon have done it. Why? Because people stood up and fought for a $15 an hour wage and appealed to the conscience of the American people.Second point, gay marriage. You are -- now, I would hear ten years ago, would you have believed honestly that gay marriage would be legal now in 15 states in this country? Probably not. I would not have.But what happens when people stand up and say, we have got to end bigotry in America. People have a right to love whomever -- change takes place when people stand up and fight for change.That is the kernel, the heart of what this campaign is about. And I believe everything that we\'re talking about. Nothing is radical. These ideas exist in other countries; they have existed in the United States. When you were a kid, how much did it cost to go to city university?It was virtually...CUOMO: Under $1,000.SANDERS: There you go. Virtually tuition free. Why, if we could do it 30, 40, 50 years ago, can\'t we do it in America today? We can.But what -- the truth is, is that the people on top have enormous economic and political power. I\'m trying to change that dynamic.CUOMO: Bill Clinton on the hustings said, you know, look, I love that these young people are out there, they\'re being energized by Bernie Sanders. That\'s great.Basically his message to them is, if you kill one out of every three people who work on Wall Street, everything will be fine. You can -- look, that\'s politics. It\'s ugly, it\'s out on the hustings. That\'s no surprise.But you know you have a problem with that group of people. I mean, you target the banks all the time as the seed of what\'s wrong with the capitalist system. They would say they are the capitalist system.What do you say to the entrepreneurs, to the young business people? Why would they vote for Bernie Sanders?SANDERS: Because you can run a business in a way that is profitable -- that\'s what businesses try to do -- treat your workers with respect and protect the environment.There are thousands of businesses who are into social responsibility. Yeah, they want to make money. But they\'re not going to shut down today and move to China. They\'re not going to destroy the environment in order to do that.What we need -- and this is where we can learn something from the pope. That\'s what Pope Francis is talking about, he\'s morality, creating a world economy based on morality, not just on greed. I agree with him.CUOMO: But -- right. But when you use the pope as an analogy, the pope is not a politician, OK? He is shamelessly socialist in terms of his finding (ph). He is actually way beyond that.You know, his signature expression of [in Spanish], ""make a mess,"" he wants to go out and challenge capitalism to be different and better. OK, that\'s the pope.SANDERS: Right.CUOMO: A president is not a pope any way you want to look at it. And that is what gives America all of its resources, all of its unique capabilities, all of its unique success, is that engine that you\'re now saying is broken -- and I get the disparity argument.You would have to be blind not to see it. But do you wind up attacking what makes America great as part of an ability to make it better?SANDERS: I do not think that America is great when the leadership of major financial institutions engage in widespread fraud.So, if your question -- I think what your question is, how are we going to create wealth without Wall Street? That\'s your question.CUOMO: Right.SANDERS: I think we can. And I think you can break up these large financial institutions...CUOMO: How?SANDERS: Well, you can do it through section 121 of Dodd-Frank. You go through my legislation. All you need is the secretary of Treasury to determine which banks, if they fail, will cause systemic damage to our economy.That is not a hard to do.CUOMO: It exists now, though.SANDERS: That\'s right. The law exists now.CUOMO: So, why are we different?SANDERS: I will use it. Just because we can do it doesn\'t mean we are doing it.CUOMO: But they have the stress tests and the ongoing analysis now.SANDERS: And what happened recently? They failed -- five of the major banks failed their stress tests. Failed...CUOMO: Right.SANDERS: Yeah. So, what I\'m saying is, I think when so few financial institutions have so much economic and political power, when their history in recent years has shown them that they\'re into fraud and illegal behavior, I do not think it is a good thing for the future of this country that they maintain the kind of size that currently have.CUOMO: Guns.SANDERS: Guns.CUOMO: Your early rationale on why certain sellers shouldn\'t be sued was, these are mom and pop shops. Don\'t go after a mom and pop shop for the fact that we don\'t like how guns are used in the hands of wrong people.That\'s not what Newtown\'s lawsuit is about. Newtown is about going after the major manufacturers, not the mom and pops, and doing it for their marketing, that they promote the use of these things in video games and otherwise.Why did you give such a quick no on that about whether or not they should be sued on that basis?SANDERS: Well, this is -- this is -- this is what I think.First of all, please understand that we, back in 1988, I ran a campaign for the United States Congress, the only candidate taking on the gun people to say, we should ban these assault weapons which are designed only to kill people.That was my view then. That is my view now. I want to see that put away.What I believe right now is, yes, you\'re right about mom and pop stores. I sell you a gun legally, you go out and kill somebody. Should I be held responsible?CUOMO: Right.SANDERS: But this is what also believe. Is that if you walk into my shop and you want 10,000 rounds of ammunition -- oh, here it is, Chris, 10,000 rounds. That\'s pretty crazy. I should be held responsible.If I am a gun manufacturer, selling guns into areas where I know they\'re ending up into the hands of criminals, I should be held liable for that as well, [inaudible].CUOMO: But the Newtown suit is, you put them into video games, you market them to the young, you tell people they\'re tools of empowerment, that they make you cool, they make you mighty.SANDERS: It\'s an ugly thing.CUOMO: And they want to sue. I\'m not saying they would win the suit.SANDERS: Right.CUOMO: But do you think they should be able to sue?SANDERS: Obviously, they should and they are suing, and they want to...CUOMO: Well, you said no.SANDERS: Well, within a broader context. Do I think somebody should be held liable, is what I said, for selling a legal product? Should somebody have the right to sue and make their case? Of course they should.CUOMO: So, the Newtown families should be allowed to sue the manufacturers on the basis of marketing?SANDERS: They are doing that, they are doing that.CUOMO: And the judge said yes.SANDERS: Right.CUOMO: But many people said you were on the wrong side of that issue.SANDERS: Well, if what I said in my own personal view, if I sell you a legal product, do I -- am I liable for the crazy thing that you do with it? I think not.CUOMO: I help -- I\'m trying to get you to clarify it, because it has been -- [inaudible] so much.SANDERS: All right. But should somebody have the right to sue? Anybody can sue for any reason. We\'ll see how the courts react to that suit.CUOMO: All right. Another issue that\'s going on right now, the G.I. bill. OK?SANDERS: Yeah.CUOMO: What\'s happening in Congress? They have a no roll call vote. Sneaky. Dirty pool already. They get through this bill that says the following: there is money that -- you know what the bill is. Just for you at home. There\'s money that they\'re taking that people from the military used to use for their dependents, that they weren\'t using themselves for housing allowance. It\'s money that they needed.Now Congress is saying, we\'re going to take that money, we\'re going to use it to fund other programs. The veterans, the IAVA, big associations are coming out and saying, ""Don\'t use the G.I. Bill as a piggybank.""SANDERS: Right.CUOMO: ""Find your savings somewhere else. You already don\'t honor your commitment to the troops."" Where are you on that bill?SANDERS: Yes. I agree with the veterans organization.CUOMO: Will you fight it?SANDERS: Absolutely, absolutely. Look...CUOMO: Because it\'s passing through right now.SANDERS: I know, I got to -- you know, my problem is, there are only 24 hours to a day. But the answer is, yes. The veterans are saying there is, there is money available in a dozen different ways.Some of these guys who are pushing this cut are the same people who want to give tax breaks to billionaires. In my view, that\'s pretty crazy. You have got to stand by the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us.You do not make cuts in the housing allowance which people need.CUOMO: All right. Tone. It\'s becoming more and more subject to this.We know that it is more critical, it\'s closer than people expected it to be, maybe even you included in that. So, part of that happens in politics.But the concern is going to be, if you don\'t win and you wind up in the convention, you have a lot of followers who, in their mind -- I mean, you know when you\'re out there, they\'re not looking for anybody else.How -- have you given a thought yet to what you would do if you don\'t get the nomination, to keep this massive group of people who believe in you with the party that you say you are beholden to, the Democrats?SANDERS: Well, it\'s -- first of all our major focus right now is trying to win.CUOMO: Is winning. I get it.SANDERS: But I got your question. And the question is that it\'s a two-way street. I mean, the Clinton people are also going to have to listen to what these people are fighting for.And the Clinton people are going to have to say, well, you know, maybe Bernie has a point, that we should not be the only major country on Earth to not guarantee health care to all people, or have paid family or medical leave.And maybe, yes, the billionaire class should start paying their fair share of taxes, and maybe yes, we should break up Wall Street.So, it is a two-way thing. And it\'s not me; I don\'t control millions of people. But the Clinton campaign is going to have to make the case to those young people that, in fact, they are prepared to stand up for some real fundamental changes in this country.And that\'s a case they have not yet been able to make.CUOMO: You do not believe that the Clinton campaign has said, in any compelling way, that they have what that group of voters, whose hashtag, #feelingthebern, that they have the solutions for those people\'s problems?SANDERS: No, I really don\'t think they have. I mean, they\'re very good at rhetoric, and certainly, she has moved to the left in this campaign in response to many of the initiatives that we have brought forth.But I think, not only our supporters, I think the average person understands that when you collect such large sums of money from Wall Street and other special interests, they have their doubts as to whether the Clinton people will stand up to these powerful forces.CUOMO: What did you think about the question from Wolf at the debate where he said, ""Can you point to one single vote, one single action...SANDERS: Yeah.CUOMO: ... that makes this allegation about her too closely tied to reality?"" She didn\'t have -- you didn\'t have one.SANDERS: Well, let me give you proof -- well, first of all, one is the bankruptcy bill that she ended up voting for, which was not a good piece of legislation.But you see, the question suggests that, just because somebody gets campaign contributions, do they automatically respond? As you well know, it\'s more than that.So, I\'m not suggesting that money immediately results in a vote or -- either way.But the more important issue, Chris, the point I did make, which I believe is the fundamental point, if we know -- and the evidence is not debatable -- that major Wall Street firms have been operating in a fraudulent manner. If we know that a handful of these firms have incredible economic and political power, should they be broken up?I began this campaign by saying, yes, too much economic and political power, too much fraudulent activity. Hillary Clinton has not come on board that point of view.CUOMO: Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you very much for making the time for ""New Day."" Good luck tomorrow.SANDERS: Thank you.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 24, 2016","b'Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News\' ""Face the Nation""'","b'DICKERSON: Turning now to the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by eight points in our Pennsylvania Battleground Tracker, 51 percent to 43 percent. In Indiana, it\'s a tighter race there, too. Clinton is up five points over Sanders 49 to 44 among likely Democratic primary voters.With that, we turn to Senator Sanders, who joins us from Providence this morning. Senator, I want to ask, Hillary Clinton has more votes and delegates. Is it your view that Democrats want to vote for you, but that there is something rigged about the system that is keeping that from happening? SANDERS: No, John.We started this campaign 60 points behind Secretary Clinton. And in the last couple of weeks, a number of the national polls have had us either tied, me ahead a little bit or her ahead a little bit.We have come an enormous way. We are running against the most powerful political organization in United States of America. And I\'m very proud of the campaign that we have run. We have won 16 states right now. In almost all of the contests, we win the younger people. By that, I mean not just kids, but people 45 years of age or under. I think the ideas we are talking about are what the American people and people in Democratic Party want to hear. We are the future of the Democratic Party. So, I\'m very proud of where we are, and we look forward to finding this out through California. DICKERSON: One of the issues you have talked about so much is income inequality.NPR did an analysis, though, and found in places where income inequality was high, that Hillary was winning in those places. You were asked about this on ""Meet the Press"" and you said, well, poor people don\'t vote. But in states like Ohio, Florida, New York, and even Michigan, which you won, those who would be--those earning less than $30,000 ended up voting more for Hillary Clinton. So, that doesn\'t seem to be the case. SANDERS: Well, but -- well, first thought, one of the challenges that we have as a nation is that we have one of the lowest voter turnouts in general of any major country on Earth.In the last national election, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t vote and those numbers were worse for young people and for low-income people. I believe that what we are trying to do in this campaign, John, with some success, is bring people into the political process. And, obviously, we have got to do better, but I would hope that if I am the nominee that on Election Day you\'re going to see a very, very large voter turnout. And if that is the case, I think we can change the dynamics of American politics, so it is not just big money interests who help elect candidates through outrageous campaign contributions, but what we have is vibrant democracy where old people participate. DICKERSON: But do you still stand by the idea that because poor people aren\'t voting, that is why you\'re not winning? SANDERS: Well, I think we would -- the fact of the matter is, is that we have low voter turnouts.In New York state, three million independents were ineligible to vote. I think that that is pretty crazy. And I think that, as a nation, we have got to significantly increase the voter turnout. There is no doubt that among low-income people, the voting turnout is quite low. DICKERSON: The -- one of the -- in our polls, one of the things we found is that your supporters really want to you continue even if you don\'t get the number of delegates because you have so affected Hillary\'s positions on so many things.If that\'s the case and you were to continue, is there a specific issue or two that you, given leverage you have, would demand that the nominee support that Hillary Clinton is not supporting at the moment? SANDERS: Well, John, there\'s not a question whether if we are going to continue. We are going to continue. We\'re going to fight this out to the last vote is cast. That\'s what democracy is about. You can\'t say to the largest state in this country, California, you can\'t determine who the nominee will be or what the agenda will be. The basic issue -- issues that we are running on is that we have a rigged economy where the middle class continues to decline and almost all the income and wealth goes to the top 1 percent, that we are not being vigorous enough in combating climate change. And let me tell you something, because I\'m on the Environmental Committee, and the scientists are very clear. If we don\'t transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, this planet is in serious trouble for our kids and our grandchildren. And I got to also add that what we are going to fight for is to end the corrupt campaign finance system by which billionaires of Wall Street and super PACs are able to buy elections. Those are the issues that I think are mobilizing the American people and we will continue to fight for. DICKERSON: Yes, I guess what I was asking is whether you will take the fight all the way to the convention and say something like, if you don\'t get nomination, I would like Hillary Clinton to support that $15 national minimum wage, reinstate Glass-Steagall, come out against fracking more forcefully, make specific requests like that.SANDERS: John,that was a very good start. You\'re doing well. Keep going. DICKERSON: So, you would do all that?SANDERS: But why don\'t we throw in the fact -- yes, and why don\'t we throw in the fact that we are the only major country on Earth that doesn\'t guarantee health care to all people as a right?And we need a Medicare-for-all health care program. We need to guarantee paid family and medical leave. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. All of those issues are issues that I believe that the vast majority of people in the Democratic Party support. I hope that if I do not win the nomination, that that will be part of Clinton\'s agenda. DICKERSON: Your strategist Tad Devine said that if -- after next Tuesday, you may rethink, reevaluate your tone towards Hillary Clinton. What does that mean? SANDERS: I have not the slightest idea. You have to ask Tad. My own view is that we are going to debate in a respectful manner the differences of opinions that we have. And we have many differences with Secretary Clinton, as you indicated. I believe the minimum wage should be 15 bucks an hour. She believes it should be $12 an hour. I believe that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I believe that we need a carbon tax, which many of the international financial organizations agree with me on, if we are going to be serious about transforming our energy system and saving this planet. I believe in -- my foreign policy views are quite different than Secretary Clinton\'s, not only that she voted for the war in Iraq, and I opposed it. I have not great fan of regime change, because you have too many unintended consequences. And I do not want our brave men and women in the military to get sucked into perpetual welfare in the Middle East.DICKERSON: All right. SANDERS: So, I will continue contrasting my views with the secretary\'s. DICKERSON: OK. Senator Sanders, thanks so much. SANDERS: Thank you very much.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 24, 2016","b'Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News\' ""Meet the Press""'","b""TODD: Bernie Sanders is spending the weekend campaigning in Maryland ahead of Tuesday's primaries. It's been a tough week for Sanders, whose chances of beating Hillary Clinton received a near-fatal blow after he was convincingly beaten in the New York primary. Sanders has vowed to fight on but he needs to win the remaining contests by some big margins to have any chance of catching Clinton at the Philadelphia convention. I sat down with him in Baltimore yesterday and I started by asking him about his differences that still remain with Hillary Clinton. TODD: Hillary Clinton, the other night in her victory speech after New York, said this: [begin video clip]HILLARY CLINTON: And to all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.[end video clip]TODD: Do you agree with her on that?SANDERS: I think there is a lot that unites us. I think there's a lot that divides us. I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us. The fact that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us. But on the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the part of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. We have to deal in a very substantive way with income and wealth inequality. We need to understand why we're the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, not to have paid family and medical leave and that we have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system, which allows big money interests to buy elections.Those are areas, I think, of difference.TODD: Well, it's interesting you say they're differences. If she were here, she would say I agree with you on campaign finance. I agree with you on Medicare. I agree with you on --SANDERS: No, no, but that's not --TODD: She would say she agrees with those goals.SANDERS: -- well, we all agree with goals. I mean, I suppose everybody has general understanding, you know, that we don't want to see a nuclear war and so forth. But I think that I believe in a Medicare for all, single-pay or program that guarantees health care to all people. I have not only shown by talk but by walking the walk that you can run a campaign, a strong, winning national campaign, getting millions of individuals to make small campaign contributions. That has not been Secretary Clinton's approach. We have not been dependent on big money interests. And that is perhaps the most important thing because I'm not quite sure that you're ever going to change this country, ever going to take on the billionaire class, ever going to create a government that works for the middle class so long as you're dependent on Wall Street money and big money interests.TODD: You wake up the day after the convention and you're not the nominee. Do you look in the mirror and say this was a successful campaign?SANDERS: Well, obviously, our goal now is, while we have a narrow path to victory, we're going to fight for the -- through that path. We hope to win. But I think the fact that we have shown that there is massive dissatisfaction in this country with the status quo, that people want to think bigger, that people understand that when you have 20 people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that people are showing in this campaign the desire to stand up and fight back, the fact that we have brought millions of young people, who, I think many of the pundits had thought were kind of apathetic, not interested in politics, well, you know what? These young people know they're the future of this country. They want to shape the future. And I'm very proud that we have been able to bring them into the political process.TODD: You just described it as a narrow path. So what it is? Explain it to me.SANDERS: Well, we're going to have to do -- obviously win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain. A poll came out yesterday that had us within striking distance in California, our largest lead. I think we could do very well in California.TODD: But it starts with winning some states here, winning a Pennsylvania, winning -- SANDERS: Well, bottom line, the arithmetic is you have to win delegates. That's what it means. We have won --TODD: Well, in this case, it means big primary wins.SANDERS: Right. We have won 1,200 delegates. And, by the way, when we talk about the campaign, you know, we started this campaign 60, 65 points behind Secretary Clinton in national polls; now many of these polls have us even, a few points ahead, perhaps. Many of the polls now show us -- and this is an important point, Chuck. When Democrats look out into the horizon, what unites us is the understanding that Trump would be a disastrous president. Look at the polls. Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton.TODD: But she runs well, too. SANDERS: She runs well, too. [crosstalk]TODD: Does that hurt your cause a little bit?It's like, yes, you do better. But she runs pretty well, too.SANDERS: Well, I think the answer is, depending on the polls -- and polls are polls. I don't want to go crazy on polls.But I think many Democrats are convinced that what is most important is defeating Donald Trump. And I believe the objective evidence is that I'm the stronger candidate.TODD: I was just going to say, at the end of the day, you feel like you were given a fair shot at this nomination?SANDERS: Yes. We took advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are in the race, we're not writing our obituary. We're in this race until California and we're proud of the campaign we ran.TODD: Quite some interesting numbers here. So 17 of the 25 states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries; 16 of those 17 states have been won by Hillary Clinton, not by you. Why?SANDERS: Well, because poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact. That's a sad reality of American society. And that's what we have to transform. We have what, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on Earth. We have done a good job bringing young people in. I think we have done -- had some success with lower income people.But in America today, in the last ,election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote.TODD: You feel as if you could find a way to get people that are fighting at that poverty line, either just below it or just above it, if they were getting engaged in the process, you would do better?SANDERS: If we could significantly increase voter turnout so that low income people and working people and young people particular in the political process, that if we could have a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically transformed.TODD: President Obama is getting a little bit of criticism in the U.K. for speaking out against -- he doesn't want to see British citizens vote to take the U.K. out of the E.U. First of all, where are you on that?And second of all, would you insert yourself into the campaign?SANDERS: Well, I'll let the British people make their own decisions on that.TODD: So you don't think the president should be commenting on this?SANDERS: The president has every right to comment on what he wants. Though I'm a candidate for president right now, I'm not going to --TODD: So as president, you would not have -- SANDERS: I didn't say that. He is the president.TODD: Right.Do you have a view?[crosstalk]SANDERS: -- candidate for president.TODD: Do you have a view on this?SANDERS: Not a significant one. I'll let the people -- you know, I think the U.K. -- the European Union obviously is a very, very important institution. But ultimately, you know, people of Britain have got to make their own decisions. I would hope that they stay in but that's their decision.TODD: Why are you against the consumption tax, the soda tax in Philadelphia that would pay for pre-K?[crosstalk]TODD: Hillary Clinton is for it.SANDERS: Yes. I'll tell you why, because it is a totally regressive tax. And right now, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting wealthier, many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people. You have large multinational corporations not paying a nickel in federal taxes. That's where you get the money. Somebody who's making $20,000 a year and they buy a bottle of soda, I don't think you charge them 30 cents more for that bottle of soda. Now the goal of universal health care, universal child care, absolutely something that I strongly agree on and I applaud the mayor there for coming forward.But raise the money in a way that is progressive, not on the backs of low-income or working people.TODD: So you must be against cigarette taxes, too, then?SANDERS: No, I'm not. Cigarette taxes are -- there's a difference between cigarettes and soda. I'm aware of the obesity problem in this country.TODD: I don't think Michael Bloomberg would agree with you on that one.SANDERS: Well, that's fine. He can have his -- a point of view. But cigarettes are causing cancer, obviously, and a dozen other diseases and, you know, there's almost a question as to why it remains a legal product in this country.TODD: Let me wrap it up, a question this way. Do you feel as if, if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and you're not but Donald Trump is the opponent, do you have a responsibility to do what it takes to get your voters to support Hillary Clinton?SANDERS: I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president. But the -- if that's scenario plays out, the major responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton to convince all people, not just my supporters, that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country, to take on the big money interests, who have so much power, to fight for what the American people want.TODD: Your supporters are, for the most part, whenever I -- very skeptical of Hillary Clinton. Very, very skeptical. Tougher on her, frankly, than you ever are. People talk about all this back and forth. What do you think -- what is your advice to her on winning your voters over?SANDERS: Well, I think she's going to have to be very explicit about supporting a program which stands up for the needs of the middle class and working families, which, most importantly, makes it clear that she is prepared to take on Wall Street in a very clear way, take on the billionaire class, come up with a program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years. I think those are some of the issues she's going to have to bring forth."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 24, 2016","b'Interview with Jake Tapper of CNN\'s ""State of the Union""'","b'TAPPER: Senator, thanks so much for joining us. SANDERS: Great to be with you, Jake. TAPPER: So, Senator, according to ""The New York Times,"" Hillary Clinton has started compiling a list of 15 to 20 potential V.P. picks that she wants to start vetting in late spring. Broadly, regardless of which of the two of you ultimately wins the Democratic nomination, should the other one be first on the V.P. list? SANDERS: Look, I\'m focusing right now on dealing with why the middle class of this country continues to disappear, why we\'re the only country on Earth, Jake, that doesn\'t provide paid family and medical leave, why we don\'t guarantee health care to all of our people. I was just in Baltimore yesterday. The level of poverty is unbelievable. We have to rebuild our inner cities. I think the American people want us to focus on the real issues impacting them, how their kids can afford to go to college, not worry at this point about who is going to be a vice presidential candidate. TAPPER: Well, then broadly speaking on those issues, if you don\'t win the nomination, does Hillary Clinton need an outspoken progressive, someone like you or Elizabeth Warren, as her running mate to motivate your supporters and make sure that those issues you just talked about are on the forefront? SANDERS: Well, I think that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, whoever became the candidates may be, need to start talking to the real issues facing the American people.And that is that we have a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. Jake, how often do we talk about on television that the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that, in fact, we are seeing public school systems, one end of this country, in serious, serious trouble, we are seeing kids graduating college deeply in debt?All of the candidates need to focus on those issues. And vice presidential candidates need to do the same. That\'s what I\'m trying to do in this campaign. That\'s why we have come from 3 percent in the polls to almost tying or in some cases being ahead of Secretary Clinton in national polls. TAPPER: David Plouffe, Barack Obama\'s 2008 campaign manager, who, we should say, is now supporting Hillary Clinton, Plouffe had some strong words for you on Twitter. He wrote -- quote -- ""Sanders has run a stunningly strong campaign fueled by passionate supporters, but raising money stating that you have path to nomination is fraud"" -- unquote. What\'s your response to Plouffe? SANDERS: Well, my response is that David Plouffe is working for Hillary Clinton. The idea that we should not vigorously contest this election, when the largest state in the United States of America, California, has not yet voted, nine other states will not have voted after Tuesday, of course, we\'re going to give every -- the people in every state in this country the right to determine who they want to see president of the United States, what kind of agenda they want. Jake, you know, when we began this campaign, we were way, way behind. And I think it is fair to say that we have the momentum, we have the energy, that we are bringing millions of people into the political process. What is good for America, what is good for the Democratic Party is to see a whole lot of people debating the real issues impacting our country. That\'s how you have a large voter turnout. And when you have a large voter turnout, Democrats and progressives win, and Republicans will lose.TAPPER: Do you have a path to the nomination, though, sir? In what states can you win so overwhelmingly that you can overtake her ultimately in the pledged delegate count? SANDERS: Well, I\'m not going to tell you that it\'s easy, but I think we do. What polls seem to be showing is that many of the states yet to come, including California, our largest state, we have a real shot to win. And I think, also, there are a lot of delegates out there who are looking at the general matchup, and what they\'re seeing in polls is that Bernie Sanders is running a lot stronger against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton, because we can appeal to a lot of independents and people, not just the Democrats. So, I think we do have a path to victory. I think we have come a very, very long way in the last year, and we\'re going to fight for every last vote until the -- California and the D.C. primary. TAPPER: Senator, President Obama told the BBC today that he does not think the military campaign against ISIS will be completed before he leaves office. There are now around 5,000 U.S. troops fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Is the U.S. at war in the Middle East again? And does Congress need to pass a new authorization for use of military force, so that the next president, which could be you, has a clear authority to wage this war? SANDERS: Well, I would like to see an authorization. The question obviously is, what is in that authorization? And, Jake, I will oppose any authorization that gives us just a wide-open approach to getting involved into perpetual war in the Middle East. I think the president has done a good job in trying to balance the need to destroy ISIS. We have got to put together a coalition of the Muslim nations. But I voted against the war in Iraq, one of the differences that I have with Secretary Clinton. I will do everything that I can to make sure that our men and women in the military are not sucked into perpetual war there. TAPPER: You were asked this weekend about why Hillary Clinton beats you in states where income inequality is most stark. And you responded that -- quote -- ""Because poor people don\'t vote"" -- unquote. It was, however, Hillary Clinton, not you, who carried Democratic voters with household incomes below $50,000 a year. Clinton carried this group 55 percent to 44 percent across primaries where network exit polls had been conducted. SANDERS: Well, let me just say this. One of the reasons I am running for president of the United States is to try to revitalize American democracy. It is no secret that we have one of the lowest voting turnout rates of any major country on earth. And it is also true, in the last general election we had in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t vote, and the numbers were worse for low-income people, and the numbers were worse for young people. So, what we have got to do, Jake, is to not only overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, so that billionaires and super PACs are not able to buy elections. We have got to involve people. And it\'s not easy, because so many people have given up on the political process, including a whole lot of low-income people, where the voting rates are in fact quite low, young people, who are not voting in large numbers. Our job is to bring people into the political process, to create a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent. And if there\'s a thing that I\'m trying to do in this campaign, that\'s precisely what I\'m trying to do, to increase the number of lower-income people who are voting, working people who are voting, young people who are voting, revitalize American democracy.And when we do that, I think we begin to change the dynamic of government in America, where it\'s not just big money interests who make the decisions, but ordinary people. TAPPER: Are you surprised that you consistently lose lower-income Americans to Hillary Clinton?SANDERS: Well, I am surprised at how well we have done in this campaign. You know, Jake, if you and I were talking 11, 11-and-a-half months ago, you would not have believed that we would here where we are right now. You would not believe that we have won 16 states at this point, and that we\'re running very close to Secretary Clinton in general election matchups, and, in fact, we\'re beating Trump by rather large numbers. I\'m very proud of the campaign that we have run and the kinds of support that we are getting. TAPPER: There is a lot of concern, as you know, about what kind of damage you or Hillary Clinton might be doing to one another. One of your high-profile surrogates, actress Rosario Dawson, invoked Monica Lewinsky at one of your rallies. Do you think it\'s appropriate for your surrogates to be talking about Monica Lewinsky on the campaign trail?SANDERS: We have many, many -- Rosario is a great actress, and she\'s doing a great job for us. And she\'s been a passionate fighter to see that we see the increase voter turnout, that we fight for racial, economic, environmental justice. What our job right now is to contrast our views compared to Secretary Clinton. That\'s what a campaign is about. My own view is, we should break up the large financial institutions on Wall Street. I\'m opposed to fracking.And, by the way, we just won a good victory in New York state the other day. A major fracking program has been killed. I think we have got to ask the wealthy and large corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. So, what I will be doing in this campaign is in an issue-oriented way, not by personal attacks... TAPPER: Right, but that\'s...SANDERS: ...but by contrasting our view to Secretary Clinton. TAPPER: But, yes or no, should your surrogates be talking about Monica Lewinsky?SANDERS: I have no idea in what context Rosario was talking about her. But I would hope that all of our people focus on the real issues facing working people and the massive level of income and wealth inequality that we have. And, by the way, it might be a good idea for all of us, including television networks, to start talking about the planetary crisis of climate change, because the scientists tell us, if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, energy efficiency and sustainable energy, we should worry about the planet that we\'re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren. TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Good luck on Tuesday. SANDERS: Thank you, Jake.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 25, 2016","b'Remarks in a Town Hall Meeting with Chris Hayes of MSNBC at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania'","b'HAYES: Welcome to the National Constitution Center here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of five states that will be voting tomorrow. And when this whole campaign began, there were more than 20 candidates in the race. And if you took bets when it began on who the last five would be, a lot of people would have lost money. And one of the reasons they would have lost money is the man I can introduce right now.It\'s my great pleasure to welcome senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders. [applause]How are you, Senator? [applause]Does this -- does this happen everywhere, like when you go to get coffee now or is that... [laughter]SANDERS: [inaudible]HAYES: Yes.Um, we\'re here in Pennsylvania. You\'ve got five states tomorrow. Those five states are -- are Northeastern, Eastern Seaboard states. They\'re not the deep South, where you had a hard time. They\'re not the Plains States, where you had some real good wins.Um, how do you feel about tomorrow?SANDERS: I feel pretty good. I think if the turnout is high, if -- if working people come out in large numbers, if young people come out, I think the message, Chris, that we are bringing forth, that it\'s too late for establishment politics, that it is insane that today, almost all new income and wealth has gone to the top 1 percent, that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave, not to guarantee health care to all people, that is a message resonating in Pennsylvania, it\'s resonating in Connecticut, it\'s resonating all over this country.HAYES: [inaudible] [applause]HAYES: The primary calendar, uh, June 7th is a big date. It\'s the California and some other states.SANDERS: Right.HAYES: The 14th is DC.SANDERS: Right.HAYES: As of the 14th, everyone will have voted...SANDERS: Right.HAYES: -- in the territories. Right now, you\'re at 45 percent of pledged delegates, Secretary Clinton is at 55 percent. She\'s got about 2.7 million more votes.SANDERS: By the way, that\'s not quite accurate, because I think a lot of the votes cast in the caucus states have not been counted and we\'ve won some of those states by 70 percent.HAYES: But you would agree that she\'s won more?SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: On the 14th, um, do you agree that the person who\'s won the most pledged delegates and the most votes is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party?SANDERS: This is what I believe. Now, I know the media has got into all of the process issues. What this campaign is about is transforming the United States of America. What this campaign is about is bringing millions of people into the political process. And I\'m very proud of the -- the fact that we have had [inaudible] to do that.Now, at the end of the process, you know, frankly, if we are behind in the pledged delegates, I think it\'s very hard for us to win. But I think we are going to make the case, also, that if you look at the polling and if you look at reality, I believe -- and I\'m not the only one who believes this -- that we are the stronger campaign in taking on Donald Trump or any other Republican candidate. And I think that most of -- most Democrats out there, more than anything -- correctly so -- want to make sure that some right-wing Republican doesn\'t become president of the United States. [applause] HAYES: Let me ask you about that because... [applause]...and I -- I sort of share your feeling about process, frankly. I mean I know the...SANDERS: My response is then let\'s now talk about process all afternoon.HAYES: Well, but -- but -- right. On, and I agree. But -- but there\'s also a principal aspect to it.SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: I mean the -- the principle is Democrat control of the Democratic Party...SANDERS: Right.HAYES: -- in the sense of you want the person who got the most votes to be the nominee.SANDERS: Look, you also -- let\'s talk about principles. Hundreds and hundreds of super delegates, parts of the Democratic establishment, voted for Hillary Clinton...HAYES: Right.SANDERS: -- or pledged to come on board her campaign before I even announced my candidacy.HAYES: Right.SANDERS: And those people have a right to rethink the decision that they made. And if they conclude, for a dozen different reasons, that we are a stronger campaign -- and by the way, this is not just talking off the top of my head, virtually every poll that\'s out there, as you know, shows that Bernie Sanders is better against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton because nobody gets other Republican candidates.Should that be taken into consideration?Yes, I do. I think so.HAYES: How hard do you see yourself pressing that case?SANDERS: Look, again, the issue to me right now is we\'ve got five states tomorrow, if -- we\'ve got 10 remaining states, including the largest state in this country. And what I\'m going to focus on is the burning issue facing the American people that we have got to talk about.Why is it that the middle class has been declining for the last 35 years?Are we happy that 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.Are we doing enough to address the crisis of climate change and make sure that the planet that we leave our children and grandchildren is a healthy planet.Are we happy with the corrupt campaign finance system, which super PACs and billionaires are buying elections.Those are the issues that we have got to focus on.HAYES: One of the... [applause]...one of the sort of sources of your -- of your -- your critique, right, when you talk about why the system is broken, um, has to do with an answer you gave to my colleague, Chuck Todd, about turnout in states and, um, you said something about, you know, a -- lower voting turnout of poor people, right?SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: And -- and you got some heat for that. It is [inaudible]SANDERS: Why did I get heat on it?Poor people...HAYES: A...SANDERS: -- voted for -- voted [inaudible]HAYES: Right. [crosstalk]SANDERS: Look, let\'s be clear, this is the [inaudible]...HAYES: And that -- and it explains a lot, right?SANDERS: Let\'s be clear, the Clinton campaign has a super PAC. They have 30 people on the Internet who pick up on everything and then they create this kind of, you know, narrative.Here is the facts, all right, dispute it if you want with me. In the last election in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t vote.HAYES: Right.SANDERS: It\'s not a very vibrant democracy, to my mind. Eighty percent of young people, and as I understand it, 80 percent of low income people did not vote. That\'s a fact.HAYES: Right.SANDERS: All right?So what was my point?Low income people are not voting in large numbers. I think that\'s a tragedy. I want to see if we can change that.HAYES: That -- that brings me to what...[applause]...ultimately you set up -- you set up this campaign that, in some ways, cast its own [inaudible], right, because the -- the campaign is about this political revolution, as you say. It\'s about breaking down the barriers of who does and doesn\'t participate.SANDERS: This campaign is about...HAYES: You said...SANDERS: -- taking on the entire establishment, the Democratic establishment, the financial establishment and in Clinton\'s campaign, the most powerful political organization in the United States of America.This campaign is about starting off 60 points behind Secretary Clinton and, by the way, in the last couple of weeks, a few polls had us ahead of her nationally.All right, that\'s what this campaign is about. [applause]HAYES: What have you learned, then, about what you\'ve succeeded and failed at when you think about turning out precisely the kinds of people that don\'t -- that under vote in American politics?SANDERS: I think it\'s very difficult. I think there are -- and this is a real American tragedy. There are millions of people, working class people and low income people who turn on the television and you know what they see?Nothing being talked about the reality of their lives. They listen to what goes on in Congress, they can\'t for -- afford to feed their kids. They can\'t pay for their electric bills because we have 47 million people living in poverty. And they see Congress debating tax breaks for billionaires and candidates taking huge sums of money from the wealthy and the powerful.And they conclude -- and it\'s kind of hard to argue with them -- that the system is -- the political system is corrupt. And they are saying and candidates taking huge sums of money from the wealthy and the powerful.And they conclude -- and it\'s kind of hard to argue with them -- that the system is -- the political system is corrupt. And they are saying to themselves, why do I want to participate in this charade?Now, we are trying -- and we\'ve had really good success with young people. I think we\'re bringing out a whole lot of young people, to some degree with working class people and maybe with low income people.But it is very, very hard to tell people who are struggling now and seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, that they should get involved in the political process, that their voices actually matter.HAYES: So there\'s -- there\'s other folks, um, who have been running -- talking about some of those same things. Um, you\'ve -- you\'ve endorsed a few of them, raised money for a few of them.There\'s a guy here in -- in Pennsylvania named John Fetterman. He\'s the mayor of a town named Braddock. [applause]I had him on the show, an interesting guy. The town has had a really hard time because of trade, because of the steel industry essentially dying.He endorsed you. He says he feels basically like he\'s a -- sitting there without a -- with a corsage, waiting for the -- [inaudible] the Sanders mutual endorsement.SANDERS: Well, I -- I honestly don\'t know John and I\'ve heard just a little bit about him. Um, what we are trying to do now, we have endorsed and gotten some money to some candidates and I hope they win. I just don\'t know enough about, uh, John, to be honest with you.HAYES: Um, there\'s -- this -- this connects to another question people have, which is about this movement that you\'ve built.SANDERS: I haven\'t built it. This is a movement of millions of people who are beginning to stand up and fight back.HAYES: But you\'ve -- you\'ve facilitated [inaudible] SANDERS: I am the candidate for president that many of them...HAYES: Right.SANDERS: -- are supporting.HAYES: Right.SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: And so then the question becomes, to a lot of people, you know, you -- look, a year ago, I don\'t -- you were not a Democrat, right?You -- now you are one of the most powerful Democrats in America.Whatever happened after that?Whatever happened?You\'ve raised more money than anyone ever, right?SANDERS: No, I\'ve raised more money than anyone ever?HAYES: Up to this point, you are [inaudible]...SANDERS: Oh, you mean...HAYES: -- in primary hard dollars.SANDERS: -- no, Hillary Clinton -- Clinton has raised more money than we have. She has a couple of super PACs [inaudible]...HAYES: Right. In hard -- in hard dollars, and particularly in small donors, right, you\'ve done [inaudible]SANDERS: We have -- this is -- let me be very clear about this. I am enormously proud. This campaign, our campaign, does not have a super PAC, does not want a super PAC. What we have done is received over seven million individual campaign contributions, averaging $27 apiece.I am enormously proud of that. [applause]HAYES: So the question then is...[applause]...we have seen before, um, campaigns -- we have seen before campaigns that were able to ignite, uh, tremendous passion from folks, volunteer, knock on doors, give money, right, because of all of the things you\'re talking about.SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: And then the campaign goes away and what do you say to those folks that are supporting you about what endures from this, no matter what happens...SANDERS: Well...HAYES: -- in this outcome?SANDERS: -- what I would say, for a start, it will be a lot easier for us to mobilize and endure if I am elected president of the United States [inaudible] [applause]...because this is why. [applause]And every day I say this, Chris, and I suspect you\'ve heard me say it more than one, and that is that no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else, can transform this country in the way we have to transform it, because of the power of the big money interests. Wall Street has an endless supply of money. Corporate America would shut down a plant in Pennsylvania tomorrow if they can move to China and make another five bucks. The corporate media very much determines the kind of conversation we have.Your particular station is owned by whom?HAYES: Comcast.SANDERS: Comcast.HAYES: NBC Universal.SANDERS: There we go, one of the more popular corporations in America.HAYES: Yes. [laughter]SANDERS: And -- and, you know, and you\'ve got wealthy campaign contributors. And the only way -- and let me -- let me repeat it again -- the only way we transform this country, and this I believe from the bottom of my heart -- is when millions of people stand up, fight back and demand that we have a government that represents all of us, not just the 1 percent. [applause]HAYES: So we\'ve got some great folks here, uh, in the audience. We\'re going to take some audience questions.The first comes from David Zakubuwetz (ph).He\'s a 20-year-old U Penn student who supports you.David?SANDERS: Hi, David.DAVID ZAKUBUWETZ: So, first, I want to say as a student, I\'m very excited to be voting for the first time tomorrow for you.So thank you.SANDERS: [inaudible].ZAKUBUWETZ: My question is, many of your supporters are staunchly opposed to Hillary Clinton and are considering writing you in, voting for a third party candidate or not voting at all if you don\'t win the nomination.I believe you will win the nomination and the presidency, but if you don\'t, will you encourage your supporters to vote for Secretary Clinton?SANDERS: Well, David, thanks for the question.And let me answer it, uh, in this way. Um, first, um, I think it is, you know, we are not a movement where I can snap my fingers and say to you or to anybody else what you should do, because you won\'t listen to me. You shouldn\'t. Uh, you\'ll make these decisions yourself.I think if we end up losing -- and I hope we do not -- and if Secretary Clinton wins, it is incumbent upon her to tell millions of people who right now do not believe in establishment politics or establishment economics, who have serious misgivings about a candidate who has received millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests.She has got to go out to you and to millions of other people and say, yes, I think the United States should join the rest of the industrialized world and take on the private insurance companies and the greed of the drug companies and pass a Medicare for all.I think that says Secretary Clinton, that for the young people in this country, you should not have to leave college $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt because we\'re going to make as many other countries around the world do, public colleges and universities tuition-free. I think Secretary Clinton is going to have to explain to millions of young people and a lot of other people that climate change is a real crisis and incrementalism is just not going to solve it. That\'s... [applause]...[inaudible]...[applause]And she is going to have to come on board and say, yes, I know it\'s hard, but I am going to take on the fossil fuel industry and pass a carbon tax.So the -- the point that I am making is, it is incumbent upon Secretary Clinton to reach out not only to my supporters, but to all of the American people, with an agenda that they believe will represent the interests of working families, lower income people, the middle class, those of us who are concerned about the environment and not just big money interests.HAYES: There is -- there are Hillary Clinton supporters who I talk to, um, people who -- some of whom are -- are die hard [inaudible] they voted for her, they like you, they like your politics. But it -- but there is concern that thing you said at the beginning of that answer strikes me as important. You can\'t snap your fingers. I mean people -- this thing is big and people are very passionate.Um, you know, you have Tim Robbins\' gun event for you. He Tweeted something today about the elections being stolen. And Rosario Dawson mentioned Monica Lewinsky and all of that is going to come out in the wash, I agree.But the question for you is, if it\'s incumbent on her, what role do you have if and when you come to that moment? [applause]SANDERS: Good. [applause]Fair question. [applause]I work with Republicans in the U.S. Senate and I see what they do in the House. I think the Republican Party today has moved so far to the right that they are way, way, way out of touch with where the American people are.These are people who almost without exception do not even recognize the reality of climate change, let alone want to anything about it.They want to cut Social Security and give tax breaks to billionaires. They want to end the Affordable Care Act, but they have nothing to replace it with.I will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election cycle. [applause]HAYES: Um, all right, we are going to take a quick break and we will be back right here at the National Constitution Center with more questions from the [inaudible]...[applause] [commercial break] [applause]HAYES: We are back here in the National Constitution Center with Bernie Sanders in a town hall.We have a question now from Becky Cerna, who is at U Penn studying nursing and is undecided.Becky?BECKY CERNA: Hi. My name is Becky and my parents are undocumented immigrants who arrived from Mexico so that I could have opportunities that they could only dream of. This has come with a life full of personal sacrifices and economic hardship.You propose to implement immigration reform that will create a path to full and equal citizenship.How will you ensure that after implementation, immigrants like my grand -- like my parents, aren\'t treated as second class citizens?SANDERS: Um, Becky, thank you for the question.Uh, we have 11 million undocumented people in this country today. Many of them are being exploited because when you don\'t have any legal rights, your employer can take advantage of you.Many of them are living in fear and living in the shadows.So I believe absolutely that we have to move aggressively toward comprehensive immigration reform.My dad was an immigrant. He came to this country at the age of 17. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.Comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.Now, my concern is that if Congress does not do what it should do and pass that legislation, I will pick up where President Obama left office and use the executive powers of the presidency to do everything that I can to make your parents safe in this country and not afraid.And the other thing that I will do, where I do disagree with President Obama, I will end the deportations. [inaudible]. [applause]HAYES: All right, um, we now have Natalie Herbert.She is getting a PhD from the Annenberg School of Communications at U Penn and supports Hillary Clinton.NATALIE HERBERT: Thank you, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Thank you.HERBERT: So much of your campaign rhetoric is about revolutionary politics. But so much of a president\'s job is inherently tied to institutions and bureaucracies as they exist.So, how do you keep the revolutionary spirit alive despite these constraints?SANDERS: OK. Thank you.Um, you\'re right in saying that a lot of the day to day work is going to take place in Capitol Hill and it\'s messy and there\'s a lot of negotiating. What I will tell you is that when I was in the House, in a given number of years, I ended up passing more amendments on the floor of the House working with Republicans than any other member of the House. I can work with Republicans.Just a few years ago, I helped pass, as chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, the most comprehensive veterans legislation in modern history... [applause] ...working with John McCain and a number of other Republicans.So if the question is, can I sit down, you know, with conservative people like Chris here and negotiate with them... [laughter] ...yes, I can do that.But let me also say this, and this is important. At the end of the day, the powers that be, the powers who control -- people who control the Congress, the big money interests and Wall Street, they are not going to allow the kind of real change that this country needs, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, ending our disastrous trade policies so that corporate America starts investing in this country rather than China, making sure that women do not continue to earn 79 cents on the dollar compared to men, aggressively addressing climate change, making sure that public colleges and universities are tuition-free.That is not going to be done by Congress itself. That requires a political revolution. And as president of the United States, what I would do is use the bully pulpit in an unprecedented way to rally the American people to demand that the Congress listens to their needs, not just the needs of wealthy campaign contributors. [applause]HAYES: President Obama... [applause] ...President Obama, when he came into office, had this new, unprecedented thing called Obama for America, right, where they...SANDERS: Yes.HAYES: -- they basically preserved the campaign organization...SANDERS: Right.HAYES: -- and...SANDERS: Right.HAYES: -- full disclosure, my brother worked for them. He was an organizer. Um, and that proved tough, in a lot of ways, for it to work. Um, part of that, I think, had to do with the inherent tension between being the president of the United States and outside power.What have you learned from that?What is the model, if that -- if that seemed to not do what you\'re talking about...SANDERS: Actually, I talked to the president about that. And from what he, you know, indicated, it\'s tough. And it is tough. It is really tough.Uh, but I think that one of the most important things that a president can do is to help ordinary people come together in a variety of grassroots organizations to put the pressure on the Congress to counterbalance the pressure that Wall Street and wealthy campaign contributors now exert.For example, let me just give you one example and on this one, I am 100 percent sure that I\'m right.If the young people of this country stood up and were very loud and clear that they are sick and tired of leaving college $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt, that they want public colleges and universities tuition-free, and if millions of them stood up, started emailing, writing and demonstrating, without the slightest doubt, that is exactly what would happen. [applause]So the question is, this is what the American people want.The question is, how we put together...HAYES: Right.SANDERS: -- that type of grassroots organization...HAYES: But that\'s a hard thing to do.SANDERS: It is a hard thing to do. But for the future of this country, that is exactly what has to be done.Let me say this about the president...HAYES: Yes.SANDERS: -- somebody I love and have enormous respect for. I think because he is such a decent guy, in many respects, he actually believed that he could walk into the Oval Office and sit down with Republicans and negotiate in good faith. He was wrong about that. Republicans had no intention of ever negotiating in good faith. What they wanted to do was obstruct, obstruct, obstruct in an unprecedented way.And it took the president a number of years to learn that lesson. He knows it now and that\'s why his pen and executive orders are flying out. I have learned that lesson. I will know that when I get into the Oval Office.HAYES: Do you predict that would -- whoever the Democratic president, should there be a Democratic president elected in January of next year, do you believe they will be met with functionally that same attitude?SANDERS: Yes. I think the Republican Party, as I mentioned a moment ago, has moved very, very far to the right. Obviously they are beholden to the wealthy corporate interests, but they are now also beholden to an extreme right wing base, you know, people who are active in the horrific, you know, Trump ethic, on the birther movement, people who are very hostile to immigrants.You see Trump talking about and referring to Mexicans as racists and criminals, wanting to ban Muslims from coming into this country. And those concepts do have a certain support.So do I think if I became president that we\'d run into that type of obstructionism? Yes, I do.HAYES: Terry Smith, legal aid lawyer, undecided until the issue that she is going to, I believe, ask you a question about.QUESTION: Senator Sanders, I was surprised and disappointed to hear you oppose Philadelphia\'s efforts to bring universal preschool to all kids through a tax on big soda distributors. Here in Pennsylvania we have a state legislature that doesn\'t adequately fund our existing public schools, and importantly, we also have a constitution that prohibits us from taxing just the wealthy.So given those constraints, I\'m interested in hearing your ideas for funding winnable anti-poverty agendas like pre-K for all.SANDERS: First of all, please do not be disappointed in my views on pre-K. I believe that we have right now in my state and in Pennsylvania a dysfunctional pre-K system, which is a national disgrace. That we have child care workers who make less than McDonald\'s employees, where we have parents who cannot find quality affordable childcare. We have kids who are entering school way behind because they are not getting the intellectual or emotional nourishment that they need. I believe absolutely, and if elected president one of my priorities would be to establish a cutting-edge high-quality pre-K system in every state in this country. I can\'t think of many things that are more important to me than that.But when it comes to funding these programs, at a time when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, when 58 percent of all the income goes to the top 1 percent, to ask poor people to pay for that, it\'s wrong. You are taking money from the people who are hurting the most.So please count me in as somebody who will aggressively lead the effort for universal, high quality childcare, but I believe it has to be funded in a progressive way. The wealthy and large corporations are going to have to pay for it. [applause]HAYES: A follow-up on that because I think it\'s a really tricky issue and there are people of all kinds of politics on either side of the issue. You know, the big soda companies are on the same side of that, right. And they have poured -- I saw them pour millions of dollars in New York City to fight that. And that\'s their argument, right. I mean, how do you feel when you end up on the same side as them?SANDERS: Look, big soda companies will do what they do. And let me also be clear. I am more than aware of the negative role that sugar is playing in terms of obesity and health in the United States. But what we have got to do is to have progressive taxation.Look, and I don\'t want to have to repeat it, the truth is the very, very rich are becoming much richer. Almost everybody else is becoming poor. It is absurd to go to some of the poorest people and raise their taxes. And by the way, this tax, if I recall, is three cents an ounce. Twelve ounce bottle of soda, that\'s 36 cents, times five sodas week, that\'s two bucks, 100 bucks a year. If you don\'t have a lot of money, you know, that\'s a lot.So I think what we have got to do is to understand that nationally we need progressive taxation. There are corporations, Chris, right now who make billions of dollars a year in profit, stash their money in the Cayman Islands, not paying a nickel in federal taxes. I intend to and that. [applause]There are multimillionaires and hedge fund operators who pay an effective tax rate lower than many of the people here. I intend to end that.So the argument is not whether we have a high quality pre-K system. We must do that. The argument is that we have got to fund it by asking the wealthiest people who are doing phenomenally well to start paying their fair share of taxes.HAYES: Going to take a quick break, and we\'ve got some more from the National Constitution Center in just a minute. Don\'t go anywhere. [commercial break]HAYES: We are back at the National Constitution Center with Senator Bernie Sanders, candidate for the Democratic nominee for president. And our next question comes from Suleiman Rahman, who is 48 years old and undecided. Mr. Rahman.QUESTION: I want to ask a similar question that was posed to Secretary Clinton about there has been a lot of talk around mass incarceration. Can you speak to, as president, how you will address the issue around the collateral consequences of convictions around housing, around employment, around education.SANDERS: Thank you for that important question. As a nation we should be profoundly embarrassed that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth. We spend $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people, disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American.For a thought, what I would propose is when we have unemployment rates of minority kids of 40 or 50 percent, that maybe it makes more sense to invest in jobs and education for those kids rather than jail and incarceration. [applause]Second of all, we need to end over-policing, and we need to de-militarize local police departments so they don\'t look like occupying forces.Thirdly, we need to make police departments reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. Number four, we need to make sure that we end private ownership of prisons and detention centers. And very importantly, and Secretary Clinton and I have a big difference of opinion on this, I think we really need to rethink the war on drugs. [applause]Now it turns out that in the last 30 years millions of people have received criminal records because of possession of marijuana. And it turns out also, interestingly enough, that the white community and the black community do marijuana at about equal levels. But blacks are four times more likely to be arrested than whites. So this becomes a racial issue and not just a criminal justice issue.I would take marijuana out of the Federal Controlled Substance Act.HAYES: Senator, some of sort of the knock-on effects of a criminal justice conviction, particularly a felony conviction, that Mr. Rahman just mentioned, are punitive across the board, right. Student aid, living in public housing. Some of that comes from the \'94 crime bill.That was a bill that you got on the floor and said there was a lot about this bill I don\'t like. You also voted for it. Was that a mistake?SANDERS: Well, it\'s one of these things where you have a -- has the bill had absolutely horrendous impact in terms of mass incarceration? Absolutely. Is that an awful thing? Yes it is. It also had in it, when you sit there and vote, the Violence Against Women Act. And I worked very hard as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, trying to end domestic violence.It also had in it, as you know, the ban on assault weapons. And I have believed from way back when that assault weapons should not be sold or distributed in the United States of America. These are weapons design not for hunting but to kill people.So, you know, I could see if I had voted against the bill, you know, there would be 30-second ads saying, Bernie Sanders didn\'t vote to ban assault weapons, didn\'t support women in the fight against domestic violence.But here is the more important point. It has had a disastrous impact and we\'ve got to undo the damage that it caused.HAYES: Obviously you can\'t go back in time, right. But you learn things about votes -- because all votes, frankly, have some stuff on one side or the other. I mean, do you wish you had that vote back? [crosstalk]SANDERS: I wish I had a different piece of legislation. I wish that I could vote for the Violence Against Women Act. And I want to see assault weapons banned in the United States, weapons that were used in Sandy Hook and in other areas.So what we need to do, it doesn\'t -- you know, 1994 was a long time ago. What we need to do now is address this very serious issue. And I have said this. Let me repeat it again, that if elected president, by the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than any other country.Now the other point that you made, and I thought you were going there, is many people who have felonies in this country, believe it or not 2 million people, lose their right to vote and participate in the political process. My state of Vermont is one of the few states that allows felons to vote. I think we should do that nationally. [applause]HAYES: It\'s been interesting to watch the \'94 crime bill being debated in this. I think in the case of Secretary Clinton, if you asked her or people said, what\'s the biggest vote she regrets, I think people would say it\'s Iraq. I think she would say that. That\'s a sort of obvious answer to that.What is your answer to that question? What is the piece of legislation in the 40 years you have done this where you think to yourself, I got that one wrong? SPEAKER: [off-mike]SANDERS: Well, you know, Chris, it\'s hard. I\'ve cast many, many thousands of votes, and there was one vote where it was almost unanimous in the House on de-regulating derivatives and so forth. I should\'ve voted the other way. I mean, like four people -- you know, I had help lead the effort against de-regulation. That was a bad vote.But I\'ll tell you something. As I look back on my voting record, you know, Secretary Clinton -- and I don\'t mean to be overly partisan here -- supported DOMA in 1996, and that is the Defense of Marriage Act, which I think she has since apologized for. It was a homophobic piece of legislation. Back then it was not easy to vote against that piece of legislation, all right. I voted against that piece of legislation. [applause]Back in the early 1990s, when all of corporate America and all Republicans and many Democrats were pushing these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA and later CAFTA and permanent noble trade relations with China, I didn\'t vote for any of them. I helped lead the opposition to them.So I\'m not saying by any means that after thousands of those I did not cast a bad vote. I did. But I will say that time and time again I took on issues and voted -- cast votes that were unpopular at the time but turned out years later -- whether it\'s the vote against the war in Iraq, the vote against trade agreements, voting against DOMA, voting against the first Gulf war. Those are votes that I cast. They were not popular votes. Those are the votes that I cast, and I\'m proud of casting those votes. [applause]HAYES: We\'ll be back with much more with Senator Sanders and live questions at the National Constitution Center in just a bit. Don\'t go anywhere. [commercial break][applause]HAYES: We\'re back at National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, site of one of tomorrow\'s five big contests in the primary, and we have a question now from (Miguel Garces), he\'s 29 years old and he is supporting Senator Sanders.QUESTION: Senator Sanders, you said that you think that the U.S. airstrikes are authorized under current law, but does that mean that the U.S. military can lawfully strike ISIS-affiliated groups in any country around the world?SANDERS: No, it does not mean that. I hope, by the way, that we will have an authorization passed by the Congress, and I am prepared to support that authorization if it is tight enough so I am satisfied that we do not get into a never-ending perpetual war in the Middle East. That I will do everything I can to avoid. [applause]But the President, no President, has the ability willy-nilly to be dropping bombs or using drones any place he wants.HAYES: The current authorization which you cite in what Miguel just quoted which is the authorization to use military force after 9/11. That has led to the kill list. This President -- literally, there is a kill list. There is a list of people that the U.S. government wants to kill, and it goes about doing it. Would you keep the kill list as President of the United States?SANDERS: Look. Terrorism is a very serious issue. There are people out there who want to kill Americans, who want to attack this country, and I think we have a lot of right to defend ourselves. I think as Miguel said, though, it has to be done in a constitutional, legal way.HAYES: Do you think what\'s being done now is constitutional and legal?SANDERS: In general I do, yes.HAYES: One more question -- the announcement today that the U.S. is going to send 250 Special Forces operators on the ground in Syria. Do you agree with that? Do you think that\'s permissible, given the fact that there has not been an authorization?SANDERS: I think the -- look. Here\'s the bottom line. ISIS has got to be destroyed, and the way that ISIS must be destroyed is not through American troops fighting on the ground. ISIS must be destroyed and King Abdullah of Jordan has made this clear, that the war is for the soul of Islam and it must be won by the Muslim nations themselves.I think what the President is talking about is having American troops training Muslim troops, helping to supply the military equipment they need, and I do support that effort. We need a broad coalition of Muslim troops on the ground. We have had some success in the last year or so putting ISIS on the defensive, we\'ve got to continue that effort.HAYES: All right, the next question comes from (Monica Hunt).QUESTION: Hello. How do you plan on protecting women\'s reproductive rights in all states?SANDERS: You got it. I do. And I\'ll tell you how. [applause]I have a 100 percent, lifetime pro-choice voting record. I believe  [applause]Not only do I vigorously oppose Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, I think we should expand funding for Planned Parenthood --- [applause]And it is no secret that in states all over this country, in a dozen different ways, there are governors and legislatures who are trying to make it impossible for a woman to control her own body.I will use the Department of Justice to go after those states in every way that I legally can. I believe that in the United States of America women have that right to control their own body, and I find that, I must say, completely hypocritical for my Republican colleagues who tell us every day how much they hate government, how they want to get government out of our life, but they think that local state and federal government have the right to tell you and every woman in America what she can do with her body.That is hypocrisy. [applause]HAYES: There\'s a very big abortion case before this eight member Court that is a challenge to the Texas law. That Texas law -- many people believe essentially it upheld death-row inmates in all but name. Meaning it wouldn\'t overturn it [crosstalk] how bid a deal is that court case to you?SANDERS: Of course it\'s a big deal. And by the way, that is why it goes without saying, that if elected President, I will appoint or nominate people to the Supreme Court who number one are prepared to overturn Citizens United, a disaster and a (poor decision) and number two, absolutely protect a woman\'s right to choose. [applause]HAYES: This has obviously been a contentious fight, on the Democratic side, although not, I think, the most contentious. There have been -- I went down in the archives to look at 2008, it got pretty ugly --SANDERS: Yeah it did.HAYES: -- and you know 1980 on the Republican side got pretty ugly and Kennedy and Carter -- there\'s a long list. One of the things that happens, sometimes in those contested intramural disputes is someone had the other person serve on their ticket or in their administration. Would you consider that in this case, either having Hillary Clinton on your ticket or being on hers?SANDERS: Well let me just answer that question in exactly the way you knew I would answer it. And that is to say right now we are running as hard as we can to win this thing, and at the end of the process we\'ll take a look at what\'s going on, but right now my job is to get as many delegates as possible and try to win the nomination for President. [applause]But you knew that that would be my answer.HAYES: Well we try.I\'ve interviewed you probably dozens of times since you started running for President, and before that. And what\'s happened in this campaign in some ways is things you\'ve been talking about haven\'t changed that much between before you were running for President and running for President. But you have found an audience for them that is bigger, I think it\'s fair to say, than when you were just a United States Senator from Vermont.You have also had to go out and politic in places where you didn\'t have to politic before. You\'re from Vermont. You\'ve been in Baltimore, you\'ve been in Philadelphia, been in Chicago. You are trying to run the Obama coalition, right? You are trying to -- you\'re running in the party of the first black president. What have you learned on this campaign about race in America, about the way this coalition operates? What have you learned -- what have you come away thinking, ""I did not know before I ran for President, this, and now I know?""SANDERS: How many hours do we have to discuss that? I mean, one of the extraordinary things about the experience of running for President is you learn just so, so much, and you meet so many extraordinary people.We have been -- I have been, obviously, to Flint, Michigan -- and let me tell you something Chris. I will never forget that experience as long as I live talking to a mother who described to me the breakdown of the cognitive capabilities of her daughter because that daughter was drinking poisoned water.And you ask yourself how that could possibly happen in the United States of America. You\'ve heard me being critical of media more times than one, but I think people in America really don\'t know, not only what\'s going on in Flint, Michigan, they don\'t know that the Detroit public school system is on the verge of a fiscal collapse. They don\'t know that in Baltimore, Maryland there are tens of thousands of heroin addicts. They don\'t know that in inner cities all over this country people are paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing, that there is not enough affordable housing. People do not really know what is going on in African-American communities where kids are suffering 40, 50, 60 percent rates of unemployment and what I have learned in this campaign, is if I get elected President we are gonna change national priorities.We\'re not just gonna rebuild communities in Iraq and Afghanistan, we\'re going to rebuild them in the United States of America. [applause]HAYES: Senator Sanders, thank you very much. Everyone here at National Constitution Center, we thank you very much, (regret to leave) all these wonderful folks.Up next don\'t go anywhere, Rachel Maddow hosts another super town hall event with Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 26, 2016","b'Interview on MSNBC\'s ""Morning Joe""'","b'BRZEZINSKI: That was Hillary Clinton at last night\'s MSNBC town hall, speaking about how in 2008 she worked hard to convince her supporters to support then Senator Barack Obama.Joining us from Philadelphia, Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Good morning. Welcome back to the show. I guess we\'ll start right there, Senator, because a lot of people, especially in the Clinton campaign say that you\'re hurting the party and you\'re hurting her chances of going into the nomination.SANDERS: I\'m hurting the party?BRZEZINSKI: Well?SANDERS: Mika there was just a study that came out from Harvard yesterday which suggests that the Sanders campaign is turning around millions of young people, getting them to be more progressive, in fact, getting them into the Democratic Party.So I don\'t think we\'re hurting the party. I think a vigorous debate on the important issues facing the American people is not only exactly what democracy is supposed to be about, at the end of the day, it creates more political interest, it drives up voter turn out, and when voter turn out is high, progressives and Democrats win elections.So, let me be very clear...BRZEZINSKI: You can\'t argue -- you...SANDERS: Let -- go ahead, I\'m sorry.BRZEZINSKI: No, it\'s all right. You can\'t argue, though, that you\'re -- I mean, if she is close to clenching this, if there is no path for you, then you\'re just hurting her as -- on the road to the nomination and she goes into it more damaged, maybe some would argue.SANDERS: Well, first of all -- first of all, I don\'t accept there is no path for us. You know, let\'s not count our chickens before they\'re hatched.There are five contests today. The state of California. Last I heard, the largest state in the United States of America has not yet cast a ballot.I think all of the people of this country have a right to participate to determine who the Democratic nominee will be and what the agenda will be. And I think it will be very healthy for democracy and the Democratic Party when we have the debate, the platform debates, the policy debates at the convention.Should the United States of America join every other major country and guarantee health care to all people through a Medicare for all program? Should we provide paid family and medical leave? Should we address the grotesque level of income inequality?Should we deal with the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country? A lot of good debates to take place.SCARBOROUGH: So...SANDERS: And if I do not win the nomination, trust me, I\'ll do everything I can to make sure that some Republican does not end up in the White House.SCARBOROUGH: But how important is it to you, win or lose, to reshape the Democratic Party as you move forward through the convention and make sure it\'s not the Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton\'s past, which we saw the New York times magazine this weekend painted her vividly as a hawk, as an interventionist.And as you have said...SANDERS: That is...SCARBOROUGH: ... as somebody who has closer ties to Wall Street than probably the two Republican candidates?SANDERS: Look, Joe, I\'m really very proud that our campaign has brought so much energy into the political process. Not just young people, but working people, and the issue you raise is a very important issue.Look, we know that sometimes our military has got to be involved in a war. But I think there are a lot of Democrats out there who are concerned that secretary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, was active in the overthrow of the Gadhafi government in Libya, and maybe a little bit too much...SCARBOROUGH: Is Hillary Clinton a hawk? Because we were talking to a New York Times reporter yesterday, and having a hard time getting her to admit what her own paper wrote over the weekend.Do you believe that Hillary Clinton is a war hawk?SANDERS: Let me just say this, my views on foreign policy are different than Secretary Clinton\'s. I helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq. I think that force, military force is the last resort not the first resort. And I think my views are a lot closer to President Obama\'s than they are to Hillary Clinton\'s.SCARBOROUGH: But do you think she\'s a hawk?BRZEZINSKI: Or hawkish.SCARBOROUGH: Is she -- is she -- is she an interventionist?SANDERS: I don\'t want to -- you know, I don\'t want to -- Joe, I don\'t want to characterize it.SCARBOROUGH: But not -- what about an interventionist? It really matters to people in the Democratic Party.SANDERS: It does matter.SCARBOROUGH: Especially after eight years of Bush and Cheney, and then the tripling of troops in Afghanistan and all the things that Hillary Clinton proposed while she was secretary of state.It does matter to a lot of Democrats on whether they\'re going to nominate someone who is an interventionist. Do you believe she\'s an interventionist?SANDERS: No, that\'s right. I think -- look, again, I don\'t want to characterize her, but I think our views on foreign policy are different.I think what we have got to understand is that there are terrible dictators all over the world, but regime change, overthrowing some dictator often has unintended consequences.Let\'s go way, way back to Guatemala, to Iran, when we overthrew a Democratically elected prime minister there.So, I am more cautious about that. And in terms, certainly, the Middle East right now with ISIS, I believe it must be Muslim troops on the ground who do the fighting with the support of the United States. I will do everything that I can to prevent our troops from getting involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.So, I think if the question is, do Secretary Clinton and I look at foreign policy in a different way? The answer is yes, we do.BARNICLE: Senator, the Harvard study that you just referenced a few moments ago, showed your tremendous popularity among millennials. You\'ve brought many millennials into the political process.But it also points out that a majority of millennials -- I\'m having trouble pronouncing the word -- reject both socialism and capitalism. They don\'t believe in socialism, they don\'t believe in capitalism. What should they believe in?SANDERS: I think they should believe, Mike, in economic justice and ending this really, really grotesque level of incumbent wealth inequity in America, where the 20 wealthiest people now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans.I\'ve been in cities from all over this country, from Flint, to Detroit, to Philadelphia where you have 40, 50 percent of the children in those cities living in poverty. So, I think that the fight for economic justice -- and I\'ll tell you what else is resonating with young people.They understand what corporate media, by the way, does not understand. That climate change is the great environmental crisis of our time, and that we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from coal and oil into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. That generation understands that.And the other thing they understand is that the younger generation today, if we do not change the economy, will, for the first time in modern history, have a lower standard of living than their parents. In other words, we\'re seeing the death of the American dream. These young people don\'t want to see that dream die.So, there are a lot of issues out there that these young people, I think, are standing up and fighting for.SCARBOROUGH: Yeah.SANDERS: But I do believe they think government should play a more important role in protecting needs of the working people, the elderly, the children, the poor than we\'re seeing now.GEIST: Senator Sanders, it\'s Willie Geist. Good to see you this morning.You said something at our town hall last night I thought was interesting.SANDERS: Hey, Willie.GEIST: You said, if she becomes the nominee, it\'s not incumbent on you to tell your voters to go vote for her, it\'s incumbent on her to convince your voters that they should vote for her.So, many of your supporters are adamantly against Hillary Clinton, adamantly for you. What could she say to a Bernie Sanders voter, theoretically, if she does get the nomination, to convince them that they ought to leave you and go vote for her?SANDERS: I think what she has to do -- what any candidate has to do to win a general election is to convince the vast majority of the people who are the working class of this country, the middle class, lower income people that she is, more than any candidate is on their side.You don\'t have to convince the billionaires. You know, they have enormous power -- all that many of them. You have got to convince ordinary people that you\'re prepared to deal with the major crises facing this country.What are those crises? We\'re looking at a disappearing middle class in this country. We\'re looking at corporations who, in a given year, may make billions of dollars in profits and not pay a nickel in taxes. We\'re looking at kids graduating college $50, $70,000 in debt, paying it off that debt for decades.The American people understand that in this great country, the rich and the billionaire class in corporate America cannot have it all.So, I think that for Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders or any other nominee, they got to go out to the American people, say yeah, I do have the guts to take on Wall Street, to end the disastrous trade policy, to take on corporate America, to say, yes, that the wealthy and powerful will start paying their fair share of taxes.GEIST: And you said, though, Senator, she has not been capable of doing that thus far, that she is in the pocket of Wall Street.So, how could she change her tone and convince your voters to go to her?SANDERS: Well, I -- well, you know, that is her job. You know, people think, you know, Bernie Sanders is going to snap his fingers and everybody who votes for him is, oh, now we\'re going to, you know, vote for Hillary Clinton. Bernie said so. That\'s not the way the real world works. And it should not work that way. I have got to -- if I win the nomination, I\'m going to have to convince Hillary Clinton supporters and Republicans and independents to vote for me. Hillary Clinton, every other candidate has the same challenge.And I happen to believe, as I just said, that the American people are tired of establishment politics. They understand that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. They understand that there\'s something profoundly wrong when we\'re the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people, or paid family and medical leave. They are tired of seeing in cities all over this country so many of our children going to totally inadequate schools and living in poverty. And I think we need leadership in this country to address those issues to understand that we have to take on the billionaire class. That\'s how you win elections, in my view.SCARBOROUGH: Senator, good morning. It\'s Mark Halperin. Every president and vice president we\'ve had in this country has been a man. If you are the nominee, would you commit to picking a woman as your running mate?SANDERS: Well, I\'m not going to commit -- you know, you have to look at the best candidates you can. But I think your point is well taken. I think the women of this country, the people of this country, understand that it would be a great idea to have a woman as vice president and something I would give very, very serious thought to.BRZEZINSKI: All right.SCARBOROUGH: Are there any women in particular you think would be qualified for that job?SANDERS: Are there any women? Yes, there are many women who would be qualified for that job.SCARBOROUGH: Could you name a couple?SANDERS: No. I think it\'s a little bit early to be speculating on that. But I think -- you know, as you know, there are people in life that -- Elizabeth Warren, I think, has been a real champion in standing up for working families, taking on Wall Street. There are other -- you know, fantastic women who have been active in all kinds of fights who I think would make great vice presidential candidates.SCARBOROUGH: All right.BRZEZINSKI: All right. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you very much.SCARBOROUGH: Thank you, Bernie. We always love having you on.BRZEZINSKI: And tomorrow on ""Morning Joe""...SANDERS: Thank you very much.BRZEZINSKI: Good luck tonight.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"April 27, 2016",b'Interview with Chris Jansing of NBC News',"b""JANSING: You just said that you're in this campaign to win. SANDERS: Right.JANSING: Do you see a viable path? SANDERS: Look, we are clearly the underdog. I'm very good at arithmetic. I think Secretary Clinton is 300-plus delegates ahead of us and we're going to have to do very well here in Indiana, we're going to have to do well in California, our largest state, and other states. And the other thing that we're going to have to do is make the case to the super delegates, many hundreds of whom came onboard Secretary Clinton before I even announced. You know, they were with her way back when. And make the case to them that what is most important is that a Republican not gain control over the White House. And I think in any objective assessment of political reality Bernie Sanders is a much stronger candidate against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton. And that's just not me talking, I mean, that's poll after poll, state polls, national polls. And the reason for that is we are appealing to independents and some Republicans, interestingly enough, who are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics who would prefer a Bernie Sanders than a Hillary Clinton. JANSING: Some supporters are saying she has 3 million more votes. SANDERS: In the Democratic primary, sure. I understand that. But look at (AUDIO GAP) where many of - I'll give you an example, just yesterday there were five primaries. We did badly in three, we did okay in Connecticut, we won in Rhode Island. The one state that we won was an open primary. Well you know what, the general election is open. If you're an independent, you can vote for a Democrat, you can vote for a Republican. We are winning in the Democratic primary and caucus process independents, I think, roughly two to one compared to Hillary Clinton. So, it's not me. Every poll that's out there, national and statewide, shows Bernie Sanders defeating Trump by a significantly larger margin in many cases than is Hillary Clinton. JANSING: But of course the nominee is elected by delegates. SANDERS: Yes.JANSING: You are far behind. The lead seems almost I insurmountable. Do you believe if you're not the nominee that you and your voters are owed something at the convention? SANDERS: [inaudible] of owed something at the convention, if - if I am not the nominee, and we're going to fight for every last vote and we hope to become the nominee, we have run this campaign on a set of principles, and the principles are that we have to take on the billionaire class whose greed and recklessness are doing terrible damage to working families all over this country. We need to join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee health care to all people as a right, have paid family and medical leave, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and make public colleges and universities tuition free among many other issues. JANSING: So, how much influence...SANDERS: To my mindJANSING: ... should you have on the platform? SANDERS: Well, it depends, obviously, if we have a majority of delegates that will be the platform. If we do not have a majority of delegates, I would think that any smart presidential candidate will say millions of people are supporting Bernie Sanders, they want an agenda that goes beyond establishment economics and establishment politics, and I'm smart, I'm going to listen to those people and, in fact, create a progressive agenda, not just to appease Bernie Sanders and his supporters, but to winning this election because it is far more important to speak to the middle class and working class of this country than just the billionaire campaign contributors. JANSING: Do you believe Hillary Clinton is smart? SANDERS: Oh, god yes, she is very smart. JANSING: Let me ask you about something Donald Trump said today, because he looks more and more...SANDERS: Oh, what was it Donald Trump - now the media's - the media - major function of media is to follow the Donald Trump quote of the day. JANSING: But more and more...SANDERS: My eating habits.JANSING: More and more it does look like he's going to be the nominee...SANDERS: Yes.JANSING: ... on the Republican side, so either you or Hillary Clinton is going to have to run against him. SANDERS: Yes, it would be my pleasure. JANSING: He said he would look to your speeches for very good material against Hillary Clinton, starting with she has bad judgment. SANDERS: Well look, the Republican party will have dozens of oppositional researchers. They don't need my speeches to talk about Hillary Clinton. They will go after Hillary Clinton, by the way, in ways that I have never, ever gone after Hillary Clinton. I mean, things like the Clinton Foundation, or things like the e-mail situation. I don't talk about that. I have never talked about it one word on this campaign. I suspect very much that Donald Trump and the Republican party will go after her in many, many ways that we have not. JANSING: But if he says she has bad judgment, you wouldn't disagree? SANDERS: It depends -- well, I think Donald Trump's not - not that Donald Trump has bad judgment, I don't think Donald Trump has any judgment whatsoever. When you have a candidate like Donald Trump who every single day is attacking a different group of people, whether they're Mexicans, or Muslims, or veterans, or women or African-Americans, this is a man without any judgment, without the demeanor, and I -- I think the vast majority of the American people, no matter what their political views are, do not believe that Donald Trump has the demeanor or the judgment to become president of the United States. JANSING: You suggested he's...SANDERS: That's why he's way behind.JANSING: You suggested he's dangerous and if he is the likely - if he is the nominee, he is the likely nominee, does your continuing criticism of Hillary Clinton, if she's the nominee, hurt the Democrats' chances of pushing forward your agenda of winning the White House? SANDERS: Look, this is media stuff, this is media stuff, okay? And I think this is what media focuses on. JANSING: You don't think you're hurting her with criticism? SANDERS: Of course I'm not hurting - Well, first of all, I am running for office. She went around today, I think yesterday, today, here in Indiana suggesting that Bernie Sanders voted against the automobile bailout, happens not to be true. She has talked about me wanting to dismember healthcare programs in America when I believe in universal healthcare, that I have attacked Planned Parenthood when I want to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. That's what happens in a campaign. People exaggerate and they make charges. We have tried to run an issue-oriented campaign. Why am I running for president? Not for the fun of it, you know? I'm running because I think it is too late for establishment politics and because I have strong differences of opinion with Hillary Clinton, no great secret. Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq. She acknowledges that that was a mistake. I helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq, voted against the war.I have voted against every one of these disastrous trade agreements which have resulted in millions of Americans losing their jobs. She has supported virtually all of them. I want to end fracking in this country, as Secretary of State she supported fracking. All right, I've compared...JANSING: And you don't think those criticisms hurt her? I mean, you intend them to hurt her.SANDERS: This is - this is called a democracy. Why am I running for president? What should I do? I should be talking about what I believe and the differences of opinion that I have with Hillary Clinton. Now, if the question is, are my views much closer to Hillary Clinton's than they are to somebody like Donald Trump, of course they are. Donald Trump would be a disaster.JANSING: Now, does that mean at some point...SANDERS: But look...JANSING: Does that mean at some point that the two of you...SANDERS: ... this is media - this is not...JANSING: No, no, no, but it will - at some point, will the two of you get in a room, whoever the nominee is, do you think...SANDERS: Well...JANSING: ... and whatever the differences were...SANDERS: This is what I believe...JANSING: ... and criticisms were...SANDERS: This is what I believe...JANSING: ... you will work that through.SANDERS: Hillary Clinton and I, now, you have to separate the real world from media world.JANSING: Sure.SANDERS: All right, media world worries about these things, real world does not. Real world worries about how their kids are going to go to college, real world worries about climate change, real world worries about 47 million people living in poverty. That's not media world. Media world does gotcha type questions.Now, I will do everything that I can, and I think Hillary Clinton and I agree on this, that we will do everything we can to make sure that a Republican does not win the White House, and I will knock my brains out, I will work seven days a week to make sure that that does not happen if I am the nominee and if I am not the nominee. That's what I will do.JANSING: You and I in Indiana just shot some hoops. You were better at it, I think.SANDERS: Well, I'm a little bit taller than you.JANSING: All right, thank you. That's kind of you. You're a little better. So, if you were a betting man, if you were going down to the betting parlor, what are the chances Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee?SANDERS: Well you know, politics is very strange and funny things happen, and especially this political year. It's been a pretty strange year I think it's fair to say. So, if the question is, do I consider myself the underdog, you know, when we began we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton, we have closed that gap very significantly. We have now won 17 states, think we're going to win here in Indiana. We are the underdog, but I think there is a narrow path to victory and we're going to fight for every vote that we can get to make that victory happen.JANSING: Senator, thank you.SANDERS: All right."""
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 5, 2016",b'Interview with Steve Inskeep of National Public Radio',"b'INSKEEP: How is West Virginia different, if at all, from anywhere else you campaigned? SANDERS: Well, West Virginia has some pockets of the worst poverty in the United States of America. We\'re going to McDowell County. And the reason we\'re going there is that about half the people in that area are living in poverty  and that what is really astounding is that the life expectancy of people in that community is extraordinary low. You know when we talk about poverty, Steve, we often think, well, it\'s too bad somebody can\'t afford a flat-screen TV, or go out to eat. But what poverty is really about is that we have millions of people who are living  who are dying at ages much, much younger than they should. In McDowell County, where we\'re going tomorrow, the average life expectancy for men in that county is 64 years of age. Sixty-four years of age. And yet you go a six-hour drive to Fairfax County, Va.  six-hour drive  a man can expect to live until the age of 82 years of age, 18 years longer than men in McDowell County... INSKEEP: These are really compelling statistics, Senator. And you mention McDowell County  I believe the poverty rate there is something like 35 percent, and of course... SANDERS: ... I think it\'s even higher than that actually. INSKEEP: ... a lot of people are certainly close to that. But there\'s another statistic that\'s on my mind, along with the poverty stats, and the life expectancy  shocking life-expectancy stats. You\'re going to a couple of counties  McDowell County, W.Va., is one of them  that voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and then voted against him, for Mitt Romney, in 2012. What has been happening to the Democratic Party in the region where you\'re going?  SANDERS: Well, that\'s an excellent question, and I think it goes well beyond McDowell County and well beyond West Virginia. And I think there are many people around this country  poor people, working people  who believe that the Democratic Party is not effectively standing up to them. Now, if I lived in McDowell County and the unemployment rate was sky-high, and I saw my kid get addicted to opiates and go to jail, there were no jobs, you know what? I would be looking at Washington and saying ""what are you guys doing for me?"" And I\'m going to look for an alternative. I think one of the challenges we face, what my campaign is about, is making it clear that the Democratic Party must be on the side of working people and low-income people. Now I\'m talking about poverty, and in this campaign I\'m talking about the fact that we have the highest rate childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That we have 47 million people living in poverty ... that we have 29 million people who have no health insurance, and we have thousands of people who die every year because they don\'t get to a doctor on time. The Democratic Party must make a stand, and the stand is that you cannot be on the side of Wall Street. You cannot be on the side of that pharmaceutical industry  which, by the way, charges our people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  you gotta make a stand. And the stand we gotta make is the stand with the people in McDowell County, W.Va., and poor people and working people all over this country. INSKEEP: It\'s interesting  when you travel in that region, as we did just a few weeks ago, for Morning Edition here  you\'re in coal country, you hear people bring up Hillary Clinton in a specific way. She was criticized for saying that ""we\'re going to make coal jobs go away,"" even though she was going on to say, ""and we want to help people who lose their jobs."" But she was criticized for that one part of the statement. Would you be any better from the perspective... SANDERS: Yeah I would... INSKEEP: ... of people in Appalachia who are concerned about that history? SANDERS: Look, I have spent my whole life fighting for working people. I have a 98 percent voting record with the AFL-CIO. I have opposed disastrous trade agreements  and I think there is perhaps no candidate in the United States Senate who has a more progressive record than I do. But I also believe, and understand, as a member of the Senate Environmental Committee, that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing severe problems in our country and around the world. And we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now, I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation ever introduced in the U.S. Senate. And in that legislation  because we understand it is not the fault of the coal miners, or people included in the fossil fuel industry, they have a right to want to feed their families, and live in dignity  we have $41 billion in that legislation to make sure that those workers who might be displaced as a result of the transition away from fossil fuel get the extended unemployment benefits they need, get the education they need, get the job training that they need. And also we are going to invest heavily in those communities. INSKEEP: How do you speak to people in a community like that, who have deeply mixed feelings about government? You may run into the same person who says ""I\'m on Medicaid, I get various kinds of assistance, but I really don\'t like it. I don\'t like living like this, I don\'t like depending on government."" SANDERS: Well, I think it raises a fundamental issue about politics in America today and who we are as a civilized society. I understand that the right-wing has done a very good job in suggesting that ""freedom""  and this is the Koch brothers\' line  ""freedom"" is about ending social security ,and Medicare and Medicaid, and actually abolishing the concept on the minimum wage. So Steve, you can be a free guy and work for $4 an hour  aren\'t you a lucky guy? But you know what, most Americans don\'t believe that, and one of the things I\'m really proud of in this campaign is that in election after election  in primary and caucus after caucus, right here in Indiana where we won last night two-thirds of the people 45 years of age or younger. ... And the reason I think is they understand that in a democratic, civilized society, government has a very important role to play. And the word has gotta get out  it doesn\'t get out all that often in the media  that the United States is the only major country on Earth, for example, that doesn\'t guarantee health care for all people. Life would be a lot different in McDowell County if all of the people there, and all of the people in Vermont, and all of the people in Connecticut, had health care as a right, which is the case 50 miles north of where I live, in Canada, for example. INSKEEP: What do you say then, to people who just say  ""regardless of my own situation, it bothers me that government has to do so much for people, or is doing so much""? SANDERS: I think that that is mythology that has been effectively perpetrated by the big-money interests in this country. To say that every other country in the world guarantees health care to all of their people, every other country has paid medical and family leave, a number of countries provide free tuition in public colleges and universities, most countries take care of their elderly and their children a lot better than we do... I think what you have seen in the last many years in this country is a very coordinated effort of the part of corporate media, and the wealthiest people in this country, to perpetuate an ideology, which says that government is terrible, government is awful  oh by the way, except when we can get some corporate welfare. I point out in all of my speeches, Steve, that Walmart  which is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in this country, worth some $149 billion  they get a huge subsidy from the taxpayers of this country, from you, from me, from every working people, person, because the wages they pay their employees are so low that many of those workers have to go on Medicaid or food stamps in order to survive. I don\'t think the middle class of this country should be subsidizing the wealthiest family in the United States of America. So I guess if it\'s OK for the Walton family to get billions of dollars of support from the taxpayers of this country, maybe its OK for working families to get health care and paid family medical leave. INSKEEP: Senator, I put a call out on Twitter  I said ""I\'m talking to Bernie Sanders, you got anything you want to know"" and the most consistent theme in the many responses we got had to do with how long you\'re going to stay in this race. Even though you just won Indiana, people are looking at the delegate counts, recognizing that you\'ve got long odds, and wondering if you\'re going to stay in too long. SANDERS: Well we\'re going to stay in till the last vote is counted, and that will be in the primary in Washington, D.C. INSKEEP: June 14. SANDERS: That\'s right. We think that ... I don\'t know, maybe I\'m old-fashioned, but I think that the people of every state in this country  including the largest state in America, California  should have a right to cast their votes as to who they want to see as president of the United States, and what kind of agenda they want the Democratic Party to have. We won last night in Indiana  that is our 18th state. We\'re going to fight in West Virginia  I think we\'ve got a shot to win there. We\'ve got a good shot to win in Oregon, and I think we\'ve got a good shot to win in California and some other states, so we are in this race till the last vote is cast. INSKEEP: Let me ask a couple of specific questions  just people on Twitter  here\'s one. Are you threatening your revolution by continuing, and alienating some Democrats from voting for Hillary Clinton eventually? SANDERS: Well I think we are perpetuating the political revolution by significantly increasing the level of political activity that we\'re seeing in this country. Millions of people are now coming into the political process as the result of what our campaign is about. I think it is good for the Unites States of America, good for the Democratic Party, to have a vigorous debate, to engage people in the political process. You know, two years ago in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn\'t even bother to vote, and 80 percent of young people and 80 percent low-income people didn\'t bother to vote in the midterm elections  I think that that is pretty pathetic. And I think that Democrats do well when the voter turnout is high. Republicans lose when the voter turnout is high.So I\'m going to do everything I can to stimulate political discourse in this country  get young people, working people involved in the political process. We think we have a path towards victory  admittedly it is a narrow path, but when I started this campaign we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton; yesterday here in early May we won in Indiana. I think we\'ve got some more good victories coming  so we are in this race until the very last vote is cast. INSKEEP: Another variation on this question from Twitter: Which is more important, a Sanders presidency or a Democratic presidency? SANDERS: Well, I think that if you look at the issues facing this country, and the differences between Secretary Clinton and myself, I think, a) my policies and my agenda will be better for the working families of this country, and second of all, if you look at virtually every poll that\'s out there  including one from CNN today  Bernie Sanders does better against Donald Trump than does Hillary Clinton. So if we want to make sure that we do not have a Donald Trump in the White House, I think that at this point Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate. INSKEEP: Do you mean a Sanders presidency is more important than this person\'s suggestion that a Democratic presidency might be more important? SANDERS: Well, what I\'m just suggesting is  if you look at every poll that\'s out there  Bernie Sanders does better against Donald Trump, more likely to defeat Donald Trump, than Hillary Clinton. INSKEEP: One more question along those lines, and this is my question now  you told Chuck Todd of NBC the other day that if Secretary Clinton does clinch the nomination quote ""the responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton, to convince all people,"" not just your supporters, ""that she is the kind of president this country needs."" Are you convinced, Senator? SANDERS: Well I thought my point was, that it\'s true of Secretary Clinton, it\'s true of Bernie Sanders, it is true of Donald Trump  you want to go out and win elections, you\'ve got to convince the people of this country that you are the candidate that works best for their interests. And I think there\'s a lot of work that has to be done on the part of all of the candidates. INSKEEP: The reason I ask is because you did say earlier in the campaign she was not qualified. Can you convince yourself, or have you convinced yourself, that she is qualified? SANDERS: Right now  as I have said many times, Steve  I think that a Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster for this country. And I intend to do everything that I can to see that that does not happen. INSKEEP: Does that mean to say that you would be out this fall if you don\'t win the nomination, campaigning? SANDERS: You know, as I just said Steve, I think that a Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster for this country. I am the most progressive member of the Unites States Senate, I think. I have fought as hard as I can for working people, and I\'m not going to see a president come into office like a Donald Trump, who is busy dividing us up in terms of picking on Mexicans, and Latinos, and Muslims, and women, and veterans, and African-Americans. That is not the type of president that we need, and that is not the type of president that I  I will do everything in my power to make sure that he does not become our president, So, Steve, so  thank you so much... INSKEEP: Senator? Do you mind if I ask one more question? SANDERS: One last question. Sure, we got time for one more. INSKEEP: Yeah just, talk me through  because you said you have tough path, but one that you can walk  I\'m just interested about a little bit of the mechanics here. You\'d have to win a lot of delegates  a great majority of delegates along the way to get a majority of pledged delegates. There are some big states ahead  it\'s certainly true  but just the way delegates are awarded, even if you win California, even if you win West Virginia, you don\'t get all of the delegates. They\'re not winner-take-all. Doesn\'t that make this extraordinarily difficult for you to... SANDERS: Yes, it\'s an uphill battle. But you know what? Steve, when I started this campaign, it was an extraordinarily uphill battle  we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton. Polls out there in the last few weeks, a few had us ahead actually in national polls, or a few points behind. The path to victory is to do extremely well in the remaining states  and as you indicate, California, of course, is the largest state. And we hope to do well there, and win that state. INSKEEP: Could  and is... SANDERS: But here is the other path, Steve  you asked me a question, let me give you an answer here  is that we have won a number of states, in Washington and New Hampshire, by landslide victories, and I\'m talking about 65, 70, 75 percent of the vote. I think it is incumbent on the superdelegates The problem, one of the main problems that we have, is that the establishment Democrats, of course, supporting all of  virtually all of them are supporting Hillary Clinton. I think that in those states where we have won landslide victories, those delegates should reflect the wishes of the people of their state and give us their votes. And then I think we have got to make the case to the superdelegates, who in many cases, were on board for Hillary Clinton even before I got into the race, that they should take a hard look at which candidate is stronger against Donald Trump. And I think we can make that case. INSKEEP: Let me follow up on that... SANDERS: Steve I apologize  one more question, because I\'ve gotta run here. INSKEEP: Is there a real danger that Donald Trump  now that he\'s the presumptive Republican nominee  that he\'s the kind of different candidate who might seriously appeal to the very kinds of voters that you\'ve been appealing to all this time, that you want to bring back to the Democratic Party? SANDERS: Is that a serious  you mean... INSKEEP: A real danger of that, yeah, in the fall? SANDERS: You say a risk? Well, you know as I said a moment ago  what campaigns are about is going out and making a case to the American people. Does Donald Trump have support in this country? Of course he has support  he has won the Republican nomination, so of course he has a lot of support. He has won it overwhelmingly in state after state after state. INSKEEP: Can he drag Democrats over to the Republican side? SANDERS: Well the question, I think that\'s the wrong question, Steve. The question is, why is somebody with Donald Trump\'s perspective appealing to Democrats? That gets back to the question we talked about at the beginning of this conversation. Has the Democratic Party, has the leadership made the case that they are standing there, fighting for the poor people of McDowell County, or the working people of Indiana, or of New Mexico, or of California? Have they stood up and said that ""maybe we gotta take on the billionaire class, maybe it\'s wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, maybe we should not be getting significant sums of money from Wall Street or from the pharmaceutical industry that charge us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,"" you know, ""maybe we\'ve gotta stand with the people who for the last 20 or 30 years have seen a decline in their standard of living""? You know, those are the issues that the Democratic Party has got to ask itself. And I think when it does, and it makes it clear that they are prepared to take on the big-money interests, I think the Democratic Party will do just fine  and that\'s kind of what this campaign is about. INSKEEP: Sen. Sanders, thanks very much SANDERS: Thank you very much Steve. Take care.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 6, 2016",b'Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN',"b'BLITZER: And joining me now, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate.Senator Sanders, thanks very much for joining us.SANDERS: My pleasure.BLITZER: Donald Trump locked up the presidential nomination. He is focusing in on a general election. Here is the question, are you willing to continue to fight Hillary Clinton even if it creates the real possibility that you\'re going to weaken her potentially in a general election?SANDERS: Well, Wolf, I know what you really mean by that question, and that is, am I going to continue in the next nine primaries and caucuses to make sure that I can get every vote that I can? And by the way, we think we can win a good majority of those caucuses.Do I think that every American in this country, including in the largest state of California, have a right to cast their vote for who they want to be the next president of the United States and what they want the agenda of the Democratic Party to be? Of course I do. We\'re going to be in this until the last ballot is cast.BLITZER: So far, though, what, she has 3 million more votes than you\'ve had in all the contests today, 300 more pledged delegates. And she also has 513 so-called super delegates to your 41 super delegates.What are you going to say to the super delegates to try to get them to change their minds?SANDERS: Well, first of all, Wolf, we have now won 18 states. And I think by the end of the process, you know, who can predict tomorrow, but I think we\'ve got the shot to win at least half or maybe even a majority of the overall states, maybe 25 or more states.Second of all, in terms of super delegates, this is what I will say -- many super delegates, some 450 of them declared for Hillary Clinton before I even got into the race, before the first ballot was cast. And if you look at national polls today, if you look at state polls, in almost every instance, Bernie Sanders is the stronger candidate against Donald Trump because not only do we get almost all the Democratic votes, we got a lot of the independent votes which is what you\'re going to need it win in November.So I would say to those super delegates, look, what is most important is we defeat Donald Trump. I believe that I am the strongest candidate against him.BLITZER: If she were to get the nomination, would you consider being her vice presidential running mate?SANDERS: Well, right now, we are focused in the next five weeks of winning the Democratic nomination. If that does not happen, we\'re going to fight as hard as we can on the floor of the Democratic convention to make sure that we have a progressive platform that American people will support. And then after that, certainly, Secretary Clinton and I can sit down and talk and see where we good from there.BLITZER: I guess an alternative question would be, if she came to you now or relatively soon approached you and offered you the vice presidential running mate slot, would you drop out?SANDERS: I think that that is a hypothetical that will not happen and once again, there are nine states left. We think we have a good shot to winning West Virginia on Tuesday. Kentucky and Oregon the next week. And we think we can win in California.So, we\'re going it fight for every remaining vote in the next nine states. That\'s where we\'re at right now.BLITZER: Paul Begala, who you know, he\'s a CNN contributor. He advises a super PAC that supports Hillary Clinton. He wrote an op-ed piece where he said you should stay in the race. He said that. But also said you should focus all of your fire on Donald Trump and not Hillary Clinton. Are you ready to focus entirely right now in coming weeks on Donald Trump?SANDERS: Well, I like Paul very, very much. Very smart guy.But I think what the American people want, what is good for American democracy, what is good for the Democratic Party, is a vigorous debate on the real issues facing the American people. At the end of the day, if you engage people in that debate, no matter who they end up voting for, likelihood is they will have a higher voter turnout in November and higher voter turnout in November works for Democrats, because when a lot of people come out, progressives and Democrats win, when people are demoralized and we have a low voter turnout as we did in 2014 that\'s when Republicans win. So, I will continue to run and issue the campaign. Will I be taken on Donald Trump? Absolutely. Will I be discussing the very important differences of opinion that Secretary Clinton and I have? Yes, I will.BLITZER: Donald Trump recently started using some of your own public critiques of Hillary Clinton regarding her judgment. He tweeted this. He said, ""Crooked Hillary has zero leadership ability as Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment, constantly playing the women\'s card. It is sad.""Does that worry you that Trump is using your words against Hillary Clinton?SANDERS: Trump, I have never -- you read that tweet. That is nothing that I have ever said about Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton and I disagree on many issues.I think her judgment on the war on Iraq was bad. I think her judgment in trade policies where she supported, virtually every one of these disastrous trade policies was bad. I think the fact that she supports $12 minimum wage when clearly we need $15 an hour minimum wage, I think that\'s bad. I think her creating super PACs and raising money from Wall Street and other special interests, not a great idea.But I\'ve never used the phraseology that Trump is. Look, Trump is in his own world. Obviously he wants to do whatever he can to cause divisions within the Democratic process. But what he just put in his tweet is something that I have never said, never will say.BLITZER: Well, you did say she had bad judgment. Right? Are you denying that?SANDERS: That\'s right. Of course, she had bad judgment. Of course. She voted for the war in Iraq.BLITZER: But you never spoke about -- [crosstalk]SANDERS: That\'s bad judgment. No, that is nothing I ever talked about.Clearly, women -- we are reaching out to women as strongly as we can. Donald Trump also says he will go after your supporters. He thinks your supporters will come to him because he says the Democrats are unfair to you, that the Democratic system is rigged against you.BLITZER: Do you agree with him?SANDERS: Well, I know that Donald Trump is staying up nights worrying about Bernie Sanders. I mean, I know this is just coming from his heart and I know that he doesn\'t have any ulterior motive in saying those kinds of things.But let me just give Donald Trump some bad news. And that is, number one, if I am the Democratic nominee, I\'m going to defeat him and defeat him by a very large margin. If I am not the Democratic nominee, I\'m going to do everything that I can to see that he does not get into the White House.BLITZER: You just wrote a letter to the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, expressing some of your concerns about the make-up of some of the Democratic convention committee. Let me read a couple lines from it.This is what you wrote: ""As it stands now, chairs of the rules committee and platform committee are active supporters of Secretary Clinton\'s campaign. But even more than that, they both are aggressive attack surrogates on the campaign trail. I do not, and millions supporting the campaign will not, have any confidence that any of them have they can conduct committee proceedings in an even-handed manner.""Are you suggesting the DNC is stacking the cards against you?SANDERS: Of course. What can I say? You got to chairmen there who\'ve been very vigorous in attacking me. But more importantly, of the 40 people that Wasserman Schultz has appointed to the major committees, we have three out of 40 despite the fact that as of today, we have 45 percent of the pledged delegates.So, all that that letter says is, look, the American people are very suspicious of the establishment, the political establishment. Do not create a convention situation where our people do not get fair representation.Now, right now, we\'re at 45 percent. I think by the time this process is over. Frankly, I hope to be at 50 percent, but if we\'re at 47, 48 percent, that\'s the kind of representation we want on the committees. That is not an unfair request. That is kind of a -- you know, realistic reasonable request. But if she is giving us three delegates out of 40, and have major chairman, who are going to actively and aggressively campaigning against me, that is not acceptable.BLITZER: Senator Bernie Sanders, thanks so much for joining us.SANDERS: Thank you, Wolf.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 11, 2016",b'Interview with Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC',"b'MITCHELL: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joining me now. Senator, good to see you. First, congratulations on West Virginia. SANDIERS: Thank you very much. MITCHELL: But at the same time, you come out of there, at least now by our count, with a 17-17 delegate divide. So you win big but you still don\'t catch up. You don\'t close that gap. What\'s the path moving forward? SANDERS: You know, Andrea, it -- it is interesting and you raise a good point. Hillary Clinton got I think 35 percent, 36 percent of the vote, popular vote yesterday, and yet she gets six out of seven of the superdelegates. And that\'s what we\'ve been seeing all over this country. In many cases, we win landslide victories, 65 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent of the vote, and she gets the superdelegates. I think the people of many of those states are going to be saying to those superdelegates, hey, you know what? Why don\'t you reflect the views of the people in the state who voted for Bernie Sanders? And that\'s one of the areas that we\'re going to be focusing on in the coming weeks.MITCHELL: Well, certainly that sounds like one of the areas you\'re going to be focusing on in terms of trying to get reform, commitments from her, from her team at the convention or before, that the process is going to change. SANDERS: Well, no, what we\'re going to be focusing on in the next month is winning the Democratic nomination. Right now, Andrea, we have about 45.5 percent of the pledged delegates. That is the real delegates who are voted on by the people. There are eight primaries and caucuses remaining. We think many of the states in front of us are sympathetic to a progression mission -- message of standing up for the working class and the middle class against Wall Street and the billionaire class. We think we\'re going to do very, very well. And if we do extremely well -- and I know it\'s a steep climb but we have been fighting an uphill battle from day one -- but if we do very, very well, we still have the possibility of coming in with the majority of pledged delegates. MITCHELL: Who is in charge and how are you working this attempt to get the superdelegates, to recruit them, to switch them over? Are you making calls yourself, for instance? Do you have an operation? Tell us what\'s going on. SANDERS: Well, we are going to have a very strong operation and the point that we\'re going to make to the superdelegates is a very simple one. Over 400 superdelegates came on board Secretary Clinton\'s campaign before anybody else was in the race. Before anybody else was running. That\'s pretty crazy. And that talks about the weakness of this whole superdelegate system. No. 2, the point that we\'re going to make loud and clear is that in virtually every national poll that\'s been out there in the last month or six weeks, and in almost state poll, Bernie Sanders runs stronger against Donald Trump than does Hillary Clinton. And I think what every delegate to the Democratic National Convention wants, most importantly, is to defeat Donald Trump. The case we\'ll make is that I am the stronger candidate. And it\'s not only polling. Polling goes up and down. It is the fact that our campaign is the campaign bringing in working class people, bringing in young people, people who are sick and tired of establishment politics, establishment commitments, establishment media. People in this country are hurting. They want real change. We are the campaign of that change. MITCHELL: Well, Senator Sanders, flying in the face of that is the exit poll data from West Virginia that shows that 34 percent, 34 percent of the Sanders voters said that they would vote for Donald Trump in a Trump/Sanders match-up. SANDERS: Well, that is what some of those people are saying today. MITCHELL: A third of them. SANDERS: The general election, as you know, is in November. I think in a race with Donald Trump, Andrea, not only do I think we would win that race, I think we would win it overwhelmingly. Because I think the people of America, the more they see Mr. Trump, understand that he\'s a total phony, that what he said yesterday is not what he\'s going to say tomorrow. That he is a pathological liar and that he gets a lot of media attention for attacking people but that is going to wear thin. The American people understand there\'s something wrong when they are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all new income and wealth goes to the 1 percent. They understand there\'s something wrong when we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people or paid family and medical leave. Bottom line is, the American people are not going to go to an establishment billionaire who changes his mind every day. They want I think a president who has a life history of fighting for working people and prepared to take on big money interests. MITCHELL: But isn\'t the bottom line about you versus Hillary Clinton and who would be the stronger candidate, that she is now fighting a war on two fronts? She\'s getting beaten up by Donald Trump on a daily basis. Aside him from calling you Crazy Bernie in his tweet, he has been embracing you. He is building you up. He likes the fact that you\'re taking her down. So she\'s fighting Donald Trump. She\'s fighting Bernie Sanders. SANDERS: One -- one second. One second. One second..MITCHELL: And that\'s depressing her overall --SANDERS: Andrea, no, I don\'t accept -- Andrea, I don\'t accept that proposition. Last I heard, Hillary Clinton is running for President of the United States. I am running for president of the United States. Trump is running for President of the United States. And what a candidate does is make his or her best case to the American people. I have gotten attacked and attacked and attacked. My record has been misinterpreted and lied about. The issue of this campaign is to go out to the American people and talk about why the American people are working, are struggling. Hillary Clinton has got to make that case. Trump has got to make that case. Sanders has got to make that case. And that\'s what we intend to do.MITCHELL: I\'m just saying that --SANDERS: And I know -- yes, I\'m sorry.MITCHELL: I\'m just saying that -- sir, I\'m just saying that Hillary Clinton\'s - the opposition to her, the negatives against her, have been built up by Donald Trump just hammering away at her. And up until now at least he has not been going after you as much. She\'s fighting two candidates and you\'re fighting one. SANDERS: Andrea, Andrea -- oh really. Oh, really? Hah. Andrea, in every state that we have one, in 19 states, we have had to take on the entire Democratic establishment. We\'ve had to take on senators and governors and mayors and members of Congress. That\'s what we have taken on, so please do not moan to me about Hillary Clinton\'s problems. I\'m in this race to win. We\'re taking on the Democratic establishment. We are standing up for working people and we have a shot. It is a steep hill to climb, but we\'re going to fight for every last vote that we can get, every delegate that we can get. And that\'s what I intend to do in the next month, five weeks.MITCHELL: Well, I don\'t think I was moaning about Hillary Clinton\'s problems. But just to point out, let me play a little bit of Donald Trump on ""Morning Joe"" and ask you to react. [begin video clip]DONALD TRUMP: Well, Bernie Sanders has a message that\'s interesting. I\'m going to be taking a lot of the things that Bernie said and using them. He said some things about her that are actually surprising, you know, that essentially she has no right to even be running and that she\'s bad judgment. When he said bad judgment, I said, ""Sound bite!""[end video clip]MITCHELL: So if you do -- SANDERS: If Donald Trump --MITCHELL: I\'m just saying, if you do lose, then are you giving him the weapons against her? SANDERS: Well, if Donald Trump wants to take my ideas and fight for a single payer national health care program or wants to fight to make sure that the wealthiest people in this country, like Donald Trump, start paying their fair share of taxes, wants to make sure that we have paid family and medical leave, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure -- if that\'s what Donald Trump is supporting, I think that\'s a good thing. And I hope Hillary Clinton does that as well. But, frankly, because that is not what Donald Trump will be saying. Point is, when you run for President of the United States you got to make your case to the American people. And in fact, as you well know, there are many areas that I could have attacked Hillary Clinton on that I have chosen not to attack her on. What I have done is run an issue-oriented campaign. That is what the American people want. And, by the way, when you have a real debate about real issues, when you get more and more people involved in the political process, it results in a higher voter turnout. Democrats will win in November, whether it\'s Clinton or myself as the candidate, when there is a high voter turnout. Republicans win when there is a lower voter turnout. I think a vigorous debate, an honest debate about the real issues facing the American people, will result in a higher voter turnout, which is good for Democrats. MITCHELL: Speaking of real issues, Donald Trump went after Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton repeatedly over the weekend, dredging up all sorts of personal attacks. I wanted to play a little bit of that for you and ask your reaction. [begin video clip]TRUMP: She\'s married to a man who hurt many women. And Hillary, if you look and you study, Hillary hurt many women, the women that he abused. Do you remember the famous ""I did not have sex with that woman"" and then a couple months later, ""I\'m guilty."" And she\'s taking negative ads on me.[end video clip]MITCHELL: He\'s called her an enabler. Do you agree with that? SANDERS: Look, the media loves that kind of stuff and that\'s why Trump is doing so well. That is the kind of ugly stuff that I do not go near. No, I debate Hillary Clinton on the important issues facing working people. The media loves every ridiculous remark that Donald Trump makes. But we are going to stay focused on the issues. And the issues are a growing gap between the very rich and everybody else, and that we have a government and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables the wealthy and the powerful to control legislation and economic decisions in this country. I want a government that represents all of us, not just the 1 percent.Those are the issues that I talk about, not Bill Clinton\'s personal life, not Hillary Clinton\'s emails, not the Clinton Foundation. That is what Trump will talk about; that\'s what the media will talk about. I will focus on the issues facing working families in this country and I hope the media will allow that discussion to take place. MITCHELL: And as you say, it\'s a hard climb to narrow this gap. But -- and if you don\'t, will you feel that the revolution has succeeded if she has moved to your positions on a lot of these issues and if you open up the democratic process and have fewer primaries like the closed primary in New York that you\'ve complained so much about? SANDERS: Well, Andrea, our focus right now is on winning Democratic nomination. But this is what I want to say, whether I win or whether I don\'t. The Democratic Party has got to note that we have won in virtually every contested contest out there. We have won a strong majority of people 45 years of age or younger. The ideas that I am bringing forth in this campaign are in fact the future of America and the future of the Democratic Party. And the Democratic Party is going to have to open their doors very, very wide to millions of working class people and young people tired of establishment politics, who want real change in this country. Don\'t want a party dependent on Wall Street; they want a party that is going to stand up and fight against Wall Street. That is what the Democratic Party has got to do. If I am elected president, that is certainly what the Democratic Party will do. But I hope it happens in any case.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us today. SANDERS: Thank you, Andrea.'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"May 17, 2016","b'Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Carson, California'","b'Hello! Thank you! Thank you, Carson! [applause]\tLet me -- let me begin by thanking all of you. What a fantastic turnout. Thank you so much. [applause]And let me thank Jim Sobel, and Nick Zano, and Francis Fisher, and Hollis Longwear, and Adriana Aravalo, and Gil Sedilio, Kendrick Sampson -- and let me give a special thanks to a very good friend of mine and one of the great actors in our country, Danny Glover. [applause]Danny is not only an extraordinary actor but, as many of you know, he has spent his entire adult life fighting for economic justice, social justice, racial justice. Danny, thank you for all that you have done. [applause]Let me also take this opportunity to say a word of thanks to the people of Kentucky. In a closed primary -- something I am not all that enthusiastic about where independents are not allowed to vote... [boos] ... where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 250,000 votes in 2008, it ends up tonight we\'re going to end up with about half of the delegates from Kentucky. [applause]I want to thank you all for coming out because this is, in a sense, the beginning of the final push to win California. [applause]When we -- and by the way, I should tell you that there are a lot of people out there -- many of the pundits and politicians -- they say ""Bernie Sanders should drop out."" [boos]""The people of California should not have the right to determine who the next president will be."" [boos]Well, let me be as clear as I can be. I agree with you. We are in until the last ballot is cast. [applause]You know, when we began this campaign a little over a year ago, we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton in the polls. We had no political organization, no money, very little name recognition. The media and the pundits determined that we were a fringe candidacy. [boos]And nobody -- nobody thought that this campaign was going anywhere. And on top of all of that, we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the country; an organization that elected Bill Clinton twice and ran a strong campaign for Hillary Clinton in 2008. [boos]Well, a lot has changed in the last year. [applause]As of today, we have won 19 state primaries and caucuses and over 9 million votes. [applause]No one can predict the future, but I think we have a real shot to win primaries in a number of the states that will be coming up. [applause]And don\'t tell Secretary Clinton; she might get nervous. I think we\'re going to win here in California. [applause]And as all of you know, California has 475 pledged delegates. [applause]And let me mention something else. I am especially proud that in, I believe, every primary and caucus, those we won and those we lost, we have received a significant majority of the votes of young people. [applause]And by the way -- and by the way, one -- you know one of the things about getting older, the older you get, you know -- well, yeah -- people who are older appear to be younger. That\'s what it is. So, we are winning people 45 years of age or younger and what that tells me is that our vision, a vision of social justice, economic justice, racial justice, and environmental justice, that is the future of this country. [applause]As of today, I am proud to tell you that taking on virtually the entire democratic establishment, almost all of the Senators, the Members of the House, mayors, governors -- we have won over 45% of the pledged delegates. [applause]And in a couple of weeks if we can win big in New Jersey, New Mexico, North and South Dakota, Montana, California, we have the possibility. It will be a steep climb. I recognize that. But we have the possibility of going to Philadelphia with the majority of the pledged delegates. [applause]Now, some people say that we\'ve got a steep hill to climb to do that, and that is absolutely true. But you know what? Together we have been climbing that steep hill from day one in this campaign, and we\'re going to continue to fight for every last vote until June 14, and then we\'re going to take our fight into the convention. [applause]You know, there is -- there is a lot of discussion about the role of super-PACs. [boos]And I am very proud to tell you I am the only candidate running for president who does not have a super-PAC. We made a decision when we began this campaign that we were not going to beg Wall Street, or corporate America, or billionaires for campaign contributions. And as of today, without a super-PAC, we have received almost 8 million individual campaign contributions. Anybody know what that average contribution is? That\'s right, $27. And what that shows the world, in a time when big money is dominating our political process, is that you can run a strong, winning national campaign without begging billionaires for campaign contributions. [applause]Let me -- let me also mention something that a lot of people may not be aware of and that is that virtually every national and state poll taken in the last six weeks -- in all of those polls, we are defeating Donald Trump. [applause]And not only are we defeating Trump, in most cases by double digits, in almost every case, whether -- in almost every case, whether it is a national poll or state poll, we do much better against Trump then does Secretary Clinton. [applause]A poll just came out -- I think it was yesterday in the state of Georgia -- not a very good state for us -- Trump was beating Secretary Clinton by four points, and we were beating him by five points.If the Democratic -- if the Democratic Party wants to be certain that Donald Trump is defeated -- and that we must do -- we, together, are the campaign to do that. And it is not just -- it is not just the polls -- the polls go up, the polls go down. What it is, is that our campaign has the energy and the enthusiasm and the grassroots capability. [applause]The grassroots capability to make certain that in November, in the general election, we have a huge voter turnout. Here is a political truism: when the voter turnout is low, and people are demoralized and don\'t come out to vote, Republicans win. When there is excitement, and energy, and people are prepared to stand up and fight back, progressives and Democrats win -- that is our campaign. [applause]I don\'t have to explain to anybody here that the American people will not elect a candidate like Donald Trump who insults Mexicans and Latinos. [boos]Who insults Muslims; who insults women and veterans; and who is a leader of the so-called birther movement, tries to delegitimize the presidency of our first African-American president. [boos]We will not accept as President a man who wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to billionaire families like his, but who has told us that we do not have to worry about raising the starvation minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. We will not accept a President who recklessly talks about using nuclear weapons and who changes his mind every day on every issue. [boos]Let me also say a word to the leadership of the Democratic Party. And that is -- that is -- that the Democratic Party is going to have to make a very, very profound and important decision. It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change. [applause]That is the Democratic Party I want to see, bringing in people who are willing to take on Wall Street; to take on corporate greed; and to take on a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. So I say to the leadership of the Democratic Party, open the door, let the people in.Or, the other option -- the other option for the Democratic Party, which I see as a very sad and tragic option, is the truce to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big money campaign contributions, and be a party with limited participation and limited energy; and a party which, incredibly, is allowing a right- wing extremist Republican Party to capture the votes of a majority of working people in this country. Now, I come from the working class of this country, and I will be damned -- I will be damned if we will allow the Republican Party, whose job is to represent the rich and the powerful, to win the votes of working-class Americans. Let me say a word about why I think this campaign is doing so well. You know why? Because we are doing something very unusual. We are telling the American people the truth. [applause]And here is a very important truth. If we as a nation do not get our act together, this great nation is going to slip into in oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control our political and economic life. Let me tell you how absurd it is. It was just announced the other day, the Koch brothers -- the second wealthiest family in America, a family worth tens of billions of dollars, extremely right-wing -- are contributing over $40 million to try and make the United States Senate stay Republican; $40 million. And here is what is even crazier -- a guy named Sheldon Adelson, also one of the wealthiest people in America -- this is a billionaire who is prepared to contribute huge sums of money to another billionaire, named Donald Trump. The American people are sick and tired of billionaires running our economy and our political lives. [applause]Together, we are going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, and we are going to move toward public funding of elections. I want this country to be a vibrant democracy, and that means whether you\'re progressive, conservative, or moderate, if you want to run for office, you should not have to beg millionaires for campaign contributions. [applause]I want this country to have one of the highest voter turnout rates in the world, not one of the lowest. But before we will have the opportunity to defeat Donald Trump, we are going to have to defeat Secretary Clinton. [applause]A campaign is about issues and ideas, and let me very briefly and straight-forwardly tell you some of the differences between Secretary Clinton and myself:Number one, I am proud to tell you I don\'t have a super-PAC and I don\'t get money from Wall Street. Secretary Clinton has a number of super-PACs, and in the last filing period, reported receiving $15 million from Wall Street. Our job is to take on Wall Street, not take their money. [applause]Federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. Secretary Clinton wants to raise that to $12 an hour. That is OK. but it is not good enough.Hold that sign up, let everybody see it. We are talking about a fight for $15 an hour. I am proud to tell you, I have been on the picket line with those workers. They are standing up and fighting for a living wage, and all of us will stand with them. [applause]My wife just tells me that CNN has called Oregon for Bernie Sanders. [applause]We won. You know, we won a great victory in the state of Washington a few months ago. We just won Oregon. [applause]And we are going to win California. [applause]I am getting to like the West Coast. [applause]This campaign -- when we talk about equitable wages, it is not just that -- you know, raising the minimum wage to a living wage. It is also ending the disgrace of women making $.79 on the dollar compared to men. And together, I know that every man here will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity. [applause]I am a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Environment and I will tell you what all of you know, and that is that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and, as everybody in California knows, it is already causing devastating problems. You in California have witnessed the devastating impact of climate change with your own eyes. You have seen historic wildfires, which scorched 118,000 acres of land here in California in 2014. You have seen massive mudslides; you have seen rising sea levels; you experienced a massive heatwave in 2006. We have a moral obligation -- a moral obligation to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels... [applause] ... to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause]In my view, if we are prepared to be aggressive in transforming our energy system, we need a tax on carbon. We cannot allow, with impunity, the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet. I believe in a tax on carbon because I see climate change as one of the great global crises that we face. Secretary Clinton does not support a tax on carbon. [boos]One of the great crises that we are beginning to see unfold is whether or not, in our country and around the world, we will have the clean drinking water that our people need. And that is why I believe we should move for a ban on fracking. [applause]That is my view. Unfortunately, it is not Secretary Clinton\'s view. In fact -- in fact, when she was Secretary of State, she pushed fracking technology onto countries around the world. [boos]The great -- the great foreign policy debate -- the most important debate that we have had in the modern history of our country centered around Iraq, and whether to go into Iraq. I listened very carefully to what President Bush, and Dick Cheney, and the others had to say. I voted against that war. [applause]Secretary Clinton voted for that war. [boos]I believe that when you have a handful of large financial institutions on Wall Street -- institutions who have a business model of fraud; institutions which through their illegal behavior and their greed drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great depression -- I believe that now is the time to break them up! [applause]That is my view. That is not Secretary Clinton\'s view. [boos]One of the reasons that the middle class of this country has been in decline for the last 35 years has to do with a disastrous trade policy which has ended up shutting down thousands of factories in America, as companies shut down here -- the workers out on the street -- and move to China and other low-wage countries. [boos]I voted against every one of those disastrous trade agreements. [applause]Secretary Clinton supported almost all of them. [boos]What this campaign is about is whether or not we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, or an economy that continues to work for the 1 percent. [boos]It is not acceptable to me that in America today we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on Earth. It is worse now than at any time since 1928. It is not acceptable that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. It is not acceptable to me that in my state of Vermont, and here in California, and all over this country, we have millions of people who are working not one job, but two jobs and three jobs to cobble together the income and health care they need. And yet, when mom works, dad works, and the kids work, it adds up that 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. That is not acceptable. [boos]This campaign is listening to the American people, and not just to wealthy campaign contributors. [applause]This campaign is listening to young people. [applause]And young people are asking me ""how does it happen that when they do the right thing, when they go out and get the best education they can, they end up $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt?"" [boos]We should not be punishing people for getting an education; we should reward them. [applause]Forty or 50 years ago, if you had a high school degree, you were in pretty good shape. You could go out and get yourself a good job. Those days, by and large, are gone. We have a changing economy, changing technology, and a changing global economy. We need to have the best educated workforce in the world. [applause]And that means that when we think about public education, it is not good enough now just to think about first grade through 12th grade. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition free. [applause]I want every kid in California in the fourth grade, and in sixth grade -- kids in Vermont -- to understand that if they study hard and take school seriously, no matter what the income their family is, they will be able to get a college education. [applause]How many people here are carrying student debt right now? [applause]I have talked to people all over this country -- people $50,000, 100,000 -- $100,000 in debt. For what crime did they commit? That they went out and got a decent education? That is crazy stuff. So we are going to give people with student debt the right to refinance their loans at the lowest interest rate they can find. [applause]And people say -- you know, my critics say ""Well, Bernie, you\'re Santa Claus. You\'re giving away free tuition; you\'re going to lower student debt; how are going to you pay for it? I will tell you exactly how we will pay for it. In 2009, Congress, against my vote, bailed out the crooks on Wall Street. Today, Wall Street is doing just fine, and I think it is appropriate to impose a tax on Wall Street speculations. [applause]And that tax will more than pay for free tuition and public colleges and universities and in lowering student debt. [applause]Now, Wall Street does not like that idea, and I say, so what?If we win this election, Wall Street and the other people who now run this country, are going to learn a very profound lesson. And that is, they will not continue to get it all. [applause]I am sick and tired of the greed of corporate America and the greed of Wall Street. We need a new moral compass in this country. [applause]You know, Pope Francis talks about a moral economy -- a moral economy, and I agree with him. That is what we need. [applause]This campaign is listening to our Latino brothers and sisters. [applause]My father -- my father came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, so I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. [applause]There are 11 million undocumented people in this country today. Many of them are being exploited on the job because when you don\'t have legal rights -- when you don\'t have legal rights, you can\'t stand up and protect yourself. And that is why I believe we must pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship. [applause]And that is why I believe we must stop, immediately, the current deportation policy. And if Congress does not do its job, I will use the executive powers of the presidency to do it right. [applause]This campaign is listening to our brothers and sisters in the African-American community. [applause]And they are asking me a very simple but important question; how does it happen that this country has trillions of dollars to spend on a war in Iraq we never should have gotten into, but, somehow, we don\'t have the available funds to rebuild our inner cities? [applause]I have been to Flint, Michigan and visited with parents whose children have been poisoned by lead in the water. [boos]I have been to Detroit, Michigan where their public school system is on the verge of a physical collapse. [boos]I have been to Baltimore, Maryland where tens of thousands of people are addicted to drugs and do not have the treatment available to get them off that heroin. [boos]We, as a nation, together, are going to change our national priorities. [applause]We are going to rebuild our inner cities, build affordable housing, and create decent schools for our children. [applause]And this campaign is listening to people whose pain is almost never heard, and that is our Native American brothers and sisters. [applause]We owe the first Americans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. They have taught us so much, including the very important lesson that as human beings -- all of us are part of nature. We must live with nature. [applause]And, we cannot continue to destroy nature, because if we destroy nature, we are destroying ourselves. [applause]Together, this campaign, and our presidency are going to reform a broken criminal justice system. [applause]It is not acceptable, I believe, to any of us, that we have 2.2 million people in jail today, more than any other country on Earth. [boos]Instead of seeing kids around this country in inner cities or rural America, experiencing 40 percent, 50 percent unemployment rates, we are going to put those kids to work in good jobs. And we are going to invest in education for them, not jail or incarceration. [applause]We want this country to be the best-educated country on Earth, not the country with more people in jail. [applause]What this campaign is about is thinking outside of the box, outside of the status quo. Every other major country on Earth, whether it\'s the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Scandinavia, Canada -- every major country guarantees health care to all of their people as a right. [applause]The Affordable Care Act has done some very good things, but we have a lot more to do. I believe, from the deepest part of my soul, that health care is a right, not a privilege. [applause]Today, we have 29 million peoples with no insurance, even more who are underinsured, with large deductibles and copayments. And every one of us is getting ripped off by the greed of the drug companies. [boos]Pharmaceutical industries charge us by far the highest prices in the world for the medicine we need. By the way, on the ballot in November here in California, you are going to have a proposition making sure that California can control the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. [applause]I congratulate those people who put that item on the ballot -- let\'s pass it. [applause]Together, we will end the fact that we are the only country -- major country without health care for all -- that we pay far more per capita for health care than any other country. We are going to end that by passing a Medicare-for-all health care system. [applause]Now, the insurance companies may not like it; the drug companies may not like it. But the American people do like it, and that\'s what we\'ve got to do. [applause]This campaign understands a very, very important historical lesson. That lesson is that no real change has ever occurred in our country from the top on down. It has always been from the bottom on up. [applause]Think back -- think back 120 years ago, when workers in this country were forced to work seven days a week, 14 hours a day. They had no rights on the job. Think about the children -- 10, 11 years of age, losing fingers in factories, and what the working people of this country said. Sorry, we are human beings, we are not beasts of burden. We are going to form trade unions and negotiate contracts. [applause]And I thank the trade union movement for creating the American middle class. [applause]Think about 150 years ago, in the midst of the abomination of slavery. There were African Americans and their allies who were prepared to go to jail to get beaten, to get lynched, who stood up and said that they will come in this country when we will end racism, and bigotry, and segregation. [applause]And over the years, millions of people were engaged in that struggle. Think about where we were as a country 100 years ago -- not such a long time ago. 100 years ago, women in America did not have the right to vote. They could not get the education or the job they wanted. But women stood up and fought back. [applause]Women stood up to the establishment, which said to them ""Your job is to stay home and have babies."" [boos]But women said ""You will not define us. We will define ourselves."" [applause]And women and their male allies said loudly and clearly ""Women in America will not be second-class citizens."" [applause]If we were here ten years ago -- no time at all -- somebody jumps up and says ""You know Bernie, I think that, say, by the year 2015, gay marriage will be legal in every state in this country."" [applause]If somebody said that, the person next to them would have said ""You are nuts."" What happened? But what happened is the gay community and their straight allies stood up against incredible bigotry. [applause]Against all kinds of abuse. And they said together that in this country, people should have the right to love whoever they want, regardless of their gender. [applause]And let me give you a more contemporary example. If five years ago, somebody here stood up and said ""Bernie, this $7.25 minimum wage, that\'s really awful and terrible, we\'ve got to raise it to 15 bucks an hour"", the person next to him what have said ""$15 an hour? You are nuts. You are thinking too radically. You are an extremist."" But then, what happened? We\'ve got some of them here -- workers in the fast food industry went out on strike.Workers -- workers in McDonalds, and in Burger King, and in Wendy\'s and Subway, and in all these places, they told their community and they told the world they cannot live on $7.25 an hour. And you know what happened after the strikes and demonstrations in Seattle, here in Los Angeles, in San Francisco? Fifteen dollars an hour. [applause]And if I have anything to say about it -- and I will as President -- $15 an hour in every state in this country. [applause]What is my point? Here is my point. Throughout -- let me kick off my point, but I want to...[laughter]...I want you to think about this: throughout history -- throughout history, people looked around them. If they were a worker, working seven days a week with no power, they saw that as being unjust, unfair. They stood up and they fought back. In the days of terrible segregation and slavery, people said ""America will not be racist."" Women fought back. The gay community fought back. Low income workers fought back. That\'s what change is about.And right now -- right now, from coast-to-coast -- and I have been from Maine to California -- I have seen millions of people looking around them, and they\'re saying ""Wait a second, what is going on in our country where we have such a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent? What is going on when the middle class continues to disappear, and we have more children -- we have a higher rate of childhood poverty that almost any country on Earth? What is going on when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? Not to guarantee health care to all people? What is going on when women are making 79 cents on the dollar?"" [boos]And when young people are leaving school $50,000 in debt. [boos]Though what the establishment wants you to believe is that real change effectively dealing with these issues is impossible -- it\'s too big, it\'s too radical. [boos]The options they want to give you -- the media wants to give you, Congress wants to give you -- should we cut food stamps or should we cut education? [boos]We do not accept those choices. We\'re going to ask... [applause]At a time of massive income and wealth inequality -- yeah, we are going to tell the wealthiest people in largest corporations, they are going to start paying their fair share in taxes. [applause]If the American people are prepared to reject the Donald Trumps of the world who want to divide us up -- they want to divide us up -- but if we stand together as black, and white, and Latino, and Asian American, and Native American; if we stand together as gay and straight, male and female...[applause]If we stand together as people born in this country and people who come into this country. [applause]If we stand together and have the courage to take on the billionaire class -- to demand a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent -- together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.As all of you know, in a few weeks there is going to be of an enormously important primary here in California. [applause]And what I have found throughout this campaign is that we win primaries and caucuses when the voter turnout is high. We lose when it is low. Let us have, in the California Democratic primary, the largest voter turnout in the history of the state. [applause]And let this great state show the world that you are prepared to help lead our nation into the political revolution. Thank you very much. [applause]'"
Bernie Sanders,D,c,"July 25, 2016","b'Remarks to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania'","b'Good evening.How great it is to be with you tonight.Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers. Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributionsaveraging $27 a piece. Let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution, giving us the 1,846 pledged delegates here tonight46 percent of the total. And delegates: Thank you for being here, and for all the work you\'ve done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night.And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor, congressman, senator and presidential candidate. And to my familymy wife Jane, four kids and seven grandchildren thank you very much for your love and hard work on this campaign.I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it\'s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am. But to all of our supportershere and around the countryI hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.Together, my friends, we have begun a political revolution to transform America and that revolutionour revolutioncontinues. Election days come and go. But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percenta government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justicethat struggle continues. And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you.Let me be as clear as I can be. This election is not about, and has never been about, Hillary Clinton, or Donald Trump, or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency. This election is not about political gossip. It\'s not about polls. It\'s not about campaign strategy. It\'s not about fundraising. It\'s not about all the things the media spends so much time discussing.This election is aboutand must be aboutthe needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and grandchildren.This election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class the reality that 47 million men, women and children live in poverty. It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy, our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living then their parents.This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience, the worst it has been since 1928. It is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change.This election is about remembering where we were 7 1/2 years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle-down economics.The Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street, our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Some 800,000 people a month were losing their jobs. We were running up a record-breaking deficit of $1.4 trillion and the world\'s financial system was on the verge of collapse.We have come a long way in the last 7 1/2 years, and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession.Yes, we have made progress, but I think we can all agree that much, much more needs to be done.This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutionsnot just bombast, fear-mongering, name-calling and divisiveness.We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us strongernot leadership which insults Latinos, Muslims, women, African-Americans and veteransand divides us up.By these measures, any objective observer will conclude thatbased on her ideas and her leadershipHillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.This election is about a single mom I saw in Nevada who, with tears in her eyes, told me that she was scared to death about the future because she and her young daughter were not making it on the $10.45 an hour she was earning. This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages.Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructureour roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater plants.But her opponentDonald Trumpwell, he has a very different view. He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an houra starvation wage. While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25. What an outrage!This election is about overturning Citizens United, one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country. That decision allows the wealthiest people in America, like the billionaire Koch brothers, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and, in the process, undermine American democracy.Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country. Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman\'s right to choose, workers\' rights, the rights of the LGBT community, the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government\'s ability to protect the environment.If you don\'t believe this election is important, if you think you can sit it out, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country.This election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt, and the many others who cannot afford to go to college. During the primary campaign, Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches. Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less83 percent of our populationwill be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.This election is about climate change, the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet, and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations. Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us thatunless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near futurethere will be more drought, more floods, more acidification of the oceans, more rising sea levels. She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs.Donald Trump? Well, like most Republicans, he chooses to reject science. He believes that climate change is a ""hoax,"" no need to address it. Hillary Clinton understands that a president\'s job is to worry about future generations, not the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry.This campaign is about moving the United States toward universal health care and reducing the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured. Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange. She believes that anyone 55 years or older should be able to opt in to Medicare and she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers.And What is Donald Trump\'s position on health care? No surprise there. Same old, same old Republican contempt for working families. He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off of the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans.Hillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors, disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine. She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and that drug companies should not be making billions in profits while one in five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need. The greed of the drug companies must end.This election is about the leadership we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and repair a broken criminal justice system. It\'s about making sure that young people in this country are in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells. Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails or incarceration.In these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up. While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Yes. We become stronger when black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native Americanall of usstand together. Yes. We become stronger when men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native born and immigrant fight to create the kind of country we all know we can become.It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That\'s what this campaign has been about. That\'s what democracy is about. But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party. Among many other strong provisions, the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Street and the passage of a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidencyand I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children.Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight.'"
