Rick Perry,R,p,"August 13, 2011",Press Release - The Perry Job Creation Record: Best in the Nation,"Government does not create jobs, the private sector creates jobs. What government can do is create an environment that allows the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish. An environment where small business owners feel they have a fair chance to grow their company without interference. In June of 2011, 32,000 net new jobs were created in Texasmore than any of the other states. From June 2010 to June 2011, Texas led all other states by far, adding 220,000 net new jobs. The model for success story is proven and clear. Texas' economic climate under Gov. Perry has consistently outperformed Washington's broken model, reaffirming the need for low taxes, responsible spending, fair and predictable regulations, and tort reform. Recent acclaim for the fiscally conservative model of good government under Gov. Perry's leadership: ""From June 2009 to June 2011 the state added 262,000 jobs, or half of the USA's 524,000 payroll gains, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Bureau of Labor Statistics."" USA Today: Texas Bucks National Unemployment Trend (July 25, 2011) ""Mr. Perry is continuing the Reagan tradition of removing senseless roadblocks and allowing free enterprise to do what it does best: hire employees and generate wealth. During a time when most companies appear to be insecure about adding to their payrolls because of the uncertainty surrounding our economy, this country would be wise to carefully study why Texas employers seem to be largely immune to this insecurity. In short, the Reagan Revolution is alive and well - deep in the heart of Texas."" Michael Reagan (June 25, 2011) ""Between 2001 and last June, Texas  a right-to-work state that taxes neither personal income nor capital gains  added more jobs than the other 49 states combined. And since the recovery began two Junes ago, Texas has created 37 percent of America's net new jobs."" Washington Post: Rick Perry: A Texan's ""Exceptionalism"" (June 24, 2011) ""Texas notched one of the biggest increases in size in a half-century, surpassing $1 trillion in annual economic output. The state gained nearly a full percentage point in its share of the U.S. economy during the decade, reaching 8.3% in 2010. This growth in economic clout has been matched only twice in the past 50 years  by California in the 1980s and Texas itself during the 1970s oil boom."" USA Today: Texas Wins in U.S. Economy Shift (June 21, 2011) ""What explains this Lone Star success? Texas is a big state, but its population of 24.7 million isn't that much bigger than the Empire State, about 19.5 million. California is a large state too36.9 millionand yet it's down 11,400 jobs. Mr. Fisher argues that Texas is doing so well relative to other states precisely because it has rejected the economic model that now prevails in Washington, and we'll second that notion. Mr. Fisher notes that all states labor under the same Fed monetary policy and interest rates and federal regulation, but all states have not preformed equally well. Texas stands out for its free market and business-friendly climate."" Wall Street Journal: The Lone Star Jobs Surge (June 10, 2011) ""It's no big secret why Texas has been attracting businesses, while corporations are fleeing California. As Perry told the Golden State visitors, Texas' low taxes and regulatory sanity offer a friendly business climate for companies looking to set up shop."" Human Events: Gov Rick Perry's Business-Friendly Texas Thriving (May 16, 2011) ""Whatever they are drinking in Texas, other states may want to imbibe. California  which boasted zero regions in the top 150  is a prime example. Indeed, a group of California officials, led by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, recently trekked to the Lone Star State to learn possible lessons about what drives job creation."" Forbes (Yahoo! Finance): The Best Cities for Jobs (May 11, 2011) Help Gov. Perry replace job-stifling government growth with sound fiscal policies and job creation. Let's get America working again!"
Rick Perry,R,p,"August 13, 2011",Press Release - Texas Gov. Rick Perry: It Is Time to Get America Working Again,"Announces the launch of presidential campaign CHARLESTON, S.C.  Determined to get America working again, Texas Gov. Rick Perry today announced his candidacy for president of the United States of America while speaking to an overflow crowd at the RedState Gathering 2011. Perry was joined by his wife, Anita, and their adult children at the announcement. ""It is time to get America working again,"" Gov. Rick Perry said. ""That's why, with the support of my family, and an unwavering belief in the goodness of America, I declare to you today my candidacy for President of the United States."" ""It is time for Americans to believe again  to believe that the promise of our future is far greater than even the best days of our past. It is time to believe again in the potential of private enterprise, set free from the shackles of an overbearing federal government. And it is time to truly restore our standing in the world and renew our faith in freedom as the best hope of peace in a world beset with strife."" Perry underscored the urgent need for new leadership in light of the continued uncertainty and instability in the U.S. economy, continued overreach by an increasingly intrusive federal government into the lives of Americans and the rights of the states, and the misguided policies that are harming the future prosperity of our country. ""One in six work-eligible Americans cannot find a full-time job,"" Perry continued. ""That is not a recovery, that is an economic disaster."" Perry spoke not only of the need for new leadership to create jobs, but the need to get serious about federal spending, saying, ""Mr. President, you can't win the future by selling it off to foreign creditors."" Last week, that failed leadership, and Barack Obama's tax, spend and borrow agenda, led to the first ever downgrade in the credit rating of the United States. ""In reality, this is just the most recent downgrade,"" Perry said. ""The fact is for nearly three years, President Obama has been downgrading American jobs, downgrading our standing in the world, downgrading our financial stability, downgrading confidence, and downgrading the hope of a better future for our children."" As president, Perry has pledged to get the federal government's fiscal house in order, restore the country's good credit, and repeal Obama's misguided one-size-fits-all government-run health care plan. He also committed to holding government accountable to the taxpayers, and adhering to the fiscally responsible principles that will lead to job creation, and in turn, wealth, while educating and innovating in science, technology, engineering and math to create the jobs and progress needed to get America working again. ""I will work every day to make Washington, D.C. as inconsequential in your lives as I can, and free our families, small businesses and states from a burdensome and costly federal government so they can create, innovate and succeed,"" he continued. ""With the help and courage of the American people, we will get our country working again."" After announcing his candidacy in South Carolina, Perry is set to travel to New Hampshire on Saturday and Iowa on Sunday to begin a vigorous campaign in all three early states.

Perry's three-day visit takes him to Waterloo today; the State Fair in Des Moines on Monday, in addition to visits to Iowa City and Cedar Rapids, and; stops in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and Walcott on Tuesday.

Rick Perry,R,p,"August 15, 2011",Press Release - Perry: Obama Administration Should Impose Freeze on New Federal Regulations,"Perry Visits Iowa State Fairgrounds DES MOINES, IOWA  Texas Gov. Rick Perry today called on the Obama Administration to put a six-month freeze on new federal regulations in an effort to ease the burden on small businesses that continue to struggle under President Obama's job-killing economic policies. The governor's call was made at a campaign stop at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, where he also highlighted his record of job creation in Texas and the importance of pursuing policies that will open doors to job growth and get America working again. ""It is hard enough for small businesses to keep their doors open under this Administration's failed economic experiment, and the last thing employers need is additional regulations that kill jobs,"" said Gov. Perry. ""While the president issues executive orders to study what regulations harm business, I believe we need immediate action, not bureaucratic studies. So, starting today, the president should put a six-month freeze on all pending federal regulations. The Department of Labor, the EPA and hosts of other federal agencies have already done enough damage. Let's give small businesses a reprieve from burdensome regulations."" The governor added, ""Our nation cannot and must not endure four more years of rising unemployment, rising taxes and rising debt. The greatest threat to our economy is a President trying to spend our way out of our economic spiral."" Under President Obama, America has lost 2.5 million jobs, unemployment has gone up and there are one in six work-eligible Americans that cannot find a full time job. In contrast, under Gov. Perry's leadership of Texas, the state is responsible for 40 percent of net new jobs created since June 2009 and the unemployment rate remains well below the national average. Gov. Perry noted that President Obama is scheduled to visit the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Monday, underscoring that after a failed stimulus package and the first ever downgrading of our nation's credit, Iowans and all Americans deserve the right to know the president's plan to stop the record deficit spending and restore our nation's good credit. As president, Gov. Perry has pledged to get the federal government's fiscal house in order, simplify and limit taxes, restore the country's good credit, and repeal Obama's misguided one-size-fits-all, government-run health care plan. He also committed to holding government accountable to the taxpayers, and adhering to the fiscally responsible principles that will lead to job creation, and in turn, wealth, while educating and innovating in science, technology, engineering and math to create the jobs and progress needed to get America working again. ""I will work every day to make Washington, D.C. as inconsequential in your lives as I can, and free our families, small businesses and states from a burdensome and costly federal government so they can create, innovate and succeed,"" he continued.

Rick Perry today visited Cedar Rapids, Iowa where he criticized President Obama's proposal to create a new jobs agency as a solution to economic recovery. He also reiterated his call for the Administration to issue a six-month freeze on new regulations to help free employers to create more jobs for Americans. ""What is this president's plan to fix the economy? Apparently to create a new jobs agency,"" Gov. Perry said. ""Mr. President, we have tried two and a half years of government creating jobs, it's time to let the private sector get to work. Americans need work, not symbolism. We need new jobs, not new agencies. If you want to create jobs, don't create a new agency, and stop all the unnecessary regulations of the agencies you already control."" Gov. Perry highlighted the healthy jobs climate in Texas, where more than 40 percent of the nation's net new jobs have been created since June 2009. He noted the key to creating economic prosperity is upholding policies based on fiscal restraint, low taxes, reasonable and predictable regulations, and a fair legal system. In contrast, under President Obama, America has lost 2.5 million jobs, unemployment has gone up and there are one in six work-eligible Americans that cannot find a full time job. As president, Gov.

He also reiterated his call to put a freeze on new federal mandates for six months in an effort to free small businesses to create jobs. ""Our economic plan shouldn't depend on luck, it should depend on sound economic fundamentals,"" Gov. Perry said. ""President Obama's policies, which he claims 'reversed the recession,' actually increased unemployment, exploded the debt and led to the first downgrade of credit in the history of our nation."" The governor added, ""The president said yesterday I needed to watch what I say. But actions speak louder than words and my actions as governor are helping create jobs, while the president's tax and regulation policies are killing jobs."" Gov.

Rick Perry,R,p,"August 18, 2011","Press Release - Perry: Proposed Federal Building Codes Will Hurt Job Creation, Home Prices, Homebuilders and Homeowners","Takes presidential campaign across New Hampshire; Renews call for temporary freeze of federal regulations PEMBROKE, NH  Texas Gov. Rick Perry today took his presidential campaign to Epoch Homes in Pembroke, New Hampshire. He toured the facility and took questions from employees, renewing his call for a six-month freeze on federal regulations. Additionally, he specifically criticized proposed federal mandates being considered by the U.S. Senate that would enable federal takeover of local building codes. ""If there's one area that government needs to get out of the way, it's in regulation,"" said Gov. Perry. ""With too many American homeowners and homebuilders financially strapped, these proposed federal building codes will hurt job creation, home prices, homebuilders and homeowners. The federal government has no business federalizing local building or energy efficiency guidelines and costing America jobs in the process."" Like many Washington regulations, this housing mandate, proposed by New Hampshire's own Sen. Jean Shaheen, gives little or no consideration to likely increases in the cost of a home. If passed, federal regulators at the Department of Energy would be allowed to take over the local building codes if they decide the private sector isn't meeting federal mandates fast enough. The governor noted that in 2010, the Obama Administration implemented 43 new regulations that cost U.S. businesses more than $26 billion. These are the types of actions that prove how out of touch this administration is with hardworking Americans. If employers didn't have to spend that money dealing with government red tape, they could have instead created 650,000 new jobs that pay $40,000 per year. Gov. Perry reiterated the importance of promoting policies based on restrained spending, low taxes, reasonable and predictable regulations and a fair legal system, crediting these priorities as the foundation of Texas' successful job creation.

Rick Perry today took his campaign for president to South Carolina, where he underscored his belief that economic opportunity is derived by creating jobs, not issuing welfare. He criticized recent comments from President Obama's administration claiming that food stamps are a form of economic stimulus and emphasized the need to get government out of the way and unleash the private sector to create the jobs our nation needs. ""Most Americans do not yearn to be dependent on government subsidies, they want economic freedom, and economic freedom comes from work and wages, not welfare,"" Gov. Perry said. ""The central issue of this election is an Administration that believes Washington must be our caretaker, and a people who want Washington to only take care of their constitutional responsibilities."" Gov. Perry criticized the Obama Administration for referring to food stamps as economic stimulus, emphasizing that food stamps are not the solution, but a symptom of the problem that too many people are without work.

Rick Perry,R,p,"August 19, 2011","Press Release - Dallas Fed Chief Separates ""Fact From Fiction"" on Texas Jobs","On Wednesday, Richard Fisher, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, gave a speech in which he separated ""fact from fiction"" about the record of job creation in Texas. Key facts from his remarks include: Texas Job Growth is Indisputable: ""These are the facts. You may select whichever metric you wish. Regardless, it is reasonable to assume Texas has accounted for a significant amount of the nation's employment growth both over the past 20 years and since the recession officially ended."" Most new jobs are unrelated to the oil and gas sector: ""The most jobs have been created in the educational and health services sector, which accounts for 13.5 percent of Texas' employment. The second-most jobs have been created in the professional and business services sector, which accounts for 12.5 percent of the Texas workforce. The mining sector, which includes support activities for both mining and oil and gas, employs 2.1 percent (yes, two-point-one percent) of Texas' workers."" Most New Jobs Pay Good Wages: ""...these jobs are not low-paying jobs. The average weekly wage in the education and health services sector is $790; in the professional and business services sector it is $1,117; and in the mining sector, the average weekly wage is $2,271. Together these three sectors account for 68 percent of the jobs that have been created in Texas in the past two years."" Texas job gains are a result of pro-growth policies on taxes, spending and regulations: ""...people and businesses have been picking up stakes and moving to Texas in significant numbers over a prolonged period... And yet Texas, like all states, is subject to the same monetary policy as all the rest... From this, I draw the conclusion that private sector capital and jobs will go to where taxes and spending and regulatory policy are most conducive to growth."" To create jobs, Washington must address taxes, spending and regulations: ""The Committee of 12 and the president have an awesome task. Essentially, they must reboot our entire system of economic incentives and come forward with an updated tax and spending and regulatory regime that incentivizes businesses to invest in the United States and create jobs for American workers rather than gravitate to foreign shores."" The Dallas Fed will provide ongoing updates to counteract inaccurate information: ""The Dallas Fed will henceforth be providing monthly updates on employment in Texas through our website at www.dallasfed.org. We hope it will be a useful tool for everyone ranging from columnists who write for the New York Times to the pundits who provide commentary for Fox News, as well as serious economists.""

Rick Perry,R,p,"August 22, 2011",Press Release - Iowa Governor Terry Branstad on Gov. Perry's Visit,"Iowa's Gov. Terry Branstad had this to say about Gov.

""I thought he was as relaxed and confident and at home at the Iowa State Fair as anybody I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them. He comes from a farm background, he's a former agriculture commissioner, he's a graduate of Texas A&M.;"" Branstad added: ""Only thing, in Texas they always say how big everything is and we tend to downplay and understate here. But I think he came across very well."" Asked about Perry's comment in Iowa last week that it would be ""almost treasonous"" for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to attempt to revive the economy by directly injecting money, Branstad said it had to be taken in context. Perry said last Monday, according to CBS News: ""If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I dunno what y'all would do to him in Iowa but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treasonous in my opinion."" Branstad today said: ""I think that was probably the wrong choice of words. But the idea that somehow we're going to correct our problems in this country by printing more money, I think people are apprehensive about that."" The full article"
Rick Perry,R,p,"August 23, 2011","Press Release - Thiessen: ""Rick Perry's Very Good Week""","Marc Thiessen's recent opinion piece in the Washington Post had high marks for Gov. Perry's first week as a candidate for President of the United States: He left his cowboy boots in Austin, but Gov. Rick Perry brought some Texas straight talk to New Hampshire. ""Live free or die, you've got to love that,"" Perry told an audience in Bedford last week, adding that the state motto reminded him ""of a little place down in Texas called the Alamo."" Perry's promise to make Washington ""as inconsequential in your lives as possible"" is resonating in libertarian New Hampshire. He has moved into second place here after just a few days in the race, registering 18 percent support among Granite State Republicans. The secret to Perry's success? One word: jobs. As Perry explained in Portsmouth, he has ""ten years of leading a state that inarguably has the best record of job creation in America  no offense to any other candidate, but no one else is close to that."" As if on cue to prove Perry's point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that Texas had added another 30,000 jobs in July  the state's 10th straight month of job growth. At Epoch Homes, a Pembroke modular home-builder, Perry held a town hall where he explained the Texas model: keep spending low and put a stop to over-taxation, over-litigation and over-regulation. ""We're over-regulating ourselves out of work,"" he said, pointing out that new regulations under the Obama administration last year cost American businesses $26 billion  money that could have created 650,000 good-paying jobs. That made sense to Dave Quinn, who has worked at Epoch three years and says regulations are preventing Epoch from expanding and hiring more workers. ""I like his big push on deregulation,"" Quinn told me. ""I'm undecided, but that push to give control back to the people, that's what's really swaying my position to support Governor Perry."" The power of Perry's jobs message is not lost on the White House, which is why Obama officials spent much of the week trying to shoot down the ""Texas miracle""  arguing that most new Texas jobs are low wage and have little to do with Perry's policies. So it is significant that while Perry was campaigning in New Hampshire, back in Texas the Democratic head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard Fisher, gave a speech supporting Perry's claims. Over the past two years, Fisher said, ""Texas has accounted for 49.9 percent of net new jobs created in the United States,"" and the vast majority were equal to or above the national average for weekly wages. ""These jobs are not low-paying jobs,"" he said. Moreover, Fisher added, the reason so many people and businesses have been moving to Texas is that ""private sector capital and jobs will go to where taxes and spending and regulatory policy are most conducive to growth."" Translation: Texas is creating half the new jobs in America, thanks to the pro-growth policies Perry presided over.

""Meanwhile, since just June 2009, Rick Perry's Texas is responsible for approximately 40 percent of the net new jobs in America."" ""America is at a crossroads. Time and time again, President Obama's agenda has damaged the confidence of the private sector and made it harder  not easier  to create the jobs Americans desperately need,"" continued Speaker Cannon. ""The President has failed, and it's time for a different approach."" ""Governor Perry knows that we must reduce government spending. You cannot tax your way into prosperity, and you cannot borrow your way out of debt. Governor Perry's record of creating jobs and cutting spending is exactly what we need to get our country back on track, and I am excited to support his campaign to get America working again,"" Speaker Cannon said. ""I am honored to have Dean Cannon's support and look forward to working with him to build a strong campaign in Florida. I know that with Speaker Cannon's help, we will win Florida's primary, the Republican nomination, and ultimately, the Presidency."""

Rick Perry,R,p,"August 28, 2011",Press Release - Rick Perry: Job Creators Pick Texas,"Gov. Perry submitted this op-ed, which appeared in USA Today  Since June 2009, nearly 40% of the net new jobs in America have been created in Texas, and those jobs are being created in a climate that actually encourages such growth. While it is true that Texas also created jobs in previous decades, so did the nation. But since I became Texas governor in December 2000, Texas has added more than 1 million net new jobs while the rest of the nation has lost nearly 2.5 million jobs. In his Aug. 17 speech to the Midland Community Forum,Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, made an important distinction between Texas and the rest of the nation, saying: ""Texas, like all states, is subject to the same monetary policy as all the rest: We have the same interest rates and access to capital as the residents of any of the other 49 states, for the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy and regulates financial institutions under its purview for the nation at large. From this, I draw the conclusion that private sector capital and jobs will go to where taxes and spending and regulatory policy are most conducive to growth."" Employers and jobs are coming to Texas in droves. So are people looking for work, as the Texas labor force has increased by more than 700,000 since the recession began. Today, Texas employment is at near-record highs, and workers are employed in high quality jobs with companies such as eBay, Facebook, Toyota, Caterpillar  all of which have expanded in Texas in recent years. The people whose opinion really matters on this issue are the job creators themselves. I put significant stock in opinion of 550 business leaders who ranked Texas No. 1 for job growth and business development for the seventh year in a row. Polled by Chief Executive on factors that include fair and predictable taxation and regulation, they voted Texas to the top of their list. I believe this common-sense model will benefit our nation: Control spending, keep regulations fair and predictable, and simplify the tax code to once again spark job creation. The alternative is economic ruin."

After three years of Obama's liberal agenda, Rick Perry is the right person to get America working again and turn our country in the right direction,"" said Sen. Inhofe. ""His record as Texas' governor proves that he knows you grow the economy with less government, by controlling spending, cutting taxes, reforming tort laws and reducing regulatory red tape for employers. One of the important areas is reigning in over-regulation. Rick Perry is strong against the Cap and Trade tax that would further devastate our economy and do nothing but move jobs overseas to places like China. He is one of the few who understand this, and he won't cave in to the extreme environmental activists or the Hollywood crowd and their liberal agenda. We can't afford four more years of the Obama malaise. Look at what Rick Perry has done in his state. He is going to be a great president!""

Rick Perry highlighted important legislation, passed during the 82nd Legislative Session that takes effect September 1, including a balanced budget that doesn't raise taxes, and key measures that protect the lives of the unborn and strengthen the state's legal climate, private property rights, and penalties for those convicted of human trafficking. ""This session we further strengthened our state's robust economy the way we said we would: by living within our means, balancing our budget without raising taxes and protecting the Rainy Day Fund,"" Gov.

Perry fought to continue, that will keep taxes low for thousands of employers across the state. Several key measures, along with issues the governor declared as emergency items during the regular session, become law on September 1, including:  HB 274, which implements several changes to streamline and lower the cost of litigation in Texas courts, allowing parties to resolve disputes more quickly and fairly, and less expensively. HB 15, which requires a physician to perform a sonogram 24 hours before an abortion, except in cases of medical emergency.

Certain provisions of this bill take effect September 1 and the remainder will take effect January 1. HB 3, which increases the punishment for repeat sex offenders convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child, including certain sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault offenses, to life without parole. SB 7, which provides Texas $467 million in savings by streamlining inefficiencies in the Medicaid program. SB 1736, which helps expedite the entry of military veterans and service members into the workforce by allowing colleges and universities to develop programs that give them credit for experience, education and training obtained during their military service. HB 3, passed during the special session, which reforms the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association to protect Texans from the effects of devastating hurricane seasons while keeping insurance coverage available to Texans living along the coast. It also implements reforms that will ensure the association timely and adequately compensates its policyholders without enriching trial lawyers or further undermining the organization's financial stability.  http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/16540/"

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 1, 2011",Press Release - Ron Paul's Reagan Revisionism,"His ad refers to him as ""the one who stood with Reagan""...His 1987 resignation letter indicates Reagan drove him from the Republican Party AUSTIN  Rep. Ron Paul's newly released attack ad refers to the congressman as, ""the one who stood with Reagan."" But his 1987 letter announcing his resignation from the Republican Party indicates Reagan drove him from the party. ""Ronald Reagan was one of the most significant presidents of our generation, and a proven fiscal conservative,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. ""Like President Reagan, Gov. Perry has cut taxes and freed employers from government regulations that kill jobs."" ""Rep. Paul's letter is a broadside attack on every element of President Reagan's record and philosophy. Paul thought President Reagan was so bad, he left the GOP,"" said Miner. ""It will be interesting to hear Rep. Paul explain why Reagan drove him from the party at tomorrow's debate on the grounds of the Reagan Library."" In one part of the letter, Paul wrote, ""There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years."" Paul continued, ""Thanks to the President and Republican Party, we have lost the chance to reduce the deficit and the spending in a non-crisis fashion. Even worse, big government has been legitimized in a way the Democrats never could have accomplished."" Paul even went so far as to call Reaganomics, ""warmed-over Keynesianism."" Paul summarizes his reason for leaving the Republican Party with the following tirade: ""I want to totally disassociate myself from the policies that have given us unprecedented deficits, massive monetary inflation, indiscriminate military spending, an irrational and unconstitutional foreign policy, zooming foreign aid, the exaltation of international banking, and the attack on our personal liberties and privacy."" Text of the letter is below or may be viewed at http://www.rickperry.org/content/uploads/2011/09/PaulLetter.jpg. As a lifelong Republican, it saddens me to have to write this letter. My parents believed in the Republican Party and its free enterprise philosophy, and that's the way I was brought up. At age 21, in 1956, I cast my first vote for Ike and the entire Republican slate. Because of frustration with the direction in which the country was going, I became a political activist and ran for the U.S. Congress in 1974. Even with Watergate, my loyalty, optimism, and hope for the future were tied to the Republican Party and its message of free enterprise, limited government, and balanced budgets. Eventually I was elected to the U.S. Congress four times as a Republican. This permitted me a first-hand look at the interworkings of the U.S. Congress, seeing both the benefits and partisan frustrations that guide its shaky proceedings. I found that although representative government still exists, special interest control of the legislative process clearly presents a danger to our constitutional system of government. In 1976 I was impressed with Ronald Reagan's program and was one of the four members of Congress who endorsed his candidacy. In 1980, unlike other Republican office holders in Texas, I again supported our President in his efforts. Since 1981, however, I have gradually and steadily grown weary of the Republican Party's efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. Since then Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt. How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together? Tip O'Neill, although part of the problem, cannot alone be blamed. Tax revenues are up 59 percent since 1980. Because of our economic growth? No. During Carter's four years, we had growth of 37.2 percent; Reagan's five years have given us 30.7 percent. The new revenues are due to four giant Republican tax increases since 1981. All republicans rightly chastised Carter for his $38 billion deficit. But they ignore or even defend deficits of $220 billion, as government spending has grown 10.4 percent per year since Reagan took office, while the federal payroll has zoomed by a quarter of a million bureaucrats. Despite the Supply-Sider-Keynesian claim that ""deficits don't matter,"" the debt presents a grave threat to our country. Thanks to the President and Republican Party, we have lost the chance to reduce the deficit and the spending in a non-crisis fashion. Even worse, big government has been legitimized in a way the Democrats never could have accomplished. It was tragic to listen to Ronald Reagan on the 1986 campaign trail bragging about his high spending on farm subsidies, welfare, warfare, etc., in his futile effort to hold on to control of the Senate. Instead of cutting some of the immeasurable waste in the Department of Defense, it has gotten worse, with the inevitable result that we are less secure today. Reagan's foreign aid expenditures exceed Eisenhower's, Kennedy's, Johnson's, Nixon's, Ford's, and Carter's put together. Foreign intervention has exploded since 1980. Only an end to military welfare for foreign governments plus a curtailment of our unconstitutional commitments abroad will enable us really to defend ourselves and solve our financial problems. Amidst the failure of the Gramm-Rudman gimmick, we hear the President and the Republican Party call for a balanced-budget amendment and a line-item veto. This is only a smokescreen. President Reagan, as governor of California, had a line-item veto and virtually never used it. As President he has failed to exercise his constitutional responsibility to veto spending. Instead, he has encouraged it. Monetary policy has been disastrous as well. The five Reagan appointees to the Federal Reserve Board have advocated even faster monetary inflation than Chairman Volcker, and this is the fourth straight year of double-digit increases. The chickens have yet to come home to roost, but they will, and America will suffer from a Reaganomics that is nothing but warmed-over Keynesianism. Candidate Reagan in 1980 correctly opposed draft registration. Yet when he had the chance to abolish it, he reneged, as he did on his pledge to abolish the Departments of Education and Energy, or to work against abortion. Under the guise of attacking drug use and money laundering, the Republican Administration has systematically attacked personal and financial privacy. The effect has been to victimize innocent Americans who wish to conduct their private lives without government snooping. (Should people really be put on a suspected drug dealer list because they transfer $3,000 at one time?) Reagan's urine testing of Americans without probable cause is a clear violation of our civil liberties, as are his proposals for extensive ""lie detector"" tests. Under Reagan, the IRS has grown bigger, richer, more powerful, and more arrogant. In the words of the founders of our country, our government has ""sent hither swarms"" of tax gatherers ""to harass our people and eat out their substance."" His officers jailed the innocent George Hansen, with the President refusing to pardon a great American whose only crime was to defend the Constitution. Reagan's new tax ""reform"" gives even more power to the IRS. Far from making taxes fairer or simpler, it deceitfully raises more revenue for the government to waste. Knowing this administration's record, I wasn't surprised by its Libyan disinformation campaign, Israeli-Iranian arms-for-hostages swap, or illegal funding of the Contras. All this has contributed to my disenchantment with the Republican Party, and helped me make up my mind. I want to totally disassociate myself from the policies that have given us unprecedented deficits, massive monetary inflation, indiscriminate military spending, an irrational and unconstitutional foreign policy, zooming foreign aid, the exaltation of international banking, and the attack on our personal liberties and privacy. After years of trying to work through the Republican Party both in and out of government, I have reluctantly concluded that my efforts must be carried on outside the Republican Party. Republicans know that the Democratic agenda is dangerous to our political and economic health. Yet, in the past six years Republicans have expanded its worst aspects and called them our own. The Republican Party has not reduced the size of government. It has become big government's best friend. If Ronald Reagan couldn't or wouldn't balance the budget, which Republican leader on the horizon can we possibly expect to do so? There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years. I conclude that one must look to other avenues if a successful effort is ever to be achieved in reversing America's direction. I therefore resign my membership in the Republican Party and enclose my membership card."

Perry's Fiscally Conservative Record,"100% of attacks in ad are false AUSTIN  A committee supporting Michele Bachmann has released a blatantly false ad that completely misrepresents Gov. Perry's fiscally conservative record in Texas. ""Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative, having cut taxes, signed six balanced budgets, and led Texas to become America's top job-creating state,"" said Ray Sullivan, RickPerry.org's communications director. ""Congresswoman Bachmann's front-group ad is patently and provably false. Unlike Washington, the Texas budget is balanced, does not run deficits and limits spending, even as Texas added jobs and population in big numbers."" FALSE CLAIM: ""Rick Perry doubled spending in a decade."" TRUTH: State spending  the non-federal dollars state lawmakers can control  is six percent lower under Gov. Perry than it was under the two-year budget in effect when he took office, adjusting for population growth and inflation. In unadjusted amounts, state spending is $80.5 billion for the 2012-13 biennium compared to $55.7 billion for the 2000-01 biennium. Texas' population growth plus inflation since 2001 is 54 percent. The current Texas budget funds the state's vital needs by operating within available revenues and providing tax cuts for small businesses. Gov. Perry is the only Texas governor since World War II to cut state (general revenue) spending. FALSE CLAIM: ""This year, Rick Perry is spending more money than the state takes in."" TRUTH: Texas' budget has been certified as balanced by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, with an estimated $6.5 billion remaining unspent in the state's Rainy Day Fund. Every budget Gov. Perry has signed has been balanced. FALSE CLAIM: ""Covering his deficits with record borrowing."" TRUTH: Texas does not have a deficit. The state's recent sale of Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRANs) is cash-flow management tool that dates back to 1987. These notes are sold every fiscal year to manage cash flow and to provide up-front payments to public schools. They are repaid within the fiscal year with tax revenue that comes in after the upfront school payments are made. Texas earned the highest possible ratings in anticipation of this offering, receiving a rating of SP-1+ by Standard & Poor's, MIG 1 by Moody's Investors Service and F1+ by Fitch Inc. Texas' net interest rate of .27 percent is down from last year's rate of .34 percent, representing the state's lowest net rate ever for these notes.

Or, more precisely, his next plan following the failed stimulus that spent our children's inheritance, exploded the debt, and led to greater unemployment. Now the president wants a mulligan. He wants us to forget that his last swing off the tee drove the economy into the weeds, and hope we see another speech as a sign of his leadership. But this is the same president who refused to reveal the details of a plan during the debt ceiling negotiations. Just as he kept the cameras away from his last round of golf, he kept the public out of his negotiations with Congress for fear the American people might learn about his proposals to reach a deal. But his failed leadership gives us little confidence he will embrace fiscal discipline and economic policies that will lead to job creation. Help us yell a pre-emptive ""fore,"" before the president takes a three-iron to the economy and makes matters worse.

He shared his record of success in Texas as well as his plans to turn the country's economy around during the Reagan Centennial GOP Candidates Debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. ""I am pleased to have been able to introduce my conservative philosophy and pro-jobs record to the American people watching this important debate,"" said Gov. Rick Perry. ""We must not allow four more years of the current administration's devastating economic policies.

During the debate, Gov. Perry highlighted his record of successfully creating a job-friendly environment in Texas, which continues to lead the nation in job creation. As governor, Perry has worked hard to keep taxes low, maintain a predictable regulatory environment, prevent frivolous lawsuits, and prioritize public education, all aimed at creating America's top economy and job-producing state. Texas has created more than one million net new jobs under Gov. Perry and is home to approximately 40 percent of all net new jobs in America since June 2009. Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative, having cut taxes, signed six balanced budgets, and led Texas to become America's top job-creating state.

Perry has the best record of job creation and has fought to defend and strengthen measures that have maintained a competitive economy, even during a national recession. Gov. Perry's record exceeds other candidates' rhetoric when it comes to job creation.

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 8, 2011",Press Release - Mitt Romney's Social Insecurity,"Despite Debate Posturing, Romney's Writings Compare Social Security to a Criminal Enterprise AUSTIN  The Perry Campaign for President today contrasted former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's posturing on Social Security last night at the Reagan Library Presidential Debate with his recently published book, exposing his inconsistencies on the issue. Last night, Romney said, ""Under no circumstances would I ever say, by any measure, it's a failure. It is working for millions of Americans."" However, in his book ""No Apology: The Case For American Greatness"", which was published just last year, Romney compared those managing Social Security to criminals, saying: ""Let's look at what would happen if someone in the private sector did a similar thing. Suppose two grandparents created a trust fund, appointed a bank as trustee, and instructed the bank to invest the proceeds of the trust fund so as to provide for their grandchildren's education. Suppose further that the bank used the proceeds for its own purposes, so that when the grandchildren turned eighteen, there was no money for them to go to college. What would happen to the bankers responsible for misusing the money? They would go to jail. But what has happened to the people responsible for the looming bankruptcy of Social Security? They keep returning to Congress every two years."" Romney also says in his book, ""To put it in a nutshell, the American people have been effectively defrauded out of their Social Security."" ""In his book, Romney compared Social Security to a fraudulent criminal enterprise, but last night he ran from his position,"" said spokesman Ray Sullivan. ""His evolving and inconsistent position on this important issue is curious, but unfortunately not unusual."" Not only has Romney compared Social Security to a criminal enterprise, he said just two weeks ago in New Hampshire: ""I don't know of any Republican whose running for office who said they want to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits to people who are retired or near retirement. Not one, I haven't heard a word of it...so Republicans, like myself, are not gonna cut social security or Medicare for people who are retired or near retirement. And for the people who say we are, they are demagoguing an issue very much that harms America. Because we need to be truthful on this."" (8/24/11, Lebanon, New Hampshire) ""Governor Perry believes that Social Security for current beneficiaries, and those nearing retirement, can and must be protected,"" said Sullivan. ""Additionally, citizens of all ages, experts and elected officials must seriously discuss reforms to Social Security to make it financially sound and sustainable for the long haul."" ""Americans want a leader to speak honestly about the financial challenges facing our nation,"" said Sullivan. ""Traditional political rhetoric and tap-dancing don't comfort Americans deeply concerned about the future of our nation."""
Rick Perry,R,p,"September 8, 2011",Press Release - U.S. Rep. Miller Endorses Gov. Perry for President,"AUSTIN - Today U.S. Rep. Candice Miller (R-MI) endorsed Gov. Rick Perry in his campaign for president of the United States. ""It is clear that our nation needs new leadership. I have watched as the campaign for the Republican nomination has unfolded in search for the right person to lead our nation,"" Rep. Candice Miller said. ""The most important factor in making my determination is who is best suited to bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and help build an environment where our economy can grow and new jobs can be created. Lots of candidates talk about job creation, but no one has delivered like Rick Perry. Since Rick Perry became governor, Texas has gained more than one million jobs  a stark contrast to the 2.4 million jobs America has lost on President Obama's watch. After careful consideration I have determined that Gov. Rick Perry is the leader we need to get Michigan and America working again."" ""Rick Perry offers voters a clear contrast with President Obama's disastrous record of failure on job creation,"" said Rep. Miller. ""The Perry record is less government spending, balanced budgets, less burdensome regulation, a lower tax burden and more jobs. The Obama record is millions unemployed, a stagnant economy and a crushing burden of government debt on our children and grandchildren. The choice in my mind is clear; Rick Perry is the right leader to get our nation back to work."" ""In addition, the first and foremost responsibility of the federal government is to provide for our national defense. Through his service to our nation in uniform and his leadership as Commander-in-Chief of the Texas National Guard, Rick Perry has proven his commitment to defending this nation. I have full confidence in his ability to keep America the strongest nation on earth and to be a staunch defender of our freedom."" Miller's home state of Michigan is currently experiencing 10.9 percent unemployment, with the loss of much of its industrial base. ""I want to bring manufacturing back to the Midwest, and jobs back to American workers,"" said Gov. Perry. ""I appreciate Rep. Miller's endorsement because she has been on the front lines in opposition to the Obama agenda that has failed to provide our citizens the opportunities they need. I know that she will be a staunch ally in the fight for lower taxes and smaller government so employers can flourish and create jobs. Job creation is critical to Michigan, and I am honored to have her support. I look forward to working with her as I campaign to earn the trust of the people of Michigan."" Rep. Miller was the first Republican in more than half a century to be elected to countywide office in Macomb County, a blue-collar region near Detroit that is sometimes referred to as the home of the Reagan Democrats. She was first elected to the U.S. House in 2002, and currently serves on the House Committee on Homeland Security and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Prior to serving in Congress, Miller was the first woman elected Secretary of State and the first Republican to win that office in 50 years."

Gov. Perry will continue to speak with voters across the nation about how we can get America working again. Perhaps the most thoughtful insight into the economic philosophy of the Lone Star State chief were his comments during the debate about chastising the use of government spending to stimulate the economy. President Obama, Perry argued, ""has proven for once and for all that government spending will not create one job. Keynesian policy and Keynesian theory is now done. We'll never have to have that experiment on America again."" Perry appears not to believe in government manipulation of the economic system to spur job creation and activity in the economy. While Perry does not say it outright, he defacto endorses a more Austrian approach or a pure free market approach to economics. His criticism of government involvement in economic activity is also evident in his beliefs about how jobs are created: ""You want to create jobs in America? You free the American entrepreneur to do what he or she does, which is risk their capital, and I'll guarantee you, the entrepreneur in America, the small businessman and woman, they're looking for a president that will say we're going to lower the tax burden on you and we're going to lower the regulation impact on you, and free them to do what they do best: create jobs.""

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 12, 2011",Press Release - Rick Perry: I am Going to be Honest With the American People,"Gov. Perry submitted this op-ed, and it appears in today's USA Today: The first step to fixing a problem is honestly admitting there is a problem. America's goal must be to fix Social Security by making it more financially sound and sustainable for the long term. But Americans deserve a frank and honest discussion of the dire financial challenges facing the nearly 80-year-old program. As I said at the Reagan Library recently, Social Security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected. For younger workers, we must consider reforms to make Social Security financially viable. These are the hard facts: Social Security's unfunded liability is calculated in the trillions of dollars. Last year, annual Social Security outlays exceeded annual revenues for the first time since 1983. The Congressional Budget Office projects that outlays will be roughly 5% greater than revenues over the next five years, worsening as more and more Baby Boomers retire. By 2037, retirees will only get roughly 76 cents back for every dollar that is put into Social Security unless reforms are implemented. Imagine how long a traditional retirement or investment plan could survive if it projected investors would lose 24% of their money? I am going to be honest with the American people. Our elected leaders must have the strength to speak frankly about entitlement reform if we are to right our nation's financial course and get the USA working again. For too long, politicians have been afraid to speak honestly about Social Security. We must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix Social Security and make it financially viable for generations to come. Americans must come together and agree to address the problems so today's beneficiaries and tomorrow's retirees really can count on Social Security for the long haul. We must have a frank, honest national conversation about fixing Social Security to protect benefits for those at or near retirement while keeping faith with younger generations, who are being asked to pay."

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 16, 2011",Press Release - Gov. Perry: The U.S. Must Support Israel At the U.N.,"Governor Rick Perry submitted this op-ed, which appears in today's Wall Street Journal: Obama policies have encouraged the Palestinians to avoid direct negotiations with Israel. The historic friendship between the United States and Israel stretches from the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 to the present day. Our nations have developed vital economic and security relationships in an alliance based on shared democratic principles, deep cultural ties, and common strategic interests. Historian T.R. Fehrenbach once observed that my home state of Texas and Israel share the experience of ""civilized men and women thrown into new and harsh conditions, beset by enemies."" Surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and terror organizations that aim to destroy her, the Jewish state has never had an easy life. Today, the challenges are mounting. Israel faces growing hostility from Turkey. Its three-decades-old peace with Egypt hangs by a thread. Iran pursues nuclear weapons its leaders vow to use to annihilate Israel. Terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians from Hezbollah and Hamas continue. And now, the Palestinian leadership is intent on destroying the possibility of a negotiated settlement of the conflict with Israel in favor of unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state by the United Nations. The Palestinian plan to win that one-sided endorsement from the U.N. this month in New York threatens Israel and insults the United States. The U.S. and the U.N. have long supported the idea that Israel and its neighbors should make peace through direct negotiations. The Palestinian leadership has dealt directly with Israel since 1993 but has refused to do so since March 2010. They seem to prefer theatrics in New York to the hard work of negotiation and compromise that peace will require. Errors by the Obama administration have encouraged the Palestinians to take backward steps away from peace. It was a mistake to call for an Israeli construction freeze, including in Jerusalem, as an unprecedented precondition for talks. Indeed, the Palestinian leadership had been negotiating with Israel for years, notwithstanding settlement activity. When the Obama administration demanded a settlement freeze, it led to a freeze in Palestinian negotiations. It was a mistake to agree to the Palestinians' demand for indirect negotiations conducted through the U.S., and it was an even greater mistake for President Obama to distance himself from Israel and seek engagement with the hostile regimes in Syria and Iran. Palestinian leaders have perceived this as a weakening of relations between Israel and the U.S, and they are trying to exploit it. In taking this destabilizing action in the U.N., the Palestinians are signaling that they have no interest in a two-state solution. The Palestinian leadership's insistence on the so-called ""right of return"" of descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel's sovereign territory, thereby making Jews an ethnic minority in their own state, is a disturbing sign that the ultimate Palestinian ""solution"" remains the destruction of the Jewish state. The U.S.and the U.Nshould do everything possible to discourage the Palestinian leadership from pursuing its current course. The U.S. should oppose the statehood measure by using our veto in the Security Council, as President Obama has pledged to do, and by doing everything we can to weaken support for the unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood in the General Assembly. The U.S. must affirm that the precondition for any properly negotiated future settlement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is the formal recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state behind secure borders. Since the Oslo accords were signed in 1993, the U.S. has provided more than $4 billion in aid to the Palestinian Authority. This year alone, the Obama administration is seeking to secure $550 million in funding for Palestinians. The U.S. has an interest in the development of Palestinian civil society and institutions. We should encourage Palestinians who are more interested in building a prosperous future than in fueling the grievances of the past. Our aid is, and must remain, predicated on the commitment of the Palestinian leadership to engage honestly and directly with the Israelis in negotiating a peace settlement. Their threatened unilateral action in the U.N. signals a failure to abide by this commitment. We must not condone and legitimize through our assistance a regime whose actions are in direct opposition to a peace agreement and to our vital interests. The Palestinian people should understand that their leaders are now putting this much-needed support in jeopardy and act in their own best interestswhich are also the interests of peace."

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 22, 2011",Press Release - Rewriting Romney,"From the Boston Phoenix, Feb. 10, 2011, http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2011/02/10/romney-rewrites-sampler.aspx Romney Rewrites, Sampler Published Feb 10 2011, 10:16 AM by David S. Bernstein There's been a lot of pick-up on my item about changes in the new paperback edition of Mitt Romney's ""No Apology."" I didn't have room to provide more than a summary there, so I thought I'd provide more of the changes here, so people can judge for themselves. Bear in mind that the remainder of the book (other than the new introduction) is virtually unchanged  aside from the two sections I wrote about, I could only identify five paragraphs altered in the entire book, all of which were either to change something to past tense, or to remove something that is no longer true (eg, ""there has never been an oil spill from an offshore platform""). Oh, and to remove journalist Nina Easton from the acknowledgements. (Perhaps at her request, after she got grief for the ethics of advising Romney.) .... Next, the section titled ""The Massachusetts Model"" in the chapter ""Healing Health Care."" The first paragraph of that section in the hardcover has been completely removed; here it is: In 2009, the national health-care policy supported by Barack Obama was often and erroneously reported as being based on the plan we enacted in Massachusetts. There were some big differences  in particular, our plan did not include a public insurance option. The notion of getting the federal government into the health-insurance business is a very bad idea. Government-supplied insurance would inevitably be subsidized at great cost to the taxpayers and, combined with Medicare and Medicaid, it would give government the kind of monopoly we would never allow a private entity to claim. Clearly, the public insurance option is simply a transitional step toward the president's stated goal of creating a single-payer system, one in which the nation's sole health insurer would be the federal government. You can see the problem: he argued that the major difference is the public option, which did not end up being part of the federal law. That paragraph is gone in the new edition. Over the next several paragraphs, there are a few other removals and changes, mostly removing suggestions or hints about how to do national health-care reform right. One good example comes at the end of a paragraph boasting of the success of his plan in Massachusetts. The original paragraph ends with this sentence: We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care. That has been replaced with: And it was done without government taking over health care. The biggest change, however, is the addition of seven paragraphs at the end of the section. Here are some excerpts: ...When the bill was signed, we noted that as with any experiment, it would need mid-course corrections. In addition, we knew that the legislature had added a number of troublesome provisions to the program  subsequent data would prove that these would be among the necessary corrections. I am often asked how I would make the program better. First, of course, I would reinstitute my vetoes of the legislature's additions.... I would also have rather provided a tax break for those who have health insurance rather than a tax penalty for those without health insurance.... I would have made very different choices in the years since I left office than those that were made by the Democrats. When the reform was passed, for example, we required everyone who received subsidized insurance to pay a fair share of their premiums  the new liberal administration decided that some people should get their insurance for nothing. Imagine the additional cost to the state of such a decision. Imagine as well the incentive it creates for people  particularly unhealthy people  to move into the state.... There is no question in my mind that our program could be significantly improved if it were managed by a conservative administration.... Had we not passed out program, it is probable that an expensive entitlement would have been imposed on Massachusetts taxpayers: a ballot initiative would have made government-provided health care for every resident a constitutional right - and that initiative was leading in the polls. And it has been an instructive experiment, teaching both the ""do"" and ""don't"".... Here is why Obamacare will not work and should be repealed. First, the Massachusetts health-care plan was designed for Massachusetts, not for every state and not for the nation.... Second, Obamacare was a major departure from what we had crafted: It raised taxes, cut benefits for seniors, and imposed laborious burdens on small business  we did not. His bill was over two thousand pages and is intended as a step toward a government takeover of health care; our bill was seventy pages and was intended as a step toward market-driven health care. Our reform was constitutional; Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states. And, as Florida's Marco Rubio put it: ""Even if Obamacare was a good program, which it is not, we simply cannot afford more federal spending. [Italics in original]"

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 22, 2011",Press Release - Setting the Record Straight: State Employees Not Covered by Social Security,"State-run pension funds for their public employees and retirees is not a new idea. Every state administers pension programs for their public employees and retirees, many of whom are not covered by Social Security, including Massachusetts. In fact, more than 95 percent of Massachusetts state employees do not participate in Social Security. The original Social Security Act of 1935 did not extend coverage to state and local workers. Beginning in the 1950's, the law was changed to allow states and local governments to opt in to coverage. Until April of 1983, state governments could opt out of Social Security entirely on behalf of their public employees. In 1983, new legislation banned state governments from opting their employees out of Social Security once they accepted coverage (i.e., once a state opted in, it could never again opt out)."

'I think Secretary Duncan has done some good things,' he said. 'I hope that's not heresy in this room.'"" [1] Romney told the Floridians, ""I think the American people recognize we're at a point of crisis. They can tell when people are being phony and pandering to an audience.

At a June town hall meeting in New Hampshire, Romney said he vehemently opposed the Obama Administration's takeover of education standards and curriculum. [3] A concerned New Hampshire parent asked, ""Right now we have Obama taking over education, too, setting national standards. We're going to have a national assessment, which gives us a de facto national curriculum. My question to you is, would you tell me your views on this, number one, and would you come out against this?"" Romney spoke strongly against the Obama Administration's school takeover: ""Issues like education, these are going to be handled at the state and local level, closest to the people. ... If Barack Obama says I'm going to take that and impose it on the nation, I will fight it to the 'n'th degree. It's against the Constitution and it's wrong for America. ... I can't imagine an America where you're going to have a White House, Republican or Democrat, or a Congress, Republican or a Democrat, laying out what our kids have to be taught. That is unacceptable."" Mitt Romney is flip-flopping again on important public policy issues. ""In his latest flip-flop, Mr. Romney is on both sides of the Obama Administration's takeover of public school standards and curriculum. In Florida, he praises Obama's school takeover, but in New Hampshire he attacked Obama's school takeover,"" said Perry spokesman Mark Miner.

As his campaign strengthens and gains support, Gov. Rick Perry's conservative agenda and record were again the center of attention at the FOX New Channel/ Google debate in Orlando, Florida tonight. Perry shared his steadfast commitment to get America working again as the next president of the United States, defended his conservative economic and social policy record in Texas and reiterated his goal to speak honestly and effectively about reforming Social Security to protect current and near beneficiaries and fix it for younger workers. ""Americans are concerned with getting our economy back on track to prosperity and creating the jobs that Americans are desperately looking for,"" said Gov. Perry. ""I am proud of the record I have in Texas working to create an environment that creates jobs and in turn opportunity for our people, and I look forward to applying our blueprint for success at the national level  a model based on restrained spending, low taxes, predictable regulations and a fair legal climate."" On job creation, Gov. Perry has the best record of job creation among all the candidates, including President Obama. Texas has created more than one million net new jobs under Gov. Perry and is home to approximately 40 percent of all net new jobs in America since June 2009. Perry contrasted his renowned pro-jobs record with the failed record of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who signature accomplishment  government-mandated health care  was the model for the job-killing federal ObamaCare. Romney's Massachusetts was 47th in job creation during his term in office. Gov. Perry's strong record of cutting taxes, signing six balanced budgets, reducing general revenue spending and leading America's top job-creating state makes him the candidate America needs to create jobs and get our nation's fiscal house in order. In fact, he is the only Texas governor since World War II to cut state general revenue spending.

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 22, 2011",Press Release - Romney Health Plan a Bust for Massachusetts - CATO Institute,"Highlights from a recent Cato Institute report: SAME AS OBAMACARE: As part of his liberal phase when governor of Massachusetts  political principles have been ever-flexible for Romney  he orchestrated passage of legislation with eerie similarities to ObamaCare. MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who advised both Gov. Romney and President Obama on health care, asserted: ""Basically, it's the same thing."" GOVERNMENT MANDATE: Alas, even the former governor's constitutional scruples are suspect. In 1994 he backed a federal mandate. His concern about the overweening federal government apparently was not so finely developed then. BUDGET-BUSTER: Last year State Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill wrote: ""The universal insurance coverage we adopted in 2006 was projected to cost taxpayers $88 million a year. However, since this program was adopted in 2006, our health-care costs have in total exceeded $4 billion. The cost of Massachusetts' plan has blown a hole in the Commonwealth's budget."" Full report below and available here.  Romney Health Plan a Bust for Massachusetts By Doug Bandow Health care remains one of President Barack Obama's greatest political weaknesses. The issue remains an equally serious problem for Republican Mitt Romney. President Obama's program to centralize medical decision-making in Washington remains as unpopular as ever. Insurers are raising premiums and canceling policies. The president's promise that Americans can keep their existing coverage has turned out to be void. Health care providers and insurers are cutting back operations and dropping jobs to comply with the new law. Washington has been forced to issue temporary waivers  over 1400, as of mid-June  to moderate the legislation's impact. No GOP presidential contender officially supported the administration legislation. However, Mitt Romney instituted an early variant of the Obama program. Moreover, ObamaCare has bent the cost curve upward by reinforcing the underlying third party payment problem. The administration even double counted its imagined cost savings, causing Medicare's chief actuary to warn that the program's latest estimates were essentially fraudulent. Future Congresses will have to reduce promised benefits or public subsidies, or hike spending. As part of his liberal phase when governor of Massachusetts  political principles have been ever-flexible for Romney  he orchestrated passage of legislation with eerie similarities to ObamaCare. Massachusetts mandates purchase of insurance, decides what benefits must be offered, and maintains a complex system of subsidies and penalties. Declared Boston Globe columnist Adrian Walker, the two programs are ""not identical, but they're certainly close kin."" MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who advised both Gov. Romney and President Obama on health care, asserted: ""Basically, it's the same thing."" Out of either policy pride or political calculation, Romney continues to defend his approach as ""a model that works."" But he probably could not escape the legacy even if he wanted to. Walker wrote: ""Health care was Romney's greatest achievement by so wide a margin that it's hard to know what to compare it to."" However, Romney has grown increasingly desperate to distinguish his legislation from that of Obama. The best the former can say is that his program was constitutional, since states possess the so-called ""police power,"" allowing them to regulate most anything within their jurisdiction. In contrast, the federal government was created with only limited, enumerated powers. The Founders would never have imagined that Washington could force people to purchase health insurance under the guise of regulating ""commerce among the states."" (So far the federal courts have split on the issue.) Alas, even the former governor's constitutional scruples are suspect. In 1994 he backed a federal mandate. His concern about the overweening federal government apparently was not so finely developed then. In any case, the fact that RomneyCare is constitutional does not mean that it is wise. Americans want their president to exercise good judgment and common sense, as well as respect the office's constitutional limits. RomneyCare fails the first two standards. Yet so far Romney has gotten off easy in the Republican contest. In the first debate former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty failed to criticize Romney on the issue of ""ObamneyCare,"" as Pawlenty termed it, when given the opportunity. Pawlenty's belated attempt to toughen his message highlighted his political weaknesses, and he soon departed the race. (In fact, Pawlenty as well as former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman both supported a mandate, though their respective state legislatures eventually passed more limited legislation.) Texas Gov. Rick Perry may end Romney's easy ride. Perry already has gone after Romney, observing: ""I think Mitt is finally recognizing that the Massachusetts healthcare plan that he passed is a huge problem for him, and yeah, it was not almost perfect."" This is likely only the first of many hits. ""ObamneyCare"" was not a revolutionary attempt to overturn the status quo. Rather, the usual special interests did quite well. The American Prospect's Robert Kuttner observed: ""In Massachusetts, Romney needed and got buy-in from the powerful hospital, insurance, and corporate lobbies. To win that support, he could not fundamentally change the way they did business. Instead, private insurance companies got more customers thanks to the individual mandate, hospitals kept their beds full, and corporations that failed to insure employees paid only a token penalty of $295 per worker."" Romney's legislation sought to extend insurance coverage. About 95% to 96%  the state claims 98.1%, but the actual rate appears to be lower  of Massachusetts residents now are insured. That is a genuine achievement but still not universal coverage. Moreover, as Peter Suderman of Reason observed, ""the state's insurance coverage rates were already unusually high to begin with: About 90% of the state's population had health coverage prior to the law's passage."" In short, Gov. Romney's accomplishment actually was rather modest. Moreover, at what cost? Defenders of RomneyCare argue that its goal was to expand coverage, not to cut expenditures, but Gov. Romney was not alone in promising ""affordable"" health care. Anyway, the legislation certainly was not supposed to drive costs skyward. However, paying for more benefits for more people inevitably makes medicine more expensive. Costs for Commonwealth Care, the Massachusetts government's subsidized insurance program alone are up a fifth over initial projections. Last year State Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill wrote: ""The universal insurance coverage we adopted in 2006 was projected to cost taxpayers $88 million a year. However, since this program was adopted in 2006, our health-care costs have in total exceeded $4 billion. The cost of Massachusetts' plan has blown a hole in the Commonwealth's budget."" State finances have not collapsed only because RomneyCare spread the costs widely, forcing virtually everyone in and out of the state to share the pain. Cahill cited federal subsidies as keeping the state afloat financially. Indeed, a June study from the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that ""The state has been able to shift the majority of the costs to the federal government."" The Institute pointed to higher costs of $8.6 billion since the law was implemented. Just $414 million was paid by Massachusetts. Medicaid (federal payments) covered $2.4 billion. Medicare took care of $1.4 billion. But even more costs, $4.3 billion, have been imposed on the private sector  employers, insurers, and residents. This estimate is in line with an earlier study by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which figured that 60% of the new costs fell on individuals and businesses. As expenses have risen, so have premiums. Noted Kuttner, ""because serious cost containment was not part of the original package, premium costs in the commonwealth have risen far faster than nationally  by 10.3%, the most recent year available."" Economists John F. Cogan, Glenn Hubbard, and Daniel Kessler figured that RomneyCare inflated premiums by 6% from 2006 to 2008. This at a time where the state-subsidized Commonwealth Care was displacing private insurance for many people, thereby reducing demand, which should have reduced cost pressures. Unfortunately, noted the Beacon Hill Institute, ""private companies have no choice but to pass the higher costs onto the insured. Some of these costs fall in the double-digit range."" That naturally displeased public officials, since it undercut their claim to have solved Massachusetts' health care problems. Gov. Deval Patrick responded like King Canute: he insisted that premiums not rise. Predictably, his rejection of proposed rate hikes required insurers to operate at a loss and placed several in financial jeopardy. Robert Dynan, the career insurance commissioner tasked with maintaining insurer solvency, wrote that the state ""implemented artificial price caps on HMO rates. The rates, by design, have no actuarial support."" Last year Sandy Praeger, Kansas' insurance Commissioner, observed: ""Right now, premium increase have never been more political. If there is any way to justify not granting the increase, commissioners are looking for them."" Thankfully, Gov. Patrick's price controls did not fare well when challenged in court and his administration eventually negotiated reduced rate hikes. But the governor then came up with a new legislative program to arbitrarily reduce medical costs. Even weaker restrictions would be counterproductive. The Beacon Hill Institute warned that ""Controlling costs will translate into capping services provided by physicians and other caregivers. These are, in effect, price controls that will dampen the incentive to provide services and lead to longer wait times and the rationing of healthcare."" Even worse, bankrupt insurance carriers would mean either no health care coverage or expensive government bail-outs. Yet John Graham of the Pacific Research Institute detailed shrinking margins and pervasive losses for Massachusetts health insurers. He warned ""that if politicians refuse to allow health plans to increase their premiums at a rate commensurate with the increase in medical costs, health plans will plunge into financial crisis within a remarkably short period of time."" Indeed, carriers ""will stand at the precipice of insolvency if the political class in Massachusetts insists on continuing to follow the path that it has chosen."" Unfortunately, worse is likely to come. The Rand Corporation concluded that ""in the absence of policy change, health care spending in Massachusetts is projected to nearly double to $123 billion in 2020, increasing 8% faster than the state's"" GDP. Added Rand, continued cost increases of this magnitude ""threaten the long-term viability of the initiative."" Nor can the state count on an increasingly strapped federal government to continue its generous subsidies. Moreover, at some point people and businesses will flee the state rather than pay ever more to underwrite the state's health care program. Finally, RomneyCare inflated demand for medical services without increasing the corresponding supply. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded: ""The vast number of the newly insured residents in Massachusetts is responsible for bottlenecks in the primary care system that forces residents to utilize emergency room care at a significantly higher than expected rate."" A fifth of adults report difficulty in finding a physician to treat them. Earlier this year the Massachusetts Medical Society discovered ""more than half of primary care practices closed to new patients, longer wait times to get appointments with primary and specialty physicians, and significant variations in physician acceptance of government and government-related insurance products."" New York internist Marc Siegel observed: ""The wait time for an appointment is now routinely over a month for primary-care doctors and specialists. Internists and family practitioners report being so overwhelmed  too many patients, too much time pressure  that more than half are closing their practices to new patients."" You'd think Massachusetts was a province of Canada. The state's subsidized programs effectively drive away doctors. Explained Siegel: ""More than half of primary-care docs in Massachusetts find themselves unable to work with Medicaid or Commonwealth Care (state-subsidized insurance), which both pay providers poorly."" Acceptance rates are far lower than even for Medicare, and one Massachusetts legislator has proposed making medical licensure contingent upon acceptance of state-subsidized plans. Although the expansion of insurance was supposed to reduce emergency room use, visits rose 9% from 2004 to 2008. Ironically, noted Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, ""difficulties in getting primary care have led to an increasing number of patients who rely on emergency rooms for basic medical services."" Thus, uncompensated care still costs more than $400 million annually. The state also encouraged adverse selection, as predicted. Many healthy people chose to remain uninsured and pay the fine (or lie about having purchased coverage). They then bought insurance when sick, and dropped the policy when it was no longer necessary. Massachusetts was forced to institute an open enrollment period, limiting when people could sign up for insurance  an otherwise bizarre restriction when the objective is to increase the number of people insured. ObamneyCare is bad policy. Gov. Romney's signature policy achievement, no less than President Obama's principal legislative victory, is a bust. At least Mitt Romney did not compound bad policy with unconstitutionality, but his health care failure inevitably taints his presidential bid. He rightly faces an uphill task in convincing Republican primary voters that he is the best choice to be their nominee."

According to a 2010 study (""The Effect of Massachusetts' Health Reform on Employer-Sponsored Insurance Premiums"") co-authored by Romney's own chief economic advisor, Glenn Hubbard:  Romneycare is the same as Obamacare. Romneycare increased single-coverage employer-sponsored insurance premiums in Massachusetts by about 6% more than national rates, or $262, in just two years.  Hubbard's conclusions:  Romneycare ""imposed a very large burden on small businesses and their employees."" ""Because the Plan's [Romneycare] main components are the same as those of the new health reform law [Obamacare], the effects of the Plan provide a window onto the country's future."" ""Policy makers should be concerned about the consequences of health reform for the cost of private insurance.""  ""Mr. Romney can edit his book or run from the issue, but his own advisors say Obamacare and Romneycare are identical, costly job killers,"" Miner continued. ""Romneycare will prove to be the same political cement shoes that Obamacare is for Barak Obama's reelection effort."" According to the study, in the years since the implementation of Romneycare:  Premiums for single coverage at private sector employers in Massachusetts rose by 5.9% more than national rates. Premiums for family policies in Massachusetts rose by 1.5% more than national rates, but in the Boston MSA, those premiums rose by 8.1% more than premiums in the 19 largest other MSAs in the country. Family premiums for small employers in Massachusetts rose by 14.4% more than national rates.

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 26, 2011",Press Release - Perry Op-Ed: Cleaning Up Washington's Mess,"Gov. Rick Perry penned this op-ed, which appears at Tea Party Brew Texas Governor Rick Perry on job creation, border security, and Washington's failure to do anything useful about either. Tea Party Brew welcomes the Governor and his participation in our premiere. Over the past few years, we've seen what happens when our country chooses leaders who emphasize words over deeds. For all of the president's eloquent speeches, he's done nothing to right America's wayward course. As jobs are lost, so is the hope he once promised. Meanwhile, the federal government has grown bigger and more brazen, willfully neglecting its constitutional duties. Washington's mess has spilled across the country. Nearly 2.5 million jobs have been lost under this Administration. 45 million Americans are now on food stamps. And the president has added $4 trillion to our debt, costing us the first credit downgrade in American history. In spite of the widespread misery created by this president, in Texas, we've found ways to clean up Washington's mess. Most importantly, we've rejected the over-taxing, over-spending, over-regulating philosophy that does nothing but kill jobs. As Governor, I've signed 65 tax cuts totaling more than $14 billion. I was the first governor to cut state spending since World War II. And we've passed sweeping lawsuit reforms, including a loser pay law, and fought Washington's intrusive job-killing regulations. It's not a coincidence that my state has gained more than one million new jobs in the past decade, or that Texas is responsible for nearly 40 percent of all net new jobs in America since June 2009. It's proof that the conservative philosophy works  when it's implemented by leaders who emphasize actions over words. While it's tough to overstate the economic impact of Washington's failure, nowhere is the federal government's mess more apparent than along our international border. At least 35,000 people have died in the Mexican drug war that threatens to spill into our country on a daily basis. The border with Mexico is viewed as a prime point of entry by terrorist organizations, criminal gangs and drug traffickers. And because the federal government has abdicated its constitutional responsibility to secure our border, millions of immigrants have been allowed to enter the country illegally. As a result, state governments across the country are forced to deal with the consequences of Washington's failure. With 60 percent of the total US-Mexico border, no state has been hit harder than Texas. That's why, as Governor, I have implemented the most aggressive state-led border security initiative in America. We created a state Border Security Operations Center to coordinate intelligence and assets in an 80,000 square mile region. I have authorized the use of National Guard personnel, state trooper strike teams, covert surveillance units, canine tracking teams, DPS helicopters, game wardens and the Texas Civil Air Patrol to help border sheriffs and police stop illegal activity. And I directed nearly $400 million of Texans' tax dollars to pay for these measures  money we could have used for our schools, roads or a host of other priorities if it weren't for Washington's inaction. As a result of our state-led initiatives, we've created major disruptions for international smuggling rings, seized millions of pounds of illegal drugs, taken 3,500 illegal weapons off the street, and made our state  and all of America  safer. In Texas, we understand the consequences of Washington's failure to secure the border. And we are proud to do our part, voluntarily paying a price that no other state has paid. Nobody from Washington had to ask Texas taxpayers to pay for these measures. Nobody from Washington had to ask our border sheriffs and state law enforcement officers to put their lives on the line to do a job that they weren't willing to do themselves. We did it because it was the right thing to do for our state and our nation, and because actions matter far more than words."

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 27, 2011",Press Release - Mitt Romney's Race To The Flop,"Different days, different venues, different Romney positions on Obama's federal takeover of education On issues important to American voters, Mitt Romney has never been known to stick to a position for long. As highlighted at the recent debate, he is finding it particularly easy to be both for and against President Obama's national school testing and curriculum requirements known as Race to the Top. Mr. Romney's fluid positions are on display in the video, ""Romney's Race To The Flop."" ""Last week at a Florida town hall, Governor Romney praised President Obama's Secretary of Education and the Obama Administration's federal school mandates, then flip-flopped the very next day claiming he was against Obama's school mandates,"" said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. ""His positions change as his audience and political climate changes."" ""Whether it's government-mandated health insurance or federal encroachment on America's public schools, Mr. Romney's smooth delivery hides positions that change with the political climate. The next president needs to have strong conservative principles Americans can count on,"" Sullivan said. At a town hall in meeting in Florida, Romney strongly and articulately praised Obama's federal takeover of education: ""I think Secretary [Arne] Duncan has done some good things. He is the current Secretary of Education. He, for instance, has a program called Race to the Top which encourages schools to have more choice, more testing of kids, more evaluation of teachers. Those are things I think make, make some sense."" The next night at the Florida GOP debate, when confronted by Gov. Perry about standing with Obama on Race to the Top, Romney denied his position: ""I'm not sure exactly what he's saying. I don't support any particular program that he's describing."" Just yesterday, Mr. Romney was knocked for editing his book, No Apology, to remove his statement that Romneycare's government mandated health insurance plan is a model for the nation. The paperback version of the book removed that phrase. At last week's debate, Romney proudly explained that his words have meaning and were written down. Given the constant flips and shifts, most of Mr. Romney's words seem to have expiration dates."

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 29, 2011",Press Release - Obama's Environmentalist Army Declares War on West Virginia Jobs,"President's agenda will kill 7,000 mining jobs nationwide Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign today is calling upon President Obama to freeze proposed mining regulations that will kill good jobs in West Virginia, increase dependence on foreign energy sources and raise electricity prices for consumers nationwide. Today Gov. Perry is visiting West Virginia, where he will continue to share his record and vision of fiscal conservatism and job creation. ""President Obama claims to be a 'warrior for the middle class,' but his job-killing regulatory policies are hammering middle class families already struggling to make ends meet,"" said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. ""The president should freeze the proposed federal regulations endangering thousands of West Virginia jobs and the very existence of the industry that provides 44 percent of America's electricity."" The Perry campaign cited the U.S. Office of Surface Mining's rewrite of the Stream Buffer Zone Rule, which could kill as many as 7,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, or 10 percent of industry total, according to the agency's own estimates. ""Our families cannot afford four more years of a president sacrificing thousands of jobs and crippling American energy production so he can energize his liberal political base,"" said Miner. President Obama's policies indicate that he is intent on shutting down the U.S. coal industry, as he admitted in a 2008 interview: ""So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can; it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.""[1] The president's ideologically driven objectives on greenhouse gases are so extreme, in fact, that the EPA recently admitted it would require 230,000 new federal bureaucrats to fully implement the terms of the Clean Air Act. The agency's admission confirms that the Clean Air Act was never intended to apply to greenhouse gases. Rather than simply concede that fact, the Obama administration has attempted to rewrite the Clean Air Act to satisfy its radical agenda of regulating the entire economy based on emissions. ""Gov. Perry knows we do not have to sacrifice our economy to protect our environment, and we do not have to pit our health against our jobs,"" said Miner. ""Even President Obama realizes that his environmental extremism is hurting the economy, and that's why he reluctantly backed off enforcement of smog rules. But if the president is serious about creating jobs, he will freeze all proposed federal regulations for six months, starting today."""

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 5, 2011","Press Release - ""Why I Support Rick Perry"": Dr. Melissa Clouthier","Dr. Melissa Clouthier, a widely-read and well-respected conservative blogger, wrote a great piece on her support of Rick Perry to get America working again: Rick Perry will be the next President of the United States if I have anything to do with it. Who am I? I'm a mom, a doctor, a business owner, a former Michigander, Californian and New Yorker, a conservative with a libertarian streak, a Tea Party attender and reporter, a blogger, an activist, and for 14 years, a Texan. Dr. Clouthier is also one of the most prolific conservatives on twitter. I live under the light hand of the Texas systema hand that Governor Perry has done everything in his power to make lighter. He cut the size and scope of government even as the Texas population grew faster than any place in the nation. We started a business here with nothing but a credit card. You know how much money we were making a month when we first moved here fourteen years ago? Two thousand a month. Gross. With a baby. Slowly, surely, we built our business and life here. When we first got to Texas, my husband worked with doctors who were heavily involved in the Worker's Comp (work injuries) and Personal Injury (car accidents) system. It was rife with abuse. There were rings of lawyers, doctors, and accident fakers who exploited the system. Governor Perry directly took on the fraud and abuse which meant taking on the trial lawyers association. In one day after the law was passed (my husband had long since gone into practice for himself and had a holistic practice), the shysters lost the whole scam. It was beautiful to behold. And then, this last year, Governor Perry pushed through ""loser pays"" on lawsuits. I cannot even tell you how much lawyers in Texas hate Rick Perry. And it's one reason I love his record. It's also a reason, they'll fight tooth and nail against him nationally. Perry has curbed malpractice judgments. So now, doctors are moving to Texas in droves. The Houston medical center is a haven of medical innovation and bold new treatments. People fly from all over the country to come here for cancer treatment and more. When a family member was diagnosed with cancer, do you know how long it took to get an appointment with the number one specialist in the world? Less than one week. I would shudder to be in Massachusetts suffering under impossibly long doctor wait times. Rick Perry has fought Barack Obama from day one. I don't know how many lawsuits have been filed back and forth against the federal government, but I know there's multiple fights with the EPA, there's Obamacare, there's Medicaid, there's the border, and on and on. Other people talk about fighting President Obama. Governor Perry has gone straight at President Obama's socialist agenda and tangled with him both rhetorically and in the courts of law. Dr. Clouthier offers a clear distinction between Rick Perry, President Obama, and the other GOP candidates, highlighting Gov. Perry's record and conservative resolve. I want our president to know what it's like to have skin in the game, to be in the military...to sacrifice. Rick Perry was a C-130 air force pilot who finished as Captain. Pilots need to make quick decisions in demanding situations..life and death decisions. Governor Perry is solidly anti-abortion, pro-gun-rights, anti-job killing regulations, pro-capitalist, pro-America, pro-Israel, and for economic expansion. More than being for these things, his professional walk supports these things. He doesn't just talk or evangelize (though he does both), his record supports these principles. I believe that Governor Perry can bring the success that his administration facilitated in Texas to America. The Obama-Keynesian experiment has been an abject failure. What's the alternative? A mushy Mitt Romneyesque big government Republicanism that expands the power of the government just at a slower rate? A rhetorical flourish from a businessman with no legislative experience? Please take a moment to share this on facebook and twitter with the sharing links at the top of the page. Read Dr. Clouthier's full write-up here."

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 6, 2011",Press Release - President Obama Doesn't Get Job Creation; Must Be Replaced to Get America Working Again,"Texas ""in recovery"" while Obama economy ""close to faltering"" AUSTIN  At a news conference today, President Obama again signaled unwavering belief that a bigger, more intrusive federal government can jump-start the faltering U.S. economy. That blind commitment to government-based solutions is why America's recovery depends on replacing the President. While President Obama's failed big-government liberalism is prolonging national economic misery, two new reports show that positive job and economic growth continues in Texas. Since the national recession began in late 2007, Texas has responded by passing two balanced budgets, reducing spending, and cutting taxes 23 times for a total of $742 million in savings. [1] As a result, Texas is home to nearly 40 percent of the net new jobs in America since June 2009. ""Every day it is clearer that for the United States economy to grow and succeed, we need a new President,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""At his news conference today, President Obama again showed his blind commitment to the same pro-tax, pro-government, pro-regulation policies that have failed our nation. ""America needs new a new leader with a proven record of job creation and sound economic policies. Texas is not immune to the effects of the national economic environment, but recent reports show that low, flat and fair taxes, fair and predictable regulations, and restrained government spending is a proven recipe for job creation."" The Associated Press is reporting today, ""Texas tax revenues have bounced back to levels nearly equal to pre-recession levels indicating that the economy is in recovery, the state's chief revenue estimator said Wednesday."" [2] In its Oct. 2011 report released yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said, ""The Texas economy grew at a modest pace, with employment expanding at a 1.6 percent annual rate in August. Texas home sales rose in August along with single-family permits and housing starts. Texas exports inched up in July, and manufacturing activity increased in August, according to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey's production index."" [3] While the Texas economy grows, the national economy falters. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday that the economic recovery ""is close to faltering."" Bernanke said that the economy is growing more slowly than the Federal Reserve had expected, and that the biggest factor depressing consumer confidence is poor job growth. [4] The AP is also reporting today, ""The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, a sign that the job market remains weak.""

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 6, 2011","Press Release - ""Interviewing Rick Perry On Illegal Immigration""","John Hawkins recently interviewed Governor Rick Perry about border security, illegal immigration, and his record as governor. On the Federal DREAM Act: The federal DREAM Act is an amnesty bill, and I strongly oppose amnesty. The Texas educational residency bill was vastly different. Because the federal government has failed in its basic duty to protect our borders, states are forced to deal with illegal immigrant issues. In Texas, we had to deal with the children of illegal immigrants residing in our state and attending our schools, as the federal government requires states to educate these children through the public school system. Lawmakers in Texas  indisputably one of the most conservative states in America  were virtually unanimous in their decision. The Legislature determined the payment of in-state college tuition is available to all students who have lived in Texas for at least three years and graduated from a public high school. If you meet those requirements, you pay in-state tuition, whether you relocated from Oklahoma, Idaho, Canada or Mexico. The only difference is that Texas residents who aren't documented must be on the path to pursue U.S. citizenship to be allowed to pay in-state tuition. There were a number of reasons the bill received widespread support among conservatives. Importantly, it has never had a cost to Texas taxpayers. In fact, our institutions of higher learning would actually lose tens of millions of dollars in lost tuition payments if the law were repealed. And it would lower the odds that these students would receive subsidized health care or end up in prison. Protecting taxpayers was a serious concern, given that a Supreme Court decree already requires taxpayers to pay for K-12 education for undocumented students. On the Texas tution law: I too oppose the federal DREAM Act and will oppose it as President. Because the federal government has failed to secure the border, states have had to act. In Texas we have sent Texas Rangers to the border, spent hundreds of millions to fight border crime, outlawed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants and passed Voter ID. On the issue of all Texas residents paying in-state tuition, I regret the comment from the debate. It was a poor choice of words, and it wasn't fair to those who disagree with the policy. On abolishing ""sanctuary cities"" in Texas I called for abolishing sanctuary cities in my last State of the State address, and made it an emergency item for the Legislature. I'm a firm believer in giving law enforcement the discretion they need to do their job. Sanctuary city policies handcuff law enforcement officers in order to further a political agenda. On banning drivers licenses for illegal immigrants: I signed that bill because getting a driver's license is a privilege, not a right. It just doesn't make sense to me to extend that privilege to individuals who are here illegally. Additionally, I vetoed a bill that would have allowed the use of a matricula consular, which is an ID card used by the Mexican government, to get a driver's license in Texas. Driver's licenses are used for a host of activities besides driving, like making financial transactions, boarding airplanes, renting vehicles and proving your identity to government authorities. The Department of Homeland Security has expressed concern that the matricula consular is particularly susceptible to fraud, which means you can't rely on it to prove someone's identity. So if you allow someone to use it to get a driver's license, you've got some pretty serious homeland security implications. On the Arizona law: I support the right of each state to come up with its own plan to address the federal government's failure on border security and illegal immigration. The federal government has failed to secure the border, and states are left fending for themselves. States have every right under the 10th Amendment to pass laws and make decisions for themselves. That's why Texas supported Arizona when the Obama Administration sued to overturn Arizona law. If Washington politicians don't like the way state leaders are cleaning up their mess, they should quit complaining and pick up a broom. If they just did their job securing the border in the first place, states wouldn't be forced to develop with their own policies. In Texas, our efforts have focused on stopping the illegal flow of narcotics and people before they cross the border, rather than once they get here. It's the philosophy that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We've spent about $400 million of our state tax dollars to put more boots on the ground, more helicopters in the sky and better intelligence in the hands of law enforcement. And we've seen real results. Our surge in manpower has created major disruptions for the drug cartels and human smuggling rings. We've seized millions of pounds of drugs, taken 3,500 illegal weapons off the street and made America safer. Securing the border and enforcing immigration laws are the federal government's constitutional responsibility, and it's time for Washington to do its job. In the meantime, I respect the right of all states to develop their own solutions, whether they use the Texas model or the Arizona model. I applaud my fellow governors who are showing leadership on this issue, because President Obama certainly has not. On the border fence: I have long been a proponent of strategic fencing because it is a critical component of border security, and it works when used in the right places. I think what caused the hang up was that after it was passed, it was amended to give Homeland Security complete discretion on how, when and whether the fence ever gets built. Obviously with this president, that means it will never be completed. If I'm elected, I will direct my Secretary of Homeland Security to expedite construction of strategic fencing along the border, especially in high traffic areas where manpower alone is insufficient to do the job. But it's important to remember that fencing is only one component of an overall border security strategy. A fence is only as secure as it is manned. That's why I would increase manpower on the border, starting with thousands of National Guard and border patrol agents, and I'd also make greater use of unmanned aerial vehicles to help gather real-time law enforcement intelligence. We know for a fact that increased manpower is effective, because we've proved it in Texas with our $400 million border security effort. For John Hawkin's full interview, click here."

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 11, 2011",Press Release - Gov. Perry: We Must Remove Energy Production Obstacles to Create Jobs,"Gov. Perry penned this op-ed, which appears in the October 11 New Hampshire Union Leader Two of the biggest challenges facing the United States are getting people back to work and becoming less dependent on foreign oil from hostile countries. Unfortunately, the President's rigid belief that stimulus spending could create private-sector jobs has failed and left us with higher unemployment and skyrocketing debt. His energy policies undermine America's security by making it more difficult for entrepreneurs and private employers to produce domestic energy resources. Instead of developing proven U.S. oil and gas resources, Washington has curtailed energy exploration. The Gulf of Mexico restrictions alone have cost up to 12,000 jobs and forced drilling platforms to relocate to other countries. America needs energy and more jobs. Our economic and national security depend on it. That's why later this week I will unveil a plan to energize job creation across the country and help make America more energy secure and less dependent on foreign oil from hostile countries. This plan is the first phase of a broader economic strategy I will reveal in the near future, and it requires no congressional action, only the strong executive leadership of a President. As President, I will bring an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy to increasing our energy production, using all of our natural resources  conventional and renewable, on-shore and offshore, including oil, gas, wind, solar, coal and nuclear. I will begin by immediately authorizing the release of some federal lands and waters for energy development, so we can start creating good jobs in the energy sector as soon as possible. We can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase our oil output by 25 percent if we fully develop oil and gas shale formations in the Northeast, mountain West and Southwest. I also support drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain (ANWR), offshore expansion in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and development of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, all of which would maintain the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. This will create more than 185,000 U.S. jobs. I support returning immediately to 2007 levels of permitting in the Gulf of Mexico, safely and responsibly making more of the Gulf available for energy production, and allowing Eastern states to explore and develop more of the Outer Continental Shelf off the Atlantic Coast. This could create more than 240,000 U.S. jobs. As President, I would roll back the radical agenda of President Obama's job-killing Environmental Protection Agency. Our nation does not need costly new federal restrictions, especially during our present economic crisis. I would also oppose federal restrictions on natural gas production, including hydraulic fracturing, which is successfully regulated at the state level, and will deliver the energy needed to spark our economic recovery. If the EPA's emissions regulations go into effect as scheduled, they could cost America 1.65 million jobs by 2020, while dramatically increasing average U.S. electricity prices. It is time for a balanced, pro-American energy policy. Economic growth and security should not be pit against environmental stewardship. My energy jobs plan would allow American industry to create 1.2 million high-paying American jobs, reduce our dependence on hostile foreign energy, and ensure a continued commitment to strong environmental policies. Additionally, our families, communities and employers will benefit from more affordable energy prices as we increase the domestic supply. American manufacturing will experience a tremendous boost if we control electricity prices and get a handle on the cost of fuel for transportation fleets. Much of my plan can be accomplished by changing the occupant of the White House and removing the liberal, anti-job activists running regulatory agencies in Washington. With the stroke of a pen, I will initiate a review of all Obama-era regulations, begin a comment and review period, and work to eliminate onerous rules that kill jobs with little benefit to the environment. America needs jobs. America needs energy. The first phase of my plan will energize important sectors of the America economy, creating 1.2 million U.S. jobs  enough jobs for nearly 9 percent of Americans out of work today. With the right people in the White House and administration, our nation can reduce dependence on foreign sources of energy hostile to our interests and implement a more affordable, reliable and pro-job ""Made in America"" energy policy."

Perry's leadership, we have sharpened our competitive edge, and the Texas economy is succeeding as a result."" Linda McKenna, President and CEO, Rio Grande Valley Partnership, Weslaco ""Employers continue to look to Texas first when it comes to relocating or expanding their operations, and that's because our state has the climate they need to thrive: low taxes, reasonable regulations, and a fair and predictable legal climate.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 11, 2011",Press Release - Truth Revealed: Romney Mandate Led Way to Obamacare,"Romney and Obama shared policy advisors, personal commitment to individual health care mandate An explosive new NBC News report reveals that Mitt Romney personally insisted that a government mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance be included in Romneycare. (See ""White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law,"" NBC, 10/11/11 New documents also show how Romney advisors and Romney's personal health care vision modeled President Obama's government-mandated health care plan. Romney advisors Jon Gruber, Jon Kingsdale, and John McDonough all advised Obama Administration officials including one meeting with President Obama. The late Senator Ted Kennedy even attended the Mitt Romney's Romneycare signing ceremony. ""Gov. Romney personally insisted the government mandate requiring private citizens to buy health insurance be included in his Massachusetts government health care law,"" said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. ""New documents also prove that Romney and Obama shared policy advisors and an unwavering commitment to government-mandated health insurance."" A top Romney policy advisor who also advised on Obamacare told NBC News that Romney is ""the father of health-care reform. I think he is the single person most responsible for health care reform in the United States. ... I'm not trying to make a political position or a political statement, I honestly feel that way. If Mitt Romney had not stood up for this reform in Massachusetts ... I don't think it would have happened nationally. So I think he really is the guy with whom it all starts."" NBC reports that ""the health-care reform law in Massachusetts was seen as a national breakthrough when Romney signed it an elaborate ceremony  complete with a fife and drum band  at Boston's historic Faneuil Hall on April 12, 2006. It was attended by an array of prominent political figures in the state, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime champion of health-care reform."" NBC's Michael Isikoff discussed his investigation into the truth about Romneycare being the blueprint for Obamacare this morning on NBC's The Daily Rundown with Chuck Todd: White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law  Three advisers to GOP candidate met a dozen times with senior Obama officials, records show  By Michael Isikoff National investigative correspondent NBC News, 10/11/11 Newly obtained White House records provide fresh details on how senior Obama administration officials used Mitt Romney's landmark health-care law in Massachusetts as a model for the new federal law, including recruiting some of Romney's own health care advisers and experts to help craft the act now derided by Republicans as ""Obamacare."" The records, gleaned from White House visitor logs reviewed by NBC News, show that senior White House officials had a dozen meetings in 2009 with three health-care advisers and experts who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006, when the Republican presidential candidate was governor of Massachusetts. One of those meetings, on July 20, 2009, was in the Oval Office and presided over by President Barack Obama, the records show. ""The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we'd done in Massachusetts,"" said Jon Gruber, an MIT economist who advised the Romney administration on health care and who attended five meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. ""They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model."" Romney has forcefully defended the Massachusetts law he signed, but says he is adamantly against a ""one-size-fits-all national health-care system"" imposed on all 50 states. ""I will repeal Obamacare,"" he has said. ""And on day one of my administration, I will grant a waiver from Obamacare to all 50 states."" Asked about the White House records, a Romney campaign spokeswoman responded by citing comments that Romney made last April after Obama suggested the White House had borrowed from his law in Massachusetts. ""He does me the great favor of saying that I was the inspiration of his plan,"" Romney said of Obama. ""If that's the case, why didn't you call me? ...Why didn't you ask what was wrong? Why didn't you ask if this was an experiment, what worked and what didn't. ... I would have told him, 'What you're doing, Mr. President, is going to bankrupt us.'"" The White House visitor logs suggest that, if Obama officials didn't talk directly with Romney, senior presidential aides did consult with others  like Gruber  who played important roles in helping to craft and implement the Massachusetts law. In addition to Obama himself, the meetings attended by Gruber were presided over by the president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, then budget director Peter Orzag and Nancy-Ann DeParle, the president's chief adviser on health care, the records show. Gruber was also given a $380,000 contract by the Obama administration in 2009 to work with Congress on drafting a new federal law based on the Massachusetts law, records show. Another Romney administration adviser consulted by the White House was Jon Kingsdale, a health-care expert who was appointed in 2006 by one of Romney's Cabinet secretaries, Thomas Trimarco, to serve as executive director of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority  the state agency charged with implementing the new Massachusetts health-care law. Who met with whom The White House records show Kingsdale attended three White House meetings on health care in 2009. Another expert who attended four White House meetings on health care was John McDonough, who also had played a leading role in shaping the law signed by Romney. As the head of a health-care advocacy group in Massachusetts, McDonough was named by Romney aides as a ""stakeholder"" to represent consumer interests on the health-care law. McDonough later shared an ""innovator in health award"" with Romney and 11 others  including several top lawmakers and business leaders  given by NEHI, a leading New England health-care research group, ""for their collaborative efforts in achieving Massachusetts health reform."" The health-care reform law in Massachusetts was seen as a national breakthrough when Romney signed it an elaborate ceremony  complete with a fife and drum band  at Boston's historic Faneuil Hall on April 12, 2006. It was attended by an array of prominent political figures in the state, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime champion of health-care reform. Kennedy warmly praised Romney at the event, saying, ""You've led the way over the long and winding path to this moment."" Romney himself touted the historic significance of the act. ""Massachusetts once again is taking a giant leap forward,"" he said at the signing ceremony. The key features of the new law were an individual mandate, which required state residents to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty  and the creation of a state agency to help the uninsured to purchase private health insurance plans at reasonable costs. It was touted by Romney at the event as a way of ""expanding coverage to all our citizens."" Romney has since emphasized differences between his law in Massachusetts and ""Obamacare,"" saying the state law didn't require any increase in taxes. But the extent to which Romney's 2006 health-care law served as a blueprint for Obama's health care plan has been a recurring issue in the GOP presidential contest. Obama aides have fueled the controversy. Romney ""did some interesting things there on health care,"" David Axelrod, the president's political adviser, said in an interview earlier this year. ""We got some good ideas from him."" On Monday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign unleashed a blistering attack ad  called ""Romney's Remedy""  that accused the former Massachusetts governor of running away from his record on health care. ""Even the richest man can't buy back his past,"" reads a tag line on the ad. It cited a line that Romney had deleted this year from the paperback edition of his book, ""No Apology: The CASE for American Greatness,"" discussing the Massachusetts law which read: ""We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country."" ""When it comes to government-mandated health care, there is no difference between Mitt Romney and President Obama,"" Perry spokesman, Mark Miner, said in a press release accompanying the ad. Romney's aides shot back, accusing Perry of distorting his record on health care and taking quotes out of context. ""Rick Perry is a desperate candidate who will say and do anything to prop up his sinking campaign,"" said Gail Gitcho, Romney's communications director. The role of Gruber could complicate the Romney campaign's efforts to address the issue. An economist who specializes in health-care issues, he was hired by the Romney's administration as a consultant and asked to run computer models on the costs of various approaches to extending health-care coverage. He told NBC News he attended one meeting with Romney in which the then governor forcefully insisted on including a controversial provision that some of his political advisers were wary about: the ""individual mandate"" that would require everybody in the state to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty. The same provision has since become the most contentious feature of Obama's Affordable Care Act. ""This was a big decision to be made and Governor Romney clearly stated that he believed without an individual mandate healthy people could just free ride on the system,"" Gruber said of Romney's decision. Connection played down Romney aides have recently tried to suggest that Gruber was not a true adviser to Romney and did not play a big role in shaping the law. But Gruber was personally recognized by Romney for his role when he signed the health-care bill into law and was later appointed by Romney as a board member to the Connector Authority. (He also was given a photograph of the signing ceremony personally signed by Romney that read: ""Jonathan, with deep appreciation and congratulations. A Triumph! Mitt Romney."") Gruber now says he is ""proud"" of Romney for ""sticking up for what he did in Massachusetts"" but is ""disappointed"" about his current efforts to make distinctions between the state law and the Affordable Care Act. (He also noted that the Massachusetts law didn't require any increase in taxes only because it received federal health-care funds that defrayed the costs of the new law.) Romney is ""the father of health-care reform,"" said Gruber. ""I think he is the single person most responsible for health care reform in the United States. ... I'm not trying to make a political position or a political statement, I honestly feel that way. If Mitt Romney had not stood up for this reform in Massachusetts ... I don't think it would have happened nationally. So I think he really is the guy with whom it all starts."""

He discussed Obama's failure to unleash American energy and grow American jobs: INDIANAPOLIS  Texas Gov. Rick Perry aimed his attacks at President Obama's energy and jobs policies Wednesday by criticizing the president's speech in Pittsburgh Tuesday and by painting his own forthcoming energy and jobs plan as a direct contrast to the president's. ""This president would rather listen to an environmental activist than he would the pleas and the cries of the people without a job,"" Perry said at the Indiana Republican Party's Presidential Forum in Indianapolis. ""The question is whether the president's going to listen to his advisers on jobs or competiveness or is he going to listen to the activists that are pushing an agenda that pits environment against the economy,"" Perry added. ""That's what the question is.

Perry criticized the administration's ""bureaucratic overkill"" and argued that new EPA regulations will lead to the loss of 1.6 million jobs by 2020. ""The choice this election is whether we're going to keep a president who has failed to create jobs and who is pro-bailout, pro-government-mandated health care, pro-cap and trade, or whether we're going to change the course and elect a president who will give consumers greater freedom, who will protect us from job-killing carbon schemes and who will support policies that are good for Main Street and not just Wall Street,"" Perry said.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 14, 2011","Press Release - Gov. Perry's ""Energizing American Jobs and Security"" Plan Will Spark 1.2 Million Jobs, Reduce Dependence on Hostile Foreign Oil","As President Obama kills domestic jobs through aggressive regulations, Perry plan adds 1.2 million American jobs through safe and aggressive energy exploration at home PITTSBURGH, Pa.  Gov. Rick Perry today unveiled his Energizing American Jobs and Security plan to spark 1.2 million American jobs, while reducing our nation's dependence on energy from nations hostile to the U.S. Most of the plan can be implemented through executive branch action, without Congressional action and free of Washington gridlock. Gov. Perry announced his plan at the United States Steel Mon Valley Irvin Plant. Gov. Perry's full plan can be viewed at http://www.rickperry.org/energizing-american-jobs-html. ""This American jobs plan is based on a simple premise: Make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world,"" said Gov. Perry. ""We are standing atop the next American economic boom  energy  and the quickest way to give our economy a shot in the arm is to deploy American ingenuity to tap American energy. But we can only do that if environmental bureaucrats are told to stand down."" Gov. Perry's Energizing American Jobs and Security plan is the first part of a broader package of economic reforms that he will present to the American people in the coming days. It will create jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel. First, Gov. Perry will open several American energy fields for exploration that are currently limited, including those in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the Mountain West region and the Northeast Marcellus Shale. These actions will generate billions of dollars in royalty payments that will help pay down our nation's skyrocketing deficit. Perry also supports the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that will transport Canadian oil to U.S. coastal refineries. The governor also noted the importance of having the states more involved in energy exploration, including decisions to not pursue development in certain valuable areas such as the Everglades or Yellowstone National Park. However, such instances should represent the exception, not the rule. Second, the governor's plan will eliminate activist regulations that are on the books and under consideration by the Obama Administration, which are estimated to destroy up to 2.4 million American jobs and add $127 billion in costs to electric providers and consumers. President Rick Perry will call for immediate review of such rules and implementation of cost-benefit analyses to determine their impact on American employers and the environment. ""If we face the facts, we know that none of these rules were needed to reduce emissions of the six principal pollutants by 50 percent since 1980,"" Gov. Perry said. ""And they are not needed now, especially as our economy hangs in a fragile balance between recovery and recession."" The governor will also specifically remove the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gases, which was provided under a controversial ruling by a federal court without the approval of Congress. Third, Gov. Perry pledged to work with Congress to dismantle the EPA in its current state and rebuild a scaled down agency focused on regional and cross-state issues, providing scientific research, environmental analysis and cost-comparison studies to support state environmental organizations. He said, ""I reject the notion that Washington is more committed to environmental stewardship than state and local officials who must live with the consequences of their own environmental policies."" Lastly, Gov. Perry will level the playing field among all energy producers, working with Congress to phase out direct subsidies and tax credits that distort the energy marketplace. He will however preserve tax incentives for research and development. Gov. Perry will also put an end to the Obama Administration's agenda-driven hostility toward coal and natural gas, which provide roughly two-thirds of American electricity, noting that technologies in place today and currently under development can ensure cleaner development of conventional sources. ""I do not accept the false choice that we must pick between energy and the environment,"" the governor said. ""It is time for a balanced, pro-American, pro-jobs energy policy. ""The choice in this election is between two very different visions for our country. When it comes to energy, the president would kill domestic jobs through aggressive regulations, while I would create 1.2 million American jobs through safe and aggressive energy exploration at home. President Obama would keep us more dependent on hostile sources of foreign energy, while my plan would make us more secure by tapping America's true energy potential. The president's energy policies are driven by the concerns of activists in his party, while my policies are driven by the concerns of American workers without jobs."" Gov. Perry concluded, ""It's time to end the over-regulation, excess litigation, and bureaucratic intimidation. Let's get back to what works to get America working again: Make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world."" Gov. Perry has a proven record of upholding responsible energy production while protecting both jobs and the environment. Rick Perry's Texas is the nation's number one job creator and number one energy producer, while successfully cleaning the air. Texas has reduced NOX emissions by 58 percent and ozone by 27 percent since 2000, more than any other state. A summary of Gov. Perry's ""Energizing America: Jobs and Security"" plan can be viewed at http://www.rickperry.org/energizing-american-jobs-and-security-summary and the full plan can be viewed at http://www.rickperry.org/energizing-american-jobs-html.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 15, 2011",Press Release - National Review rates Rick Perry's Energizing American Jobs and Security plan,"Gov. Perry has unveiled the first part of his comprehensive economic plan: Energizing American Jobs and Security. National Review grades the policy proposals: Gov. Rick Perry has released a jobs plan. Or is it an energy plan? Or it is an EPA-reform plan? Or is it a trade-deficit plan? The plan is a bit of each, and it is a very good one. Governor Perry, under whom Texas enjoyed the strongest job-creation record of any large U.S. state, proposes to open up oil and gas production in areas in which American producers are either shut out or heavily restricted: the Gulf of Mexico, the Florida coast, and Alaska, among others. Perry's plan also entails the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and the liberalization of regulations hindering production in throughout the United States. Governor Perry estimates that U.S. oil and gas production could be expanded by some 9.3 million barrels of oil per day and 22.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas, creating more than 1 million new energy-industry jobs. National Review also notes that much of the plan can be implemented almost immediately-without the gridlock of Congress. Governor Perry argues that much of his agenda could be accomplished without going through Congress. That would mean a lot of executive orders and some arm-twisting of governors and state legislatures. That's a lot of unilateral executive action, but then, there's been a lot of unilateral executive action suffocating the energy industry. Before the election of Barack Obama, there were on average 130 drilling-plan approvals issued by the federal government each year; in the Obama era, there has been an average of 30 approvals each year. Before Obama, there were an average of 545 Gulf of Mexico permits issued annually; under Obama, that average has been 203. Cutting the number of permits and approvals by 50 percent or 75 percent has predictable results; so would reversing that trend. Likewise, aggressive new EPA action has come largely out of executive initiative, not as a result of new legislation passed by Congress. Perry's plan would cut the EPA budget by a punitive 60 percent, suspend the implementation of new regulations, and require the agency to conduct a rigorous cost-benefit analysis for new regulations. Read Gov. Perry's full plan, which will allow the creation of 1.2 million jobs while halting Obama's job-killing agenda that is projected to eliminate 2.4 million more jobs.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 17, 2011","Press Release - ""Governor Perry's Energy Paper Hits All the Right Notes"" - Americans for Tax Reform","Americans for Tax Reform sums up Gov. Rick Perry's plan to Energize American Jobs and Security: Last week, presidential candidate Rick Perry released his aptly named Energizing American Jobs and Security plan, a blueprint outlining his energy and environmental policies. Leaving no rock unturned, Perry lays out a strong plan aimed at spurring domestic investment and job creation, reining in the out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and reducing our nation's deficit. Keeping in line with much of the legislation coming out of the Republican controlled House of Representatives, Perry first looks to undo the damage caused by the Obama Administration over the past three years. Refusing to issue drilling permits at a reasonable rate, the Department of the Interior has put forth an impossible number of hoops for oil and natural gas producers to jump through. Across town, Lisa Jackson's EPA has scared America's job creators into inaction. With a slew of punitive, unnecessary regulations coming down the pipe, America's manufacturers and energy producers are hording capital until they fully comprehend EPA's compliance costs. Perry's blueprint would reprimand these agencies, expediting permit processing and giving American businesses the certainty investment requires. Consistent with Perry's record as governor, he believes that state-run EPAs are best equipped to determine and enforce environmental regulations. Bogged down in the fight against the federal EPA, devolution of environmental regulation to state agencies is something conservatives should talk about more. Also encouraging is Perry's plan to simplify our distortive tax code through repealing tax credits and subsidies. Cleaning up the code of course, would be done in a revenue neutral way as he promised Americans he would not raise their taxes when he signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. ATR has long championed this strategy for tax reform, which was modeled after Reagan's successful 1986 plan. Repealing credits and plowing the savings into lower rates would not only simplify the tax code, but make it more faira step towards a truly innovative free energy market. The ATR article."

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 18, 2011",Press Release - Rick Perry Opposes Wall Street Bailout Supported By Mitt Romney,"While Mitt Romney continues to support the Wall Street bailout (TARP) passed by Congress in 2008, Rick Perry opposes bailouts and issued a statement before the TARP vote to remind Congress, ""In a free market economy, government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America."" [1] Meanwhile, there are numerous examples of Mitt Romney supporting the $700 billion Wall Street bailout (TARP) from 2008-2011, including his defense of TARP at last week's GOP debate. 2011: ""My experience tells me that we were on the precipice, and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system, wiping out all the savings of the American people. So action had to be taken."" [2] 2010: ""I think it's something that we have to pursue at this stage."" [3] 2009: ""Though I know we didn't all agree on TARP, I happen to believe it was necessary to prevent a cascade of bank collapses."" [4] 2008: ""I think had President Bush and Secretary Paulson and Ben Bernanke not pushed for a TARP-type program, we were going to be in a free fall that would cause the collapse of not just a few banks in Wall Street, but banks all over the country, killing not only a few jobs but all the jobs in this country ... It was the right thing to do."" [5] As Chairman of the Republican Governors Association (RGA), Rick Perry co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Governor and Democratic Governors Association (DGA) Chairman Joe Manchin calling on Congress to take action in October 2008, but the joint letter was not an endorsement of TARP. [6] As the Austin American-Statesman reported on 10/3/08: Brian Namey, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, said the letter was ""not an endorsement of any particular plan.""

[1] [2] When Romney says he didn't raise taxes to pay for Romneycare, he intentionally hides the fact that Romneycare cost American taxpayers almost $4 billion in federal funding, a cost spread across all 50 states. [1] When Romney says his socialized medicine scheme only affected 8 percent of the Massachusetts population, he ignores the fact that Romneycare resulted in higher insurance premiums for everyone. [1] Romneycare penalizes taxpayers and employers if they don't comply with his individual mandate. Individuals making as little as $33,000 a year must pay the government a $1,212 fine if they don't purchase health insurance. [3] Not only has Romneycare destroyed jobs in Massachusetts, it has depressed income, wage growth and disposable income in the state. According to the Beacon Hill Institute:  Disposable income in Massachusetts is $2-3 billion lower than it would be without Romneycare. Corporate investment in the state dropped by as much as $30 million a year. Single-coverage employer-sponsored insurance premiums increased by 6%, or $262 a person, in just two years. [2]  Romney's own chief economic advisor, Glenn Hubbard, noted that Romneycare ""imposed a very large burden on small businesses and their employees."" Family premiums for small employers rose by 14.4 percent more than national rates.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 18, 2011",Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Dominates CNN Debate with Forceful Discussion of Jobs and Conservative Record,"Strong performance at CNN GOP Presidential Debate LAS VEGAS  Texas Gov. Rick Perry dominated tonight's CNN debate, forcefully presenting his pro-job, conservative plans and record. Gov. Perry spoke about his ideas to get America working again by creating 1.2 million jobs through his Energizing American Jobs and Security plan, which was unveiled last week. Gov. Perry's plan is the first part of a broader package of economic reforms that he will present to the American people in the coming days. The plan will create jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel. ""My plan is based on one clear premise: Make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world,"" said Gov. Perry. ""The American people are looking for a president with the ability to steer our nation toward economic prosperity and for substantial ideas to get America working again. My record of job creation in the state of Texas and my proposals to create jobs nationwide demonstrate that I am that president."" During the debate, Gov. Perry emphasized his intentions to eliminate job-killing regulations, ensure a fair and predictable tax system, create a just legal climate and put an end to unnecessary government spending. Gov. Perry has the strongest record of job creation of all the candidates, having established a pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-innovation environment in the state of Texas. Under Gov. Perry's tenure, Texas has led the nation in job creation with more than one million net new jobs generated. In contrast, while President Obama has been in office, the United States has lost 2.5 million jobs. Gov. Perry tonight reiterated his commitment to repealing Obamacare, the job-killing government-mandated healthcare plan that began with Mitt Romney and must end with President Obama.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 18, 2011",Press Release - Romney is a Fraud on Immigration,"Mitt Romney tries to hide his past support for amnesty for illegal immigrations. Romney supported an amnesty proposal from John McCain and Ted Kennedy. [1] Romney also claims to be against sanctuary cities, but he did nothing to outlaw Massachusetts' four sanctuary cities while he was governor. [2] Romney brags about signing an agreement with the federal government to allow Massachusetts state troopers to work with federal immigration agents. What Romney doesn't say is that he signed this agreement just three weeks before he left office  after his Democrat successor had been already been elected. [3] [4] Not surprisingly, Romney's Democrat successor quickly announced he would be ending the agreement when took office, so Massachusetts state troopers never underwent required training and zero arrests were made before the agreement was removed. [4] Despite tough talk directed at employers hiring illegal aliens, it was discovered in the last campaign that Romney went a decade without checking the citizenship status of those who tended to his 2 1/2 acre lawn: But, for a decade, the governor has used a landscaping company that relies heavily on workers like these, illegal Guatemalan immigrants, to maintain the ground surrounding his pink Colonial house on March Street in Belmont. ...Romney never inquired about their status, they said. [5] And it's not enough for Romney to argue he doesn't inquire about people's legal status as a matter of practice, because he waited a year after the story broke to fire the company in question. While Romney told his landscaping company to terminate the illegal workers, the same company worked him for another year, continuing to employ undocumented workers. So the practice continued, and Romney didn't even report the illegal workers to the INS. Right before the Iowa Caucuses and the New Hampshire Primary, in December of 2007, Romney finally fired his landscaping company: Romney letter: Today I learned that employees of your company, who were assigned to work on my property, are not permitted to work in the United States. Given your company's disregard for the clear instructions provided on this issue last year, I am forced to terminate my contract with your company, effective immediately.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 18, 2011","Press Release - FLASHBACK: ""Lawn work at Romney's home still done by illegal immigrants""","Lawn work at Romney's home still done by illegal immigrants Boston Globe, December 4, 2007: Standing on stage at a Republican debate on the Gulf Coast of Florida last week, Mitt Romney repeatedly lashed out at rival Rudy Giuliani for providing sanctuary to illegal immigrants in New York City. Yet, the very next morning, on Thursday, at least two illegal immigrants stepped out of a hulking maroon pickup truck in the driveway of Romney's Belmont house, then proceeded to spend several hours raking leaves, clearing debris from Romney's tennis court, and loading the refuse back on to the truck. In fact, their work was part of a regular pattern. Despite a Globe story in Dec. 2006 that highlighted Romney's use of illegal immigrants to tend to his lawn, Romney continued to employ the same landscaping company  until today. The landscaping company, in turn, continued to employ illegal immigrants. Two of the workers confirmed in separate interviews with Globe reporters last week that they were in the country without documents. One said he had paid $7,000 to a smuggler to escort him across the desert into Arizona; the other said he had come to the country with a student visa that was now expired. Both were seen on the lawn by either Globe reporters or photographers over the last two months. Questioned this afternoon during two campaign stops in New Hampshire about the use of illegal immigrants on his property, Romney declined to answer. An aide said he would issue a statement, and Romney, emerging from a Concord restaurant, said, ""Did you hear him? We'll give you a statement."" Later, the campaign issued a statement saying Romney had just learned  apparently from Globe reporters  of the company's continued practice of employing illegal immigrants, and immediately fired it. ""After this same issue arose last year, I gave the company a second chance with very specific conditions,"" Romney said in the statement. ""They were instructed to make sure people working for the company were of legal status. We personally met with the company in order to inform them about the importance of this matter. The owner of the company guaranteed us, in very certain terms, that the company would be in total compliance with the law going forward. ""The company's failure to comply with the law is disappointing and inexcusable, and I believe it is important I take this action,"" Romney said. For Romney, who has made curtailing illegal immigration a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, the revelation that he continued to employ the same landscaping company was likely to fuel criticism from his rivals, at least one of whom  Giuliani  has already mocked Romney's commitment to the issue on the trail. http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2007/12/lawn_work_at_ro.htm"

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 18, 2011",Press Release - Debunking False Attacks Regarding Texas Jobs,"America's unsecured border is a huge problem and the states are left with the resulting challenges, especially big states like California, Texas and Florida. In light of the federal government's failure to secure the border, Gov. Perry has championed border security, authorizing $400 million from Texas to fight border crime, and called for penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrants and an end to sanctuary city policies. A central conclusion of a recent study falsely claims that ""40 percent of all the job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants."" [1] This finding is false. The numbers don't add up. Since Jan. 2007, Texas has created 384,700 net new jobs, according to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. [2] Forty percent of 384,700 jobs is 153,880 jobs. The Department of Homeland Security data cited in the false study estimates that 60,000 illegal immigrants have arrived in Texas since 2007. [3] So if Texas created 384,700 jobs since 2007 and 40 percent of that is 153,880 - the false study claims that 60,000 illegal immigrants arrived in Texas since 2007 - then the study's conclusion must be false and numerically impossible.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 19, 2011","Press Release - ""Debate Score: Perry for the Win""","Bryan Preston, conservative blogger for Pajamas Media, reviews Governor Rick Perry's CNN Debate performance and concludes that it's ""Perry for the Win"" ...Perry also hit Romney directly for ""hypocrisy"" for having hired illegal aliens. Romney laughed and denied, but the story has been out there since 2007 or thereabouts. Romney lost his cool, for the second time. Perry scored another direct hit, and Mitt turned red again. The ice man melted. Perry also did well on the question of securing the border: It's about a fence, plus other security measures including technology and boots on the ground. Bachmann got in a jab about the president's illegal alien relatives who keep popping up in the news, before moving on to declare that she would build a fence along the entire border. There is actually less policy daylight between most of the candidates on the border than the stage arguments suggest, but the arguments drew out some personalities, and it's hard to see Romney benefiting from the exchange. Tonight's was the most lively debate, and does have the potential to change the race a bit. Perry came to fight and from tax policy to spending to funding the UN, showed that his issue knowledge is broad. Romney wasn't prepared to take hits from so many other candidates. Romney's packed supporters in the audience and other blogs provided some soundtrack to back their man up but I doubt it did much good. Romney's cool broke too many times for his own good. His whining about being talked over, when he isn't shy about interrupting others, was entertaining but revealed a thin skin. Romney probably had his best moment during the religion debate, but that's such tired ground now and Romney has so overreached on that issue that it's unlikely to make any difference. This was Perry's best night. He took control when he needed to, threw the president's and his competitors' words against them at opportune moments, and showed a strong and knowledgeable presence going toe to toe with Romney...

Rick Perry today received the endorsement of 32 New Hampshire job creators who have formed the Job Creators for Perry Coalition. These Granite State business owners and entrepreneurs are teaming up to show their support for Gov. Perry and his unmatched job creation record. Dr. Julianne Cooper and Marian Norhona have been named co-chairs to the coalition. Twenty-four of these coalition members are announcing their support for Gov. Perry for the first time. ""Gov. Perry is the only candidate in this race who has a proven record of standing by businesses  large and small  enabling them to create jobs,"" said Dr. Julianne Cooper, Job Creators for Perry Co-Chair and founder of Liberty Harbor Academy, a private day school in Manchester. ""I am supporting him for president because he understands that with less spending, lower taxes, fewer regulations and tort reform, the private sector will have the confidence and ability to finally hire new workers. I believe Gov. Perry is the only candidate who has the experience to get America working again."" ""Gov. Perry has focused on two simple and achievable tasks: unleashing America to extract its own energy, and freeing Americans to chart their own future,"" said Marian Noronha, president of Turbocam International in Barrington. ""As soon as the world knows that America is capable of and serious about producing more oil, prices will head downward. And when Americans know that the government will run on 18 percent of GDP instead of 25, they will start hiring and believing in themselves again."" Last Friday, Gov. Perry rolled out a plan that will create up to 1.2 million good paying jobs in America's energy sector by cutting the red tape and regulations currently strangling the expansion of domestic energy exploration and production. His plan is based on the one simple premise that our nation will make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world. Much of it can be implemented through executive action, without Congressional action and free of Washington gridlock. ""His recently unveiled jobs and energy plan is that of a forward-thinking and experienced leader,"" said Jack Tulley, owner of the Tulley Auto Group of Nashua. ""Gov. Perry, unlike any other candidate in this race, has provided the surest and quickest way to help get this country working again, without the need for Congress and with a focus on a sector America must solidify and develop for our national security and our economic growth  domestic energy production."" Gov. Perry's plan will not only create the jobs America desperately needs and jump start our economy, it will also stop Obama's job-killing EPA with significant reforms, return authority to the states to regulate their own resources and level the playing field among all energy sectors. ""Gov. Perry proved in Texas that by freeing the private sector from over-regulation, providing it with predictability and allowing it to do what it does best  compete  jobs will be created and economies will grow,"" said Perry Campaign Manager Rob Johnson. ""While Obama has been increasing regulations, picking private sector winners and losers and killing 2.5 million jobs nationwide, Gov.

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 21, 2011","Press Release - ""Business Leaders Trust Texas Gov. Rick Perry""","Sean Mahoney, former Congressional candidate and RNC Committeeman in New Hampshire, wrote this op-ed in support of Rick Perry. It appeared in Thursday's Foster's Daily Democrat With 14 million Americans unemployed, we have to address a very real problem before we can revive our economy and our prospects for job growth: our government simply isn't trustworthy. Business leaders  those who create jobs -have been given little comfort about the goals and direction of our government. Is the president focused on deficit reduction, or stimulus spending? Do we want to unleash the innovation of the private sector, or create more regulatory burdens for job creators? Business leaders are looking for leaders who they can trust and we found one in Rick Perry. We can trust Governor Perry to answer those questions in a credible, consistent fashion and to create an environment where job creation is rewarded, not punished. The best way to establish trust is through actual performance, and based on his record as Governor, Rick Perry is the right candidate to provide firm, consistent leadership, to limit the size and growth of government, and to provide a stable economic outlook that will encourage businesses to hire new workers. Faced with a significant budget shortfall, Perry resisted calls to drain his state's rainy day fund or hike taxes, and instead signed a budget that reduced spending by $1 billion dollars. While reducing overall spending, he was able to increase vital areas because he made smart managerial choices. For example, efficiency and cost containment measures in the state's Medicaid program created several billion in savings that allowed Texas to increase spending on border security by nearly 25%. Investors and job creators seek environments where investment is rewarded and where they can reasonably predict outcomes, and Perry's strong leadership in Texas has created a hothouse of economic activity. Between 2009 and 2010, the value of Texas exports grew by more than 26%. During that time, Texas GDP grew by nearly 5%, far outpacing the national average of 3.8%. Unsurprisingly, the additional economic activity resulted in a more robust jobs market. The governor's home state has one of the highest rates of job growth in the country  accounting for half of all new jobs in the US, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. On every measure, Texas does better than the national average in employment statistics, substantially below the national average. Jobs are created by investors willing to take risks and invest. Investors are willing to start businesses where there is a stable, pro-growth economic climate. The right climate is created through restraining the size and scope of government. Rick Perry understands the mechanisms that lead to job creation, has a track record of pursuing pro-growth policies, and has the documented results of creating more jobs than any other state. Other candidates in the race like to claim they would create jobs, but their claims are either theoretical or flat out false. For example, Governor Romney's signature achievement in Massachusetts was to pass Romneycare, which has killed 18,000 jobs in his home state. According to August 2011 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that means he is responsible for nearly 7% of the unemployed in Massachusetts. A similar result in New Hampshire would mean an additional 2700 unemployed, or the equivalent of eliminating all the jobs at Portsmouth Regional Hospital AND all the jobs at New Hampshire Motor Speedway AND roughly half the jobs at Hypertherm in Hanover. No matter how Romneycare is explained, eliminating the equivalent of several major state employers is not the record of ""job creation"" that Granite State voters are seeking. Because he has a consistent record of smaller government and job creation, business leaders can and will trust Rick Perry to lead the federal government as he has led state government, and we trust Rick Perry to give the private sector the confidence it needs to invest, create jobs, and put our friends and neighbors back to work. That's why I hope you'll join me in supporting Rick Perry. Sean Mahoney Portsmouth Sean Mahoney was a candidate for Congress in 2010. Prior to that served as the Republican National Committeeman from New Hampshire. Mahoney is also the former owner of Millyard Communications, Inc. of Manchester and former publisher of BusinessNH Magazine.  Submit your own endorsement of Gov.

Romney OKd Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants""","Romney's 2004 rules allowed benefits for illegal immigrants The Los Angeles Times is reporting Mitt Romney's signature achievement while Governor of Massachusetts  Romneycare  includes provisions that allow illegal immigrants to receive full health benefits for free. According to the L.A. Times, then-Gov. Romney and his administration knew about provisions in the Romneycare that would allow illegal immigrants to receive free health care. The Times reported: ""...there was broad understanding when Romney signed it that at least some people who would benefit would be in the country illegally."" [1] ""Governor Romney's government-mandated health care plan provided free care for illegal immigrants in Massachusetts, establishing just the kind of illegal immigration magnet Governor Romney claims to oppose,"" said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. ""Program rules established by the Romney Administration in 2004 clearly state that citizenship is not required for free health care and subsidies and health centers cannot consider citizenship before rendering that free care."" Rules adopted by the Romney Administration on May 1, 2004, for Free Care defined eligibility as residency in Massachusetts with no requirement for citizenship. The rules also clearly state that ""a Hospital or Community Health Center shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, citizenship... in its policies, or in its application of policies, concerning the acquisition and verification of financial information, pre-admission or pretreatment deposits, payment plans, deferred or rejected admissions, or eligibility for Free Care."" [2] Romneycare, which President Obama's health care takeover was modeled after, has already been shown to have killed 18,000 jobs in Massachusetts and resulted in $8 billion in additional cost to taxpayers. [3, 4] ""When faced with the illegal immigrant benefits this morning, the Romney campaign tried to deny indisputable facts and to cover their tracks by blaming Gov. Patrick,"" Miner continued. ""The truth is Gov. Romney's plan intended to provide free health care to illegal immigrants, and the law and rules he approved were clear about providing free health care to illegal immigrants."" Romney's campaign is falsely claiming that provisions referenced in the Times' story were implemented after Romney left office. [5] However, the official Massachusetts Free Care website was updated three days after Gov. Romney signed Romneycare into law. Under ""Am I eligible?"" the site clearly states: ""Your citizenship or immigration status does not affect your eligibility."" [6] The Times also reported John McDonough, a former consumer advocate who worked extensively on the healthcare effort in Massachusetts, said: ""There is no question that lots of different kinds of people, including undocumented immigrants, obtain medically necessary services as result of this program.""

Rick Perry Unveils Plan to Cut Taxes and Spending, Balance the Budget and Grow the Economy","Cut, Balance and Grow"" plan offers optional 20% flat tax; cuts federal spending, repeals job-killing regulations, sets path to balanced budget GREENVILLE, S.C.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry today unveiled his Cut, Balance and Grow plan, which provides taxpayers with the choice of a simple, 20 percent flat tax rate, cuts federal spending, ends earmarks and includes a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. He announced his plan at ISO Poly Films near Greenville. The governor's plan addresses five primary areas of reform, which include replacing the current tax code with an optional 20 percent flat tax for individuals and corporations, simplifying our regulatory system by freezing new and auditing pending regulations, fixing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs, balancing the federal budget by 2020, and repealing job-killing federal laws like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and parts of Sarbanes-Oxley. To view Gov. Perry's Cut, Balance and Grow plan, please visit http://www.rickperry.org/cut-balance-and-grow-html/. ""My Cut, Balance and Grow plan reorders the way they do business in Washington by reinventing the tax code and restoring our nation to fiscal health through balanced budgets and entitlement reform,"" Gov. Perry said. ""Central to my plan is giving every American the option of throwing out the three million words of the current tax code and the costs of complying with that code in order to pay a 20 percent flat tax on their income. ""My plan offers the kind of bold reform needed to jolt this economy out of its doldrums and renew American prosperity. This is a change election, and I offer a plan that changes the way Washington does business."" As president, Gov. Perry will work to implement a plan that cuts taxes across all income groups, leaving more money in Americans' pockets and encouraging greater investment in the private economy instead of federal government. The new tax code, featuring the 20 percent flat tax, will be simple enough to file taxes on a postcard, providing deductions for only mortgage interest, charitable giving and state and local tax payments for families earning $500,000 or less. It will also eliminate taxes on Social Security, the death tax, capital gains tax and taxes on dividends, while increasing the standard exemption for individuals and dependents to $12,500 for those earning $500,000 or less. Overall, taxpayers will save money through lower taxes and lower tax compliance costs since the new form will be simpler. Regarding corporate taxes, the governor's plan creates a tax that is lower and fairer, closing corporate loopholes and ending special breaks for special interests. It offers a lower rate of 20 percent, the average corporate rate among developed nations, replacing the current combined corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent, which is currently the second-highest in the world. Cut, Balance and Grow also implements two major reforms that will incentivize corporations to invest in America again. First, it will transition to a territorial tax system on corporate income earned overseas, so companies pay the appropriate corporate tax in the country where income was earned, but aren't taxed a second time when that income is moved back into the United States. Second, the plan provides a temporary, one-time reduced tax rate of 5.25 percent on repatriated earnings that are currently languishing overseas. Gov. Perry noted, ""My Cut, Balance and Grow plan will unleash job creation to address the current economic crisis, while generating a stable source of revenue to put America's fiscal house in order. It provides employers and investors certainty, which is critical to getting investment capital back into the economy. In contrast, the president's plan provides temporary tax relief, which does nothing to encourage long-term investment, because it doesn't provide the private sector certainty. The way to stimulate the economy is not through temporary tax relief or government spending, but by stimulating private spending through permanent tax relief."" The corporate flat tax plan will bring more jobs and economic investment back to America, unleashing job creation that will remedy the current economic crisis and generate a stable source of revenue to address the nation's record deficit. Gov. Perry's plan will also establish firm policies to effectively reform entitlement programs.  To save Social Security for the long term, Gov. Perry proposes five principles: Protect existing benefits for current retirees and work with Congress on the exact age when those nearing retirement are grandfathered out of changes to the program. Protect the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, by stopping Congress' borrowing against the fund with IOU's Allow younger workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes into private accounts if they so choose. Allow state and local governments to return to pre-1983 law and opt out of Social Security, allowing their employees to instead pay solely into state or locally run retirement programs. This has been done around the country in the past with better results. Work with Congress to determine the right formula, beginning at the right age, to raise the retirement age for younger workers on a gradual basis that reflects the longer life-span of today's Americans.  To reform Medicare and save it for future generations, Gov. Perry will work with Congress on several options, including:  Giving patients greater flexibility in choosing the plan that best fits their unique needs through bundled premium support payments to the individual, or as a credit against the purchase of health insurance. Considering gradually raising the age of Medicare eligibility. Considering adjusting Medicare benefits to be paid on a sliding scale based on the income of the recipient. Tackling the $100 billion in annual Medicare waste and fraud.  The governor's plan also restructures Medicaid, returning control over the program and the dollars needed to administer it to the states, giving them flexibility to fix the program and control its costs. Gov. Perry's plan sets a course to a balanced federal budget by 2020. In his remarks, the governor noted that to truly protect taxpayers, a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is absolutely necessary. He pledged to reduce spending across several agencies including the Department of Education, Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency, while returning greater regulatory control of those responsibilities to the states. Gov. Perry's plan to balance the budget will cut federal spending to 18 percent of GDP from the current rate of about 23 percent and will reduce non-defense discretionary spending by $100 billion in the first year. It will also institute other fiscal reforms, including elimination of baseline budgeting, an end to non-emergency spending in emergency bills, and the elimination of earmarks. Regulatory reform is also key to Gov. Perry's plan. That reform will begin on his first day in office, when he will freeze all pending federal regulations and immediately begin a review of all new regulations implemented since January of 2008. ""Today the Federal Register contains 165,000 pages, and the index alone is eleven hundred pages long,"" Gov. Perry said. ""Somehow, despite not having any of these new regulations for our first 219 years, America not only survived, we thrived. Heavy-handed federal regulations are keeping our economy in the ditch, and it is time to review and scrap regulations that harm jobs and growth."" Lastly, the governor pledged to lead the charge to eliminate the Dodd-Frank banking regulations which impede investment in our economy and block access to credit in a time when small businesses need it most. His plan also calls for the repeal of Obamacare and of the onerous Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 regulations on small businesses. ""The great issue facing this nation is whether we have the courage to confront spending and the vision to get our economy growing again,"" Gov. Perry said. ""We need a tax code that unleashes growth instead of preventing it, that promotes fairness, not class warfare, that sparks investment in America instead of overseas interests. It is time to create incentives for American companies to invest in American workers. ""The future of America is too important to be left to the Washington politicians. My plan unleashes American ingenuity for a new American Century, restores the hopes and dreams of our people, renews our great promise, and entrusts the fate of this nation into the hands of our people, setting them free.""

It's fabulous. I like it. ... This is why a lot of people are going to like it. It is a return to fiscal sanity."" Rush Limbaugh on ""The Rush Limbaugh Show,"" 10/25/11 ""This program he's come up with is a great program, this tax plan. ... Perry has come up with one hell of a proposal."" Mark Levin on ""The Mark Levin Show,"" 10/25/11  ""The good news is that Mr. Perry and most of his competitors are thinking big, with proposals that will reverse the U.S. slide to high-debt, slow-growth stagnation. President Obama wants to portray the economic debate as pro-growth government spenders vs. the austerity of budget cutting. But the real debate is over whether government or the private economy is the main engine of prosperity. The flat tax puts Republicans on the side of private growth and government reform, a potent combination. Perhaps Mr. Perry and his comrades can even coax Mitt Romney to join the party."" Wall Street Journal, 10/26/11 ""Strong entitlement reform in #GovernorRickPerry flat tax plan. Plus strong growth incentives from 20% flat rate. #GOP tax competition. Good."" Larry Kudlow, host of CNBC's ""The Kudlow Report,"" via Twitter, 10/25/11 ""Twenty percent is a very good place to be. And what Governor Perry does right is he sets up an alternative structure. If you like the present tax system, if you've organized your life around the various deductions and credits, nothing changes for you. If you'd rather move to a lower rate, fewer deductions and credits, that's available as well. It doesn't have the danger that the Fair Tax or the 9-9-9 has, which is you create these additional new taxes that maybe you'll end up with both the income tax and the sales tax and a VAT [value-added tax], which would be France, Greece."" Grover Norquist on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" 10/25/11  ""Rick Perry's plan for tax reform would be massively pro-growth. A Flat Tax like the one proposed by Perry would unleash years of economic growth if it is passed into law. Furthermore, eliminating the tax on dividends and capital gains would immediately add trillions of dollars in new wealth to the economy, benefiting all Americans. Perry clearly understands that revitalizing the economy should start with a complete overhaul of a tax code that has nearly choked economic growth to death. Conservatives looking for a champion to carry the banner of a pro-growth tax reform will surely rally behind this bold proposal."" Club for Growth President Chris Chocola, 10/25/11 ""[Governor Perry] unveiled a very aggressive plan today. For too many years, our tax code in America has punished, not rewarded success. ... By 2015, the cost of tax compliance will cost over $480 billion. Think about that money that's being taken out of our economy. Instead of the American taxpayers wasting all those hours collecting all those receipts, wasting all that money on tax preparers and accountants, why not have a simpler, fairer tax system where everybody pays?"" Governor Bobby Jindal (R-La.) on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" 10/25/11 ""[It's] the best plan standing. ... The governor's plan is a very bold plan by way of comparison with anything else that's out there, and I think it is possible that it could achieve the growth of the American economy and the job creation that would follow that growth."" Dick Armey, former House Majority Leader and chairman of FreedomWorks, on CNN, 10/25/11  ""I like the plan a lot. I think it has a lot of very appealing pro-growth aspects to it. I particularly like the 20 percent tax. There have been already complaints that this is too complicated, that the phase-in or the opt-in and opt-out will make things too complicated  I think that's nonsense. You have basically the option for people to choose whether they want to pay higher taxes. Who's going to choose whether to pay higher taxes?"" The Weekly Standard's Steve Hayes on Fox News' ""Special Report,"" 10/25/11 ""Overall, the Perry flat tax plan would be a boon to long-term economic growth and increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. in the global economy."" Scott Hodge, Tax Foundation, 10/25/11 ""It's very aggressive. The fact that Perry has come out forcefully for a balanced budget amendment as well as an 18 percent of GDP spending cap is a good sign."" Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, via Bloomberg, 10/26/11 ""[T]he 20-percent marginal tax rate will be much more conducive to entrepreneurship and hard work, giving people more incentive to create jobs and wealth. ""Since all economic theories ... agree that capital formation is key for long-run growth and higher living standards, addressing the tax bias against saving and investment is one of the best features of Perry's plan. ""If implemented, [Perry's] plan would dramatically boost economic performance and improve competitiveness. ... ""[I]t will be a radical improvement compared to the current tax system ..."" Daniel J. Mitchell, Cato Institute, in Forbes, 10/25/11 ""Here's the thing that gets my attention: Governor Perry has some pretty serious entitlement-reform measures in here: Raising the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare benefits, changing the indexing formula to CPI rather than wages, giving younger workers at least a partial opt-out into private accounts, block-granting Medicaid, putting Medicare recipients directly in control of their own spendingthis would be huge. A Republican president who got nothing else done in a four-year term would be a smashing success in my book if he achieved that kind of entitlement reform. I expect Perry to emphasize taxes, but the entitlement measures are the meat of the Perry proposal, in my view, though there's a lot of good gravy: repealing Dodd-Frank, procedural reform for spending and regulating, repealing section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, expanding the ""Galveston model"" (another Social Security opt-out) to most government employees, etc."" Kevin Williamson, National Review, 10/25/11""[T]his plan does look like the kind of game-changer that Republicans can use to keep the focus on the economy in 2012."" Ed Morrissey, Hot Air, 10/25/11 ""Governor Perry's 'Cut, Balance and Grow' is a solid economic plan for renewing our economy and providing struggling Americans with a path back to economic prosperity. It addresses the key failures of President Obama's agenda in Washington, which at every turn seeks to smother us with more government, and destroy private enterprise and initiative."" Jim Martin, 60 Plus Association chairman, 10/25/11 ""My take on the plan: it's excellent. It addresses the key political weaknesses of a mandatory flat tax, while still moving us meaningfully in that direction. While it maintains certain popular deductions, it recognizes the importance of a transitional phase between our current system and a flat tax. And Perry appears to be off to a promising start on Medicare reform."" Avik Roy, Manhattan Institute, in Forbes, 10/25/11""Perry is correct in noting that the current complexity of the tax code adds tremendous inefficiency to the current system. A flat tax with limited exemptions and deductions would reduce a lot of the distortions that exist along the income scale. For instance, taxing higher income at a higher rate creates disincentives for work and saving, and these would be minimized under a flat tax. Also, it would reduce compliance costs."" Aparna Mathur, American Enterprise Institute, 10/25/11""As far as tax politics go, a new Washington Post -ABC News poll shows a straight ahead 'flat tax' a clear winner over '9-9-9' ...""

After promising in 2006 that Romneycare would ""contain health care costs,"" Romney now admits, ""I didn't get the job done in Massachusetts in getting the health care costs down in this country."" From today's Politico: Mitt Romney's health care albatross isn't just the similarity between his Massachusetts health care overhaul and President Barack Obama's health reform law. It's also the fact that Massachusetts still has the highest health costs in the country - even after the reforms Romney signed into law as governor. ... But on the day he signed the reform plan into law in 2006, Romney did claim that cost containment was one of the goals. ""Lastly, but perhaps most critically, this bill takes bold steps to contain health care costs,"" Romney wrote in a letter to the state Legislature. ""By putting an end to cost-shifting from the uninsured and from the Medicaid program, businesses and individuals will no longer bear the cost of others' health care.""

""Romneycare/Obamacare kills jobs, costs consumers more and busts the budget."" Boston's Beacon Hill Institute has reported that Romneycare [3, 4]:  Cost taxpayers $8 billion - including almost $4 billion in federal funding, a cost spread across American taxpayers in all 50 states. Killed more than 18,000 jobs in Massachusetts in 2010. Resulted in higher insurance premiums for everyone in Massachusetts. Penalizes taxpayers and employers if they don't comply with Romneycare's individual mandate, as individuals making as little as $33,000 a year must pay the government a $1,212 fine if they don't purchase health insurance. Depressed income, wage growth and disposable income in Massachusetts:  Disposable income in Massachusetts is $2-3 billion lower than it would be without Romneycare.

""Mitt Romney approved free non-emergency health care for illegal immigrants in Massachusetts, and when he signed legislation mandating the purchase of health care, he made sure that illegal immigrants continued to be eligible for free health care,"" said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. ""Mitt Romney's newfound criticism of illegal immigration magnets flies in the face of his providing free non-emergency health benefits to illegals."" Rules adopted by the Romney administration on May 1, 2004, for the state's ""Free Care"" health care program defined eligibility as residency in Massachusetts with no requirement for citizenship. The rules clearly state ""a Hospital or Community Health Center shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, citizenship... in its policies, or in its application of policies, concerning the acquisition and verification of financial information, pre-admission or pretreatment deposits, payment plans, deferred or rejected admissions, or eligibility for Free Care.""

Rick Perry,R,p,"October 28, 2011",Press Release - Romney Flips On Manmade Global Warming,"Pandering in Pittsburgh, Romney's latest positions on warming, carbon caps evolve Yesterday Mitt Romney ventured into an American hotbed of fossil fuel production - Pittsburgh, PA - and changed positions on global warming and contradicted his own record on capping carbon emissions, just days after vacillating on Question Two in Ohio on the issue of checking public union power. ""Mitt Romney's positions change, often dramatically, depending on the audience or location,"" said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. ""Voters need to consider the fact that Romney, in one week, changed positions on manmade global warming, capping carbon emissions, and Ohio's efforts to curb union powers."" In Pittsburgh, Romney said, ""My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us."" [1] Just four months ago in New Hampshire, Romney said, ""I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that."" [2] On March 14, 2003, the Cape Cod News reported Romney said, ""I think the global warming debate is now pretty much over and people recognize the need associated with providing sources which do not generate the heat that is currently provided by fossil fuels."" [3] Yesterday in Pittsburgh Romney also said, ""The EPA should not be regulating carbon dioxide. It is not a pollutant within the meaning of their, of the legislation that formed them. And as a result, I would insist on new legislation making it very clear that the EPA does not have authority to regulate CO2 or to stand in the way of developing our energy resources."" [1] Romney's opposition to regulating CO2 contradicts his own record in Massachusetts. Romney frequently points out he opted Massachusetts out of a regional compact to reduce carbon emissions, but fails to mention he implemented Massachusetts' own carbon reduction plan. On December 7, 2005, Romney announced his own carbon reduction scheme. The following is an excerpt from the release: Governor Mitt Romney today announced that Massachusetts will take another major step in meeting its commitment to protecting air quality when strict state limitations on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants take effect on January 1, 2006. ""Massachusetts continues to be committed to improving air quality for all our citizens. These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress in the battle to improve our environment,"" Romney said. ""They help us accomplish our environmental goals while protecting jobs and the economy."" Massachusetts is the first and only state to set CO2 emissions limits on power plants.

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 2, 2011","Press Release - Politico: ""Mitt Romney Faces an Inconvenient Truth on Climate Change""","Romney yet to comment on record of capping CO2 emissions in Massachusetts A new Politico report reveals Mitt Romney's rhetoric of opposing regulations to cap CO2 emissions does not match his record as Massachusetts governor, as he made his state the first in the nation to cap CO2 emissions. The Romney campaign refused to comment on this report when contacted by Politico. ""Mitt Romney should clear the air, take a position on regulating CO2 emissions, and stick with it,"" said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan.  Politico Romney hit for past emissions stance November 1, 2011 http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/67380.html  Mitt Romney faces an inconvenient truth on climate change. While the former Massachusetts governor often touts his decision not to sign up for a regional cap-and-trade compact, he also glosses over a six-year-old set of carbon dioxide rules that his aides touted at the time as the first in the country for electric utilities. Under Romney's regulations, finalized in September 2006, Massachusetts's six largest power plants faced mandatory CO2 limits with several market-friendly compliance options designed to help keep the costs down. Democrats and environmentalists panned Romney's rules as weak tea. Many felt burned by the governor's decision not to join then-New York Republican Gov. George Pataki and other neighboring state leaders in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But Romney's problem is now on the other side of the political spectrum as critics on his right said they are troubled by a decision to implement the CO2 limits in the first place. Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign, for example, has done its homework. It released a 60-second Web video last month hitting Romney for the CO2 rules, likening them to the Obama administration's EPA climate policies. Perry aides last week also circulated news clips on the Romney rules from 2006. They argued that even if Massachusetts didn't participate in RGGI, Romney still should be held accountable for putting mandatory caps on greenhouse gases. ""Mitt Romney is misleading the American public by criticizing policies he enacted as governor of Massachusetts,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. ""Mitt Romney has been running for president for six years, but he can't run from his record."" If elected president, Romney has said he'd reverse Obama-era environmental rules, including EPA's endangerment finding that declared carbon dioxide a threat to public health, making it subject to restrictions under the Clean Air Act. Speaking last week at a fundraiser in Pittsburgh, Romney said he was a skeptic on global warming science. And he recounted his decision on RGGI to explain why he would reject a cap-and-trade system. ""I actually had in Massachusetts a consortium of states that came together with a cap-and-trade program. It was called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,"" he said. ""And all the governors, Gov. [George] Pataki and so forth, all signed it. I refused to sign. I do not believe in a cap-and-trade program."" Romney aides did not respond to a request for comment about the Massachusetts CO2 regulations. Campaign aides told The Wall Street Journal last month that the climate rule came at the end of a lengthy process that started in 2001 with former Republican Gov. Jane Swift. But when the rules were issued, Romney was front and center to take credit. In a December 2005 news release announcing the rules would take effect at the start of the new year, Romney said, ""Massachusetts continues to be committed to improving air quality for all our citizens. These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress in the battle to improve our environment. They help us accomplish our environmental goals while protecting jobs and the economy."" The release touted how the limits were the ""toughest in the nation,"" and it celebrated the assistance of John Holdren, then a Harvard environmental policy professor, and Billy Pizer, then an environmental economist at the D.C. think tank Resources for the Future. Romney's critics have pounced on Holdren's role in the climate rule, noting he's now the head of Obama's White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Perry campaign also highlighted his reliance on Gina McCarthy, the Obama EPA air chief who served Romney at the time as undersecretary for policy in his Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. On Monday, Pizer said Romney's CO2 rule didn't strike him at the time as that big of a deal because it was so narrowly focused on just a few power plants. ""He was trying to burnish his environmental credentials and put the best spin on whatever environmental accomplishments were going on,"" said Pizer, now a faculty fellow at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. ""I don't remember thinking at the time it was hugely significant. But of course anything at this point trying to reduce emissions should be viewed as significant."""

Perry offers a complete overhaul of how business is done in Washington. Gov. Romney fails to realize that deficits are the result of too much spending, not a lack of revenue. ""Mitt Romney's Washington Establishment approach to the economy and the federal budget is based on the false belief that Americans simply want a reshuffling of the status quo. Gov.

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 4, 2011","Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Op-Ed: ""When I am President...""","Governor Perry wrote this op-ed, which appeared in the Washington Times on November 3, 2011: Washington is broken and must be completely overhauled to get America working again. The tinkering technocrats think Washington can be fixed with a pair of tweezers. I, on the other hand, think it will require a president with the courage to take a sledgehammer to the three pillars of big government: overspending, overtaxation and overregulation. Upon taking the oath of office, I will take immediate executive action to begin dismantling the Washington establishment so we can rebuild the American economy from the foundation up. First, I will issue an executive order prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services from any further implementation of Obamacare until we can fully repeal this unconstitutional government mandate, which, if it stands, will diminish our health care and kill jobs. Second, I will order federal agencies to begin opening American energy fields for exploration and development, which will kick-start economic growth, reduce our dependence on energy from hostile foreign sources and eventually create 1.2 million jobs across every sector of the economy. I also will work with Congress to ensure that new revenue generated from energy production on federal lands is used to pay down the national debt. Third, I will impose an immediate moratorium on all pending federal regulations, during which government agencies must audit every measure passed since 2008 to determine its necessity and impact on job creation. Those measures that kill jobs will be repealed. And fourth, I will deploy thousands of National Guard personnel to secure our southern border until we can provide the permanent increase in manpower, technology and fencing needed to protect the American homeland in the long run. If I am elected, Washington will no longer abdicate its constitutional responsibility to secure the border or force states to fend for themselves. In addition to exercising executive authority during the first 100 days of my presidency, I also will lay out a sweeping legislative agenda that will fundamentally change the way Washington works. My Cut, Balance and Grow plan will jolt our economy back to life by cutting taxes and spending, balancing the budget by 2020 and growing private-sector jobs. With a 20 percent flat tax that will enable Americans to file their tax returns on a postcard, we will end the Internal Revenue Service as we know it. My-flat tax proposal will derail the gravy train of lobbyists and lawyers feeding at the government trough by eliminating the loopholes and carve-outs that the biggest companies with the most lobbyists exploit to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever. My plan not only will level the playing field for small businesses, it will cut the corporate tax to make American employers of all sizes more competitive in the global marketplace and encourage job growth at home. My plan also will force government to live within its means by cutting billions of dollars from discretionary spending, capping spending at 18 percent of gross domestic product and putting Congress on track to balance the budget by 2020. Despite all the promises of reform, earmarks remain a congressional addiction. My plan will make Congress kick the habit cold turkey. Throughout my presidency, I will veto any budget that contains earmarks. The same goes for bailouts. I am confident we can make progress on all of these reforms in the first 100 days. But ultimately, the status quo will never change until voters take back Washington. As the federal government grows and grows, the ruling elites in Washington are insulated from the economic mess they created. Consider just two examples: While home prices have continued to slump in virtually every other region of the country over the past year, Washington bureaucrats have seen their homes increase in value, thanks in part to a surge in government spending. And according to a Bloomberg analysis, Washington is now America's richest metropolitan area on a per capita basis, surpassing even Silicon Valley. While millions of Americans have lost jobs since 2009, the average federal worker in our nation's capital has seen his pay increase to more than $126,000 per year, including benefits. This is simply obscene. As president, I will fight for an across-the-board pay freeze for Congress and all federal employees, excluding the military and public-safety workers, until the budget gets balanced. There is a massive reality gap between the American people and the ruling elites in Washington. Our next president must have the courage to close it. America cannot afford four more years of a president who continues on the course to economic ruin or a Republican alternative who simply tinkers with the status quo while the Washington establishment brazenly continues its spendthrift ways. If I am elected, I will take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment so we can get America working again."

""Mitt Romney rails against magnets that encourage illegal immigration, but the magnetic pull of his free health care for illegal immigrants made Massachusetts an attractive destination,"" said Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan. Rules adopted by the Romney administration on May 1, 2004, for the state's ""Free Care"" health care program defined eligibility as residency in Massachusetts with no requirement for citizenship. The rules clearly state ""a Hospital or Community Health Center shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, citizenship... in its policies, or in its application of policies, concerning the acquisition and verification of financial information, pre-admission or pretreatment deposits, payment plans, deferred or rejected admissions, or eligibility for Free Care."" [1] The ""health care albatross"" known as Romneycare, signed into law April 12, 2006, overhauled the Massachusetts health care system, and a recent investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed, ""There was broad understanding when Romney signed it that at least some people who would benefit would be in the country illegally."" [2, 3] In fact, eight days before Romneycare was signed into law, NPR reported on April 4, 2006, ""The people that wrote the bill assume that there will always be some who fall through the cracks, you know, the recent arrivals or people who don't file taxes, undocumented immigrants and so on. And for them, the states Free Care Pool will pay."" [4] Romneycare, which President Obama's health care takeover was modeled after, killed 18,000 jobs in Massachusetts last year and resulted in $8 billion in additional cost to taxpayers, including almost $4 billion in federal funding, a cost spread across American taxpayers in all 50 states.

Bush administration to ""make sure you don't lose the country and you don't lose the financial system."" [1] During the debate, Romney also refused to rule out another Wall Street bailout. Romney was asked, ""So would you or would you not be open to another Wall Street bailout?"" In his answer, Romney said, ""You do want to make sure that we don't lose the country and we don't lose our financial system and we don't lose American jobs, and that all the banks don't go under. So, you have to take action very carefully to make sure that you preserve our currency and preserve our financial system.""

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 7, 2011","Press Release - Manufactured Mitt: His Carefully Choreographed, Rare Iowa Appearances Attempt to Hide Positions on Carbon Emissions","After Mitt Romney skipped a presidential forum in Iowa hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers last week, he should use today's appearance at Dubuque manufacturing facility to answer the tough questions he is avoiding about his record of environmental activism.

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 8, 2011",Press Release - Rick Perry: Fixing Washington Requires a Sledgehammer,"Gov. Perry wrote this op-ed, which was featured on CNBC.com today. In the last three years, 2.4 million Americans have lost jobs. 45 million Americans now rely on food stamps just to feed their families. Our debt has swollen by $4 trillion, and our national credit rating has been downgraded for the first time in history. Make no mistake: under President Obama, it is midnight in America. With so much at stake, America can no longer afford lukewarm half-measures from politicians who shrink from the fight for fear of offending the Washington elite. Establishment politicians got us into this mess, and they cannot get us out of it by tinkering at the margins of a system that is completely and utterly broken. While the establishment believes Washington can be fixed with a pair of tweezers, I know that it will require a sledgehammer. The first step to get America working again is to end the IRS as we know it with a 20% flat tax that is simple enough to file on a postcard. My Cut, Balance and Grow plan gives every American a choice: either continue to pay the current tax rates, or opt for a new flat tax with a higher standard exemption and deductions for mortgage interest, charitable donations and state and local taxes. My plan will cut taxes for every income group and save Americans up to $483 billion in annual compliance costs. My flat tax proposal ends the gravy train of lobbyists and lawyers feeding at the government trough by eliminating the loopholes and carve-outs that the biggest companies with the most lobbyists exploit to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever. And it not only levels the playing field for small businesses, it cuts the corporate tax rate to help American employers of all sizes compete more effectively in the global marketplace. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the business tax reforms I'm proposing will pump over $1 trillion back into the American economy and create more than 2 million jobs. We can create at least another 1.2 million jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil simply by tapping the resources under our own soil. As president, I will order federal agencies to begin opening American energy fields for exploration and development and work with Congress to ensure that new revenue generated from energy production on federal lands is used to pay down the national debt. I know something about helping the private sector create jobs. My state has gained more than one million jobs since I've been governor, including 40% of all new American jobs since June 2009. But growing the economy and cutting taxes will not be enough to right America's economic course. Washington politicians have to stop spending all the money. My Cut, Balance and Grow plan forces government to live within its means by cutting billions of dollars from discretionary spending, capping spending at 18 percent of gross domestic product and putting Congress on track to balance the budget by 2020. Despite all the promises of reform, earmarks remain a Congressional addiction for members of both parties. My plan will make Congress kick the habit cold turkey. Throughout my presidency, I will veto any budget that contains earmarks. The same goes for bailouts. And I have the record to back up that promise. I am the first Texas governor to cut state spending since World War II. I cut $15 billion from the last budget alone. And citizens of my state now enjoy the second lowest government debt per capita in America. To understand the massive disconnect between Washington and Main Street, compare the economic situation in our nation's capital with the rest of the country. According to a Bloomberg analysis, Washington D.C. is now America's richest metropolitan area on a per capita basis, surpassing even Silicon Valley. While millions of Americans have lost jobs since 2009, the average federal worker in our nation's capital has seen their pay increase to more than $126,000 per year, including benefits. Think about that: the people who have seen their income decrease or disappear are forced to pay more in taxes so bureaucrats can make higher and higher salaries. And yet, do we ever hear President Obama lamenting this form of wealth redistribution? The fleecing of the American taxpayer will end when I am president. I will fight to freeze the salaries for every member of Congress and every federal employee, excluding the military and public safety workers, until the budget gets balanced. America cannot afford four more years of a president who continues on the course to economic ruin, or a Republican alternative who simply tinkers with the status quo while the Washington establishment brazenly continues its spendthrift ways. I have never been afraid of a fight, and I don't run away from conservative principles when the going gets tough. If I am elected, I will take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment so we can get America working again."

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 12, 2011",Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Clear Winner of CBS Debate; Highlights Commitment to Unapologetic Leadership At Home and Abroad,"SPARTANBURG, S.C.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry clearly won tonight's debate, hosted by the South Carolina GOP (SCGOP), CBS and National Journal, setting the agenda early with regard to foreign aid. CBS' Scott Pelley even directed a similar line of questioning to other candidates, who agreed with the governor's position. Gov. Perry made it clear that Israel is a special ally to the United States and would continue to be a beneficiary of foreign aid. He reminded voters all across the nation that he volunteered to wear the uniform of the U.S. Air Force, which sets him apart from virtually everyone else on stage. The most powerful moment of the debate was when Gov. Perry forcefully said he would use all means necessary to protect young men and women serving overseas. He also stressed the need to sanction the Iran Central Bank to deter Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. ""America has the greatest military in the world and we owe it to the men and women who daily put their lives on the line to command a clear foreign policy driven by America's vital interests,"" said Gov. Perry. ""We can no longer afford the failed leadership of President Obama, which has wrecked our standing in the world, along with our economy. ""A strong defense and a strong economy go hand in hand you can't have one without the other.  We must have both if we are to remain free. I will work to restore confidence in America both at home and abroad, by implementing policies that will reinvigorate our economy while upholding consistent foreign policy so our allies know where we stand."" Gov. Perry is a veteran the U.S. Air Force, where he served as a tactical airlift pilot from 1972-1977. As governor of Texas, he is commander of the Texas National Guard, which in recent years was deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan and to border security operations. During the debate, Gov. Perry said he would start all U.S. foreign aid budget decisions at zero, approving aid that is in America's best interest for deserving nations like our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Gov. Perry also reiterated his commitment to leading our county, at home and abroad, with conviction and strength. He pledged to uphold foreign policy based on America's interests, use every tool available to support our allies and deter our adversaries, and engage our military only as a last resort, but when necessary, engage it forcefully, with clear objectives and a path to achieve those objectives. The governor also championed his Cut, Balance and Grow plan and reiterated key parts of his Energizing American Jobs and Security plan, which will create up to 1.2 million jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel. It is based on one simple premise: make what Americans buy, buy what Americans make, and sell it to the world. Our nation is most secure when we have the strongest economy in the world. Gov. Perry's job creation record and vision to get America working again will revitalize our country's economic strength and security. He is the only candidate in this race that has the record of creating a pro-jobs, pro-innovation and pro-business environment, which allowed Texas to create almost 40 percent of all the jobs across the country since June of 2009. Under Gov. Perry, Texas has created more than one million net new jobs and ranked first in job creation. Under President Obama, America has lost more than two million jobs.

Rick Perry appeared on the Sean Hannity radio show this afternoon and responded to House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who earlier today accused Gov. Perry of ""pandering to the tea party."" Gov.

When people like Steny Hoyer come out there and go, 'Is this guy being serious?' Yeah, you better believe it Steny. Americans are serious. They're serious about the spending that's going on.

Perry continued, ""It's not a surprise to me when I laid out this fundamental reform that I talk about and ask the American people to consider a part-time citizen Congress, that career politicians like Steny Hoyer don't like my plan to overhaul Washington.

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 15, 2011","Press Release - Gov. Perry Unveils ""Uproot and Overhaul Washington"" Plan","Calls for part-time Congress, ending lifetime appointments for federal judges, elimination of agencies and privatizing TSA, Fannie and Freddie BETTENDORF, Iowa - Gov. Rick Perry today unveiled his Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan to fundamentally reform the three branches of government and review all federal departments, agencies, and spending programs from the top down. The governor's Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan includes establishing a part-time, citizen Congress, cutting congressional salaries, ending lifetime appointments of federal judges, issuing an immediate moratorium on new and pending federal regulations, and dismantling wasteful, redundant federal agencies, Gov. Perry announced his plan at the Schebler Manufacturing Facility in Bettendorf, Iowa. Gov. Perry's full plan can be viewed at http://www.rickperry.org/uproot-and-overhaul-washington-html/ ""Washington is too broken to be fixed by tinkering on the margins,"" said Gov. Perry. ""I do not believe Washington needs a new coat of paint, it needs a complete overhaul. We need to uproot, tear down and rebuild Washington, D.C. and our federal institutions. ""Washington is so broken, Americans will accept nothing less than a complete overhaul of the way business is done in America. We need new leadership. We need a new builder. We need a Washington Outsider. Unique to the Republican field, I have never been an establishment figure. My career has been that of a Washington outsider."" Gov. Perry's plan will reform the federal judiciary by ending lifetime appointments of all unelected federal judges. He will champion a constitutional amendment to prospectively institute 18-year terms for the Supreme Court, staggered every two years, so that justices are replaced in order of seniority every other year. This will instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics and put an end to the ever-increasing tenure of justices. Second, the governor's plan calls for fundamental reform of the legislative branch by establishing a part-time, citizen Congress that cuts in half their salaries, office budgets and time in Washington. Additionally, if Congress cannot balance the budget by 2020, as the governor has previously called for, their salaries should be cut in half again. Gov. Perry will also work to freeze Congressional and federal civilian salaries until the budget is balanced, holding Congress accountable to the American people. ""Congress is out of touch because Congressmen are overpaid, over-staffed and away from home too much,"" said Gov. Perry. ""It's time to create a part-time Congress where their pay is cut in half, their office budgets are cut in half, and their time in Washington is cut in half.  And if they do not submit a budget that balances by 2020 as my plan calls for, we should cut their pay in half again."" Gov. Perry also noted recent abuse by Congressional members of insider information that has been used to enhance their stock portfolios, and is calling for the criminalization of such insider trading by members of Congress. Not only will that be a part of the governor's government reform plan, but he is also calling on Congress to pass such a law immediately. (Watch Gov. Perry's video calling for an end to this practice at http://bit.ly/uj73gl) The governor added, ""Congress has proven it can't be trusted to watch our money, and now its clear they can't be trusted with theirs. Any Congressman or Senator that uses their insider knowledge to profit in the stock market ought to be sent to jail - period."" Third, Gov. Perry's plan will reform congressional spending, through measures that include:  Ending bailouts and earmarks, and veto of any legislation containing such measures Passing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution Ending federal funding of Planned Parenthood Vetoing legislation that places new, unfunded mandates on states, local communities or schools Supporting legislation requiring a two-thirds majority to pass tax increase Capping federal spending to 18 percent of GDP (average amount over last 50 years)  Lastly, Gov. Perry called for the dismantling and rebuilding of federal bureaucracy, including the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the elimination of agencies that perform redundant functions. ""No longer will we prop up failed entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were at the heart of the economic collapse because of mortgage financing policies that gave false confidence to homebuyers who have now defaulted or are under water,"" said Gov. Perry. ""We will privatize Fannie and Freddie so politicians can no longer politicize them, and taxpayers will no longer be fleeced by them."" The governor's plan will also eliminate the departments of Commerce, Education and Energy, moving key programs, like National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Nuclear Security Administration and civil rights programs, among others, to more appropriate federal departments. The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Homeland Security will be completely restructured and reformed, and the Transportation Security Administration will be transitioned to a public-private partnership. ""We will perform a full audit of the federal government, and there will be no sacred cows, including wasteful spending at the Department of Defense, where every dollar we spend should support our warfighters around the world,"" Gov. Perry said. ""And we will say to every bureaucrat: no salary increases until the federal budget is balanced. And because a president must lead by example, we should cut his salary in half until the budget is balanced."" Additionally, the governor reiterated his call for a moratorium on all pending federal regulations, an audit of every regulation promulgated since 2008 and subsequent repeal of any regulations that are not found to be affordable, effective and compatible with job creation. Gov. Perry's plan is the third in a series of key policy initiatives Gov. Perry has unveiled in the last several weeks, including his Cut, Balance and Grow plan and his Energizing American Jobs and Security plan. Cut, Balance and Grow cuts personal and business tax rates to a lower, flat 20 percent rate, cuts federal spending, ends earmarks and corporate loopholes and calls for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. Energizing American Jobs and Security will create up to 1.2 million jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel.

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 19, 2011",Press Release - Gov. Perry Shares Staunch Commitment to Conservative Values At Thanksgiving Family Forum,"DES MOINES, Iowa  Texas Gov. Rick Perry today participated in the Presidential Thanksgiving Family Forum, hosted by the Family Leader, where he reiterated his principled and longstanding commitment to conservative values. ""I am a faithful, fiscal and social conservative of conviction, not of convenience,"" said Gov. Perry. ""As Governor of the State of Texas, I have signed more pro-life legislation than any governor in my state's history and championed and signed the Texas Defense of Marriage Act. Traditional family values are important to me, to the people of Iowa and to citizens and future of our nation. America needs to reenergize limited government, entrepreneurship and the traditional values that helped us become the greatest, most prosperous nation in history."" Gov. Perry is a staunch defender of life, having signed more pro-life legislation than any other governor in Texas history. He most recently demonstrated his commitment to protecting the lives of the unborn in his Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan, in which he pledged to eliminate the federal funding of organizations that fund abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. He supported this same measure in Texas' most recent legislative session by signing important legislation, Senate Bill 7 and House Bill 1, which contain provisions prohibiting tax dollars from funding abortions. Gov. Perry strongly supports traditional marriage. He signed the Defense of Marriage Act in Texas in 2003, and supported enshrining this law in the Texas Constitution, a measure approved by voters in 2005, which defines marriage in Texas as a union between one man and one woman. He has also pledged to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that legally defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. As a life-long hunter and concealed handgun license holder, Gov. Perry has been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. During his tenure in Texas, he has signed ""Castle Doctrine"" legislation ensuring that citizens have the right to defend themselves in their homes instead of retreating. He has also worked to prevent local governments from infringing upon Texans' rights to have legally concealed weapons on public property, cut concealed handgun license (CHL) renewal fees for military, veterans and senior citizens, and labored to protect shooting ranges from expensive, frivolous lawsuits as part of his tort reform efforts. Last Tuesday, Gov. Perry announced his Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan, which would establish a part-time, citizen Congress, cut congressional salaries, end lifetime appointments of federal judges, issue an immediate moratorium on new and pending federal regulations, and dismantle wasteful, redundant federal agencies. Gov. Perry has unveiled other bold and conservative policies in recent weeks, including his Cut, Balance and Grow plan and his Energizing American Jobs and Security plan. Cut, Balance and Grow cuts personal and corporate tax rates to a lower, flat 20 percent rate, cuts federal spending, ends earmarks and corporate loopholes and calls for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. Energizing American Jobs and Security will create up to 1.2 million jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel. The Presidential Thanksgiving Family Forum, hosted by the Family Leader, included discussion among GOP presidential candidates about the conservative values Americans have long cherished. The forum was moderated by Dr. Frank Luntz, with faith leaders and socially conservative activists from counties across the state of Iowa in attendance. Citizen Link and the National Organization for Marriage served as keynote sponsors."

Perry wrote this op-ed, which appears in the Washington Times:Ever since theDepartment of Justice's gun-running operation known as Fast and Furious became public, the Obama administration's response has been slow and infuriating. Of particular concern is Attorney GeneralEric H. Holder Jr.'s lack of candor concerning what he knew and when he knew it.This is not a typical case of bureaucratic bungling. A 40-year-old Border Patrol agent,Brian Terry, and possibly a U.S. immigration agent, are dead because of a horribly ill-conceivedJustice Departmentoperation that went tragically wrong.Hundreds of Fast and Furious firearms have been implicated in criminal activity, and another 1,400 firearms are on the street because theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivesengaged in gun-walking  the selling of firearms to straw purchasers in an attempt to locate major weapons traffickers inMexico. This controversial tactic, involving thousands of weapons, means that brave law enforcement personnel along the border remain at risk.As details come to light, a larger shadow has been cast onMr. Holder. When initially asked under oath to say when he first knew about Fast and Furious,Mr. Holdertold the HouseJudiciary Committeeon May 3, ""I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.""But the evidence casts serious doubt over that claim. First, President Obama had commented publicly on the operation, noting on March 22  more than a month beforeMr. Holder's sworn statement  that an inspector general had been assigned to investigate the matter.Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, ranking member of the SenateJudiciary Committee, had sent a letter to theJustice Departmenton Feb. 16 requesting documents on Fast and Furious. ThatMr. Holderdid not know about Fast and Furious beforeMr. Grassley's letter and Mr. Obama's public comments is simply inconceivable.Perhaps more damning is that records showMr. Holderwas briefed about the operation as far back as July 2010, when the director of theNational Drug Intelligence Center,Michael F. Walther, sentMr. Holdera written memo that his agency would assist in the investigation of a gun trafficker who had acquired weapons under Fast and Furious. Another memo, from Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, notifiedMr. Holderof a sealedJustice Departmentindictment against weapons traffickers in Arizona.Mr. Holder's proclaimed ignorance leaves Americans to draw one of two conclusions: Either he is guilty of extraordinary bureaucratic incompetence or he is guilty of a cover-up meant to shield him from the consequences of an operation that has left at least one federal agent dead and continues to imperil many more.Either way, it is high time forMr. Holderto step down. If he refuses to resign, Mr. Obama must fire him immediately.Under the attorney general's leadership, our nation's top law enforcement agency proactively armed some of the most dangerous criminal organizations in North America, and at least one American is dead as a direct result. The damage done toMr. Holder's credibility is irreparable.Moreover,Mr. Holdernever apologized to  or even spoke with  the family of slain Border Patrol Agent Terry until he was confronted by Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, earlier this month, nearly a year afterTerry's murder.Drug violence is a serious threat to the United States and our citizens as cartels wage a bloody turf war. Additionally, asMr. Holderhimself announced recently, an Iranian national has been arrested for seeking the assistance of Mexican drug-cartel members in a plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador in Washington.Mexican drug cartels are a clear and present danger to America. More than 35,000 people have been killed in that country's drug war in the past five years alone, and the violence threatens to spill across our border every day.America simply cannot tolerate an attorney general who arms the very criminals he is supposed to protect us from and then refuses to comfort the grieving parents of a slain Border Patrol agent. Nor can we tolerate a president who lacks the courage to take decisive action in restoring justice to theDepartment of Justice.It is time forMr. Holderto go."
Rick Perry,R,p,"November 22, 2011","Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Sets Agenda in Foreign Policy Debate on Zero-based Foreign Aid, Misguided Defense Cuts and Sanctions on Iran and Syria","President Obama supercommittee budget failures threaten U.S. defense, Perry saysWASHINGTON, D.C.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry broke through and set the agenda in tonight's American Enterprise Institute/Heritage Foundation/CNN foreign policy debate on issues including zero-based foreign aid budgeting, strong sanctions against Iran and Syria and the danger of the looming defense cuts because of Washington's budget failures.""We need to sanction the Iranian Central Bank. That would be one of the most powerful ways to impact the Iranian regime,"" Gov. Perry said. ""Another option in the region is a no-fly zone over Syria so that nation and Iran understand America is serious about fighting nuclear proliferation and terror in the region. This president refuses to do that and it's another show of lack of leadership from the President of the United States.""During the debate, Gov. Perry spoke about his commitment to leading our county with strength and making policy decisions based on his unshakeable belief in American exceptionalism. Creating a strong economy and job creation environment is key to strong foreign and defense policies. Gov. Perry said he believes that our young men and women serving overseas deserve to be represented by a president who will make strategic decisions based on strategic information from military leaders on the ground. In contrast, President Obama has repeatedly made foreign policy decisions based on the political climate rather than America's vital interests, threatening our nation's standing in the world.The governor added, ""I don't think anybody is particularly surprised that a supercommittee failed. It was a super failure. This president has been an absolute failure when it came to this budget process and the looming and deep defense cuts are totally and absolutely irresponsible. Even President Obama's own Secretary of Defense says the cuts are irresponsible. If Leon Panetta is an honorable man, he should resign in protest.""During the debate, Gov. Perry addressed his plan to start all U.S. foreign aid budget decisions at zero, ensuring that the country is distributing aid wisely. The governor spoke again about his dedication to approving aid that is in America's best interest for deserving nations, like our close Middle Eastern ally, Israel.Gov. Perry is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, where he volunteered his service from 1972-1977 and served as a tactical airlift pilot. He is the only presidential candidate who volunteered to serve. As governor of Texas, he is commander of the Texas National Guard, which in recent years was deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan and to border security operations.The governor shared key pieces of his Overhaul Washington plan, which will establish a part-time, citizen Congress, cut congressional salaries, end lifetime appointments of federal judges, issue an immediate moratorium on new and pending federal regulations, and dismantle wasteful, redundant federal agencies. This plan builds upon other bold policy proposals Gov. Perry has presented in recent weeks, including his Cut, Balance and Grow and Energizing American Jobs and Security plans. Cut, Balance and Grow cuts personal and corporate tax rates to a lower, flat 20 percent rate, cuts federal spending, ends earmarks and corporate loopholes and calls for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. Energizing American Jobs and Security will create up to 1.2 million jobs in every sector, reduce our nation's dependence on hostile foreign oil, revitalize manufacturing and help contain the cost of electricity and fuel.The success and security of our nation depend heavily on the strength of our economy. Gov. Perry has the strongest job creation record of any candidate in the race. In addition, Texas has created more than one million jobs under the governor's tenure. Conversely, the nation has lost two million jobs while President Obama has been in office.For information setting the record straight about various statements made during the debate, please visit http://www.rickperry.org/cnn-heritage-aei-debate-recap/ or follow @PerryTruthTeam on Twitter."

Rick Perry,R,p,"November 29, 2011","Press Release - Citing Strong Criminal Justice and Border Security Record, Sheriff Joe Arpaio Endorses Gov. Rick Perry for President","AMHERST, N.H.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry today received the endorsement of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a steadfast advocate for border security and national leader in combating illegal immigration, citing Gov. Perry's unmatched efforts to bolster border security in Texas in light of a federal government that for too long has abdicated this basic responsibility to the states. Sheriff Arpaio made his announcement at Joey's Diner in Amherst, New Hampshire.""The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry. I have been watching Governor Perry and Texas closely and know his border surge operations with state, local and federal law enforcement officials have helped shut down the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and people,"" said Sheriff Arpaio. ""I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego. Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer.""As governor of Texas, Rick Perry has diligently worked to fill the gap left by Washington's abject failure to secure the nation's southern border with Mexico, and supported and passed measures to combat illegal immigration.He has directed more than $400 million since 2005 to provide law enforcement the tools they need to combat border-related crime. The governor's initiatives have put more boots on the ground, including Texas Rangers and National Guard units, and improved technology to help law enforcement detect and deter criminal activity on the border. In January 2009, Gov. Perry asked President Obama to authorize 1,000 additional National Guard troops and six helicopters to assist the state in doing Washington's job, but he has refused.""Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico,"" said Gov. Perry. ""I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs. As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer.""Gov. Perry's border security initiatives have resulted in the seizure of 6.8 million pounds of marijuana; 82,353 pounds of cocaine; 1,835 pounds of heroin; and 7,552 pounds of methamphetamine which has an estimated value of more than $6.5 billion. In addition, officers have seized $227 million in currency and more than 3,500 illegal weapons.Additionally, to combat illegal immigration, Gov. Perry:Championed a Voter ID law that ensures only American citizens will be able to vote in elections;Signed into law a requirement that only citizens and legal residents may obtain a driver license;Declared legislation outlawing ""sanctuary cities"" an emergency item in Texas, and added it to the call of the special session;Fought for tougher penalties for those who engage in human trafficking;Signed a law that requires counties to assist the state in tracking the number of illegal immigrants in Texas county jails;Passed an omnibus gang bill providing even more tools for law enforcement to be able to infiltrate and break up the transnational gangs; andProtected a Texas law that prevents any public agency, taxing jurisdiction or economic development corporation from receiving public subsidies if they have been found to have hired undocumented workers.Also known as ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been elected five times as Maricopa County Sheriff in Arizona, serving in the post for 20 years, and is respected for his successful efforts to fight crime, combat illegal immigration and raise awareness of the federal government's ongoing failure to secure the border. He served in the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1953, and as a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas for five years. He then joined the Bureau of Narcotics, eventually renamed the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) where he became one of the very first federal agents sent overseas to help dismantle the international heroin conspiracy operating in Turkey and throughout the Middle East. Sheriff Arpaio was a regional director for the DEA for Mexico and South America and was head of the DEA for Texas and Arizona."

Rick Perry Touts Faith in Constitution and Commitment to Make Washington Answer to the American People,"Gives strong performance at Huckabee Presidential ForumNEW YORK CITY  Gov. Rick Perry tonight shared his faith in the U.S. Constitution, plan to overhaul Washington and vision to get America working at the Republican Presidential Forum, hosted by Mike Huckabee and Attorneys General Pam Bondi, Ken Cuccinelli and Scott Pruitt.""I've lived a purpose-driven life and my purpose was never to be President of the United States, but our country's in trouble,"" Gov. Perry said. ""Our country needs us working together to take our country back. I hope again that you'll take a look at my plan and give me that second opportunity and I'll promise you that every day I will work to make Washington, D.C., as inconsequential in your life as I can.""Over the last few weeks, Gov. Perry has unveiled a series of plans he will implement to help create American jobs, transform Washington, D.C., and repair the damage President Obama's failed economic proposals have had on the American people.""It's been a wild and a wooly ride in this primary and I suspect that's going to stay the same,"" Gov. Perry continued. ""I hope everyone will give me a second look and take a look at my plan that cuts taxes, that balances the budget, that gets America working again and overhauls Washington. One of the ways that it does that is we'll put a part-time Congress in place. Just think about that. Send them back to their own districts to have a real job working back in their home districts. That's the way you really make a difference.""During the forum, the governor spoke about his Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan, which establishes a part-time Congress receiving only half of their current pay and spending only half of their time in Washington, so that they can spend more time at home living with the rest of the American people under the laws that they help create. Uproot and Overhaul Washington also calls for an immediate moratorium on costly, wasteful and unnecessary federal agencies, which will help to curb the spending of our overgrown government.""My Overhaul Washington calls for a part-time Congress, cutting their pay and staff and making them live and work under the laws they pass. I would end lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges. The idea that the federal government and federal courts tell us how we can pray, whether our kids can pray in school or we can have the Ten Commandments on our capitol grounds  that's offensive to me. I am the only presidential candidate who has never served in an administration or in Congress and never professionally lobbied in Washington or at the White House. I am the true Washington outsider in this race,"" said Gov. Perry. ""The American people are tired of having the prosperity of our country compromised by the direct line between Washington and Wall Street. It is time for Washington, D.C. to truly answer to the American people the way our Founding Fathers envisioned it would.""Gov. Perry also spoke about his Cut, Balance, and Grow and his Energizing American Jobs and Security plans. Cut, Balance, and Grow cuts personal and corporate tax rates to a flat 20 percent, makes tax filing simpler and more transparent and calls for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. Energizing American Jobs and Security will create up to 1.2 million jobs across every sector of the economy by reducing our nation's dangerous dependence on hostile foreign countries as sources of oil and instead utilizing our domestic energy resources to make electricity and fuel costs cheaper and more predictable. As the governor of the state of Texas for the last 11 years, Gov. Perry has an unrivaled record establishing the type of environment necessary to encourage job creation. Texas has led the nation in creating jobs while he has served as governor. During Gov. Perry's tenure, Texas has created more than one million new jobs. During President Obama's tenure, the country has lost nearly two million jobs."

Rick Perry for president.""I am honored to have Kurt's support and the support of so many other pro-life Americans,"" said Gov. Perry. ""As governor of Texas, I signed more pro-life legislation than any other governor in history. Our nation needs a president committed to protecting the rights of innocent unborn children.""""I know that Gov. Perry unequivocally believes that life begins at conception and does not waiver in his protection of the unborn, unlike some self-professed pro-life candidates,"" said Wuelper. ""But more than just talking the talk, Rick Perry has shown he is a man of strong faith and strong action. He has a proven consistent record of protecting innocent human life and has signed more pro-life legislation than any governor in Texas history, including the Parental Notification Act, the Parental Consent Act, the Prenatal Protection Act, and the Woman's Right to Know Act. That's why I am supporting him for President.""""In Texas, Gov. Perry successfully de-funded the nation's leading abortion provider, Planned Parenthood,"" Wuelper added.

Perry for president and encourage anyone who cares about fostering a culture of life in America to consider doing the same.""Gov. Perry's defunding of Planned Parenthood resulted in the shutdown of 12 Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas. Since 2005, Gov. Perry has signed budgets that include millions for pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life agencies that assist pregnant women. The governor also signed a ban on late-term abortions and a law that requires a doctor to perform a sonogram on an expectant mother before performing an abortion. Additionally, every Texas budget signed by Gov. Perry prohibits funding of abortions by tax dollars.""He doesn't just fight against abortion, Gov. Perry fights for life,"" concluded Wuelper.

Rick Perry,R,p,"December 8, 2011",Press Release - Rick Perry: Time to Get Serious About Insider Trading in Washington,"Gov. Perry wrote this op-ed, which appears today at the conservative BigGovernment.com.Congress is finally feeling the pressure over insider trading, the practice of trading financial securities based on non-public information available to a select few in government.After a series of investigative reports, including several here at Big Government, the American people are beginning to realize that what is wrong with this country can be diagrammed on a map, with a straight line connecting Wall Street and Washington, D.C.Now exposed to the light of day, the political establishment is determined to show the American people it is ""doing something"" to clean up its act.This week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the matter, taking what many observers saw as great pains to minimize perceptions of a systemic and bipartisan problem. But I remain skeptical, as do many Americans, that Congress will actually pass a bill with teeth that requires them to live by the same rules as the rest of us.The fact is, things will never change as long as the same Washington insiders remain in control. Washington is broken and needs a complete overhaul, but establishment politicians only want to tinker at the margins. This is why we can't ask a Washington insider to fix Washington, because it takes an outsider to overhaul a corrupt culture.My plan to overhaul Washington starts by creating a part-time Congress. We should cut their pay in half, cut their staffs in half, and cut the time they spend in Washington in half. A part-time, citizen Congress will not only get rid of the permanent political class  it will restore the vision of our founders and force members to live under the laws they pass with the people they represent.Second, my plan makes passing the STOCK Act a priority. Any member of Congress who trades on insider information should go to jail, plain and simple.And third, I will permanently ban all corporate bailouts. We shouldn't be awarding taxpayer-funded bonuses to Wall Street executives who defrauded those very same taxpayers, we should be locking them up.Americans who are frustrated by the excess spending, our stagnant economy and the corruption that permeates our nation's capital have a clear choice in this election.We don't have to sit back and take it anymore. We don't have to resign ourselves to replacing one Washington insider with another, or settle for modest reform that amounts to a reshuffling of the status quo. We don't have to tolerate a government that brazenly tells us that all are equal, but some more equal than others.It's time to clean house in Washington, starting with a real ban on insider trading that forces politicians to live by the same rules as average Americans."

Rick Perry today announced the formation of the Veterans for Perry Coalition aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown in Mount Pleasant, S.C. The veterans coalition reflects the strong support from veterans across the nation for Gov. Perry, the only presidential candidate in the race who volunteered to serve his country.Gov. Perry served in the U.S. Air Force as a tactical airlift pilot from 1972-1977, flying C-130 tactical airline aircraft, moving military troops and equipment. The Perry Veterans Coalition is already more than a hundred strong and will continue to grow as more veterans join to voice their support for their fellow vet.""My father was a tailgunner who flew 35 missions as part of the Allied effort to liberate Europe,"" said Gov. Perry. ""Like many from that generation, he spoke infrequently about his service because he knew the great cost of war and would rather think about peace. I was proud to follow in his footsteps, serving four and half years as a C-130 pilot in the United States Air Force. But I will be the first to tell you that this country has given me more than I could ever offer in return. It is one of the highest honors of my life to be endorsed by more than 100 distinguished veterans from all across the country today. As president, I will be committed to honoring their service with the resources, support and leadership they deserve.""""As the only presidential candidate who volunteered to serve his country, the way that I did, I am confident that Gov.

Perry truly understands the honor of volunteering to serve our great nation,"" said Major General James Everett Livingston, Medal of Honor recipient and one of the national co-chairs of the Veterans for Perry Coalition. ""He has advocated on behalf of veterans and their families as governor of Texas, and I know he will proudly represent me and veterans across the nation when he is president.""As governor, Rick Perry successfully worked to establish the nation's largest tuition assistance program authorizing $4 million for state military personnel attending public or private institutions of higher learning in Texas. He helped pass a constitutional amendment, approved by voters, to authorize an additional $500 million in bonds for veterans housing loans and cemeteries.Gov. Perry and Texas lawmakers worked to make voting while overseas easier for active-duty military members and extended the property tax exemption for fully disabled veterans to their surviving spouse while also ensuring that the property tax exemption follows disabled veterans to a new property if they move. He also created a $3 million workforce development initiative to ensure veterans and their families have the resources necessary to receive an education, get a job and return to civilian life after their deployments are over.Gov. Perry secured an additional $5 million to expand mental health treatment and support programs for veterans and their families and directed Texas state agencies to establish veteran-to-veteran support groups across the state. Finally, Perry and lawmakers established in-state tuition for veterans who are eligible for federal education benefits, and their spouses and children, while providing a tuition exemption for dependent children whose parent is a Texas resident deployed on active duty overseas.Veterans who want to stand with a candidate who believes in the values that our nation was built upon and one who volunteered to defend them, as they did, are invited to join the Veterans for Perry Coalition and show their support for Gov.

Rick Perry,R,p,"December 10, 2011","Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Corners Outsider Mantle on Healthcare Mandates, Bailouts and Conservative Economic and Foreign Policy Ideas","Offers winning performance at ABC News Presidential DebateDES MOINES, Iowa  Texas Gov. Rick Perry solidified his position as the only non-Washington, non-establishment candidate left in the GOP primary race, highlighting his consistent opposition to government healthcare mandates and Washington bailouts. Gov. Perry's unmatched record of job creation, plan to overhaul Washington and the importance of his faith and conservative values were highlighted during tonight's debate. The debate was hosted by ABC News/Yahoo!, ABC5/WOI-DT, The Des Moines Register and the Republican Party of Iowa.During the last few weeks, Gov. Perry has shared a series of plans he will use to strengthen the country's economy, create American jobs, sever the direct line between Washington, D.C. and Wall Street, and repair the damage that the failed economic proposals of President Obama have had on the American people.""The real issue is that people are sick of Washington, D.C.,"" Gov. Perry said. ""They're sick of the money that they're seeing spent. They're sick of the fraud and corruption that they're seeing. They're sick of seeing their kids' futures mortgaged because we've got a Washington, D.C. that is out of touch with the country. It's the reason why I talk about my Overhauling Washington plan; going to a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, let them spend half the time in Washington, D.C., send them back home to have a regular job like the rest of the people in their district and work under the laws that they pass. That, I will suggest to you, along with a Balanced Budget Amendment will go a long way towards stopping a lot of the nonsense that we're seeing come out of Washington, D.C.""The governor reiterated the key tenants of his three plans: Uproot and Overhaul Washington; Cut, Balance and Grow; and Energizing American Jobs and Security. His Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan creates a part-time citizen Congress, designed to make Congress spend more time living at home under the laws they create. The plan also calls for the elimination of oversized, ineffective federal agencies that are consuming taxpayer money and putting our country further in debt.""I have a record of doing that as the governor of the state of Texas over the last 11 years  we've created over a million jobs in that state while the rest of the nation lost over two million jobs,"" Perry said tonight. ""So there's a very clear blueprint of how to make this work.""""I can on a map diagram the problem that we've got in America today, and it's this direct line between Washington, D.C. and Wall Street, and it's the corruption that's gone on,"" Gov. Perry said. ""It's the idea of TARP; it's the idea of $7.7 trillion that we didn't even know was being put into banks. That's what Americans are really upset about. And it's going to take an outsider who can come in to put in the model of taxes and regulation, and be able to balance the budget by the year 2020.

""And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage.""Perry's declaration immediately resonated with millions of Christians around the nation who believe their faith is under attack and who've been waiting for a Republican presidential candidate to have the candor and moral fortitude to stand up and articulate why we are truly the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.If you haven't seen the ad, click here.It was during the Obama administration thatChristianschoolchildren were ordered to stop praying outside theSupreme Courtbuilding because they were violating the law. Instead, those American boys and girls were forced to pray for the elected officials while standing in a gutter.It was President Obama who dropped the words ""by their Creator"" when reciting a key excerpt from the Declaration of Independence to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  not once, but twice.It was the Obama administration that opposed the commemoration of a prayer by Franklin Roosevelt at the site of theWorld War IIMemorial on the Washington Mall, arguing that it would ""dilute"" the memorial's central message.And it was the Obama White House that asked Georgetown University to cover up all religious signs and symbols prior to a presidential address.Gov. Perry knows that faith made America strong, and it can make her strong again.I'm glad that Gov. Perry raised the issue of religion. It's a topic worthy of exploring merely for the fact that a leader's conduct and decision-making will always be influenced by what he or she believes at the core. A nation deserves to know what they can expect.""Bringing America back starts with faith,"" Gov. Perry declared during a speech Wednesday to the Republican Jewish Coalition.

Let me tell you, I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses,"" Gov. Perry said. ""I like these debates and I hope President Obama and I debate a lot.

Perry continued. ""And the idea that you can't tell the difference between lobbying and consulting, the idea that we have Congress staying there as many days as they do and the salary that they have. That's why I've called for a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, cut their time in Washington in half, cut their staff in half, send them home.

We do that, and pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the conversations that we've been having up here will be minor.""Gov. Perry's Cut, Balance and Grow plan establishes 20 percent flat personal and corporate tax rates, and simplifies the tax system by closing corporate loopholes and ending tax breaks for special interest groups.

Perry shared his record and vision to get America working again by bringing the pro-jobs, pro-business and pro-innovation model he helped to create in the state of Texas to the nation.

One of those is a part-time Congress to tell those members of Congress, 'We're going to cut your pay, we're going to cut the amount of time that you spend in Washington, D.C., and send you back to your district so you can get a job like everybody else in your district and live under the laws of which you passed,' and then a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.""Gov.

Rick Perry,R,p,"January 16, 2012","Press Release - Gov. Rick Perry Calls for An End to Obama's War on the States, Promotes Low Flat Tax, Overhaul of Washington Bureaucracy and Investment in American Jobs","Gives strong, confident performance at South Carolina Fox News DebateMYRTLE BEACH, S.C.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry stood out as a solid conservative and the only true Washington and Wall Street outsider left in the GOP race, and decried the Obama administration war on South Carolina and other states' efforts to pass Voter ID, immigration and other laws and policies.""This administration is out of control,"" Gov. Perry said. ""The state of Texas is under assault by federal government. South Carolina is at war with this federal government and with this administration. What this Justice Department has done, not only have they taken them to task on Voter ID, they've also taken them to task on their immigration law, and then the most egregious thing is the National Labor Relations Board coming into a right-to-work state and telling the state of South Carolina, 'We're not going to let a private company come in here.' That is irresponsible, I will suggest to you it's unconstitutional, and when I'm the president of the United States, the states are going to have substantially more rights to take care of their business and not be forced by the EPA, or by the Justice Department for that matter, to do things that are against the will of the people.""During tonight's debate, sponsored by Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the South Carolina Republican Party, Gov. Perry laid out his commitment to overhauling Washington, cutting taxes to a flat and fair 20 percent and sparking American job creation. The debate highlighted Gov. Perry's experience creating more than a million net new jobs during the last 11 years as the governor of the state of Texas, which is the 13th largest economy in the world.In response to the bickering between the other candidates on the stage, Gov. Perry said, ""This is a great example of the insiders that are having a conversation up here, and the fact of the matter is this: Washington, D.C., needs to leave the states alone and let the states decide this issues and don't do it from Washington, D.C.""Over the last several months, Gov. Perry has traveled the country sharing his plans to get America working again and emphasizing his commitment to bringing the change the American people want to see to Washington, D.C., as president. The governor's Uproot and Overhaul Washington plan establishes a part-time Congress, and calls for cutting congressional sessions, staffs and salaries in half. The plan puts an end to bailouts and earmarks, and is designed to stop the out-of-control Washington spending that has put our nation more than $15 trillion in debt.Gov. Perry also touted his Cut, Balance and Grow plan, which creates a simpler, flatter and fairer 20 percent personal and corporate tax rate; reigns in federal spending; and calls for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. He has also laid out an Energizing American Jobs and Security plan designed to take advantage of our domestic energy resources, making the cost of electricity and fuel cheaper and more predictable, revitalizing manufacturing and reducing our country's dangerous dependence on hostile foreign oil sources.""We need to cut the tax rate down to where people feel confident that they can risk their capital and have a return on their investment,"" Gov. Perry said. ""That's the reason that I've laid out a simple and flat tax of 20 percent with their home mortgage deduction and charitable deduction and local taxes deducted, get rid of capital gains tax, get rid of the tax on Social Security benefits and then take 20 percent of that and mail your check in. Even Timothy Geithner can get his taxes in on time with that type of a system.""Getting America back to work again  that's what I've done for 11 years as the governor of the 13th largest economy in the world. A million jobs that have been created in my state because we have created that climate where job creators know they can go out and risk their capital and have a return on their investment.""As the president of the United States, that's what I'm going to do. Walk into Washington, D.C., work towards a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and work to make Congress a part-time body so they stay less time in Washington, D.C., go back home and get a real job like everybody else has, and live under the laws that they pass."""

He began on Thursday with an upbeat and well-received speech outside of Dallas, where he appeared on stage surrounded by Navy SEALs and military families.  Plainly, he is establishing himself, much as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) did, as the candidate mostly closely attuned to the needs of vets, an effective way of emphasizing his own military career and his campaign's focus on national security. Moreover, he is showing he can operate effectively in a big speech setting, in TV interviews and in rural Iowa. It was as impressive a start as any candidate has had. For all that we can say, well done, Governor Perry."" Politico: ""Rick Perry's Still Got It"" ""but when it comes to glad-handing and working a crowd, Perry still sets the gold standard even if he trails in the polls. When he arrived in Boone, fresh off of a separate motorcycle ride he did for an organization that supports veterans, attendees and cameras swarmed him. The Texan posed for pictures, put his hands on peoples' shoulders and clasped attendees' hands as he worked his way across the field as voters praised him as a 'patriot.' He also got the rare shout-out from Ernst, who was asked how she felt about his organizing another motorcycle event."" The Iowa Republican: ""The Day Belonged To Rick Perry"" ""Perry's campaign put a lot of time and effort into the former Texas Governor's first day in Iowa as an officially announced 2016 presidential candidate.  Perry's entourage on Saturday was impressive, but so to was his showing at Ernst's event. Perry, the first of the 2016 presidential candidates to speak, set the bar high. The former Texas Governor ran from the barn in the background to the stage and gave an energetic speech that was by far the most optimistic speech of the day."" National Review: ""New Hampshire Journal: In The Backyard Today With Rick Perry"" ""As a new resident of the state, I found the whole event extraordinary, nearly mythic. Perry walked through the crowd, making an effort to shake the hand of every single guest. He exchanged pleasantries, answered questions, posed for pictures. Of one little girl standing next to him for a photo, he said, 'This one here likes rattlesnakes!' She giggled and looked shy. He greeted the military veterans in the crowd with particular warmth and respect. No guest was vetted; no questions were pre-planned; as far as I could tell, security was minimal. People ate burgers, dogs barked, the pink roses nodded in the heat. After Perry's speech (seamlessly and warmly delivered), one attendee asked Perry to lead the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. He did, and thanked the man for the suggestion. Another guest said, 'I'll ask you the kind of question reporters like to ask Hillary: What's your wife's favorite color?' (Answer: 'The same color as her eyes, blue.')  I don't know yet which candidate I will support in 2016; it's too early for that. But Perry is an impressive man, no doubt about it in this voter's eyes. Leaving the event, I thought, I love this country! Not a bad feeling for a candidate to inspire.

Rick Perry was met by a swarm of people Saturday as he approached his campaign booth at Sen. Joni Ernst's fundraiser. 'Nice to see you!' the smiling Republican presidential candidate said to a young man, greeting him like an old friend. Perry, a former Air Force pilot, embraced some military veterans, dressed in black leather motorcycle vests, as though they were brothers. He also posed for photos with dozens of supporters.

The event starts at 1PM, and he's arrived promptly on time. As new residents in the state, my wife and I were somewhat perplexed when we arrived to see that the event was not taking place in some auditorium, or even a parking lot, but on a quiet residential street in, I know I just wrote this at the beginning of the paragraph but, someone's back yard.

We're a few policy decisions away and obviously a leadership change at the top. It goes back to two areas in particular, energy policy and tax policy, expanding North American energy resources, there's more known resource reserves in Canada, the United States, and Mexico than in Russia and Saudi Arabia. You develop that, you drive down the costs of electricity, tie that in with the lowering of the corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the Western world, and you will have a renaissance in manufacturing in this country like we've never seen before.

Rick Perry,R,p,"June 10, 2015",Press Release - The Iowa Republican: A Rick Perry Comeback is Inevitable,"A Rick Perry Comeback Is InevitableBy Craig RobinsonThe Iowa RepublicanJune 10, 2015Click Here To Read The Full ArticleAs former Texas Governor Rick Perry officially launched his 2016 presidential campaign last week, the question being pondered by most people is whether or not he will get a second chance. It's a question that's been asked ever since Perry started making frequent trips to Iowa following the 2012 election cycle.As the 2016 Republican presidential field began to take shape, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina pleasantly surprised many Iowa Republicans. And while Fiorina is getting a lot of favorable reviews, the prime candidate who political pundits and observers should be keeping an eye on in Iowa is Perry. No candidate has worked the state more aggressively since 2012, and while Iowa has a history of rewarding hard work and determination, the tough lessons Perry learned in 2012 have made him a better candidate this time around.(...)Time is something Perry has had since leaving office. He's invested that time heavily in Iowa, and now we are beginning to see the results of his labors. Late last week, the Perry campaign announced that Dr. Sam Clovis, a popular conservative activist from northwest Iowa, had signed on to chair Perry's Iowa campaign. Clovis, who made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the open U.S. Senate seat in 2014, surprised many by finishing in second place in the primary. Clovis' U.S. Senate campaign was overwhelmingly powered by conservative grassroots activists, the kind of people who are absolutely crucial in a Republican caucus campaign.(...)Clovis is someone who you would expect to see supporting Rick Santorum, who he backed early in 2012, or a candidate like Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Yet Perry sealed the deal, and in doing so, got the support of a guy who can vouch for him in conservative northwest Iowa and beyond.Perry's campaign event in Perry on Saturday morning also exhibited the organizational prowess of the campaign he's built in Iowa and the appeal he still has as a presidential candidate. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker got a lot of attention by riding with Senator Joni Ernst to her first annual Roast and Ride, but all he had to do was show up and get on a bike. The Perry campaign organized a ride of their own, and in doing so, raised money for a local charity that provides service dogs for wounded veterans.Click Here To Read The Full Article"

Rick Perry,R,p,"July 2, 2015",Fact Sheet: Governor Perry's Economic Empowerment Program,"Here is my belief: the best welfare program in America is a job.""Job Creation:My first priority as President will be to reignite the engine of American economic growth, by reforming the tax code and requiring federal agencies to adhere to a strict regulatory budget. A growing economy will give those at the bottom of the ladder more opportunities to climb, just as it has in Texas.Incentivize Work Over Welfare:Many poor Americans want to leave welfare and rejoin the workforce. But they are hammered by rules that often require them to earn less money, after taxes, in a full-time job than they would earn if they didn't work and remained on welfare.If I am elected President, I will send to Congress a welfare reform bill that will not cut spending on anti-poverty programs. Instead, it will take the money we already spend on non-health care-related anti-poverty programs and split it into two parts. The first part will be an expanded and reformed version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, so that anyone with a job can live above the poverty line. The second part will consist of a block grant, so that states can care for their safety net populations in the manner that best serves them.Federal Sentencing Reform:One of the most significant things we did in Texas while I was governor was reform our drug-related sentencing laws for non-violent, first time drug offenders. Too many Texans were going to prison for these offenses, and once they got out, they found they couldn't get a job because they had a criminal record.I believe in consequences for criminal behavior. But I also believe in second chances and human redemption, because that is the American story. In addition to helping change lives, in 2014, Texas had its lowest crime rate since 1968, and we have been able to close three prisons.We can reform federal sentencing laws, just as we have done at the state level, to ensure more young people have a shot at a better life. And we can do so while keeping our low-income communities safe from crime.Education Reform:We all know we have to improve our schools. It's a fallacy to assume that the vastly different student populations across the country can be adequately educated with one-size-fits-all policies. We need to empower state lawmakers, school boards and parents to implement policies that address the specific needs of their students, and keep schools accountable and efficient.And we have to tackle the exorbitant price of a college education. One of the biggest barriers today to entering the middle classblack or otherwiseis the high cost of a college degree. A four-year degree at the typical private college now costs more than $170,000. The median home price in America is $205,000. We are literally asking poor students to mortgage their future in order to gain a college degree. This must end. In Texas, I challenged our state universities to offer a four-year college degree for less than $10,000. Many thought it would be impossible to drive tuition and fees that low. But today, 13 Texas universities have reached that target.We are on the cusp of an online revolution in higher education but only if the federal government rolls back the rules that make it almost impossible for students to gain accredited bachelor's degrees achieved with online instruction.Addressing the Skyrocketing Cost Of Living:Just as with college tuition we have to reduce the cost of living for those who need every dollar to be stretched as far is it can go. Federal regulationslike Obamacare's employer mandatedrive up the cost of hiring new workers. That not only means that companies hire fewer people, but that those increasing costs are passed along to consumers in the form of higher priced goods and services.Earlier this year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimated that federal regulations cost American businesses as much as $1.88 trillion a year. That's nearly $15,000 per U.S. household. If you add in state regulations, the problem gets much worse.Conclusion:If we do these five thingsif we create jobs, incentivize work, keep non-violent drug offenders young blacks out of prison, reform our schools, and reduce the cost of livingwe will have done more for African-Americans than the last three Democrat Administrations combined."

On Military Service And On Border Security, Trump Offers Only Hot AirNational Review Gov. Rick Perry July 20, 2015 Click Here To Read Being president of the United States is serious business, not a reality TV show. This is especially true for the next president, who will have a big job ahead after the failures of the Obama administration. Our challenges are too complex  and the future of our country too important  to let egos, inflated rhetoric, and emotion take the place of thoughtful discussion. I made the case recently for why GOP policies are the best to create opportunity across the country for families of all backgrounds. I've held up my home state's reforms in economic, education, and sentencing policies as examples of conservative governance that have made life better for minorities in Texas compared with other places around the country. And I've been honest about our party's shortcomings  including my own  in engaging all Americans in our conversations about the future of this nation. But we can't do that if we're pitting black against white against brown; rich against poor; women against men. Playing identity politics takes a page right out of the Democrats' playbook, and we Republicans are better than that. That's why rhetoric such as the kind employed by Donald Trump is damaging  it's damaging to our party, and most important, damaging to the United States of America. I believe strongly that Mr. Trump's philosophy is not conservatism, but rather a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense. Mr. Trump's absurdity reached a new low over the weekend, when he spit in the eye of every American prisoner of war, particularly Senator John McCain. But frankly, we should expect no better from a man who couldn't be bothered to answer the call to serve his nation when it needed him most. As a veteran and the son of a veteran, I find Mr. Trump's brand of vitriol particularly offensive, and I have no confidence that he could adeptly lead our nation's armed forces. His comments over the weekend should completely and immediately disqualify him from seeking our nation's highest office. Our nation's warriors have been let down and left behind by the bureaucratic bungling of the Veterans Administration. They deserve a leader who will stand up for them, not one who ridicules the deadly circumstances they willingly put themselves in when they volunteer to protect our nation. Then there is the issue of border security  a challenge Mr. Trump claims to have single-handedly identified and suddenly become expert in. But Mr. Trump's ridiculous and irresponsible assertion that Texas has not done enough to secure the border betrays his fundamental misunderstanding of this issue. And even though Mr. Trump may spend a lot of time talking about border security today, his interest doesn't predate his entrance in the presidential field. We heard no outcry from Mr. Trump when Jocelyn Johnson's husband, Rodney, was gunned down in 2006 in a sanctuary city by an individual who had previously been deported. Mr. Trump was similarly silent last summer, when we saw an unprecedented flood of unaccompanied children crossing the border because of President Obama's dangerous amnesty policies. Likewise last year, not a word from Mr. Trump when Border Patrol agent Javier Vega Jr. was shot and killed in front of his wife, two children, and parents by  again  individuals who had been arrested and deported multiple times. If Mr. Trump plans to ""tell it like it is,"" then he should tell the facts. Border security is a federal responsibility. Period. But when it became clear that Washington, D.C., wouldn't act, I told President Obama that if he didn't secure the border, Texas would. As the former governor of Texas, a state with a 1,200-mile border with Mexico, I had to live and govern under the shadow of the federal government's decades-long failure to secure our borders. And rather than sit idly by while Washington, D.C., left our communities vulnerable to a porous border, I acted. During my time in office, I oversaw the dedication of nearly $1 billion to border-security efforts. I've overseen surge operations with our state law enforcement, the creation of Texas Ranger Recon teams, and I even deployed the Texas National Guard to the border region last summer. I signed a bill strengthening penalties for those who engage in human trafficking  a bipartisan effort to put an end to the scourge of a modern-day slave trade that is enabled by our unsecured border. I also signed an executive order mandating the use of E-Verify for all state employees and contractors. By doing this, we ensured that people like Mr. Trump  who has a history of using illegal-immigrant labor for his construction projects (including his new hotel currently under construction in Washington, D.C.)  do not use taxpayer resources on illegal-immigrant labor. That is real, tangible action. Make no mistake: Contrary to what Mr. Trump seems to believe, Texas never should have had to do any of this, but we stepped in when the federal government failed. When it comes down to it, Mr. Trump and President Obama have similar records on border security. Neither seems to understand that it's the federal government's responsibility to secure our borders. Neither has taken the time to visit the border. Neither has paid any attention to the issue until it's become politically convenient. And most significantly, neither has put forward any thoughtful solutions to secure the border. Rather than thanking Texas for stepping into a gap it shouldn't have to fill, Mr. Trump has made clear that he believes the states should fend for themselves on border security. Rather than praising the men and women of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas National Guard, and Texas game wardens, Mr. Trump ridicules their tireless work to protect our communities. Not only is this wrong, but it perpetuates the same failed policies that have left our southern border porous and vulnerable. As I've said before, this will be a ""show me, don't tell me"" election. Our nation needs a thoughtful, experienced leader with the character, resolve, and will to rebuild what this nation has lost over the past six years. Mr. Trump has done nothing to prove that he is the man for the job. Click Here To Read On National Review"
Rick Perry,R,p,"July 22, 2015",Press Release - Governor Perry Vows To Defund Planned Parenthood,"CHERYL CASONE: Another controversial topic that has been making a lot of news and I want to get you to weigh in on this as well, the issue of Planned Parenthood. Some very disturbing videos have emerged of these top officials of Planned Parenthood basically saying that they're going to be selling baby parts, it's disgusting stuff. I know you're pro-life, I do know that, but would you pull federal funding from Planned Parenthood if you were president right now?RICK PERRY: Well we did that in Texas when I was the Governor. We zeroed out the funding for Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas and I see no difference between that and I think all Americans who have conscience looked at that video and realized that's not where they want their federal dollars being spent. I think Democrats and Republicans alike, they see that  that's abhorrent, and we shouldn't be spending federal dollars on Planned Parenthood."
Rick Perry,R,p,"July 27, 2015",Press Release - Wall Street Journal Editorial: One Down for Rick Perry,"One Down for PerryWall Street JournalA Texas appeals court throws out a trumped up felony chargeEditorialJuly 24, 2015on.wsj.com/1OwnJPGOne of the nastier political prosecutions in memory took a hit on Friday when a Texas appeals court dismissed one of the two felony counts against former Governor Rick Perry. The court should have thrown out the second count too, but that isn't likely to survive jury scrutiny.A special prosecutor in notorious Travis County essentially charged Mr. Perry for exercising his constitutional right to oppose and veto an act of the legislature. Mr. Perry threatened to veto a funding bill for the Travis County District Attorney's Public Integrity Unit unless D.A. Rosemary Lehmberg resigned. She had been arrested and pleaded guilty to drunk driving, but she refused to resign and Mr. Perry followed through with the veto. The charges boil down to criminalizing routine political debate and controversies.The appeals court ruled that the charge of ""coercion of a public official"" violated Mr. Perry's right to free speech. That's for sure. The second count of abuse of official capacity will now go to trial, but that could be reduced to a misdemeanor if a judge doesn't throw it out. Travis County prosecutors have a history of political prosecutions, and Republican primary voters should discount the one against Mr. Perry as they consider his presidential candidacy."
Rick Perry,R,p,"July 29, 2015",Fact Sheet: On Wall Street And Banking Reform,"If elected President, Governor Perry will not bail out a single bank on Wall Street.The Federal Reserve and Congress should consider strengthening the new rule requiring the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) to harbor additional capital requirements to ensure taxpayers are not on the hook for bailouts in the future.Requiring banks to separate their commercial lending and investment banking practices should be considered. Or, alternately, require these banks to hold a significant additional capital cushion for their trading activities.Dodd-Frank's ""orderly liquidation authority"" should be replaced with a true, orderly bankruptcy process so that banks of any size can fail.The bankruptcy code should be reformed to make bailouts obsolete. One idea that holds merit comes from the Hoover Institute, which proposed adding a new Chapter 14 to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with this in mind.There should be regulatory breathing room for banking with digital currencies like Bitcoin.Community banks, banks run as partnerships and asset management firms should be exempt from Dodd-Frank's regulations.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) needs to be reformed so that its leadership and funding are accountable to Congress.The CFPB needs to be put under a strict regulatory budget.On Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac:Congress should wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.While Congress is in the process of winding down Fannie and Freddie, the two entities should maintain strict capital cushions like big banks.Congress should also phase in a requirement that all loans sponsored by Fannie and Freddie are accompanies by higher, more responsible down payments.The trend of pushing more and more home loans to Fannie and Freddie should be ended in order to start rejuvenating the private insurance market.Fannie and Freddie should limit the cash-out refinancing of homes to 80 percent of its value."
Rick Perry,R,p,"August 3, 2015",Press Release - Major Border Action Taken by Governor Perry,"Legislation to Protect Children from Gang Recruitment (1999)Then-Lt. Gov. Perry helped enact penalties for those who attempt to recruit children into gangs.Anti-Gang Initiatives (2005  present)Provide funding to border areas to fight transnational gangs.Operation Linebacker (2005  2006)Developed by the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition with support from Gov. Perry. Awarded federal grants to border sheriff's departments to expand local patrol capacity along the border. Spanned across 16 counties along the Texas-Mexico border and used local deputies as a second line of defense for U.S. Border Patrol. Resources included:65 police departments53 border & coastal countiesTexas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Military Forces, U.S. Coast Guard & DPSOperation Rio Grande (June  October 2006) Expanded on success of Operation Linebacker. Operation Rio Grande was designed to maximize the impact of law enforcement resources on organized smuggling activity. The goal was to shut down organized crime between ports of entry and secure the border by increasing police presence in drug trafficking areas across the state. This operation centralized intelligence sharing by coordinating state and local law enforcement agencies, and established the Border Security Operation Center (BSOC) to further centralize border security planning.Virtual Border Watch Program (November 2006  January 2012)Part of a partnership with the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition. Aimed to expand on success of the Neighborhood Watch program. Surveillance cameras were placed in remote areas of the border. Connected to the Internet, these cameras allowed people all across the nation  and even other countries  to monitor movements along the border and report suspicious activity to law enforcement agencies. During the pilot period from Nov. 3, 2006  Nov. 30, 2006, the website received almost 28 million hits from more than 220,000 registered users around the world. The virtual Border Watch program has now transformed into Operation Drawbridge (see below).Operation Wrangler (January  July 2007)Expanded planning and tactics of Operations Linebacker and Rio Grande further into the state, covering metro areas and transportation corridors. Also continued to expand the centralized planning achieved in previous border-surge operations. Operation Wrangler placed 6,800 law enforcement personnel into known drug and crime corridors along the border for a 12 day period.Wiretap Initiative (2007)In 2007, Gov. Perry signed a bill that expanded law enforcement agencies' ability to use wiretapping to detect and deter serious crimes, such as kidnapping, human trafficking and money laundering.Operation Border Star (2007  present)A product of operations Linebacker, Rio Grande and Wrangler. Created unprecedented unity among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, and focused on reducing crime in targeted regions along the border. Operation Border Star relies on the BSOC and 6 Joint Operation Intelligence Centers (JOICs). The JOICs act as regional coordinating authorities, sending intelligence data to the BSOC, which plans and coordinates statewide operations in Austin. Operation Border Star also sends teams of Texas Rangers and National Guard troops to curb border crime and prevent spillover violence from Mexico.Ranger Recon Teams (Summer 2009  present) Teams are comprised of National Guard troops and Texas Rangers who are assigned to address crime hot spots in rural border areas. Also work as part of Operation Border Star.Contingency Plans for each Texas Border Security Sector (2009)Addressed the potential for spillover violence in Texas, including extortion, assault, kidnapping and murder by organized crime cartels.Operation Drawbridge (2011  present)Developed by the BSOC. An electronic monitoring program comprised of over 500 cameras along the border. When a Drawbridge camera is triggered, it sends an image to the DPS BSOC. If it shows something of interest, the image is saved and added to the stream of information DPS shares with other agencies. This sharing of real-time electronic images along the border alerts appropriate law enforcement officials to criminal activity, allowing them to efficiently respond to various situations as needed.Operation Strong Safety (2013)A multi-agency law enforcement initiative. Temporarily increased patrol presence in the Rio Grande Valley from Sept. 15  Oct. 4, 2013. Launched to address three public safety issues identified in the region: 1) significant criminal activity; 2) significant number of commercial vehicles on the roadways; and 3) unsafe driving practices. Assets deployed included surveillance aircraft, armor-plated patrol boats, fusion centers and increased manpower.2014 Surge OperationGov. Perry, Lt. Gov. Dewhurst and Speaker Straus directed DPS to plan and execute a surge operation of increased law enforcement in border counties to build on Operation Strong Safety and provide additional resources to combat cartels and related crimes (murders, kidnappings, extortions, child prostitution, sexual assaults, home invasions, vehicle pursuits and smuggling of drugs, humans, weapons and currency across the border).June 18, 2014: directed DPS to immediately begin law enforcement surge operations on the border to combat criminal elements taking advantage of our porous border and overwhelmed local and federal law enforcement.July 21, 2014: deployed up to 1,000 National Guard troops on State Active Duty to the border to support DPS's ongoing law enforcement surge.December 2014 Emergency Budget Execution Proposal ApprovedThe Legislative Budget Board unanimously approved the Governor's Budget Execution Proposal, redirecting $86 million of appropriated funds in Texas' budget to the Texas Military Department, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. This action allows Texas to continue its border surge operations through August 2015."

Rick Perry,R,p,"September 11, 2015","Press Release - Op-Ed by Governor Rick Perry: ""A 21st-Century Strategy For Defeating The Jihadists""","A Grand Alliance against TerrorBy Governor Rick Perry  September 11, 2015No words can do justice to the memory of the 2,988 people who died on September 11, 2001, including eleven unborn children and the citizens of over 90 countries. On this day especially, we pray for the safety of our nation's first responders, who carry on the legacy of service exemplified by those who gave their lives to save others. And we salute those sons and daughters of America who volunteered to don the uniform of our country, to ensure that something like 9/11 could never happen again.In the years since 9/11, we have asked much of those who have served our country. I'd like to share with you one such story of sacrifice, the story of Marc Alan Lee.Marc had dreams of becoming a professional soccer player. In 1997, he was scheduled to try out for Colorado's major-league team, the Colorado Rapids. But Marc blew out his knee. So instead he decided to major in Bible and theology at The Master's College in California. In 2001, Marc joined the Navy and earned a spot with the SEALs. On August 2, 2006, Marc was killed in Ramadi, Iraq.Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, the center of Sunni Iraq, had been home to many senior officials in Saddam Hussein's government  especially senior military officials. By 2006, after the American-led coalition reclaimed Fallujah, Ramadi had become the center of the Sunni terrorist insurgency. Our generals knew that if we could clear Ramadi of insurgents, we would be on our way to defeating al-Qaeda in Iraq.But clearing Ramadi would not be easy. It required fierce block-by-block street fighting. At one point, one of Marc Alan Lee's brothers on SEAL Team 3, Ryan Job, was shot by a sniper. Marc single-handedly braved direct fire from the enemy in order to give his teammates the cover to evacuate Ryan from the battlefield. In the process of doing so, Marc was fatally shot.Marc's sacrifice in Ramadi helped deliver a crucial victory to the people of Iraq. Ordinary Sunnis came to believe that Americans would stick by them, and one by one they found the courage to fight the terrorists in their midst. This courage became known as the Anbar Awakening. The surge worked. Americans, Iraqis, and our allies stabilized the country.This was the Iraq that was handed to President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton in 2009: not perfect by any means, but a place where the sacrifices of men like Marc Lee produced a hard-won stability, making it harder  but not impossible  for radical Islamic terrorists to threaten our shores.Obama and Clinton never understood that. They believed al-Qaeda in Iraq had been permanently defeated. In 2011, before Iraq was ready to stand on its own, Obama and Clinton allowed negotiations with the Iraqi government to collapse, and pulled American troops out of the country. ""After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over,"" bragged the president. ""We're leaving behind a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq,"" he told the troops at Fort Bragg.But Iraq hadn't yet become self-reliant, and our enemies had not gone away. Two months after Marc and his brothers retook Ramadi, al-Qaeda in Iraq and its allies announced that they were disbanding and reconstituting themselves as a new group: the Islamic State in Iraq.When Obama and Clinton pulled out, they abandoned the courageous Sunnis in Anbar who had helped us defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq. The president dismissed ISIS as a ""jayvee team [putting] on Lakers uniforms."" But a weakened ISIS took advantage of Obama's ignorance and navet to recruit our former allies to their side. ISIS told them: ""Obama has abandoned you. The Shiites in Baghdad have abandoned you. Either fight with us, or be killed.""Today, ISIS isn't merely comprised of wild-eyed Islamic terrorists. Its military leadership comes from some of the most sophisticated and experienced commanders in Saddam Hussein's old army. Last year, ISIS captured Fallujah. Four months ago, they retook Ramadi. Today, they control a swath of territory as large as Indiana.No big deal, says the Obama administration. When a reporter asked the president what his plans were for defeating ISIS, he said, ""We don't have a strategy yet."" When a U.S. general was asked about the fall of Ramadi, he said Ramadi was ""not symbolic in any way.""I can't even imagine how difficult it must have been for Debbie Lee, Marc Lee's mother, to learn that her son had died in Ramadi. But President Obama did something even crueler to Debbie Lee: He allowed ISIS to wave its black flag over the ground that Marc died to save, by ignoring and even mocking the warnings that ISIS was gathering strength.I have one word for President Obama and Secretary Clinton. That word is ""enough.""Enough of hiding our heads in the sand and pretending that radical Islamic terrorists don't exist.Enough of giving $150 billion to the mullahs in Iran, and believing they'll use it to plant flowers, instead of to kill Americans.Enough of making it up as we go along, of having no strategy to deal with our enemies other than giving in to them.Enough of cowering before our enemies and abandoning our staunchest ally, Israel.Enough of putting politics ahead of the safety and security of the United States.And enough of believing that the withdrawal of America will bring peace and stability to the world.President Obama is fond of saying that the only two options we have are conceding to our enemies, and war. He is wrong. What we have most sorely needed in the fight against radical Islamic jihadists is a coherent and comprehensive strategy, a strategy that will advance the stability of the greater Middle East and the security of the United States.That strategy has to start with a realistic assessment of where we are today, regardless of the dogmas of the past. Over the last 15 years, we've often spoken about a ""Global War on Terror."" But the reality is that the war against radical Islamic terrorists is largely a regional one.That regional war spans a larger area than the Middle East, as we've conventionally defined it. It was not in the Middle East but in the hills of South Asia that Osama bin Laden planned his attacks against the United States. Thanks to the strength of al-Qaeda in Pakistan, and the rise of Iran, the War on Terror now stretches from Libya in the west to India in the east, from Turkey in the north to Yemen in the south. At the heart of this regional War on Terror are four neighboring countries: Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.In Afghanistan, we have made real gains in the 14 years since 9/11. But President Obama is planning to repeat in Afghanistan his mistakes in Iraq, by engineering a premature, unconditional pullout that will allow the Taliban and al-Qaeda to thrive again, while ISIS grows in strength.The president's nuclear deal has given Iran an eventual path to nuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and hundreds of billions of dollars  resources Iran will use to destabilize its neighbors, kill Americans, and threaten Israel's existence. Iran's eastern neighbors  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India  have wrestled with jihadist violence for decades, and will now have to prevent a more powerful Iran from exporting its mayhem their way.ISIS has erased the century-old border between Iraq and Syria, drawing foreign fighters to the region and inspiring crowdsourced terror attacks abroad.Bashar Assad, after four and a half years of civil war, continues to use chemical weapons against his own people, driving young men into the hands of ISIS and al-Qaeda.Both countries are in tatters. In Syria over half the population has been killed, displaced, or exiled since 2011, and our allies in Europe now face one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our lifetime.The problems, clearly, are serious. And the solutions must be serious as well. It will not take Gulf War III to defeat ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Iran. From us, it will take a credible commitment, and a credible vision.The 20th century's Cold War was very different from the 21st century's War on Terror. But there is one thing we can learn from Presidents Truman through Reagan: the importance of a bipartisan, multi-national, multi-decade commitment to defeating a strategic and ideological enemy.We can put boots on the ground  and, where necessary, we should. But our brave men and women can't turn Syria into Sweden, or Iraq into Ireland. What they can do, along with our diplomats and aid workers, is help bring stability to war-torn countries. Stable governments and a stable international system will make it very hard for jihadists to maintain their foothold. Throughout our young century, from 9/11 to today, al-Qaeda and ISIS have flourished where sovereign states have failed.If I am elected president, America will help create a formal political and military coalition of 13 countries in the Middle East and South Asia to promote peace and stability in the region: Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. These countries don't agree on everything, just as we don't always agree with France or Germany. But each of these countries has good reason to defeat ISIS and al-Qaeda, and protect itself against Iranian aggression.In the first week of my presidency, I will bring the leaders of these nations to Camp David to assemble this coalition. Earlier this year, a number of Arab leaders refused President Obama's invitation to visit Camp David. Under my leadership, I am confident they will come, because they will once again understand America's long-term commitment to their security and ours.After that initial meeting, this new organization of Middle Eastern and South Asian states should meet several times a year, along with Western allies, to discuss economic, military, and cultural cooperation. As these ties deepen, it would not be inconceivable for these nations to build a formal military and political alliance in much the same way that we did with Western Europe in the decade after World War II.Under President Obama, our enemies believe they have learned a valuable lesson: that all they have to do is wait us out, and America will eventually abandon its friends. We can no longer allow that to happen. By creating an institutional framework that will outlive any particular president, we can stabilize and deepen our friendships in the Middle East and South Asia, regardless of which party is in power in Washington.As we build a new framework for international cooperation, we must recommit ourselves to a few clear strategic goals that orient our actions and directly address the security challenges facing southwestern Asia.Here is what our goals should be  what they must be.First, we have to eliminate the strategic threat posed by ISIS and al-Qaeda to the United States and our allies  in Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan, and throughout the region.Second, we must prevent Iran from destabilizing its neighbors through terrorism, and from developing a nuclear weapon designed to wipe out Israel, oppress the Arab world, and threaten the United States.Third, we must help our coalition partners cultivate an Islamic world that is tolerant of minorities and at peace with its neighbors.To achieve these goals, we must recognize the central importance of helping the largest minority in the Middle East: the Kurds. No one has done more to beat back ISIS than the Kurdish peshmerga. Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government has become a haven for persecuted minorities in Iraq and Syria. But the Kurds are fighting ISIS with Soviet-era weaponry, while ISIS fights back in advanced American tanks. If the Iraqi government in Baghdad won't help the Kurds defeat ISIS, then we should arm them directly and begin to treat them as the regional partner they aspire to be.While Kurds put their lives on the line to defeat ISIS, our nominal allies in Turkey have been aiding the very terrorist groups we are seeking to defeat, including ISIS and al-Qaeda. If Turkey wants to remain a constructive partner of the United States and our allies in the region, Turkey must end its tacit support for terrorists, bury the hatchet with its own Kurdish minority, and recognize that Turkey will be best off in a stable neighborhood, not a jihadist one.ISIS gained strength in Iraq because we pulled out, and because Iraq's Shiite-led government discriminated against its Sunni minority. Iraq's new Shiite prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has shown promise in addressing the corruption of his predecessor. But we must also call on our Sunni partners in the region to help Iraqi Sunnis stand up on their own two feet, especially if Iraqi Shiites are unwilling or unable to follow Abadi's lead.Unfortunately, the Shiite-led regions of Iraq have fallen under the sway of the leading Shiite power in the world: Iran. Thanks to President Obama's nuclear deal, Iran will have even more influence over Shiite Iraq than it ever had before. The deal affects so much more than Iran's nuclear infrastructure. It represents a historic shift in the balance of power in the region, away from our allies and toward Iran.I have pledged to rescind the nuclear deal on Day One of my presidency. But between now and then, Iran will become far stronger than it is today. I intend to order a top-to-bottom review of Iran's destabilizing activities, from terrorism to ballistic missiles, so that we can confront every aspect of Iran's aggression against its neighbors and the United States.A core goal of the new Middle East and South Asian coalition should be to deter the development of an Iranian bomb, and increase the costs of Iranian regional aggression. The only way the Iranian regime will become the peaceful and cooperative force that we all want it to be is if Iran knows it will pay a price for destructive behavior. A credible deterrent will require a serious political, diplomatic, economic, and military commitment from America, and a concerted effort from our coalition partners.I've only scratched the surface of the many things we need to do to restore stability to the Middle East and South Asia. The one thing we must come to accept is that the peaceful and prosperous Middle East of the future may not look like it did 20 or 40 or 100 years ago. Barring a true catastrophe, I am not willing to send 150,000 American troops back to Iraq. And without that level of American involvement, the ethnic factions of Iraq and Syria may choose a different path than the one imposed on them at the end of World War I.American power is most effective when our goals are realistic, when our endpoints are clearly defined, and when we are dedicated first and foremost to the preservation of international order.For decades, American politicians have obsessed over Palestinian statehood, while ignoring the conflicts between Sunni and Shiite, the ones between Arabs and Persians and Kurds, and the plight of Christian minorities. Today, it is those more ancient problems that are threatening the stability of the region and the security of the United States. They are problems that we can solve over time, but only after years of peace and cooperation.After World War II  the most destructive war in human history  the United States committed to help Europe regain its footing. It would have seemed unimaginable in those days, but today, institutions like NATO and the European Union have made Europe so stable that few people can imagine another all-out war in the heart of Europe.Six thousand years ago, ancient Mesopotamia emerged as the cradle of our civilization. Mesopotamians were the first people on Earth to use the written word. They invented irrigation, and cities, and our system of measuring time. So many of the good things we take for granted in our lives were first developed by people who live in what we now call Iraq and Syria.The barbarians of ISIS think that if they can destroy the historic remnants of Mesopotamia, they can also destroy the aspirations of Iraqis and Syrians to rejoin the civilized world. We owe it to our own security to ensure that civilization prevails over barbarism. Most important, we owe it to humanity.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/423840/grand-alliance-against-terror-rick-perry"
