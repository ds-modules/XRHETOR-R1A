Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 7, 2007","Statement of Hillary Clinton on Announcement of the ""Better Health Care Together"" Campaign","Washington, DC -- In response to today's formation of the ""Better Health Care Together"" campaign, Hillary Clinton released the following statement praising the coalition's announcement: ""The worst kept secret in America is that the health care system is not working for the vast majority of people in our country. Costs are spiraling out of control, already high premiums are getting higher and health care is getting further and further out of reach for millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans. Universal health care is not only a moral and health imperative, but an economic and jobs imperative as well. ""I have learned from experience that we cannot achieve the goal of health care for every American if we don't have buy-in from employers, government, and labor. Today's announcement by America's largest employer and some of America's largest unions, along with organizations from across the political spectrum, is one more piece of evidence that there's broad agreement that Americans deserve a health care system that covers everyone and lowers costs. ""Passage of a universal health coverage plan will be one of my top priorities as President. It is time for bold yet practical solutions and I will use today's encouraging news to continue my efforts to build support for universal health care."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 23, 2007",Clinton Statement on Vilsack Withdrawal,"Following is a statement released today by Senator Hillary Clinton: ""I have been proud to work with Tom Vilsack for years on the challenges facing our country, and I have a deep admiration for both Tom and Christie. ""Tom has made Iowa a leader in renewable energy and created thousands of jobs as one of America's great governors. We share a passion for protecting America's young people through expanded health care options, early childhood education initiatives and opening the doors to higher education to every American. ""I know he will continue to contribute to the dialogue about how to move America forward."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 6, 2007",Clinton Statement on Bush Administration's Yucca Legislation,"In response to the Bush Administration's recent announcement that it would reintroduce legislation on Yucca Mountain, Senator Hillary Clinton issued the following statement. ""The Bush Administration's latest announcement that it will continue to pursue its misguided policy on Yucca Mountain is very disappointing. ""I've long opposed using Yucca as a site for nuclear waste. Yucca mountain is not a suitable place for long-term storage of our nuclear waste. There are too many unanswered questions about both the geology of the site and integrity of the science done to support the decision to store waste there. ""It's past time to start exploring alternatives to Yucca mountain, because we need to find a safe, secure long-term waste storage solution. As President, I would work with the scientific community to address this problem and come up with alternative solutions."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 8, 2007",From the Senate: Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on International Women's Day,"Washington, DC -- More than a decade ago, I had the honor of participating at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women. Today, on International Women's Day, we have the opportunity to once again reaffirm the message that human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights. There has been much progress made. The number of women in the Senate and House of Representatives has reached an all-time high. According to the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the number of countries that have enacted laws against domestic violence has almost doubled within the past four years. And the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to the Grameen Bank and its founder, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, in recognition of the impact and importance of microfinance programs, which have helped millions of women and families around the world. But there is still a great deal of work we must undertake to help women achieve equal rights, equal protection, and equal status in their communities. This year's theme for International Women's Day is ""Ending Impunity for Violence Against Women and Girls."" The silent epidemic of gender based violence affects far too many women and families, both in the United States and around the world. According to a 2005 study by the World Health Organization, more than 50 percent of women in some countries surveyed reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners. The same study found that the majority of women who had experienced intimate partner violence did not seek help, owing not only to stigma and fear, but difficulty accessing the services that would enable them to escape such violence. Gender-based violence is not only a criminal issue, but a health issue. Women who have experienced domestic violence are at increased risk of contracting HIV. In our efforts to prevent AIDS in the United States and around the world, we need to ensure that women are in position to protect themselves against AIDS without fear of violence or sexual assault. In addition to intimate partner violence, too many women and girls around the world are vulnerable to other forms of violence. According to the United Nations, situations of armed conflict result in increased number of rapes, sexual violence and slavery for women. In some countries, women who have been raped or sexually assaulted are at risk of being murdered in so-called ""honor killings,"" which only increase the fear and stigma that women face. UNICEF reports that about three million girls experience female genital cutting every year. But there is hope out there. In the West African countries of Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, hundreds of communities have pledged to end the practice of female genital cutting. Women who have been subjected to abuse and sexual assault, like Mukhtaran Mai of Pakistan, have turned their tragedies into an opportunity to create positive cultural change. These examples show that we can -- and we must -- bring this violence out of the shadows, and ensure that violence against women is treated as the crime that it is. I believe that by supporting the brave individuals who stand up and speak out against gender based violence, we can make significant gains in achieving human rights for all women and men. I will work with my colleagues in Congress to support the elimination of violence against women, and help women and girls around the globe live their lives free from the threat of harm."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 12, 2007",Statement of Hillary Clinton on the Projected Shortfall in HAWK-I Program,"One of my proudest accomplishments is working in the Clinton Administration to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. As Senator, I've worked to strengthen the program and as President, I will ensure that every child -- every person -- has health insurance. I've been outraged that President Bush has not taken action to stave off shortfalls in this program which has meant so much to so many Iowa families. Tens of thousands of children in Iowa do not have health insurance. That will get worse, not better, if the President gets his way. ""Iowa has done a remarkable job enrolling children in the HAWK-I program, more than tripling the number of kids with coverage over the past six years. The projected shortfall in Iowa would force the state to cut the number of enrolled kids in half - crippling the progress of the past six years. I will be working closely with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that no state is forced to cut children from the SCHIP program. We should be expanding coverage, not cutting it. As I announced a few weeks ago, I will be introducing legislation that will expand SCHIP to help states cover every child. And as President, I will work tirelessly to have universal coverage so that no child -- no person -- in America has to worry about losing their health coverage."" Background: According to a 2006 survey sponsored by Robert Wood Johnson, 50,000 children in Iowa do not have health insurance. According to the report, uninsured children are twice as likely not to receive any medical care in a given year compared to kids with insurance.  15,700 children in Iowa will be dropped - DM Reg. 3/12/07 Anita Smith, Chief of the bureua of medical support, Iowa Dept. of Human Services.  31,819 - number of children in Iowa enrolledin the HAWK-I Program by federal budget year 2006 55,000 - number of uninsured Iowa kids according to Policy Project, Mount Vernon Iowa-based research group.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 13, 2007",From the Senate: Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Firing of U.S. Attorneys,"Washington, DC -- ""With the White House now acknowledging a direct role in the Justice Department's U.S. Attorney firings, the president must affirmatively step forward to explain what he is doing to address the politicization of our prosecutorial system and what role he and his aides played in this controversy. ""The president is the chief executive of the country and this matter goes to the heart of his ability to manage our federal law enforcement and U.S. Attorney system. It is imperative that the president act swiftly to explain what role the White House played in this situation, hold those who acted inappropriately accountable, and take responsibility."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 19, 2007",Hillary Clinton Statement on Iraq War Anniversary,"Today is the fourth anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. Those who have fallen have paid the ultimate price on our behalf and we continue to honor them and their families. It has become painfully clear over the last few weeks that we are doing a woefully inadequate job of taking care of our wounded. It is imperative that we improve our efforts on behalf of these troops immediately. A nation at war has a solemn obligation to do all it can for those who serve it on the battlefield. Four years ago, the Bush Administration launched a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Tragically, it misjudged the number of troops needed, miscalculated the cost, and mismanaged the mission. As a result, our nation now finds itself policing a sectarian conflict, our options are much more limited and it seems we're likely to have troops in Iraq for longer than any of us would like. The President is calling for patience. But Mr. President, the American people's patience has worn thin. It is time to change the course in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home. I am fighting to cap the number of troops in Iraq in order to stop the President's escalation and have proposed a phased redeployment of our troops so we can begin bringing them home. I've introduced comprehensive legislation that, if followed, would provide a roadmap out of Iraq. I hope that George Bush ends this war. But make no mistake -- if he doesn't, as President, I will."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 2, 2007",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Passover,"Hillary Clinton made the following statement in honor of Passover: ""I wish to extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the holiday of Passover, commemorating the story of the Israelites' escape from slavery and reminding us all of the blessing of freedom. The Passover Seder is a wonderful tradition, bringing friends and family together to tell this important story to each generation. As we honor the celebration of Passover this week, let us also keep in mind those who are still struggling to escape from persecution throughout the world. We wish for them too the ability to live in peace and freedom with their families."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 18, 2007",From the Senate: Statement on Supreme Court's Gonzales v. Carhart Decision,"Washington, DC -- ""This decision marks a dramatic departure from four decades of Supreme Court rulings that upheld a woman's right to choose and recognized the importance of women's health. Today's decision blatantly defies the Court's recent decision in 2000 striking down a state partial-birth abortion law because of its failure to provide an exception for the health of the mother. As the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v. Wade in 1973, this issue is complex and highly personal; the rights and lives of women must be taken into account. It is precisely this erosion of our constitutional rights that I warned against when I opposed the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 19, 2007","Statement by Hillary Clinton Commending Governor Lynch, New Hampshire Legislature for Leadership on Civil Unions","New Hampshire Soon to Become Fourth State to Adopt Civil Unions  MANCHESTER, NH -- Senator Hillary Clinton today made the following statement regarding the upcoming passage of legislation that will make New Hampshire the fourth state in the nation to adopt civil unions. ""New Hampshire has a long history of protecting its citizens from discrimination, and I would like to commend Governor Lynch and the New Hampshire legislature for their commitment and support for the civil rights of gays and lesbians,"" said Senator Clinton."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 23, 2007",From the Senate: Statement of Former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Death of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald,"Washington, DC -- ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. In the Congress, she brought her life experiences, her grit, her grace, and her sense of duty to the job, and her constituents and our country are better for it. As a former teacher, she never lost sight of our duty to the next generation and taught all of us a thing or two, whether she was standing against the genocide in Darfur or standing up for fair and free elections here at home. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 25, 2007",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"There are people right now in the world, not just wishing us harm but actively planning and plotting to cause us harm. If the last six years of the Bush Administration have taught us anything, it's that political rhetoric won't do anything to quell those threats. And that America is ready for a change. ""One of the great tragedies of this Administration is that the President failed to keep this country unified after 9/11. We have to protect our country from terrorism -- it shouldn't be a Democratic fight or a Republican fight. The plain truth is that this Administration has done too little to protect our ports, make our mass transit safer, and protect our cities. They have isolated us in the world and have let Al Qaeda regroup. The next President is going to be left with these problems and will have to do what it takes to make us safer and bring Democrats and Republicans together around this common mission of protecting our nation. That is exactly what has to be done and what I am ready to do."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 25, 2007",Clinton Statement On Election of Darren Soto to Florida House of Representatives,"The following is a statement from Senator Hillary Clinton on the election of Darren Soto to the Florida House of Representatives. ""Darren Soto's victory is the latest example that Americans are ready for change. I look forward to working with Darren and other Florida Democrats as we offer Americans real change from the State House to the White House. I want to congratulate Darren for running a great race in Florida's 49th District. After spending time with him earlier this year in Orlando, it's clear that Darren is an exciting young leader who can get results in Tallahassee."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 26, 2007",Statement from Senator Clinton on Iowa Discrimination Bill,"I applaud the Iowa State Legislature for their efforts to end discrimination and make the state more welcoming. I've supported similar legislation in the US Senate because too many Americans suffer as a result of bigotry, and I believe this legislation will help reinforce our fundamental belief in equality and justice for all. As President, I will work with Congress to echo the clear message of fairness Iowa's leaders sent today."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 1, 2007",Statement of Hillary Clinton on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month,"It is my immense pleasure to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to recognize, honor and express gratitude to Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), who have been an integral part of our American story, helping build and strengthen America. ""For centuries, America has been enriched by our diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities and by the contributions that Chamorros, Native Hawaiians, and Samoans have made in their ancestral homelands. We can see those contributions today in the national railroad system that many AAPIs helped to build as well as the many AAPI men and women who serve with honor in our United States Armed Forces today. The tradition of public service runs deep in the history of AAPIs in America. From Dalip Singh Saud, who was the first Asian American to serve in Congress, to the great Patsy Mink, the very first woman of color to ever serve in Congress, to Norman Mineta who was the first Asian American appointed by a President to serve as a Cabinet Secretary, AAPIs have served this country with honor and distinction. And it is not just the famous names and faces that have left a bold imprint on the fabric of our nation. Leaders of community based organizations, small business owners, and the growing number of AAPIs in public service demonstrate what is best and what is possible in America. I salute the contributions and sacrifices that AAPIs have made to ensure a better life for their families and for American society. ""The numerous accomplishments of the AAPI community, however, can mask the challenges that still exist for many - discrimination, language barriers, and poor access to quality, affordable health care. As Senator, I have worked with the AAPI community to promote policies that help meet the community's underserved needs. For example, I sponsored the Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act to restore access to health care for low-income legal immigrant women and children as well as the Access to Employment and English Acquisition Act to provide more job training funds for people with limited English skills. ""Although some AAPIs have reached the pinnacle of higher education, I am fully aware that others in the AAPI community continue to remain behind. For this reason, I have been a strong advocate for making college affordable and accessible. As Senator, I fought to increase the federal Pell Grant, which today covers only a third of tuition at an average public college and co-sponsored the DREAM Act, which makes it possible for hardworking young people to receive in-state tuition at state colleges. I also led the passage of legislation that will bring more qualified teachers into the classrooms and more outstanding principals to lead our schools. ""As we consider reform to our current broken immigration system, we must address issues like family reunification. Under our current system, families are separated for long periods of time, sometimes decades. Last year, during the debate on the comprehensive immigration reform, I offered an amendment to address the backlog of family visas. I will continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that brings families together. ""Let's be clear, while we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month this May, I will continue working to ensure that AAPIs are included at the table everyday and that the needs of the community are prioritized year-round. As we celebrate the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, let us all rededicate our efforts to creating better opportunities and brighter futures for all Americans."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 1, 2007",Statement of Hillary Clinton on the Fourth Anniversary of President Bush Declaring 'Mission Accomplished',"Today is the fourth anniversary of what I consider to be one of the most shameful episodes in American history. Never before in our history has a President said 'mission accomplished' when the mission had barely begun. Never before has a President landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier to proclaim the end of major combat operations to a war that rages on four years later. Never before has a President pulled a political stunt when so many American lives were and remain in harm's way. The President took us to a preemptive war of his choosing based on his assessment of faulty evidence and trumped up facts. He ignored the warnings of senior military advisors and he retaliated against those who tried to stop him. And once he got the authority to put inspectors back into Iraq, he ignored their findings. It is something that will stand as one of the darkest blots on leadership we've ever had in our nation's history. America is ready for a President who will respect our Armed Forces by properly planning for the missions we ask our troops to undertake. America is ready to end this war and when I am President, that's exactly what I'll do."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 1, 2007",Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President's Veto of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill,"Washington, DC -- ""With his veto today, President Bush has made it clear that he is standing in the way of ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home. The nation is ready for the President to stop disregarding the will of the American people and to work with Democrats on a funding bill that will enable us to begin redeploying our troops. He has a chance to do just that when he meets with the Democratic leadership tomorrow. ""It has been four years since the President declared an end to major combat operations. It is my hope that the President will approach this next round of talks in good faith. ""I am also disappointed that with his veto, the President has taken us back a step in meeting the homeland security needs of our high-threat cities like New York City and vetoed $35 million in additional funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative. ""In addition, with his veto, the President has shirked his responsibility to address the growing health needs affecting those exposed to the toxic air around Ground Zero in the wake of 9/11 and vetoed $50 million in funding for 9/11 health, which would not only have helped provide treatment to those affected in the New York metro area, but also to responders from all over the country who are suffering from 9/11 health effects. This funding would have helped meet immediate health needs and allow 9/11 health programs to continue operating. Despite the President's actions today, I will continue to fight, along with my colleagues in the New York delegation, to secure the federal commitment and funding required to meet 9/11 health needs in the long-term. ""The President has also chosen to veto critical legislation that would have ended the practice of giving Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractors bonuses for incomplete or sub-par work, thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 1, 2007",From the Senate: Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Need for Comprehensive Immigration Reform,"Washington, DC - Today's marches underscore the importance of comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration system is broken, and it is past time that we came together and implemented an effective policy which respects our immigrant heritage, the rule of law, and human dignity. That is what I am committed to achieving. A comprehensive solution to our immigration crisis must include strengthening our borders, greater cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar, including learning English. The solution must also protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken, unfair bureaucratic system that forces citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children. Although many Republicans have tried to derail attempts at comprehensive immigration reform, I am committed to working with my colleagues to create an immigration system that respects our values. We must insist on comprehensive immigration reform that protects our homeland security and protects the dignity of millions of families who live here. There is a smart and effective, comprehensive solution to the impasse we face, and I will continue to pursue it."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 4, 2007",Statement of Hillary Clinton on Cinco de Mayo,"Washington, DC -- Hillary Clinton joins millions of Americans in commemorating Cinco de Mayo and the contributions that Mexican Americans have made to our country. This day marks the anniversary of the historic victory of the Mexican people over the French army during the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. ""This weekend, millions of Americans will celebrate Cinco de Mayo and pay tribute to the rich history and courage of the Mexican people. The story of General Ignacio Zaragoza's triumph in the face of tremendous adversity reminds us of the bravery and sacrifice that continues to inspire millions of people today. I am particularly proud that New York is home to a significant community of hard working families that trace their roots back to the heroic state of Puebla. ""This day of pride and celebration for Mexican Americans has been embraced by Americans of all backgrounds as a tribute to our deep historical, cultural and economic ties to Mexico. It is an opportunity to recognize the many ways in which Mexican Americans enrich the country with their culture.

""When the Senate votes on motions to allow debate on both the Feingold-Reid and Levin-Reid Amendments, I will vote for cloture on both. I do so because we, as a united party, must work together with clarity of purpose and mission to begin bringing our troops home and end this war. ""The bipartisan Iraq Study Group offered a way forward for beginning the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. But President Bush rejected those recommendations and refuses to work with Congress to develop a strategy that will enable our troops to start coming home. ""President Bush vetoed the bipartisan bill to fund the troops, refuses to change course, and stubbornly denies the reality on the ground and the will of the American people. ""We will continue to press him to follow the will of the people. I will continue to pursue with Senator Byrd our legislation to deauthorize the war by October 11, 2007. I will continue to do everything in my power to convince the president to change course and to work with my colleagues in the Senate to bring an end to this war as soon as possible."""

Four soldiers were killed and three soldiers captured. I was assured that every effort is being made to locate and safeguard the missing soldiers. My prayers are with the families that have suffered the death of a loved one, and with the families who await confirmation on the status and safe return of those still unaccounted for. I asked to be kept apprised of the situation and offered my full support for the men and women of the 10th Mountain Division. ""I have visited 10th Mountain Division soldiers here at home and abroad. These service members have always demonstrated resolve, courage under fire, and the conviction to succeed in every mission and every assignment.

""I have long opposed storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. This latest attempt to push forward development of the project is particularly reckless, as it aims to increase spending and begin construction on the site prior to license approval. There are far too many unanswered questions about both the geology of the site and integrity of the science to support the decision to store waste at Yucca at all -- let alone to justify accelerating the site's development.

I believe that the President should begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq and abandon this escalation. I fully support our troops, and wish the President had followed the will of the people and signed the original bill we sent which both funded the troops and set a new course of phased redeployment.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"June 1, 2007",Statement from Hillary Clinton On Gay & Lesbian Pride Month,"As we celebrate Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, I want to commend the LGBT community on a historic year that brought our country closer to equality and closer to ending discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Just a year ago, I worked with my Democratic colleagues in the Senate as well as with LGBT leaders to defeat the divisive and discriminatory Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA). Since then, we not only defeated FMA, but we have been able to make real progress in achieving fairness for all Americans. In fact, since June 2006, New Jersey and New Hampshire became the third and fourth states to adopt civil unions and Washington and Iowa were added to the list of states that outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. A similar bill in Colorado is expected to be signed into law soon. And in Congress, we are finally on the verge of passing the Matthew Shepherd Act, which would expand hate crimes laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. What a difference a year makes. ""The start of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month is a great time to celebrate these recent victories but also to reflect on all the work that still needs to be done. Unfortunately, while this is the first time in years that hate crimes legislation has a strong chance of passing both houses of Congress, President Bush has already signaled that he would veto this landmark bill. The truth is we will see little progress for the LGBT community at the national level until we have a new Democratic president. For six long years, the Bush Administration has only seen the families that matter to them. It's been a government of the few, by the few, and for the few. And no community has been more invisible to this administration than the LGBT community. ""I'm running for president to replace the divisive leadership of the past six years -- leadership that views no issue and no family above the reach of politics. America deserves a president who appeals to the best in each of us, not the worst; a president who values and respects all Americans, gay and straight; a president who treats all Americans equally no matter who they are or who they love. ""I'm proud of my record standing up for the LGBT community during my years as First Lady and as a U.S. Senator. But when I take office in January 2009, we'll finally be able to define success by more than the bigotry we stopped and the bad decisions we prevented. America will finally have a president who moves this country forward. When I am president, we will work together to make sure that all Americans in committed relationships have equal benefits and that nothing stands in the way of loving couples who want to adopt children in need. We're going to finally expand our federal hate crimes legislation and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is just plain wrong that in the year 2007, people who work hard and do a good job every day can still be fired because of who they love. And finally, we will put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Courage, honor, patriotism and sacrifice -- the traits that define our men and women in uniform -- have nothing to do with sexual orientation. ""I am honored to have the support of so many people in the LGBT community and look forward to working with the community closely throughout the campaign.

""This is just one example of how the President puts ideology before science, politics before the needs of our families, just one more example of how out of touch with reality he and his party have become.

On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the valiant struggle to integrate Little Rock Central High School, let us remember the millions who marched, fought and even paid the ultimate price to help ensure every child in America has an opportunity to attend diverse, high-quality schools.""

Recent evidence shows that integrated schools promote minority academic achievement, and can help close the achievement gap."" ""Once again, the Roberts Court has shown its willingness to erode core constitutional guarantees.

""Rebuilding New Orleans is not a local obligation, it is an American obligation. And we must finally begin to fulfill it. As President, that will not just be my goal  but my mission.

""When the history of Hurricane Katrina is written, it will say that the people of this country rallied around New Orleans. While our government stumbled at first, we ultimately found our way. That out of the sludge and ashes and destruction, we rebuilt the Gulf Coast -- stronger, prouder, and more lasting than ever before."" In May, Clinton outlined a 10-point Gulf Coast Recovery Plan, that would:   Elevate the Gulf Coast Rebuilding Director  Cut Red Tape  Attract workers to rebuild New Orleans and the region  Build a reliable hurricane protection system to stop another Katrina  Expand affordable housing  Combat rising crime and give first responders needed tools  Build 21st Century schools in New Orleans  Revitalize a lagging healthcare system  Promote smart development  Revamp federal disaster response so we are ready next time.

For more than a century, we have set this day aside to spend time with friends and family and to pay tribute to hardworking Americans and the labor movement which has stood up for them -- for fair wages, fair treatment, and fair benefits. ""I believe that the foundation of a strong economy isn't the wealth at the very top -- but the investments we make in each other. I believe that economic growth comes from policies that promote prosperity -- and ensure we all share in it. ""That starts with standing up for our unions because unions have helped build America's strong middle class. I'll end this Administration's practice of harassing and bureaucratizing our labor organizations. When I'm President, we're going to appoint people to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board who are actually pro-labor. ""And we're going to stand up for the right to organize again, because it's no coincidence that as union membership has declined to just 8% of private sector workers, wages have been stagnant -- and income inequality has increased. ""I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act -- and I was proud to speak out for it on the floor of the United States Senate. And I don't care how long it takes, or how hard I have to fight, I won't back down until that bill finally passes -- because the right to organize is a fundamental human right, nothing less. ""And once you've joined a union, you should have a seat at the table and a chance to have your voice heard. That's why we need to stand up for the right to bargain collectively everywhere. ""I believe that every day ought to be a day to value hard work and value our workers. Long after the parades and picnics, our nation should pay tribute to our workers with smart policies that lift up the middle class, strengthen the right to organize and bargain collectively, improve access to affordable health care, fix the broken pension system, make college more affordable, and so much else.

And it is equally unacceptable that our government hasn't seriously addressed the growing -- and now well-known -- risk of lead-laced Chinese toys. The steps we need to take are simple, and they are long overdue. I have proposed immediately and comprehensively banning all lead in our children's toys. I have called for an immediate halt to the sale of any paint-coated toy from China that has not gone through independent third-party testing.

I am deeply concerned about reports of potentially disparate treatment of white youths and African-American youths in the criminal justice system. I am troubled by reports that African-American students were initially charged and may be sentenced in a manner out of proportion to their wrongs. And I have long been troubled by a history of disparate treatment of African Americans in our criminal justice system.

And we are all so grateful for their courage and their sacrifice. ""Today, fifty years later, America is still struggling to finish their work. We have seen schools re-segregating and a Supreme Court chipping away at Brown v. Board of Education.

""The Little Rock Nine did - and continue to do - their part, and now it is our turn. We must ensure that one day, the nine students we honor tonight can tell their children and grandchildren about how we finally overcame. How we finally came together and did what was right for America. How, while it took far too long - and cost so many people so much - we finally finished what the Little Rock Nine started all those years ago."""

The president now has the choice: will he help nearly four million uninsured children gain access to the health care they desperately need or will he turn his back on them? I hope the president makes the right choice. ""I was proud to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) during the Clinton Administration, which today provides health insurance for six million children. In New York alone, almost 400,000 children benefit from CHIP every month. By enacting this bill into law, 3.8 million uninsured children will gain coverage, including an additional 72,000 children in New York who will have access to health care. The legislation will also help reach many of the almost 300,000 children in New York who live in families that are already eligible but not yet enrolled. ""I am also proud that this bill includes the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007, legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduced to provide up to six months of job-protected leave for spouses, children, parents or next of kin of service members who suffer from a combat-related injury or illness. Currently, these spouses, parents and children can receive only twelve weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All too often, this is just not enough time, as injured service members struggle to grapple with traumatic brain injuries, severe physical wounds, and other problems upon returning home from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Expanding leave to six months is a step we can take immediately that will make a real difference in the lives of these wounded warriors and their families and I hope the President will stand with them by signing this bill into law. ""I am disappointed, however, that the bill approved fails to include the Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, which I introduced with Senator Snowe and have been working on for a number of years. This bipartisan bill would give states the flexibility to provide the same Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low-income legal immigrant children and pregnant women as they do to U.S. citizens. The current restrictions prevent thousands of immigrant children and pregnant women who are here legally and are following the rules from receiving preventive health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious. This hurts children and families and we should put a stop to it."""

His swearing-in capped more than a quarter century of legal achievement in which he fundamentally transformed our nation's civil rights landscape, and it launched nearly a quarter century of faithful and wise service to the Court and to the Constitution. As we contend with right-wing efforts to undermine the promise of Brown v. Board of Education - Thurgood Marshall's greatest legacy - and as we witness all-too-frequent reminders that the scales of justice are still out of balance for African-Americans, we would do well to remember what Justice Marshall meant to this country, what he stood for, and what he achieved. And we must commit ourselves not only to defending his achievements, but to continuing the march along the path he laid. That is why I have set forth a specific agenda to promote civil rights and fight discrimination in the 21st century.

With every child they teach, teachers help to ensure a brighter future for our country. In welcoming every child through your doors, in giving every child a chance to succeed, it's our public schools and teachers that transform that rhetoric into reality every single day. Throughout my 35 years of working on education, I've seen the dedication that American teachers demonstrate day in and day out. That is why as President, I want to be partners with teachers, parents, and administrators to improve our education system.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"October 23, 2007",From the Senate: Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Bush Administration's Request for Additional Iraq War Funding,"With his announcement that his Administration will now seek nearly $200 billion in supplemental funding for overseas military operations, President Bush is once again asking Congress and the American people to foot the bill for his failed leadership. The Bush Administration's escalation in Iraq has not led to political reconciliation and our troops still remain in the middle of a civil war. As I have said before, I cannot and will not support funding legislation that does not begin to bring our troops home. Our men and women in uniform are serving bravely and honorably  funding a failing strategy does not serve our troops or our nation. We should begin the withdrawal of U.S. troops safely and responsibly. Unless the Administration changes course in Iraq, I will vote against this supplemental request."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"October 24, 2007","Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act","Washington, DC  ""More than 65,000 immigrant students will graduate from U.S. high schools this year only to see the doors of opportunity closed to them. These are gifted and highly motivated children who grew up in the United States. For these children, many of whom arrived to this country as babies, America is the only home they know. They speak English fluently, and for many it is their first and only language. Many have never even visited the country of their birth. They have been educated in our public school system. They have stayed in school and stayed out of trouble. These kids are honor students, team captains, student body presidents and valedictorians. ""Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country they've ever known as home. But for these children, because of their immigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and reaching their full potential. Through no fault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their God given potential. ""What are we saying to these hard working students? Well I will tell you. We are saying they are not welcome in the only country they have ever known. We are telling them to go back to another country they often know little about, where they may not speak the language, or understand the culture. These are children caught at a crossroads, and rather than providing them with an opportunity, we are holding them accountable for the actions of their parents. ""This is not the America I know. ""There is a solution to this crisis, but sadly, the Senate today failed to act. The DREAM Act  which I have proudly cosponsored for several years  would help expand opportunities for our nation's immigrant children. For those students who have grown up in the United States, have demonstrated good moral character, and are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military, the DREAM Act will provide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country. ""There are many good reasons to enact the DREAM Act. In today's twenty-first century economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly becoming the minimum requirement for higher-earning jobs, we need to provide the children in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically, both for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society. The DREAM Act would also strengthen our nation's military readiness, allowing these well-qualified young men and women to serve their country with honor. But most importantly, the DREAM Act ensures that the promise of the American Dream becomes a reality for all our children. ""I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act. The enactment of this legislation is long overdue, and I will continue to fight for its passage, for all of our children and our nation."""

""I believe that a policy of diplomacy backed by economic pressure is the best way to check Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons program and stop its support of terrorism, and the best way to avert a war. That's why I took to the Senate floor last February and warned the President not to take military action against Iran without going to Congress first and why I've co-sponsored Senator Webb's legislation to make that the law of the land. I've been concerned for a long time over George Bush's saber rattling and belligerence toward Iran. ""We must work to check Iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, and the sanctions announced today strengthen America's diplomatic hand in that regard. The Bush Administration should use this opportunity to finally engage in robust diplomacy to achieve our objective of ending Iran's nuclear weapons program, while also averting military action.

Part of my plan is to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies to create a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund that would speed the development of clean, domestic energy sources, making Americans less vulnerable to the whims of the world's oil suppliers. But we also need to take immediate steps to address this problem. I urge the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve to send a signal to the market and ease concerns about low crude oil stocks that are driving prices higher. I also urge the President to support legislation passed by the Senate this year that would protect consumers by making gasoline markets more transparent and making gas price gouging a federal crime."" ---   Hillary Clinton's plan to promote energy independence, address global warming, and transform our economy includes:    A new cap-and-trade program that auctions 100% of permits alongside investments to move us on the path towards energy independence;  An aggressive comprehensive energy efficiency agenda to reduce electricity consumption 20% from projected levels by 2020 by changing the way utilities do business, catalyzing a green building industry, enacting strict appliance efficiency standards, and phasing out incandescent light bulbs;  A $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund, paid for in part by oil companies, to fund investments in alternative energy.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"November 23, 2007",Statement by Hillary Clinton Calling for Ensuring the Safety of Toys Imported from China as the Holiday Season Begins,"Earlier this week in Iowa, I discussed the continuing threat of unsafe imported toys and laid out a strategy to confront it. In response, the Chinese government called my criticisms 'slander.' ""This is the same government that just this month revoked the licenses of more than 750 of its toy companies because of quality control problems and ordered another 690 to renovate or improve their facilities, even as it asserted that 99 percent of toy exports met quality standards. And the Chinese government's watchdog agency reported earlier this year that 20 percent of the toys made and sold in China pose safety risks. That is unacceptable. ""As the holiday shopping season begins, our government should be taking immediate, decisive steps to ensure that the toys we are importing from China and other countries are safe. After months of high-profile recalls of some of the most popular toys on the shelves, we have real cause for concern. Parents should not have to worry whether the toys they buy this holiday season are safe for their children. ""The facts speak for themselves. This year alone, we have seen 36 recalls of lead-coated Chinese-made toys - 5.5 million total toys, including Curious George dolls, Thomas and Friends toy trains, Winnie the Pooh playsets, and even Elmo and Big Bird. We have seen the recall of Chinese-made toy eyeballs containing kerosene. And the United States is not the only country dealing with this challenge. The European Union reports that toys topped the list of Chinese products most likely to trigger product-safety alerts last year, and the EU has warned China that it will take strong action if China does not improve the quality and safety of its toys and other products. ""American companies have their own important role to play in keeping our children safe. They have to do a better job at every stage of the process, from design through production and shipping, to make sure that the toys they are bringing into this country -- and profiting from -- do not pose risks to children. My toy safety agenda also imposes new obligations on these companies. ""In America in 2007, the products Americans buy should be safe and secure. As President, I would:  Immediately require independent third-party testing for at-risk imported toys to ensure they are safe before they can be put on our shelves and sold. Dramatically increase the number of product inspectors and deploy them as part of a strategy to meet the threat posed by imported toys.  Establish a complete ban on lead in children's products. Increase and enforce both civil and criminal penalties for violators. Require selected companies to pay a bond pending completion of third party testing to protect consumers and taxpayers from fly-by-night foreign importers. Improve our system of toy recalls so that parents get swift notification and companies face swift sanctions if they don't remove recalled products from their shelves."" "

""The cover story in today's Des Moines Register is another stark reminder that the economy is not working for middle class Americans. President Bush has created a trapdoor economy and too many Iowans are falling through it and landing in debt. The typical family's income has fallen since President Bush has been in office, while the cost of things like gas, college tuition, and health care have skyrocketed. Americans are working harder than ever (labor productivity rose 18% in 6 years), but the average family has gotten nothing for its efforts. The housing boom masked the pain families were feeling because they could draw on their home equity to pay bills. But with house prices now falling, that cash source is rapidly disappearing. ""As President, I will act quickly to ensure that families saddled with high debt do not lose their most important asset to foreclosure. In the last 3 months, there have been 1,500 foreclosure filings in Iowa. I have proposed to dramatically expand federal support for state and community groups that help families manage their day-to-day expenses and avoid foreclosure. I have also called on the President to immediately convene a 'crisis conference' that brings together housing stakeholdersmortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, representatives of homeowners, regulators, and othersto end the foreclosure crisis. ""I have announced the American Retirement Accounts Plan that will help middle class Americans save and build wealth for their future. ""I will put an end to abusive practices by credit card companies that impose enormous fees and astronomical interest rates on unsuspecting borrowers. I will improve oversight of credit card lending policies, and vigorously enforce our laws against unfair and deceptive practices. I will change the bankruptcy rules that unfairly squeeze middle-class homeowners who have seen the value of their homes fall as their mortgage payments skyrocket. ""I will ensure that never again will a family go bankrupt because of medical costs. Today, 270,000 people in Iowa do not have health insurance. My health care plan will cover every single American. I do not believe that a plan that leaves 15 million Americans uncovered is right for our country.

And though we have made progress on many fronts, there are still 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS around the world, and here in America, HIV infection rates are rising among gay men and African Americans.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 3, 2007",Hillary Clinton Statement On Treasury Secretary Paulson's Comments at Housing Conference,"According to news accounts, Treasury Secretary Paulson said that the Administration is putting forward a proposal, as part of its response to the foreclosure crisis, to allow state and local governments to temporarily broaden their tax-exempt bond programs to include mortgage refinancing. ""I think this is an excellent idea that the administration should have been adopted two months ago when I proposed it. ""The Mortgage Revenue Bond program (MRB) needs to be modified to help families replace unworkable adjustable rate mortgages with stable, fixed-rate loans. Under the MRB, state housing finance agencies use the proceeds of tax-exempt bond issuances to provide low-cost mortgages to low- and moderate-income families. I proposed to modify the program in two ways to address the foreclosure crisis: First, state agencies would be permitted to use MRBs to refinance mortgages (under current law, MRB funds can only be used for original mortgages). And second, I would increase the federal cap on the MRB program by roughly 25% to provide an additional $2.5 billion in refinancing capacity. ""Policies like my MRB proposal are desperately needed right now. The foreclosure crisis is harming families, communities, and the economy. ""This morning I wrote to Secretary Paulson to insist that the Administration and the mortgage industry quickly fashion an agreement to end this crisis. I informed the Secretary that a satisfactory agreement must do at least three things:   Impose a foreclosure moratorium of at least 90 days on subprime, owner-occupied homes.   Freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, with the freeze lasting at least 5 years or until the mortgages have been converted into affordable, fixed-rate loans.  Require the mortgage industry to provide status reports on the number of mortgages it has modified.   ""If the Administration fails to produce an agreement adequate to the scale of the problem, I will consider legislation that enables lenders and servicers to convert unworkable mortgages into stable, affordable loans without the permission of investors."""

According to CMS, the 54 publicly released facilities are only a sub-set of the 128 nursing homes that have been designated as ""special focus facilities"" for concerns about poor performance. Three of the yet-to-be disclosed facilities are in Iowa. CMS should immediately release information on all of these facilities, so seniors can know which underperforming nursing homes are taking steps to improve their performance and which are not. In making such crucial life decisions, seniors and their families should have access to all the designations that CMS makes, and all of the information that it compiles.

In October, I called for the GAO to investigate whether we have the right regulatory tools to ensure that nursing homes with these new hybrid ownership structures are being held accountable for quality violations. While I look forward to the GAO's recommendations, we should immediately provide consumers and state-level regulators with as much information as possible on nursing home ownership, so they can make effective decisions. ""I know that the vast majority of nursing homes are providing quality care to their residents. But I also believe in the power of transparency to make our long term care infrastructure healthier, more competitive and more accountable. I urge CMS to publish its full special focus facilities list and to take the additional steps I have outlined so that seniors and their families can make informed choices about their long-term care needs."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 4, 2007",Hillary Clinton Statement on the International Day of Disabled Persons,"For 15 years, the International Day of Disabled Persons has provided a great occasion for citizens of all nations to unite behind our shared vision of a kind and just world that treats all people as equals. It is an occasion to celebrate the progress we have made toward securing equal rights for six hundred million people around the world, including fifty-four million Americans, who live and work with some form of disability. It is also a time to remember how far we still must go to create jobs and schools and homes and communities where all kinds of obstacles and discrimination, concrete and less tangible, are a tragedy of our past. ""Today, in the United States, people with disabilities have half the employment rate and double the poverty rate of Americans without disabilities. I began my work to expand opportunities for people with disabilities 35 years ago. I had taken a job with the Children's Defense Fund, and I walked door-to-door trying to understand why many young children did not attend local public schools. It was heartbreaking to meet children with disabilities who desperately wanted to learn and succeed, but were blocked from schools that refused to accommodate them. The Children's Defense Fund submitted our findings to the United States Congress, and it was not long before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act became law in America. ""As President, I will continue to work to build an America that leads the world in tearing down the barriers that face people with disabilities and in providing opportunities for all Americans to learn and work and thrive. I helped write the IDEA Reauthorization Act in 2004. I worked to pass the Community Choice Act of 2007, and I strongly supported the Americans with Disabilities Restoration Act, which I look forward to signing into law as President. I am also proud to have set forth a bold agenda for helping all individuals with disabilities fulfill their potential by increasing access to employment opportunities. My agenda recommits the federal government to hiring 100,000 people with disabilities, doubles our investment in work-enabling technologies, eliminates disincentives for work that are present in many federal programs, and more. I have also proposed a plan to provide guaranteed, quality, affordable health care coverage to all Americans. Under my plan, no one will ever be denied health care because of preexisting conditions or risk factors. ""All my policy proposals rest upon a single, unifying belief that reflects what, above all, we celebrate on the International Day of Disabled Persons: that we are all in this together - one people, one world - and that kindness and justice for all is the common seed of the American dream and the dreams of us all."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 5, 2007",Clinton Statement on New Details About President Bush's Plan to Address the Foreclosure Crisis,"Although the administration is finally giving the foreclosure crisis the attention it deserves, it seems that President Bush is going to give struggling homeowners far less than they need. With news accounts using terms like 'whittled down' and 'limited' to describe the scope of the Bush plan, it appears that the president is pushing a freeze for a very narrow group of borrowers. That is unfortunate because this crisis demands a more comprehensive approach that is adequate for the scale of the problem. ""I hope the administration adopts my entire plan and fashions an agreement with the mortgage industry that does three things:   Observe a foreclosure moratorium of at least 90 days on subprime, owner-occupied homes;  Freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, with the freeze lasting at least 5 years or until the mortgages have been converted into affordable, fixed-rate loans; and  Provide status reports on the number of mortgages being modified from destined-to-fail to able-to-work.    ""I look forward to the formal announcement of the Bush plan, but I fear that once again the Administration has let down the American middle class."""

It was as clear then as it is today that this legislation is bad law and bad policy. It does little to advance our security interests abroad, and it undermines our values at home. The specific question before the Court is whether detainees being held in Guantanamo Bay can be denied the right of habeas corpus - the right to challenge the legality of their detention, to ask why they are being held. The Court should restore this basic right. Our Nation must not indefinitely detain anyone without safeguards to ensure we are holding the right person. This is one of the bedrock principles enshrined in our Constitution; it is the way our Founders believed we could be secure against those who would abuse government power. I believe we do not have to abandon our constitutional principles or our values as Americans in the name of fighting terrorism. We can defeat terrorists around the world and preserve who we are as Americans. When we sacrifice one for the sake of the other, we hand our enemies a victory. Unfortunately, under President Bush, Guantanamo Bay has come to represent a flagging commitment to justice and contempt for the rule of law. This is not only a threat to our values - it also harms our national security interests and our moral authority in the eyes of the world."

The sons of teen mothers are more likely to end up in prison; the daughters are more likely to themselves end up as teen parents. According to a report by Dr. Saul D. Hoffman and the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, teen childbearing in the United States cost taxpayers at least $9.1 billion in 2004. ""To address this important issue, my husband issued a call to action in 1995 to America's parents and leaders to join together to cut America's teen pregnancy rate by one-third over a decade. In order to help achieve this ambitious goal, I helped launch the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, and we successfully achieved a one-third reduction by 2005. But the report released today indicates that under President Bush's leadership, we may be falling off track. As President, I will bring a concerted focus to breaking the cycle of teen pregnancy, and in doing so tackle the root cause of many social problems and help to give thousands of young people the opportunity to fulfill their hopes and dreams."""

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 6, 2007",Hillary Clinton's Response to Bush Foreclosure Plan,"Throughout the foreclosure crisis President Bush has ignored the cries for help. Today he responded, but once again it's too little, too late. President Bush's plan takes the heat off the mortgage industry but leaves homeowners to sink. ""The Bush plan is designed to help as few homeowners as possible. Lenders will decide on a case-by-case basis whether a homeowner gets the rate freeze or whether she should pay the 30 to 40 percent monthly increase. These are the same lenders who made the case-by-case decisions that sum to the prospect of 2 million foreclosures. The President knows that a case-by-case approach cannot work. The case-by-case approach has resulted in only 1% of subprime loans being modified this year, and 1.8 million foreclosure notices being sent out. As recently as a few weeks ago the Treasury Secretary himself said that the case-by-case approach was inadequate. There are other crippling shortcomings. The Bush plan excludes homeowners whose mortgages reset prior to January 2008. This may sound reasonable, but it is intentionally designed to leave out the roughly 400,000 families whose mortgages are resetting this quarter. Under the Bush plan, these families will continue to experience rate resets every six months. ""America needs a plan that matches the scale of the crisis, and President Bush has failed to deliver it. But that is what happens when you are more interested in protecting corporate interests than struggling families. ""I have announced a comprehensive plan that will actually end the foreclosure crisis. My plan imposes an immediate moratorium on foreclosures; an automatic, across-the-board rate freeze; and the requirement that servicers and lenders provide status reports on how many mortgages they are converting from designed-to-fail to designed-to-work. The foreclosure moratorium ensures that families will not lose their homes while servicers put the systems in place to implement the rate freeze as well as the large-scale modification of loans. And the automatic, across-the-board rate freeze will ensure that hundreds of thousands of families, rather than just a few, will be spared the foreclosure process. ""I call on the mortgage industry and Wall Street to go back to the drawing board, and to do so with a commitment to helping families and not just themselves. A voluntary agreement that fixes this problem is possible. But if the mortgage industry and Wall Street will not shoulder their responsibility, then I will consider legislation to protect servicers and others who do the right thing by modifying loans to help families save their homes, help investors avoid losses, and help the economy.""

I have for several years been calling on this Administration to adequately fund the Social Security Administration to ensure that people with disabilities and retirees can access the benefits they deserve. But the President has been more interested in spending $10 billion a month on a misguided war in Iraq and tens of billions each year in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans than in funding key services for our most vulnerable citizens. As a result, the average delay for individuals seeking an appeal from a disability determination has doubled since 2000 to more than 500 days. ""The President's recent veto of additional funding for the Social Security Administration signals an unacceptable willingness to let this problem continue to grow. His veto will leave hundreds of thousands of Americans with disabilities to suffer and even die without our support. That's why today I wrote the President urging him to reconsider his veto threat. I asked the President to make immediately clear that he will support the needed funding increase for SSA, and will sign it into law. I hope the President heeds this advice. But if he fails to act, then as President I will act immediately to address these growing backlogs, and ensure that the SSA has adequate support to serve Americans in need. People with disabilities and retirees deserve a President willing to stand up for their interests and ensure that government is delivering ""not denying"" them the support they need.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 14, 2007",Hillary Clinton Statement on Legislation Requiring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to Make Public All Nursing Homes Designated as 'Special Focus Facilities',"Today, I introduced legislation with my colleague Senator Tom Harkin to require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to immediately release the names of all 128 nursing homes on its Special Focus Facility list. It is absolutely inexcusable that CMS has withheld this information from seniors and their families who are making critical life decisions about long term care. Even more disturbing are press reports that CMS has shared this information with nursing home industry lobbyists, but not with the public. Over a week ago, I called on CMS to fully disclose the names of these 128 nursing homes, as well as all information on the nursing home designations that CMS has made. But CMS has failed to act. Therefore, I believe Congress must take action. This legislation would ensure that the American public has access to the names of all nursing homes that the taxpayer-funded CMS designates as poor-performing. This legislation takes an important first step toward greater transparency in our long term care system. But unfortunately the problem of poor nursing home quality extends far beyond the 128 homes on CMS's special focus facility list. That's why I have laid out a comprehensive agenda to improve nursing home quality and to protect consumers against fraud and abuse in long-term care market. The key components of my agenda are:   Requiring CMS to provide clear, comprehensive data on the Nursing Home Compare website on 1) up-to-date and accurate nursing home staffing levels; 2) the full - not just abridged - reports from inspections and complaint investigations; 3) any and all information about repeat offenses that CMS compiles; and 4) clear information about the ownership structures of long-term care facilitiesso seniors can know who is in charge of the facilities they live in.  Tripling federal support for nursing home ombudsmen programs to $50 million, to directly improve the accountability and oversight over long-term care facilities. The increased resources will help the ombudsmen in Iowa and across the country to vigorously investigate complaints and tackle new, complex issues in the long term care industry. Directing the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to assist state consumer advocates and prosecutors to tackle persistent abuses and new challenges in the long term care industry. Strengthening our nursing and direct care workforce with a national system of background checks for long-term care workers and $125 million investment in Workforce Improvement Programs. Requiring tough new consumer protections for long-term care insurance, including ending discrimination against veterans and helping states create consumer advocates for long-term care insurance.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"December 21, 2007",Hillary Clinton Statement on Legislation to Raise the Minimum Wage to $9.50 Per Hour,"With stagnant wages and skyrocketing costs for healthcare, energy and college, working families in America need a break. That is why yesterday I introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011, and link the minimum wage to Congressional pay raises after that. The Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act of 2007 is the first bill ever to call for a $9.50 minimum wage. I was proud to work earlier this year with Senator Kennedy and other Democratic leaders to enact the first minimum wage increase in ten years. By lifting the minimum wage to $7.25, that effort will give 257,000 Iowans - 18% of all workers - a raise, and help another 94,000 children who live with these workers who will benefit from increased household income. But these and other workers in Iowa and across the country should not have to wait another ten years to see another pay increase. My new legislation to lift the minimum wage to $9.50 will provide a direct raise to about 20 million working Americans. It would put extra money in the pockets of hundreds of thousands of Iowa families. Going forward, this legislation would say to Congress: if you want to give yourself a raise, then working families get a raise as well. From 1997 to the beginning of 2007, Members of Congress raised their own salaries by $31,600, while refusing to raise the minimum wage even once. That is simply unacceptable. Linking the minimum wage to Congressional salaries is a great way to ensure that working families continue to get ahead in our economy. The idea was inspired by a suggestion submitted to SinceSlicedBread.com, the Service Employees International Union's contest that asked Americans for bold ideas to improve life for working families. As President, raising the minimum wage will be part of my comprehensive agenda to fight poverty and increase opportunity for working families, which will also include expanding the EITC, increasing childcare assistance, dramatically expanding job training programs, investing in education from birth through college, and lowering taxes for hard-working families."

Last week, I laid out my blueprint for stimulus of up to $110 billion, including $70 billion in immediate measures and $40 billion in contingent tax rebates. After seeing additional signs of economic weakness and hearing the stories of countless voters in Nevada, California and across the country, I am convinced that we need my full $110 billion package immediately to effectively stimulate the economy. In just the past week we have learned that retails sales declined in December; consumer expectations have fallen to a 16-year low; major Wall Street banks have taken multi-billion dollar write downs in mortgage related investments with more write downs expected; and housing starts have fallen to their lowest level since 1991. We need aggressive action, and we need it now. I am calling on the President to consider my full $110 billion stimulus package, and will work with the Congressional leadership to help bring together a bipartisan agreement on stimulus. My $110 billion package includes $40 billion in tax rebates for working and middle-class families. These rebates should meet the principles that I have outlined: they should be temporary and fiscally responsible; they should be fast-acting; and they should be targeted to working and middle-class families who need help the most. In particular, the rebates should not be partially or completely denied to tens of millions of lower income taxpayers, as was the case with President Bush's plan during the last economic contraction. My package also includes a $30 billion Emergency Housing Crisis Fund to assist states and cities mitigate the effects of mounting foreclosures; a comprehensive plan to end the housing crisis with a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and a 5 year freeze on interest rates on subprime mortgages; $25 billion in immediate energy assistance to tens of millions of families; $5 billion in accelerated energy efficiency and alternative energy investments to jumpstart green collar job growth; and $10 billion in extending and broadening unemployment insurance for those who are struggling to find work.

""I have been calling for bipartisan action on stimulus for over a month and last week laid out a detailed plan to help struggling families and boost our economy. While I believe my plan is the strongest approach, the need for stimulus is urgent and we need a bipartisan package that is temporary and targets those who need help the most. ""For the White House to propose spending over $100 billion to jumpstart the economy, while shortchanging assistance to the 50 million families who are struggling the most and are most likely to inject those funds into the economy makes no sense. The Bush approach would fail to fully help the millions of lower income senior citizens who live on fixed incomes and are under enormous financial stress. And it would disproportionately leave out African American and Hispanic families who have, on average, lower incomes than white families. ""I hope President Bush will work with Democrats to design an economic stimulus plan that includes temporary tax relief focused on both jumpstarting our economy and fully supporting our most hard-pressed working families. I also urge the Administration to address the concerns I raised in my plan, including help for those struggling to find new jobs, keep their health care, and pay rising energy bills.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 28, 2008",Statement from Senator Hillary Clinton on Ukrainian Membership in NATO,"I enthusiastically welcome the January 11 letter from Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko, and Verkhovna Rada Chairman Arsenii Yatsenyuk to NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, which outlines Ukraine's desire for a closer relationship with NATO, including a Membership Action Plan. Like Ukraine's leaders, I hope that important steps toward reaching these goals will be made at the NATO summit in Bucharest in early April. I applaud the fact that Ukraine aspires to anchor itself firmly in the trans-Atlantic community through membership in NATO and look forward to working with Ukrainians and Ukrainian-Americans to reach that goal. Since the earliest days of Ukrainian independence, the strategy of the United States has always been to respect and support the Ukrainian people's democratic choices in shaping their future. Ukraine has been and remains an extremely important partner for the United States, and I take great pride in Ukraine's contributions to our common goal of building a Europe that is whole and free, peaceful and prosperous. When I traveled to Ukraine in 1997, I visited a memorial to the victims of Communist repression in Lviv, and made a commitment to the Ukrainian people on behalf of the United States: ""In your fight for freedom, your fight for democracy, the American people will stand with you."" In recalling that commitment more than ten years later I applaud the immense contributions that Ukrainian-Americans have made to our country and the indispensable role they have played in broadening and deepening the bonds between the United States and Ukraine. I have been greatly impressed by the courage of the Ukrainian people as they emerged from decades of Soviet oppression and as they have experienced both victories and struggles on the path to democracy and freedom. I have worked for more than 15 years to strengthen the U.S.-Ukraine relationship and help improve the lives of Ukrainians. Even before my first visit to Kyiv in 1995, I supported health care programs for Ukraine, including partnerships between hospitals in the United States and Ukraine and airlifts of critical pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies. After hearing pleas from Ukrainian women in 1997 to help combat human trafficking, which had become a growing problem in Ukraine, I helped initiate an international effort to combat trafficking, including several programs specifically to help Ukraine. In 1996, I organized a 10th anniversary White House commemoration of the Chornobyl disaster and, as honorary chair of Chornobyl Challenge '96, committed to continuing support for humanitarian efforts on behalf of those who suffer severe health consequences from the tragedy. I was honored to receive the Children of Chornobyl's Relief Fund Lifetime Humanitarian Achievement Award in 1999 for my work in helping to improve the health of women and children in Ukraine. As Senator I traveled to Ukraine in 2005 and met with President Yushchenko and offered the U.S. government's support for reform efforts to strengthen Ukraine's democracy. The United States has always favored the closest possible ties between NATO and Ukraine, including the creation of the NATO-Ukraine Council. We have always insisted on an open door policy for European democracies that want to join the Alliance. The enlargement of NATO is not directed against any state; NATO does not see any nation as its enemy. I pledge to support Ukraine's efforts to meet the criteria for MAP and eventual membership. The United States should actively encourage our NATO Allies to deepen their own ties with Ukraine, a country that has broken with an authoritarian past and pursues good relations with all its neighbors. Ukraine deserves a chance to pursue its aspirations for a wider role in the Euro-Atlantic community. In the same spirit, I call on the Bush Administration to give Ukraine all the support it needs to complete its accession to the World Trade Organization. As President, I will ensure that the United States does everything necessary to help Ukraine realize these important and achievable goals."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 28, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on the Fall in Home Sales,"Tonight President Bush will claim that the state of our union is strong. But as the latest housing data shows, the true state of the union is one of economic anxiety. ""The latest housing data shows that 2007 marked the first time in recent history where America has experienced a sustained annual drop in median existing home prices. In fact, according to some economists, America hasn't experienced a sustained annual decline in housing prices of this magnitude since the Great Depression. ""This dramatic decline in home sales is sending ripples across the economy. Construction-related employment is weakening and families' finances are increasingly strained. In order for us to truly jumpstart our Economy, we must address the housing crisis. ""Simply put, in order to bring our nation's financial house in order, we need to begin with housing itself. That is why my economic stimulus plan calls for $30 billion in assistance to states and communities to help them fight foreclosures. I have also called for a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a five-year freeze in rates on subprime adjustable mortgages."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 28, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on the State of the Union,"Tonight President Bush claimed that the state of our union is strong. And we can all debate that. But what is not up for debate is that for too many American families, the true ""state of their lives"" is one of economic anxiety and uncertainty. As I've traveled across the country and visited with people in their homes, I have listened to the urgent problems they face. These families are resolute, and when it comes to their strength, optimism and hard work, the state of our union has never been stronger. Yet after seven years of stagnant wages, declining incomes and increasing inequality, our families are working harder and harder and still falling behind. President Bush had one final chance tonight to acknowledge what the American people have known for years: that the economy is not working for middle class families. Unfortunately, what he offered was more of the same - a frustrating commitment to the same failed policies that helped turn record surpluses into large deficits, and push a thriving twenty-first century economy to the brink of recession. We need a President who understands the urgent economic challenges our families face and who will work as hard for middle-class families as they work for America. I intend to be that President for the American people. While I was heartened to hear the President acknowledge the need for immediate actions to jumpstart our economy, it will take more than tax rebates to fix our economic crisis and rebuild our economy for the future. We need immediate relief for people who are losing their jobs and facing skyrocketing home heating costs. And we need a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis. Every housing proposal the President made tonight, I made several months - and hundreds of thousands of foreclosure notices - ago. For example, I have proposed to enable the Federal Housing Administration to function as an alternative to the subprime market; and I have proposed to empower state housing finance agencies to help families refinance unworkable mortgages. But more is needed. So I have also called on the mortgage industry to observe a 90-day foreclosure moratorium on subprime mortgages and a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime loans. We need a long-term economic vision to restore shared growth and prosperity for America's middle class. As President, I will work every day to create good high-paying jobs that can't be outsourced, restore fairness to our economy, renew the promise of America that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and restore real fiscal responsibility to Washington. In Iraq, President Bush talked about the success of the surge. The Administration brandishes many numbers. The one I'm most focused on is that 2007 was the deadliest year for U.S. troops in Iraq. And the humanitarian situation remains devastating. President Bush isn't satisfied with failure after failure in Iraq; he wants to bind the next President to his failed strategy by unilaterally negotiating with the Iraqi government about the future of the U.S.-Iraq security relationship, including the possibility of permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. The Bush Administration says it does not even plan to submit this agreement to the Congress for approval, even though Iraqi officials plan to submit it to their parliament. It is an outrage that the Iraqi parliament will have an opportunity to debate this but the American Congress won't. We need to rein in this President. That is why I introduced the first legislation to require the President to submit any such agreement for congressional approval and to withhold any funding to carry out the agreement. After seven long years of this Presidency, I am committed as President to solve problems, not ignore them. I am committed to working for the middle class, not just the privileged few. I am committed to restoring our leadership in the world through strong alliances, not alienating our friends. I am committed to working towards real solutions for real Americans every day as President of the United States."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 29, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on the Fall in Home Prices,"The respected Case-Shiller Index shows that home prices fell 7.7% in November 2007 from November 2006. The dramatic decline means that families have lost an estimated $1.6 trillion in household wealth. The loss of household wealth is compromising the financial security of millions of families and it is sending ripples through the economy as consumers cut back their spending. Today's housing data is further evidence that the state of the union is a state of economic anxiety for too many families. The data underscore the need for a solution to the foreclosure crisis that is contributing to the weakness in home prices. Data was also released today showing that 2.2 million foreclosure notices were sent out last year, a 75% increase from 2006. We cannot jumpstart the economy without addressing the foreclosure crisis. That is why my stimulus plan calls for $30 billion in assistance to states and communities to help them fight foreclosures. I have also called for a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime adjustable mortgages."

And John is one of the greatest champions the American people could ask for. I wish John and Elizabeth all the best. They have my great personal respect and gratitude.

This data confirms that for far too many families, the state of the union is a state of economic anxiety. I have been calling since early December for Congress and the President to take immediate action to jumpstart our economy. I am heartened to see that the House moved quickly to pass a stimulus package. But we need more than tax rebates and business incentives to fix our ailing economy. That is why I have called for extending unemployment insurance for those who are looking for work, expanding heating assistance for those facing skyrocketing heating cost, and enacting a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis, including a 90-day foreclosure moratorium and a 5-year interest rate freeze on subprime mortgages."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 30, 2008",Hillary Clinton's Statement on the FBI's Inquiry into the Mortgage Industry,"For a long time families and community groups have been saying that the subprime mortgage industry was rife with abuses. A federal investigation of industry practices is long overdue. Last year, I introduced the Home Ownership Preservation Act to curb industry abuses by registering mortgage brokers, eliminating certain lending practices, and providing $100 million in assistance to states to investigate and prosecute mortgage-related fraud. But we must not only end the abusive practices, we must end the foreclosure crisis itself. That is why I have also proposed a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures, a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, and $30 billion in assistance to states and communities to fight foreclosures and offset the costs associated with mounting vacancies."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"January 31, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Her New Legislation to Fight Foreclosures,"Today I introduced the Mortgage Refinancing Initiative Act, legislation that will enable state housing finance agencies to help tens of thousands of families refinance unworkable mortgages and avoid foreclosures. This is a policy I proposed last October, and which President Bush called for three months and several hundred thousand foreclosure notices later. ""The legislation I introduced today will temporarily modify the Mortgage Revenue Bond program to allow state housing agencies to use the proceeds of tax-exempt bond issuances to facilitate mortgage refinancings. State housing agencies will be able to commit up to $10 billion over two years to refinancing unworkable mortgages. States will high foreclosure rates will receive the greatest assistance. ""For nearly a year I have called for action on the foreclosure crisis that is devastating communities, shaking our economy, and putting the financial security of millions of families at risk. 1.3 million households received foreclosure notices last year. Mounting foreclosures are adding to the weakness in house prices, and therefore even families not at risk of losing their homes are affected. The decline in home prices has already cost families an estimated $1.6 trillion. We cannot jumpstart our economy without tackling the foreclosure crisis. ""In addition to today's legislation, I have a comprehensive plan to address the foreclosure crisis. Specifically, I have proposed a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures, a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, and $30 billion in assistance to states and communities to fight foreclosures and offset the costs associated with mounting vacancies."" Leaders and Experts Comment on Hillary's Legislation and Plan to Fight Foreclosures ""For nearly a year now, Senator Clinton has been calling attention to the foreclosure crisis and proposing bold ways of addressing it. The legislation she introduced today is a sensible and cost-effective way of cutting foreclosures. In addition, I believe that her call for a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures, a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime loans, and a $30 billion fund to help states fight foreclosures, is the right approach for tackling the mortgage crisis."" -- Jon Corzine, Governor of New Jersey ""A natural outcome of your bill is that more individuals and families would be able to stay in their homes without the threat of foreclosure. Refinancing existing loans to more affordable rates and prices that are based on current market information will be a boon to families that face very high interests rates -- and very high payments -- on existing adjustable mortgages."" -- Richard F. Gaylord, President, National Association of Realtors"
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 1, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on January Employment Report,"Today's report that our economy actually lost jobs in January confirms my view that we are sliding into a second Bush recession. During the same month that President Bush declared that the state of our union was strong, the economy lost 17,000 jobs, the worst jobs performance in four and a half years. This data shows what so many of the families I meet every day already know: this economy is failing middle class families. Washington must act immediately and aggressively to head off our growing economic crisis. This report underscores why it is absolutely critical that we include in any stimulus package extended unemployment insurance for those who are losing their jobs and looking work in our ailing economy. And while I am heartened to see that the House moved quickly to pass a stimulus package, we need more than tax rebates and business incentives to fix our ailing economy. That is why I have called for expanding heating assistance for those facing skyrocketing heating cost, and enacting a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis, including a 90-day foreclosure moratorium and a 5-year interest rate freeze on subprime mortgages."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 4, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on the President's Budget,"The only real significance of the President's budget is to serve as a legacy of his disastrous fiscal management over the last seven years. Once again we've seen the President's failed priorities laid bare in a budget that preserves every cent of his tax cuts for the wealthiest while placing the burden of his failures on the backs of working families, senior citizens, our police, our firefighters, our teachers and others. Instead of budgeting a long term AMT fix to provide tax relief for the middle class, addressing our long term energy needs or prioritizing sensible health care reforms, this budget's biggest contribution is a commitment to more deficits and even more debt financed by countries like China. Instead of addressing the needs of low income families and working poor, the President has proposed cutting home heating assistance in the middle of winter by 22 percent, cutting rural health care programs by 86 percent and the deepest cuts, and completely eliminating a critical early education program, Even Start. It has been seven years since this President squandered the opportunities of the surpluses created during the Clinton Administration, and it is past time to restore responsible fiscal management and put the priorities of middle class Americans first."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 8, 2008",Statement of Hillary Clinton on the Bush Administration's Proposed FMLA Changes,"Our economy is sliding into recession and the strain on working families  from stagnant wages, rising energy costs, looming foreclosures, and skyrocketing tuition  is growing. Yet, the Bush Administration has acted once again to tilt the balance of power towards corporations instead of hardworking Americans. I believe we should expand the FMLA so that all workers have the time they need to care for themselves, their children, or sick family members, and be responsible employees. I have proposed a bold agenda to address the work-family squeeze that so many parents feel. Forty percent of workers are currently ineligible for FMLA benefits because they work part-time, work for small businesses, or are new to their jobs. My plan will expand the FMLA to cover 13 million additional workers, provide 7 sick days, move us towards paid family leave for new parents and caregivers, and provide greater access to quality child care for working families. I was also proud to work with my colleague Senator Dodd to enact legislation that provides extended access to leave for the relatives of wounded military members. The Bush Administration is seeking to make it more difficult for employees to claim paid leave when it is available to them by requiring the employers leave policies to take precedent over the FMLA; requiring employees with chronic health conditions to obtain an annual certification that they are able to do their job or risk being transferred to a different job; allowing employers to communicate directly with medical providers, which raises privacy concerns; and much more. The proposed regulation is 500 pages long. The Family and Medical Leave Act makes it possible for people to meet their responsibilities at work and at home. I have advanced a positive agenda to move our nation towards this goal. The President's proposed regulations, unfortunately, are a harmful step back."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 11, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Today's Comments from Secretary Gates,"I want to say one other thing, and that is, I was very disheartened to hear Secretary Gates, as reported today, suggest that the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq would not continue at the pace that had been expected. ""This means that we will have as many troops in Iraq in the summer of 2008 as we had at the beginning of 2007. I continue to call on the President to end the war he started, to take responsibly for bringing our young men and women home. I have said repeatedly that there is no military solution, and it's time for the American military to be relieved from the responsibility of refereeing the Iraqi Civil War. It is clear that in the absence of a military solution, which I think this announcement today obviously confirms, the Iraqi government will not take the steps that were expected and even demanded. ""The whole idea behind this so-called surge was to give the Iraqi government the space and time to make the tough decisions that only they can make for themselves and the future of their country. So I will continue to press hard, both in the Congress and on the campaign trail for this President to end this war before he leaves office. ""If that doesn't happen, then I will immediately, upon taking office, implement the plan that I have put forth to be able to start withdrawing our troops within 60 days, and make it very clear to the Iraqi government that they do not have a blank check. They have to begin to make the decisions that only they can make."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 12, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Blue Cross of California's Efforts to Deny Health Coverage Based on Pre-Existing Conditions,"I am outraged by news reports that Blue Cross of California is asking physicians to provide personal medical information about their patients that Blue Cross can use to deny them health insurance coverage. This is a deliberate effort to pressure physicians to betray the sacred trust they have with their patients. It could lead patients to be less forthcoming about critical medical information. And it could further erode the fragmented and inadequate system of health insurance in California and around the country. This is only the most recent example of how insurance companies spend tens of billions of dollars a year figuring out how to avoid covering people with health insurance. In the current system, insurers profit by cherry picking healthy individuals and avoiding those that may be ""expensive,"" and then trying to avoid paying up once the insured patient actually needs treatment. My American Health Choices Plan will finally put an end to these discriminatory practices. Insurance companies will no longer be able to deny individuals' coverage because of preexisting conditions or risk factors, or charge exorbitant premiums to screen them out. And individual coverage will be guaranteed, so if you pay your premiums and follow the rules, insurance companies will be required to renew your coverage each year at a price you can afford. I am running for President to ensure that no American is ever again discriminated against by insurance companies, and that every American has quality affordable health coverage-no one is left out."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 12, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on President George Bush's Housing Proposal,"Several months and several hundred thousand foreclosure notices later, the Bush administration is beginning to adopt my proposals to address the housing crisis. In early December I called on banks to observe a moratorium on foreclosures while they modified unworkable mortgages. Secretary Paulson said of my proposal: ""I don't think it makes sense to get in and intervene."" [Good Morning America, 1/18/08] But today the administration is announcing an agreement with banks to observe a foreclosure moratorium. Lenders retain too much discretion over granting the moratorium, but this is at least a start. Similarly, in October I proposed empowering the state housing agencies to fight foreclosures by refinancing unaffordable mortgages (I have introduced the Mortgage Refinancing Initiative Act to accomplish this). The administration was silent on the proposal for several months, but a few weeks ago President Bush endorsed it in his State of the Union address. ""I recognized early on that we cannot jumpstart the economy without resolving the housing crisis.

I will strictly enforce safety rules and impose stiff criminal and civil penalties on violators. And I will crack down on the slaughter of sick or injured cows, a practice which poses health risks to families and children. Now more than ever, America needs a President who will deliver concrete reforms that fill the gaps in our food safety system."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 17, 2008",Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Kosova Independence,"I welcome the historic declaration of Kosova independence issued today in Pristina. I urge our friends and allies and around the world to join the United States and European Union countries in promptly recognizing an independent Kosova. This is a historic step that will allow the people of Kosova to finally live in their own democratic state. It will allow Kosova and Serbia to finally put a difficult chapter in their history behind them and to move forward. Resolving this issue has taken too long and has held both of these proud peoples back from pursuing a better European and Euro-Atlantic future. It is time now for all of us to look ahead and to focus on the challenge of building an independent Kosova and supporting a democratic Serbia in an integrated Europe. I want to underscore the need to avoid any violence or provocations in the days and weeks ahead. Kosovars and Serbs have seen too much violence and too many provocations in the past. It is time to focus on improving the lives of people living in both countries and the integration of these countries into the West. In recognizing the independence of Kosova, I want to stress the high importance that I attach to full protection of the rights of all minorities in Kosova, especially the Serbs, and to safeguard Serbian cultural and religious heritage sites in Kosova. The international community must stand firm on these points. I remain concerned about the deterioration of the situation in neighboring Bosnia and urge the Bush Administration to pay more attention to this issue, so that it does not once again become a major threat to European stability. I regret that it has taken so long for us to reach this historic juncture and that the Bush Administration has not always given the issues of Kosova, Serbia's democratic future, and the Balkans the attention they deserve. This has helped contribute to the complicated and risky situation on the ground in the Balkans that we still face today. I look forward to working with the democratic leaders in this region and will once again make the full integration of the Western Balkans into Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community the priority it should be."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 19, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Fidel Castro,"As you know, Fidel Castro announced that he is stepping down as Cuba's leader after nearly 50 years of one-man rule. The new leadership in Cuba will face a stark choice -- continue with the failed policies of the past that have stifled democratic freedoms and stunted economic growth -- or take a historic step to bring Cuba into the community of democratic nations. The people of Cuba want to seize this opportunity for real change and so must we. ""I would say to the new leadership, the people of the United States are ready to meet you if you move forward towards the path of democracy, with real, substantial reforms. The people of Cuba yearn for the opportunity to get out from under the weight of this authoritarian regime, which has held back 11 million talented and hardworking citizens of the Americas. The new government should take this opportunity to release political prisoners and to take serious steps towards democracy that give their people a real voice in their government. ""The American people have been on the side of the Cuban people's struggle for freedom and democracy in the past and we will be on their side for democracy in the future. ""As President, I will engage our partners in Latin America and Europe who have a strong stake in seeing a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba, and who want very much for the United States to play a constructive role to that end. The United States must pursue an active policy that does everything possible to advance the cause of freedom, democracy and opportunity in Cuba. ""The events of the past three days, including elections in Pakistan and Kosovo's declaration of independence, are a vivid illustration of people around the world yearning for democracy and opportunity. We need a President with the experience to recognize and seize these opportunities to advance America's values and interests around the world. I will be that President."""

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 22, 2008",Statement from Hillary Rodham Clinton,"The administration made a critical mistake when it failed to address the housing crisis as part of its economic stimulus plan, and so it's encouraging that it is now considering proposals like the ones I've been advocating for the last year. ""We cannot jumpstart the economy without addressing the housing crisis. The fact that George Bush is starting to understand that reality but Senator Obama still does not should trouble all those concerned about how the housing crisis is impacting the economy. ""This is something that I recognized early on, and that is why my stimulus proposal called for $30 billion in assistance to states, cities and communities to help them fight foreclosures. It is also why I have called for a 90-day foreclosure moratorium on subprime mortgages, and a freeze of at least 5 years in the monthly payments on subprime adjustable rate mortgages. In addition, I have introduced the Mortgage Refinancing Initiative Act to enable state housing agencies to replace unworkable mortgages with loans that families can afford. I have introduced legislation to modernize the FHA so that it can play a stabilizing role in the housing market. And I have long called for expanding the foreclosure prevention programs at HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. ""I am the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to end the housing crisis. My plan is a workout, not a bailout, that will keep families in their homes and help halt our economy's slide into recession. I have proposed real solutions to the very real problems facing our country. Upwards of 2 million families are at risk of losing their homes. The fall in home values has already erased an estimated $1.6 trillion in household wealth. America needs a president who leads when economic challenges arise. I will be that President, and I will work hard every day to solve our nation's problems."""

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 28, 2008",Statement from Hillary Rodham Clinton,"America's prison population has grown at a staggering rate over the past quarter century. A new report now reveals a staggering and heart-breaking statistic: One in 100 American adults is currently behind bars. Our incarceration rate is several times greater than that of any other developed country. To state it plainly, the 1-in-100 figure represents a failure of our society at a number of levels. And the cost  to our families, to our communities, and to state budgets to the tune of almost $50 billion  are simply too great to bear. Many of those costs are borne disproportionately by minority communities: One in 15 African American adults is behind bars, and one in 36 Hispanic adults. We need a President who will be tough on crime, but smart about it too. A President who will take innovative steps to ensure our crime policies are reducing crime in the long run so that we have fewer victims of crime and fewer prisoners."" ""To reverse this alarming trend, interventions are needed before crimes are committed, before offenders are shipped to prison, during their terms of incarceration, and as they are released and begin to reintegrate themselves into our communities. I will work to deter crime by re-investing in our communities, re-invigorating the COPS program, and putting 100,000 new officers committed to community policing into neighborhoods across America. Studies have shown that the COPS program deters crime. And I will close the revolving prison door by reforming our sentencing policies, promoting effective alternatives to incarceration, and investing in new ""second chance"" Reentry Partnership Grants to support reformed offenders and reduce recidivism. The solutions are within our grasp. What we need now is leadership, and that's what I'll provide."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 28, 2008",Statement of Senator Hillary Clinton on the United Nation's Durban II Racism Conference,"The UN's 2001 debacle in Durban must not be allowed to repeat itself. No one will ever forget how the world's first Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance made a mockery of its own effort to banish the scourge of racism globally. I was appalled when a meeting designed to condemn racism became the forum for the distribution of anti-Semitic cartoons, leaflets and other demonstrations of naked hatred and bigotry against Jews. As President I pledge to resolutely fight all efforts to inject anti-Semitism, hatred and discrimination onto the agenda of Durban II, scheduled for 2009, and I call on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour and heads of state from around the world to lend full force of their offices to prevent that from happening. Particularly with Iran, now the global seat of anti-Semitic rhetoric, on the organizing committee, the need for vigilance and forceful action to redeem this conference is essential. When I am President, the United States will lead a boycott of the conference should current efforts to rein in the forces of hatred fail. We must not accept, condone or participate in a conference that can be hijacked by an agenda of hatred, and we must work strenuously to ensure that our friends do not do so either. I applaud the strong redline laid down by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who announced that France would disengage from the Conference if the ""excesses and abuses"" from 2001 return to the agenda of Durban II. Non-governmental Organizations also have a special responsibility to resist efforts to pollute the NGO forum at Durban II. To prevent a repeat of 2001, American philanthropic organizations must carefully review the objectives of the NGOs they sponsor for the conference, ensuring that none will come to Durban with pernicious agendas. Respected human rights organizations participating in Durban II should be prepared to swiftly and resolutely denounce any group that allows hatred to infect the proceedings. The UN is an essential arena for political debate among nations, but we must not let it be misused as a forum for anti-Semitism or incitement against any group. The credibility of the UN and its core human rights machinery is at stake, and thus far the signs are pointing in the wrong direction. We must not repeat the tragedy of the first Durban conference, and now is the time to lay down clear markers against such an outcome."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"February 29, 2008",Statement from Hillary Rodham Clinton,"Since December, there have been nearly 450 individual reports of adverse reactions and as many as 21 deaths connected to contaminated shipments of the blood-thinning drug, heparin. The New York Times reported yesterday that the Chinese factory responsible for manufacturing a key ingredient of the drug ""fell into a regulatory void"" in China. The FDA has admitted that it approved the drug for manufacture despite failing to inspect the factory. According to the FDA, inspectors got mixed up and went to the wrong facility. Today, the Times reported that the number of deaths associated with the contaminated shipments may be larger than previously thought. FDA has now told physicians to stop using heparin and production of the drug has been suspended. In light of these reports, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement: ""When will the Bush administration finally get serious about the threat of unsafe drugs, food, and consumer products from China? How many more reminders do we need that our import safety net is badly frayed? The latest reminder is a potentially tainted supply of the blood-thinning drug -- heparin -- that has caused hundreds of adverse reactions and more than 20 deaths. The plant that produced a key ingredient for the drug was certified by the FDA to export to the United States even though the FDA had not inspected it or its suppliers, and neither had the Chinese government. Instead, FDA inspectors reportedly evaluated a different Chinese manufacturer with a similar name. The problems with the drug were first reported in January, and weeks later the FDA still doesn't have answers to important questions. ""This is unacceptable. Americans have a right to know that their government is taking their health and safety seriously. When I am President, I will take decisive steps to protect patients from unsafe imported drugs. As I laid out in my import safety agenda, I will require that foreign drug makers produce a certification that they have met American safety standards as a condition of import into the United States, confirmed by independent testing and inspection. I will open permanent FDA oversight offices in at-risk countries like China so that episodes like this one are not repeated. I will require foreign drug makers to accept random, surprise inspections, rather than notifying them in advance - and giving them a chance to clean up their act -- as we do now. And I will stiffen civil and criminal penalties for violators. ""It is a basic obligation of government to protect its citizens. Americans can count on me as President to protect the food we eat, the toys our children play with and the drugs we take to make us healthy, not sick."""

""You'll have to ask Senator Obama. I think it's somewhat disturbing that he would say one thing in Ohio and then have his campaign send a private signal to a foreign government which is presenting exactly the opposite of what he's been saying in Ohio. This is part of a pattern and I think it's a pattern that deserves closer examination. NAFTA is a really critical issue to the people of Ohio. I have not just talked about the problems with NAFTA; I've put forth a very specific plan about what I would do to correct them. I made it clear in the debate that I would tell both Canada and Mexico that we would opt-out if they did not negotiate. I feel that strongly about it. We've had it for 14 years. There are parts of the country that are doing well and other parts that are really suffering. And we should make this as much of a win/win for America as possible.

Today's contest is not an open and democratic election, and the Russian people have been denied the opportunity to choose their leaders and shape the future of their country. There's no other way to describe today's election. ""Mr. Medvedev has said some hopeful sounding things in the course of his campaign, and the job of a new American President will be to test these words, to see whether they could mark a new approach in Russian politics and foreign policy. ""But we have to do this with our eyes open. ""The list of issues that divides the United States and Russia is already long  and growing longer. In the heart of Europe, where we have worked hard since the end of the Cold War to bury old rivalries and hostilities, we are witnessing renewed disputes between Russia and many of its neighbors. ""Russia has stirred nationalist feelings against neighboring countries like Estonia and Georgia, repeatedly used oil and natural gas as a political weapon, attempted to block Western diplomatic efforts to keep peace in the Balkans, criticized nations that seek to join the NATO alliance, and made clear that it regards democratic breakthroughs and progress in other countries on its borders as a threat to itself. ""Mr. Putin has put Russia on a path of zero-sum competition with the United States and many of our friends and allies. He has stifled independent media, harassed and jailed political opponents, and made elections a depressing formality. ""Unfortunately, President Bush failed to grasp what was happening. He began the process of tearing up treaties without finding other ways to preserve mutual confidence, all the while looking the other way while Russia challenged the interests of the United States and its allies. After September 11, President Bush focused U.S.-Russian relations around just one issue, fighting terrorism. Mr. Putin saw that this meant he had a free pass to act as he liked at home and in Russia's neighborhood. In the meantime, America's relations with our European allies, who are absolutely essential to an effective Russia policy, frayed. ""We simply have to do better than this. ""For the past seven years, the Bush Administration has neglected both big problems and big opportunities in our relations with Russia. ""As President, I will be ready to work with Russia where our interests intersect  fighting terrorism and nuclear proliferation are just two examples  but I also want Russia to understand what America's priorities are and that we will stand up for them."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 2, 2008",Hillary Clinton's Statement in Support of U.S. Aerospace and Aviation,"Our aerospace and aviation workforce is the best in the world, powered by hundreds of thousands of workers across the country, including more than 60,000 in Ohio and 180,000 in Texas. American aerospace is a flagship industry - producing an annual positive trade balance of close to $60 billion. In recent years, American aerospace and aviation has been facing new challenges, including mounting competition from foreign competitors like Brazil, Canada, and Europe and growing consumer concerns. Instead of supporting our industries, the Bush administration has slashed funding for NASA's aeronautical research and development, underfunded FAA's air traffic control modernization, and failed to adequately enforce our trade agreements to create a level playing field for our domestic industries. Hillary Clinton has a plan to ensure that America remains the global leader in aerospace and aviation. As President, she will: Provide new incentives for and investments in aerospace research and development. Hillary will double NASA's and FAA's aeronautics R&D; budgets as part of her plan to reverse the Bush administration's war on science. She will pursue a balanced strategy of robust human spaceflight, expanded robotic spaceflight, and enhanced space and Earth science activities. She will speed development, testing, and deployment of next-generation launch and crew exploration vehicles to replace the aging Space Shuttle program. At the same time, Hillary's innovation agenda calls for stimulating in-house research and commercial development by making the R&D; tax credit permanent. She will also double federal investment in basic research, which is critical for ensuring that America is at the forefront of new ideas. Expand the nation's pool of skilled scientists, engineers, and technicians. To meet the aerospace industry's need for scientists, engineers and technicians, Hillary has called for tripling the number of NSF fellowships and other incentives for bringing more people, particularly women and minorities, into the fields of mathematics, science and engineering. Hillary will reward teachers that enter math and science disciplines and strengthen our K-12 education system to ensure we are producing the best future scientists and engineers in the world. Modernize our air transportation system. Hillary will appoint an FAA director whose chief responsibility will be to speed a smooth transition to a Next Generation Air Transportation System. Hillary sees the Next Generation system as vital to accommodating the growth in air travel, to enhancing the safety and competitiveness of American aviation, and to improving air travel for consumers. Undertake smart, tough international trade negotiations that establish level playing fields on which our aerospace firms can compete fairly and win. Hillary recognizes that aerospace is a highly competitive global industry and that aerospace trade takes place within an exceedingly complex matrix of global, multilateral, and bilateral agreements, standards, and certification and adjudication procedures among nations. As President, she will level the playing field by ensuring fair trade negotiations, just settlement of disputes before the WTO, continued support for international certification and sales of U.S. civil aircraft, and she will look to update our outdated export control system."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 3, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"In a press availability this morning, Hillary Clinton made the following remarks regarding a memo that has surfaced confirming communication between Sen. Obama's top economic advisor, Austan Goolsbee and the Canadian embassy about NAFTA. I think that after days of denial, the Obama campaign was confronted with a memo of a meeting - it was my understanding - in which there was a discussion of NAFTA. And it raises questions about Senator Obama coming to Ohio and giving speeches about NAFTA and having his chief economic advisor tell the Canadian government that it was just political rhetoric. I don't think people should come to Ohio and tell the people of Ohio one thing and then have your campaign tell a foreign government something else behind closed doors. That's the kind of difference between talk and action and that I've been pointing out in this campaign. I think the questions should be directed at Senator Obama. I don't think people should come to Ohio and you both give speeches that are very critical of NAFTA and you send out misleading and false information about my positions regarding NAFTA and then we find out that your chief economic advisor has gone to a foreign government and basically done the old wink-wink, don't pay any attention this is just political rhetoric."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 3, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"Hugo Chavez's order yesterday to send ten battalions to the Colombian border is unwarranted and dangerous. The Colombian state has every right to defend itself against drug trafficking terrorist organizations that have kidnapped innocent civilians, including American citizens. By praising and supporting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Chavez is openly siding with terrorists that threaten Colombian democracy and the peace and security of the region. Rather than criticizing Colombia's actions in combating terrorist groups in the border regions, Venezuela and Ecuador should work with their neighbor to ensure that their territories no longer serve as safe havens for terrorist groups. After reviewing this situation, I am hopeful that the government of Ecuador will determine that its interests lie in closer cooperation with Colombia on this issue. Hugo Chavez must call a halt to this provocative action.

Only by seeking the truth about the past can we be confident about our pursuit of peace and justice today. ""On March 5, 1940, Stalin's Politburo gave the order for the Soviet secret police to execute more than 22,000 Polish POWs in cold blood. This horrific mass murder was covered up by the Soviet authorities and denied for decades until Mikhail Gorbachev finally admitted the truth and Boris Yeltsin aided the international investigations by opening the Russian archives. ""I am concerned that the pace of Russian cooperation has slowed drastically under President Putin. The Russian government, which had promised to hand over personal records of the victims and other information about Katyn, has been dragging its feet and has reclassified many of the files. All the relevant archives should be opened up in the interest of establishing the full truth about Katyn. ""The crimes were committed long ago, but we cannot and we shall not forget. ""I believe that it is highly fitting that a historical film about the massacre titled ""Katyn"" and created by the acclaimed Polish director Andrej Wajda was nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign film in 2008.

This report clearly shows that while society has made progress in addressing disparities between African Americans and whites, disturbing inequities still remain. The State of Black America 2008 highlights meaningful improvements in broadband access, college enrollment, and high school graduation rates among African Americas. In addition, the analysis shows that sentencing disparities have. We celebrate these achievements. At the same time we recognize that society has a tremendous amount of hard work ahead to ensure that every African American has the fully opportunity to achieve their God-given potential. African American children are still twice as likely as white children to be uninsured. Three times as many African Americans live below the poverty line than whites. College enrollment for African American high school graduates decreased since 2007, at a time when rates are rising among other demographic groups. And the subprime crisis is draining wealth from African American communities. As President, Hillary will act swiftly to address the deep racial disparities between African Americans and whites that are highlighted throughout this important report with tangible plans for improving people's lives. Hillary will launch a comprehensive Zero-to-Five early childhood education initiative that expands Head Start, provides nurse home visiting for every new at-risk mother, and provides access to pre-school for every four year old, starting with children living in poverty. She'll close the persistent pay gap, which results in African American women earning only $.68 for every dollar men earn for doing the same job - even less than white women who earn $.77 for every dollar men earn. Hillary will achieve universal health care and providing $50 million for improving the cultural competency of our health care providers and recruiting a diverse workforce. She'll cut in half the high school drop-out rate among students of color. She'll almost double funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), provide $100 million for helping minority-serving institutions upgrade to 21st century technology, and end the predatory lending practices of private student loan companies that are mortgaging our young people's futures. And she'll expand the EITC to reward work and help large families and low-income individuals who do not have children. As President, Hillary will work tirelessly to ensure that the findings in The State of Black America 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and beyond reveal significant progress in every area the report looks at - from economics to health care, from education to social justice and civic engagement."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 7, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on February Job Loss,"Today's dismal jobs news should put to rest any doubts that our economy is in deep trouble. We have now seen two straight months of job loss, and the 63,000 decline in February is the worst since March of 2003. This troubling news comes at the end of a week where oil toped $104 a barrel and we learned that home foreclosures hit an all time high in the fourth quarter of 2007. These are painful reminders that we need a President who is ready to be a steward of our economy, starting on day one. Because behind these statistics, every job lost means there is another family missing a paycheck, another parent worried about providing for their kids, and another family in danger of losing their home. The time for action is now. While the stimulus measures in the pipeline are important, it's going to take more than tax rebates to avoid a deep economic downturn. We need to immediately extend unemployment insurance and invest at least $5 billion right now in green-collar jobs to help avert a recession. And we need a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis, not more half-measures and hand-wringing. That is why I've called for a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures, a 5-year freeze on interest rates for subprime mortgages and a $30 billion emergency fund to help states handle the crisis in their communities."

Gas is approaching $4 a gallon in some parts of the country and the average American family is spending $2,000 more a year on their energy costs than they were in 2000. Americans need a president who is ready to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fight global warming from day one, not someone who voted to provide new special interest tax breaks and giveaways to big oil companies. My opponent voted for Dick Cheney's 2005 energy bill; I knew it would take us in the wrong direction. For seven years, the Bush Administration has stood by as the price of oil has skyrocketed, now breaking $107 a barrel. As a result, companies like Exxon are reaping the highest profits in the history of the world-$40.6 billion in 2007 alone-and we are more dependent on foreign oil now than we were before 9/11. As President, I will create a Strategic Energy Fund that will require big oil companies to reinvest some of their huge windfall profits in clean, renewable technologies. I will reduce the amount of oil we import by two-thirds from projected levels by 2030, or more than 10 million barrels per day. These steps are part of my overall plan to transition to a clean, green economy and create at least 5 million new green collar jobs in America."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 12, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on President Bush's Remarks on Trade,"We don't need lectures on trade from a President who has turned back the clock on worker and environmental protections, allowed our trade deficit to skyrocket and stood idly by while countries like China unfairly manipulate their currency and dump products like steel on the U.S. market. In fact, the reason we so desperately need to take a timeout from new trade agreements is to put a stop to the Bush Administration's reckless and destructive trade policies, and to chart a new course on trade policy for the 21st Century that is genuinely pro-worker and pro-American. We also need a President who is truly committed to fixing NAFTA. I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, and have a specific 4-part plan to get it done. My opponent told the voters of Ohio that he wanted to fix NAFTA too, but his top economic advisor told the Canadian government that was just ""political positioning,"" not a real policy commitment."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 12, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Seating Delegates from Florida and Michigan,"Hillary Clinton made the following statement at the Hispanic Chamber Of Commerce earlier this morning: ""If you are a voter from Florida or Michigan, you know that we should count your vote. The nearly two and a half million Americans in those two states who participated in the primary elections are in danger of being excluded from our democratic process and I think that's wrong. The results of those primaries were fair and they should be honored. Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of discussion about what we should do to ensure that the voters in Florida and Michigan are counted. ""In my view there are two options: Honor the results or hold new primary elections. I don't see any other solutions that are fair and honor the commitment that two and a half million voters made in the Democratic primaries in those two states. Whether voters are clamoring for solutions to the challenges that we face or not, or whether people are coming out in droves to be heard, we have a basic obligation to make sure that every vote in America counts. ""I hope that Senator Obama's campaign will join me in working to make that happen. I think that that is a non-partisan solution to make sure that we do count these votes."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 13, 2008",Statement by Senator Clinton Announcing Support for New Action on the Housing Crisis,"America's housing crisis is threatening to drive our economy into a deep recession. Mortgage foreclosures are at an all-time high, housing prices are falling at record rates, and for the first time on record, homeowners own less than half the value of their homes. This crisis threatens not only to force millions of Americans out of their homes but put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work and devastate communities across the nation. That's why today, I joined my friend Barney Frank and my Senate colleagues to support a new approach that will help ease the credit crunch and let millions of families facing foreclosures restructure their mortgages and stay in their homes. For a year now, I have been speaking out on the need to address our nation's housing crisis. In March 2007, I first called for a ""foreclosure timeout,"" that would bring together servicers, lenders and government actors to help keep families in their homes. In August 2007, I called for increased regulations to protect borrowers and rein in rampant mortgage industry abuses. In December 2007, I proposed a framework to keep families in their homes with a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days and a voluntary freeze of at least 5 years on adjustable rate subprime mortgage rates. And in early January of this year, I called for $30 billion in immediate assistance to help states and cities mitigate the foreclosure crisis. While I was heartened today to see the Administration acknowledge the need for greater federal oversight of the mortgage industry, this news comes seven months and 1.6 million foreclosure filings after I first called for similar steps. And while the Bush Administration has belatedly acknowledged that both a foreclosure moratorium and an extended rate freeze are important components of an eventual solution, their approach to-date has been far too narrow to address the scope of the crisis. That's why today, in addition to my proposals for a voluntary moratorium and rate freeze, I am supporting a plan to help millions of families restructure their mortgages on affordable, sustainable terms. I am co-sponsoring legislation with Senator Dodd to expand the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) capacity to guarantee responsible, restructured mortgages. This legislation will give lenders new incentives to work with homeowners who have seen the value of their homes fall below the principal on their loans, and put them into more affordable, secure long-term mortgages. This approach is not a bailout. It is a sensible way for all actors - lenders, investors, servicers and borrowers - to share responsibility, keep families in their homes and stabilize our communities and our economy. I first championed FHA reform over a year ago, and offered legislation to help modernize the FHA infrastructure to make the investments in personnel and information technology to help meet market demand and offer safe and secure alternatives to subprime mortgages. Today, I am expanding that approach so that the FHA can help stabilize the current housing crisis. Finally, I am calling on Congress to immediately establish a $30 billion Emergency Housing Fund for states and localities struggling with mounting foreclosures. While the recently passed stimulus bill provides much-needed support for struggling workers and seniors, it fails to address the housing crisis, which is at the heart of our economy's problems. This Emergency Fund would give governors, mayors, and community organizations the resources they need to stem the downward economic spiral that accompanies concentrated foreclosures. These resources could be used to buy, rehabilitate and put foreclosed properties back into constructive use, expand foreclosure prevention and counseling programs, and support community-level efforts to combat blight."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 14, 2008",Statement From Hillary Clinton,"Hillary Clinton put out the following statement in response to reports that President Bush personally intervened to order the EPA to weaken its new limits on ozone: President Bush opened a new front in his administration's war on science this week. His personal intervention to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's new limits on ozone proves that he has abandoned even a pretense of scientific integrity in decision-making. His efforts are directly at odds not only with accepted science, but with his government's own arguments before the United States Supreme Court. This is only the latest in a long series of examples where the Bush administration's perversion of science helps special interests at the expense of public health -- though it is certainly one of the more brazen. I will work with Senate Environment Committee Chair Barbara Boxer to investigate the President's decision and to hold him accountable. And when I am President, I will end the Bush war on science. And I will work to revise the ozone standard to reflect the available standard and to protect the public health, as the clean air act requires. Months ago, I outlined a detailed agenda to restore scientific integrity to government decision-making. I promised that as President I would issue an executive order to revive the longstanding practice of giving experts a central voice in agency rulemaking and call on agencies to pursue evidence-based decisions, and to direct all department and agency heads to safeguard against instances of political pressure threatening scientific integrity and promote openness and transparency in decision-making."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 15, 2008",Statement From Hillary Clinton,"I am deeply concerned about the violent clashes that have erupted in Lhasa, Tibet. Based on the limited information available, there is an urgent need for all parties, and in particular the Chinese security forces, to exercise restraint, to demonstrate respect for human rights and to protect civilians from danger. I call on the Chinese government to prevent further escalation of this conflict and to urgently pursue resolution through peaceful means. ""I co-sponsored the Fourteenth Dalai Lama Congressional Gold Medal Act and co-sponsored the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001, supporting a dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama. I have personally met with the Dalai Lama. I asked President Jiang Zemin to explain China's repression of the Tibetans and their religion during his 1997 state visit to the United States. More than 10 years later, Chinese repression in Tibet continues. This week, Tibetan monks have sent a message to the world that their aspirations for religious liberty remain as strong as ever. ""Upholding freedom and human rights in Tibet will happen through negotiation, and with a commitment on all sides to seeking constructive solutions for the benefit, above all, of the Tibetan people."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 17, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"This is a moment of great unique uncertainty in our financial markets. The crisis that began in the subprime mortgage market has spilled over and now poses a broader threat. I am following the developments in our markets closely. This morning I spoke with Secretary Paulson and New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner. They both outlined the actions that were taken yesterday to ensure liquidity and restore confidence in the market. I relayed to them my thoughts and concerns. I will continue to monitor the situation closely throughout the day and will seek advice and counsel from a broad range of economic advisors. ""As a senator from New York, I am keenly focused on the impact of these market developments on the lives and livelihoods of thousands of New Yorkers and on the New York economy as a whole. I am also reminded everyday as I meet with families and listen to their stories that the effective function of our market isn't just about Wall Street, it is about Main Street. It's about the families I meet that are struggling to fend off foreclosures and stay in their homes. It's about construction workers who used to build houses and are now out of work. It's about the college student who has good credit but is struggling to get a loan. What is happening on Wall Street may well affect the lives and fortunes of tens of millions of Americans who work hard everyday. They've done nothing wrong, but they will be impacted. ""In these times of stress and uncertainty, we need to be vigilant, to do everything in our power to maintain confidence in our financial system. I feel very strongly that in every way we've got to have more urgency to continue the action that was started yesterday. In my conversations earlier this morning, I raised my concern about the continuing numbers of foreclosures and my very strong belief that in the absence of addressing that aspect of this subprime mortgage credit crisis, we will not be able to make the progress that we have to make. I will follow this closely and as I said, I am particularly concerned about the many employees of Bear Stearns and their families and the ripple through the economy that this is going to cause."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 18, 2008",Hillary's Statement on the Bush Administration's Announcement of More Flexibility Within No Child Left Behind,"Today the Bush Administration took a step forward in addressing the systemic problems in No Child Left Behind through a pilot that will allow 10 states to create more nuanced systems of school accountability. While a small pilot, this is a long overdue step in the right direction. By allowing states to differentiate between schools that need modest improvements and those that are chronically failing, this pilot will provide some much-needed flexibility. This step, however, should be just the beginning. No Child Left Behind is a failed policy that needs fundamental overhaul - not tinkering around the edges. The one-size-fits-all approach of NCLB is simply not working, and today's announcement signals that the Bush Administration is beginning to acknowledge that. As President, I will work with Congress to end the No Child Left Behind Act, and put in its place a more sensible law that stops micromanaging our schools from the federal level and provides real support to struggling schools."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 19, 2008",Hillary Clinton's Statement on the State of Preschool in America,"Today, the National Institute for Early Education Research released its 2006-2007 ""State of Preschool Yearbook,"" the most comprehensive source of information about the state of early childhood education in the U.S. This year's yearbook reveals that state Pre-K programs have grown to the point where they are now serving more than one million students. About 22% of 4-year-olds are being served by state preschool programs, and 15% of three year-olds have access to either state or federal programs, such as Head Start. In addition, the per-pupil funding level for early childhood education has grown for the first time since 2002-2003. Unfortunately, despite the incredible body of research illustrating the profound impact of early childhood investments, 12 states still offer no state-funded preschool education; half of all three-year-olds do not have access to preschool; and only two states met all of NIEER's quality benchmarks. According to NIEER, more than a quarter of American four-year-olds live in states with low pre-K quality standards. The bottom line is of this report is that while we have made a lot of progress in expanding access to early childhood education, we still have tremendous gaps in access and quality, and a great deal of work to do to ensure that every child starts school ready to learn. As President, Hillary will make early childhood education a top priority, as she has throughout her life. During her campaign, she has laid out a bold plan to provide $10 billion to states to enable them to provide quality pre-K for all four year olds and to strengthen state's programs serving children aged zero to five. Hillary has also committed to growing the budget of Head Start to $8 billion by 2010, increasing the number of children served by 200,000, and increasing the quality of and access to child care, through the Child Care Development Block Grant. Hillary began her career at the Children's Defense Fund and served on its board for 16 years. As First Lady, she spearheaded the Administration's efforts to double funding for child care, and grow the budget of Head Start by 90%."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 24, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"Five years after the start of the war in Iraq, there have now been 4,000 U.S. military deaths in Iraq. On this solemn day, we remember the sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. We honor the tens of thousands more who have suffered wounds both visible and invisible, wounds that scar bodies and minds, and hearts as well. We honor the sacrifices of their families, a price paid in empty places at the dinner table, in the struggle to raise children alone, in the wrenching reversal of parents burying children. In the last five years, our soldiers have done everything we asked of them and more. They were asked to remove Saddam Hussein from power and bring him to justice and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqi people the opportunity for free and fair elections and they did. They were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time for political reconciliation, and they did. So for every American soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice for this mission, we should imagine carved in stone: ""They gave their life for the greatest gift one can give to a fellow human being, the gift of freedom."" I recall the great honor of meeting many of our brave men and women who have served our country. In meeting them, I am always struck by how, no matter how great their suffering, no matter how grave their own injuries, they always say the same thing to me: ""Promise that you'll take care of my buddies. They're still over there. Promise you'll keep them safe."" I have looked those men and women in the eye. I have made that promise. And I intend to honor it by bringing a responsible end to this war, and bringing our troops home safely."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"March 25, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Taiwan Election,"I want to extend my congratulations to Ma Ying-jeou for his election as the new president of Taiwan. My congratulations extend to the people of Taiwan for their democratic achievements which have earned them the admiration of the entire international community. The people of Taiwan began direct competitive election of the president in 1996. Since then, the presidency has changed parties twice and voter turnout in this election was impressive, a clear indication of how robust this new democracy is. The friendship between the people of Taiwan and the United States has remained deep as democracy on Taiwan has strengthened. I hope that under President-elect Ma's capable leadership, Taiwan's political institutions will thrive, and that ways can be found to appropriately expand Taiwan's contributions to the international community. Given the statements of Mr. Ma during the campaign and those of the leaders of the People's Republic of China, I would hope that cross-Strait dialogue will be possible, and will contribute significantly to a reduction of tensions in the Taiwan Straits and East Asia. Meanwhile, I want to reaffirm my commitment to the longstanding relevant principles of American policy, including the Three Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act."

McCain's Support for Social Security Privatization,"Hillary Clinton made the following statement at a ""Solutions for the American Economy"" town hall earlier this afternoon in Greensburg, PA: ""Senator McCain said something stunning the other day. He pledged to continue President Bush's attempts to privatize Social Security. He said, and I quote, 'as part of Social Security reform, I believe that private savings accounts are a part of it, along the lines that President Bush proposed.' ""Now, Senator McCain has already promised to continue George Bush's failed Iraq policy, and to make permanent his tax breaks for the wealthy few. Now he's taking up President Bush's assault on Social Security. So in a nutshell, that's John McCain's plan for America - four more years of the same. Well, we cannot afford one more year of the same. ""Now for the life of me, I cannot understand how Senator McCain can find the money for 100 more years in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest, but not for Social Security. And I would never understand why he turned Social Security's guarantee into a stock market gamble for millions of Americans. You don't need to look any further than Bear Stearns and Wall Street lately to know that our workers and seniors simply can't afford the Bush-McCain privatization scheme. ""So my message to Senator McCain is this - Social Security privatization is a bad idea whose time has come and gone, and the American people rejected the Bush privatization plan in 2005 and the American people will reject the Bush-McCain privatization plan in 2008."""

Like President Bush, Senator McCain discounts the warnings of our senior military leadership of the consequences of the Iraq war on the readiness of our armed forces, and on the need to focus on the forgotten front line in Afghanistan. Like President Bush, Senator McCain wants to keep us tied to another country's civil war, and said ""it would be fine with me"" if U.S. troops were in Iraq for 50 or even 100 years.

I read the speech that Senator McCain gave the other day which set forth his plan which does virtually nothing to ease the credit crisis or the housing crisis. It seems like if the phone were ringing, he would just let it ring and ring and ring. ""Senator McCain is a friend of mine and I admire his service to our country greatly. But he recently admitted, ""The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should."" And it turns out he'd rather ignore the credit crisis and mortgage crisis  or blame middle class families instead of offering solutions on their behalf. ""I think we've had enough of a president who didn't know enough about economics, and didn't do enough for the American middle class. I don't think we can afford four more years of that kind of inaction.

Yet while Secretary Jackson's resignation is appropriate, it does nothing to address the Bush Administration's wait-and-don't-see posture to our nation's housing crisis, which is threatening to drive our economy into a painful recession. Now is the time for immediate action, not more half-measures and white papers. While I appreciate the Administration's willingness to acknowledge the need for more regulation of our financial markets, we cannot let a discussion about rearranging the regulatory deck chairs divert us from the fact that our housing and credit markets are in crisis, and are sinking deeper every day that we fail to take aggressive action. That's why today I am outlining immediate steps we can take to shore up the housing and credit markets, restore confidence in our regulatory infrastructure, and keep millions of families in their homes. These include smart, near-term regulatory changes that are calibrated to the actual crisis we face.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 1, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on NATO Summit In Bucharest,"NATO leaders are meeting this week in Bucharest. The meeting will address a number of issues crucial to American security and the future of the alliance, specifically NATO's mission in Afghanistan, expanding peace and stability in Europe through further enlargement, and relations with Russia. ""Today, America needs institutions like NATO as much as ever. We need an alliance that is strong and undivided. One that works together to share burdens in facing the common risks we face in the new century in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, and elsewhere. To build this alliance for the 21st century, we need to strengthen NATO and our relations with Europe, be clear with Russia about our strong differences while pursuing areas of strategic importance, and solidify the alliance to meet new challenges such as the ongoing mission in Afghanistan. ""There are three crucial litmus tests for the success of this week's NATO summit meeting. First, I believe our NATO allies should extend invitations to the three countries in the Western Balkans -- Albania, Croatia, and the Republic of Macedonia - as part of a larger strategy to stabilize the Western Balkans after Kosova's independence. I support those invitations provided these countries fulfill the same requirements met by previous new allies, and hope that outstanding issues are resolved. In the 1990s, NATO opened its doors to new members to help lock in democracy and security in Europe's eastern half, and that work must continue. ""Second, both Georgia and Ukraine have made clear their desire to anchor themselves firmly in the trans-Atlantic community through membership in NATO. Both have made real progress and are seeking an affirmation of Western support through a Membership Action Plan (MAP). I enthusiastically support the extension of MAP to both Ukraine and Georgia in Bucharest. ""Third, the NATO summit must yield tangible benefits for success on the forgotten front line in Afghanistan. Today, we lack a coherent diplomatic strategy and an integrated political, economic, and military plan to prevail. NATO must play its proper role in Afghanistan. Individual nations should move to eliminate restrictions they have placed on their forces operating in Afghanistan. Countries unable to contribute more forces should increase assistance to Afghanistan. ""The other important issue this summit must address is Russia. Here, too, we have failed to craft a strategy that stands up for our values and our interests, while engaging Russia in a serious way on a long list of disagreements. The list of problems that we need to resolve with Russia has gotten far too long. But we will not be able to address them by trying to run Russia out of the G-8, as some have suggested. There is only one way to solve these problems, face to face, with Russia's new leaders hearing the same resolute message from America and its closest allies. ""When America and Europe work together, global objectives are within our means. As President, I will work with allies to finish the job of expanding peace in Europe by anchoring new democracies to the west while orienting NATO to handle challenges outside of Europe. I will forge a new approach to Russia that protects both our values and interests. ""I will work with my European counterparts to create the broader framework that ties together the soft and hard power of NATO and the European Union to create the kind of comprehensive strategies we need. I will make Afghanistan the priority it should have been from the beginning, and provide the leadership and broader strategy required to prevail in that critical conflict. ""Finally, I will build a NATO that is open to and capable of working together with other regional institutions to address new challenges. The next President will have a chance to reach out across the Atlantic to a new generation of leaders. As President, I will reestablish our traditional relationship of confidence and trust with Europe as NATO prepares to mark its 60th anniversary in 2009."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 1, 2008",Hillary Clinton's Statement on Recent Graduation Rate Study,"Today, the America's Promise Alliance released a special report called ""Cities in Crisis: A Special Analytic Report on High Schools in Crisis."" This report highlights a pressing problem facing our nation  millions of young people are not completing high school on time, a situation that has serious ramifications for their future and our nation's economic competitiveness. According to the report, conventional wisdom says that 85% of students finish high school on time when in fact only 70% do nationwide. And this nationwide statistic disguises the reality for millions of young people living in our major cities. The graduation rate in America's 50 largest cities is 51.8%. On average, there is a 17-point gap between the graduation rate in cities and in their neighboring suburbs. This report illustrates the stark inequities between students who live geographically close but worlds apart from one another. ""Hillary has called the drop-out rate a crisis of untapped potential. In February, she put forth a bold plan to cut the drop-out rate in half among students of color. Hillary's plan would provide $500 million in financial incentives to attract and retain excellent teachers and school leaders in high-need areas, adopt a standard system for measuring the high-school graduation rate so that we can accurately measure the progress being made, and invest in innovative programs, such as early college high schools and multiple pathways to graduation. Hillary will also invest in efforts to identify at-risk students early on and track their progress in order to give them mentors and other interventions that can keep them on track. She'll also encourage states to align their P-16 curriculum with the state's education standards and workforce expectations, so that children can move from one grade to the next with the skills needed to succeed beyond high school. And she'll start early, by expanding Head Start and creating universal Pre-K for all four years old, to enable all students to start school ready to learn.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 2, 2008",Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton On World Autism Awareness Day,"I am pleased to join the United Nations in recognizing the inaugural World Autism Awareness Day. Today offers us the opportunity to reaffirm a commitment to addressing the need for increased treatment, services, and research into autism spectrum disorders. In the United States and other countries, we have seen a rise in the number of individuals diagnosed with autism. Throughout my time in public service, I have met with families who have shared their experiences in dealing with autism, and trying to seek the best possible care for their loved ones with the disorder. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 150 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder. In order to respond to these increases, we need to have a commensurate investment in services and programs for individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities. I also believe that we should increase our efforts to research autism, so that we better understand the causes and the best treatments for this condition. In November, I announced a comprehensive plan to address autism. My plan provides nearly $1 billion over five years for autism research, surveillance, awareness, and early identification. I will create an Autism Task Force charged with investigating evidence-based treatments, interventions, and services. We need to know what works and start investing in those efforts. I will also expand access to post-diagnosis care so that once children have been identified as autistic, they receive appropriate evidence-based treatment immediately. No child should experience a delay in receiving services that can improve his or her quality of life. But too often today, children are forced to wait for months for care. I'll also provide funding to school districts and universities to train teachers and other health and social services professionals in how to work most effectively with autistic children, since the number of children with autism in our public schools has skyrocketed in recent years. I'll make sure every young person has a transition plan before they leave high school. I will also ensure that both children and adults with autism have access to the services they need - including housing, transportation, employment - to live rich and full lives. In all, I will commit $500 million annually to provide services to improve the quality of life for all people living with autism. This plan builds on my work in the Senate to help individuals and families impacted by autism. Last year, I introduced the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act, which would increase the availability of effective treatment, services and interventions for both children and adults living with autism. I was also a cosponsor of the Combating Autism Act, and have worked to secure funding for the research programs authorized by that act. I hope that today's commemoration will once again allow us to highlight the needs of children, adults, and families impacted by autism, and I look forward to working to continue to raise awareness about autism spectrum disorders."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 3, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Troubling Reports on Airline Safety and Regulation,"The following statement was delivered by Senator Clinton at a press availability in Burbank, California this afternoon: ""I want to start by talking about a very troubling development that has come to light in regard to airline safety and regulation. This week we are learning a number of very problematic things about airline safety and about the Federal Aviation Administration's approach to policing the airline industry. Southwest Airlines has a lot to answer for. We now have a report that Southwest flew dozens of planes thousands of times even though it knew full well that they had not been inspected. When the inspectors showed up and the inspections happened, we learned that some of these planes had potentially dangerous cracks in their skin."" ""The FAA has clearly displayed a dangerous and cavalier lack of regard for tough safety enforcement. That is all too familiar with this administration. For years it appears that FAA personnel knew that Southwest has had safety compliance problems but looked the other way, and then suppressed efforts to bring these problems to light by trying to strong-arm whistleblowers. More broadly, it is becoming very evident that the FAA is too cozy with the industry it regulates. We've seen this story before with lax oversight and enforcement of consumer safety for products, food and drugs. How many times and in how many ways will the Bush administration policies put the American people's safety at risk? I believe it's the first order of government to ensure the safety of our citizens and when I am president, I am going to take swift steps to protect the flying public."" ""Here's what I would do: First, I would appoint an administration and senior management team that is committed to safety as the core mission of the FAA. I will direct senior leadership to develop regular reporting channels so that any inspector anywhere in the chain can bring safety problems to light. One of the failures we've seen is that serious issues get trapped in the FAA bureaucracy or they are stifled by lower level managers."" ""Second, I'll close the revolving door between industry and the FAA. Senior inspectors should not be leaving their posts one day and joining the airlines they regulate the next day. I know the FAA is now talking about a cooling off period, but they need to do more than talk  they need to act and act now to end these cozy relationships. I propose closing the revolving door for cabinet officials; none of them will be allowed to lobby my administration after they leave it and I think we should extend that into other areas of the government, as well."" ""Third, I will increase the size of the inspection force which has not kept up with a growing de-regulated industry. I'll make sure that we hire and train enough air traffic controllers to meet our needs. We cannot inspect our way to safety; we need shared responsibility between the FAA and the airlines. But inspectors are a vital part of the equation and we have been neglecting our inspection force. Congress has been fighting the administration. Every year President Bush asks for less money for the FAA than Congress provided the year before. Every year, Congress tells the president he needs to devote more resources to airline safety. As president, I will provide funding to hire more inspectors, and I'll make sure the FAA has the necessary funding to hire and train enough air traffic controllers to meet our needs as members of the public."" ""Fourth, I'll reinvigorate the practice of having independent national audit teams double-checking the work done by the inspectors assigned to the airlines. Inspectors develop close working relationships with their assigned airlines. In some ways, this is healthy because it improves cooperation. It can become unhealthy when inspectors agree to overlook or wink at safety problems. That's why we need another check and national audit team for the answer. I'll increase the practice of rotating inspectors to promote arms length dealing while still preserving productive relationships."" ""Finally, I will work for and sign into law an Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights  the Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights is long overdue. My home state of New York passed a very sensible law that would require air carriers to take care of passengers stranded for hours on the tarmac. A court struck it down and said the federal government had to act. When I am president, the federal government will act. I have co-sponsored Senator Boxer's bill that requires all air carriers to provide passengers with adequate food, water and restroom facilities. Doesn't seem like a lot to ask. And an option for passengers to deplane after they have been stranded on a plane for three hours or more. This is one example as to why we need a president who is ready on Day One to manage the economy."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 3, 2008",Senator Clinton's Statement On Jobless Claims,"Today's dismal jobless claims report is a reminder that we are in the midst of a growing economic crisis and Senator McCain has yet to answer the call of economic leadership. Americans need a president who understands the complex challenges our economy faces  from lagging employment to record gas prices to a housing and credit crisis which threaten to drive us into a painful and deep recession. Senator McCain has already admitted that he doesn't know much about economics, and he is proving that point on the campaign trail. His plan for the housing crisis is simply not to have one. I've been trying to deliver a wake up call to the Administration on the housing crisis for more than a year. I have the most aggressive plan to help homeowners of any candidate in this race  including $30 billion in emergency assistance for families and communities to fight foreclosures. And I believe the government should stand ready to go further and temporarily purchase at-risk mortgages to help unfreeze the mortgage markets and keep millions of families in their homes."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 4, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement On March Jobs Report,"Today's news that unemployment jumped to 5.1% in March and that our economy lost jobs for the third straight month adds to the mounting evidence that our economy is spiraling downward, and that hardworking families are paying the price. It's time the President and John McCain recognize the r-word: reality. Our economy is in serious trouble and unless we act swiftly we could be sliding into a deep and painful recession. When Wall Street faced crisis, we saw swiftly and creative action and a $30 billion lifeline for Bear Stearns. Today's jobs report confirms that it's time to take equally aggressive action to help American families struggling in our bearish economy. For more than a year I have been like Paulette Revere, calling for action to keep the problems from our housing market from spilling over into our economy. After a year of denial and half-measures it is time for this Administration to put ideology aside and get serious about stemming this crisis. Perhaps this jobs report will also help John McCain recognize that doing nothing is not an economic strategy in times of urgent need. While I support the legislative approach that Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank are taking to help restructure mortgages and keep millions of families in their homes, today's news of serious continued weakness in our labor markets reinforces that we need to be ready to go further. I believe we must stand ready for the government to purchase at risk mortgages. We also need a second stimulus of at least $30 billion to help states and localities fight the foreclosure crisis in their communities."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 4, 2008",Statement by Senator Clinton on Zimbabwe,"The coming days will determine whether Zimbabwe moves toward a bright future, or sees its hopes turned back through violent repression. It is an anxious, uncertain moment, yet also potentially a historic opportunity for this long-suffering country. The very real, disturbing possibility exists of a coerced, fake electoral re-run and, alternatively, of martial law. Strong international pressure is needed now to reduce the possibility of these outcomes. As the author of the Support for Democracy and Human Rights in Zimbabwe Act of 2007, I have been a strong supporter of democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe. I call upon the Zimbabwe Election Commission to immediately provide an accurate and public accounting of the results of the election. The world is watching Zimbabwe, and the will of that country's brave people must not be ignored. Foreign governments, including Zimbabwe's neighbors and others outside the region, must send an unequivocal message to President Mugabe not to interfere with the electoral process or with the activities of opposition parties, and to end intimidation of the press at once. Delayed reports of electoral results and news of an unprecedented round-up of foreign journalists have raised fears of vote tampering and an imminent crackdown. A true and final presidential vote count must be released without further delay, and these results need to be reviewed openly so that independent observers can help to verify them. The international community must be vigilant in ensuring that the current impasse is resolved and does not degenerate into violent repression. The surrounding region -- especially South Africa and the regional body, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) -- and the African Union leadership must stand up clearly and forthrightly against tyranny in their midst. The United States and other nations must send a firm message to President Mugabe that repression and manipulation to hold on to power will not be tolerated, and that the regime and individuals responsible will be held accountable. My thoughts and prayers are with those who are bravely standing up for democracy and with the reporters who have been detained and their families."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 4, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Compensation for Guamanians for World War II Suffering,"As a senator, I have supported the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act (H.R 1595), a bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The legislation would implement the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission regarding claims of residents of Guam injured when the territory was under the military control of Imperial Japan during World War II. I will continue to advocate for Senate passage of the bill this year, and its enactment into law. But, if those efforts are not successful, as President of the United States, I will get it passed next year so that we may provide these survivors and their families with the compensation they deserve for their courageous devotion to the United States during Japanese occupation. By the time that the United States liberated Guam in July 1944, almost all of the island's inhabitants had been interned, and many had been subjected to forced labor, forced marches, personal injuries, rape, or public execution. Although Guamanians received limited compensation immediately after the war, the restrictive procedures, narrow window for recovery, and incomplete range of compensable injuries left too many under-compensated. As the Commission concluded, their claims were not treated comparably to U.S. citizens or nationals of other territories who suffered disproportionate hardships during World War II. The bill would remedy that decades-old injustice. The bill I support has four components. 1. It would recognize the injuries endured by the people of Guam during the occupation and their steadfast loyalty to the United States. 2. It would compensate Guam's residents for specific harms. 3. It would authorize a grant program for research, educational, and media activities to memorialize the occupation of Guam. 4. It would authorize $130 million for the grant program and compensation. The legislation is particularly timely in light of the agreement between the United States and Japan to relocate the headquarters of the III Marine Expeditionary Force and 8,000 U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014. As a result of the move, Guam will play an even more vital role as a U.S. military staging area to the Asian theater than it has in the past. The U.S. citizens of Guam deserve to know that their assistance in the nation's defense will be accompanied by a robust commitment to protect the island and compensate its residents fairly for any harm they may suffer."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 7, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Olympics,"The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for Presidential leadership. These events underscore why I believe the Bush administration has been wrong to downplay human rights in its policy towards China. At this time, and in light of recent events, I believe President Bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in Beijing, absent major changes by the Chinese government. I encourage the Chinese to take advantage of this moment as an opportunity to live up to universal human aspirations of respect for human rights and unity, ideals that the Olympic games have come to represent. Americans will stand strong in support of freedom of religious and political expression and human rights. Americans will also stand strong and root for the success of American athletes who have worked hard and earned the right to compete in the Olympic Games of 2008."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 7, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"Senator McCain's Groundhog Day approach to Iraq means four more years of the Bush-Cheney-McCain policy of continuing to police a civil war while the threats to our national security, our economy, and our standing in the world mount. We simply cannot give the Iraqi government an endless blank check. It is time to end this war as quickly, as responsibly, and as safely as possible. That has been my mission in the Senate and it will be my mission starting on day one as President."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 7, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement,"I am disappointed that President Bush has decided to send the Colombia Free Trade Agreement to Congress. As I have said consistently for several months, I oppose signing any trade deal with Colombia while violence against trade unionists continues and the perpetrators are not brought to justice. The United States should be pursuing trade agreements that promote human rights and worker rights, not overlook egregious abuses. I will vote against the President's Colombia trade agreement, and will urge my Senate colleagues to do the same."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 9, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on the ICE Halloween Party Cover-Up,"Today the House Committee on Homeland Security released a report that found evidence of a cover-up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) senior officials, including Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for ICE Julie Myers, relating to evidence of racist and inappropriate activities during a Halloween party attended by these officials. Senator Clinton issued the following statement: ""I continue to be appalled about the inappropriate and racially insensitive activities that took place within our nation's highest immigration enforcement entity, and am outraged that there was an effort to cover these incidents up. I have consistently called for a change of tone in the immigration debate and this incident points to the urgent need for that to happen. When the officials who are in charge of enforcing immigration laws display these kinds of prejudice, they become part of the problem instead of part of the solution. It's time for this Administration to hold its public servants accountable."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 9, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Bush Mortgage Plan,"After weeks of ignoring and downplaying my calls for action, the Bush Administration is finally acknowledging the need to help more struggling families restructure their mortgages and stay in their homes. But their proposal today simply underscores how out-of-touch they are with the magnitude of our economic challenges. In the face of an historic housing crisis, they're offering half-measures that could actually do more harm than good by prolonging the crisis and forcing even more expansive action down the road. The Bush administration needs to take off its ideological blinders and get serious about real solutions. We need to employ the same creativity and commitment to helping Main Street that we have already employed to help Wall Street. For over a year, I've been raising concerns about the growing problems in our housing market and calling on the Administration to take more aggressive action. The Administration's response has followed an unfortunate pattern: they initially dismiss my calls, then drag their feet, and then, many months and thousands of foreclosures later, acknowledges the need to act but put forward completely inadequate solutions. We saw this with my call for a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures; we saw it with my call for a voluntary freeze on subprime interest rates. And today we're seeing it with my call to more aggressively help restructure mortgages to keep families in their homes. I've put forward a set of proactive, pragmatic solutions that actually respond to the magnitude of the crisis we face. I support Sen. Dodd and Rep. Frank's efforts to expand the FHA to help millions of at-risk homeowners. But I think we need to be ready to go further, and have the government buy up troubled mortgages if that's what it will take. We also need a second stimulus focused on housing, with at least $30 billion to help states and localities fight foreclosures in their communities. And we should amend our bankruptcy rules to give judges more discretion to help troubled homeowners and clarify the legal liability of mortgage servicers who act to help families stay in their homes."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 10, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement On Sen. McCain's Housing Plan,"Senator McCain is apparently of two minds on the housing crisis and neither seems to know how to steward the economy effectively. Just two weeks ago, Senator McCain said he'd rather do nothing than something about the housing crisis and attacked my plan with tired right-wing talking points. Today, it looks like he's proposing a warmed over, half-hearted version of the very plan he criticized, to help families restructure mortgages to save homes and keep housing prices from falling further. Apparently, Senator McCain got the message: letting the phone simply ring and ring is not the way to respond to economic crises. So now he's changed positions and is finally responding to a housing crisis that has been going on for months, but unfortunately his actions are only half-measures. This is all part of a pattern. Senator McCain admitted not knowing enough about economics. He can't keep his own position on Social Security straight. And now he's shown himself to be dangerously inconsistent on addressing our nation's housing crisis. For eight years, we've had a President who didn't know enough or care enough to do enough on behalf of the middle class. With a credit crisis, a home mortgage crisis, and an economy facing a potentially deep and painful recession, we can't afford four more years of more of the same. At a time of economic crisis and uncertainty, Americans need a President with a steady hand and steady positions, not someone whose economic positions are as unpredictable as our troubled economy itself."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 10, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on the Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement,"Today we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the historic Good Friday Agreement, which paved the way to peace in Northern Ireland. On this anniversary, I salute the brave and tireless efforts of the parties to the agreement -- and especially the people of Northern Ireland -- and I pledge my continued commitment to promoting a lasting and prosperous peace. I know well how difficult it was to secure the Good Friday Agreement; how much work and sacrifice it took on all sides to bring about the peace; and how much effort has gone into implementing its tenets and building a new government in Northern Ireland. Ultimately, the real credit for peace can only go to the brave people of Northern Ireland, as well as the leaders of Ireland and the U.K. But I also know that helping to advance the peace process and to achieve the Good Friday Agreement is one of my husband's proudest accomplishments as President. And I too am proud to have played a role in that effort. In the Senate, I have continued to work on behalf of the peace process, providing whatever support and assistance I can to the stakeholders on all sides. And when I am President, I will continue my deep commitment to Northern Ireland. I will appoint a White House special envoy and lend my personal offices to promote lasting peace and reconciliation and to support the Northern Ireland government. I will pursue diplomatic engagement and robust economic partnerships. And my administration will strengthen the ties between the governments of the United States and all of Ireland, as well as our peoples."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 10, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on President Bush's Address on Iraq,"Today, President Bush delivered yet another address on Iraq - but we've heard enough speeches that are long on promises, short on facts. And the fact is, there will probably be more troops in Iraq after the surge than before the surge. Iraq has barely moved toward political reconciliation, meeting only a few of the benchmarks set out by the Bush Administration at the start of the surge. And violence has once again spiked in Baghdad and Basra. On Tuesday, I asked General Petraeus when he came before the Senate Armed Services Committee what conditions would mean we should change course, given that the surge has failed to achieve political reconciliation. He did not answer. Yesterday I called on President Bush to answer the question General Petraeus did not. But the President refuses to face reality. I want to commend President Bush for agreeing to cut the length of deployments from 15 to 12 months. But it is deeply unfortunate that the President only made this change when the strain he placed on our forces required it. Now, once again President Bush is asking Americans for time and patience - but the American people are saying he's had enough of both. Our troops have done all that's been asked of them and more. It's time for the President to answer the question being asked of him: in the wake of the failed surge, what is the endgame in Iraq? As President, I will do what this president has failed to do: recognize reality and end the war responsibly."

Now that the Administration has been forced to acknowledge global warming as a problem, they have put forward a proposal that looks like it was written by Dick Cheney's energy task force. The President's proposal is not to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but to actually allow them to continue to grow until 2025. Global warming is an urgent problem that demands a bold response that will actually reduce emissions, not allow them to continue to increase for nearly 20 more years. I have proposed a comprehensive, bold plan to reduce global warming. My plan will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 through a market-based, cap-and-trade system in order to avoid the most dire impacts of global warming. I will also act immediately to develop a post-Kyoto treaty with a goal of having one in place by the end of 2009.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 18, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Georgia and Ukraine,"I am deeply disturbed by the latest Russian actions regarding Georgia, and Russia's broader policies towards its neighbors. Several weeks ago I called on NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia and Ukraine at the Bucharest Summit. I emphasized that this move would be a litmus test for the success of President Bush's leadership of the trans-Atlantic community. My support for MAP was based on the need to send a positive signal to Tbilisi and Kyiv to encourage them to stay on track with their positive reforms as well as to send a signal of our concern to Moscow about the future security of these countries. I deeply regret President Bush's inability to convince our NATO allies to take this action. This is the first time in memory a U.S. President has traveled to a NATO summit and failed to achieve his publicly proclaimed goals. Now the Russian government has taken advantage of the lack of unity coming out of the Bucharest Summit to further ratchet up the pressure on young democracies on its borders. Moscow's actions this week to strengthen ties with the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia undermine the territorial integrity of the state of Georgia and are clearly designed to destabilize the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili. Georgia is a small democratic state in a turbulent region. It must not be allowed to be undermined. Two weeks ago President Bush sat with President Putin in Sochi just a few kilometers away from the Georgian border. He prided himself on his close working relationship with Vladimir Putin. President Bush should call on the Russian leadership to immediately rescind these steps. I also call on President Bush to immediately send a senior representative to Tbilisi to show our support for the government of Georgia. The United States should raise this matter in the United Nations Security Council, in a special 26+1 session of NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC), and in the NATO-Russia Council. Russia needs to hear a unified message from the United States and our European partners about our shared commitment to Georgia's security and territorial integrity. These are not the only Russian moves that I have found troubling. Senior Russian officials have engaged in a pressure campaign to prevent Ukraine from seeking deeper ties with NATO. President Putin even raised the prospect of retargeting nuclear missiles against Ukraine. I am not advocating, nor do I envisage, a return to a new Cold War with Russia, which I believe ought to remain in the G-8, where the United States and its allies can together address our growing list of concerns with Moscow. But the current Administration's mishandling of Russian relations has contributed to Moscow's belief that it can do as it pleases. America and its allies can and must do better."

""Even forty years after the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, women only receive .77 cents for every dollar men earn, and the gap is significantly more for women of color. In Pennsylvania, women who work full time earn 74.8 percent of what men earn. In Indiana, its 72.6, and in North Carolina women earn 79.7 to each dollar earned by men. On average, families forfeit $4,000 a year because women don't receive equal pay for equal work. I am a proud sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will toughen penalties in enforcing the provisions of the Equal Pay Act and help realize the promise of pay equity. ""There are heroines standing up for equal pay for equal work.

""As the voters in Pennsylvania go to the polls today, the wage gap is a stark reminder of what is at stake in this election. As President, I will continue to work for pay equity because it's not a woman's issue, it is a fairness issue and it is a family issue."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 22, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Earth Day,"On Earth Day, we embrace our responsibility to each other and to future generations: every one of us, from the President in the White House to children in schools to CEOs in boardrooms can help protect the environment and save our planet. That is the spirit that gives this day meaning. That is the call to citizenship that will help us solve the climate crisis and meet other threats to our environment. And that is why it is so important we elect a new president who will boldly and immediately set a new course. When I am president, our nation will lead the world to tackle the climate crisis - and lead the global economy in new clean energy industries. I have a plan to promote energy independence, address global warming, and transform our economy by creating five million new jobs. I will reduce global warming emissions by 80% below 1990 levels and establish a market-based cap-and-trade system to efficiently allocate pollution permits. I will cut foreign oil imports by two-thirds from 2030 projected levels, more than 10 million barrels per day; raise fuel efficiency standards to 55 miles per gallon by 2030; invest $150 billion in renewable, alternative energy; and ensure that 25% of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2025. I will end the Bush Administration's assault on environmental protections and standards. And climate researchers in our government will no longer be silenced - their results manipulated - to adhere to a radical ideological agenda. It will be a new day. But meeting these big environmental challenges will take both new leadership and renewed citizenship. I encourage all Americans to find ways in their own lives to reduce their carbon footprints, to conserve energy, to protect greenspace in their communities, and to take other steps to safeguard our planet. We are all stewards of this Earth, and we must all be part of the solution."

I am particularly disappointed that Senator McCain skipped the vote on this important legislation, and indicated that he would not have supported it had he been there. ""Senator McCain has yet again fallen in line with President Bush while middle class families are falling by the wayside. Senator McCain would rather pass laws to cut corporate taxes by $100 billion more - than pass laws to protect the civil rights of women earning thousands less than their male counterparts. Women are earning less but Senator McCain is offering more of the same. ""As president, I will never waver in my support for equal pay for equal work. I'm proud to be the sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would increase sanctions for violating the Equal Pay Act and provide stronger protections for women whose rights have been violated. I think it's long past time we put equal pay at the top of the national legislative agenda, to demonstrate that as a nation, we value the skill, talent and hard work of every American, including every American woman."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 25, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement On World Malaria Day,"Today, on the first-ever World Malaria Day, we are reminded of the global tragedy that every thirty seconds a child in Africa dies of malaria. We have the tools to stop these deaths, and to protect and treat children and their families across the world who go to bed every night fearing that they are one mosquito bite away from despair and devastation. That is why in November, 2007, I unveiled an ambitious plan to combat malaria and the poverty that results from debilitating and deadly infectious diseases. My plan includes $1 billion per year to address malaria infection in Africa, with the goal of stamping out malaria deaths in Africa altogether by the end of my second term. I was pleased to see that this commitment was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives last month when it approved a five-year, $1 billion a year, investment in malaria for the first time ever as part of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also included $5 billion over 5 years for malaria in their version of the reauthorization, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to help bring the resources to bear upon this epidemic. We need a comprehensive assault on malaria, which needlessly kills more than 1 million people each year and consumes 40% of public health expenditures in many African countries. Combating malaria is also critical to strengthening health infrastructures and effectively combating AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases. If we act boldly, we can win the fight against malaria. We can end the needless death and suffering of millions and move toward the long-term goal of completely eradicating malaria from the planet. And by raising hope, opportunity and human dignity for millions, we can help restore America's moral leadership around the world."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 25, 2008",Statement by Senator Clinton on Recent Developments Regarding North Korea,"The Bush Administration's refusal to meet or negotiate seriously with North Korea in its first five years has been enormously costly to our national security. During those years, it is estimated the North produced enough plutonium for up to ten nuclear bombs. It conducted its first nuclear test. It has continued its proliferation activities, including as we have learned in recent press reports, helping Syria build a nuclear reactor. We must remain vigilant about Syria. The nature of its nuclear cooperation with North Korea strongly suggests an intention to acquire nuclear weapons. That is unacceptable, and the United States must work closely with the IAEA, countries of the Middle East, and others in the international community to make sure that never happens. <>North Korea's nuclear weapons program must be terminated. The Bush administration's efforts were not only late in starting they are still incomplete. A much better and more robust agreement was available at the beginning of President Bush's term. Nevertheless, that is not a reason to withdraw support for the ongoing negotiations. Pyongyang must make a full and accurate accounting of its nuclear activities, and the Bush administration must push much harder for them to do so in a verifiable manner. At the end of the day, North Korea has to establish a credible track record that can only come through the voluntary declaration of all its nuclear activities. As President, I will work with the members of the six-party talks to ensure that Pyongyang fulfills its commitment to completely and verifiably eliminate its nuclear weapon programs, and stop proliferation. These will be prerequisites for normalized relations with the United States."

Obama about the oil industry. ""Earlier today my opponent attacked me on energy issues. He claimed he would take on the special interests. But we've heard him say that before, but he voted, which I think is always the way to figure out where somebody truly stands. My late father used to say 'watch what they do, not what they say' and that 'actions speak louder than words.'"" ""When it came time to stand up against the oil companies and stand against Dick Cheney's energy bill, my opponent voted for it and I voted against it. And that bill had billions of dollars in giveaways to the oil companies. It was the best bill that the energy companies could buy. ""I know that my opponent has run ads claiming that he does not take money from oil companies. Well no one does. It's illegal. It's been illegal for 100 years to take money from oil companies."" ""Then my opponent puts up an ad saying he doesn't take money from oil company PACs. In March, he took more money from oil company executives than any candidate, Republican or Democrat. So I think it's important for you to know the facts."" Here is additional background on Sen. Obama's attacks earlier today: http://facts.hillaryhub.com/archive/?id=7318"
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 29, 2008",Statement by Senator Clinton on Senator McCain's Health Care Proposals,"Today, Senator McCain announced new details to his health care plan that do little to make up for the fundamental flaws in his approach to health care. Senator Clinton issued the following statement: ""John McCain is proposing a radical plan that would mean millions of Americans would lose their job-based coverage: The McCain plan eliminates the policies that hold the employer-based health insurance system together, so while people might have a 'choice' of getting such coverage , employers would have no incentive to provide it. This means 158 million Americans with job-based coverage today could be at risk of losing the insurance they have come to depend upon. ""While Senator McCain touts the choices his plan offers, people who are older or sicker would actually have no choice under his new proposals. Older Americans or those with pre-existing conditions would be allowed to get only one type of coverage in a high risk GAP pool. That kind of arrangement does more to help insurers than individuals. In addition, high-risk pools fall far short of helping people in need. Virtually all high-risk pools today have waiting lists, high premiums, and scaled-back benefits. The millions of vulnerable Americans who lose employer-based coverage could have to wait months, maybe years, to access the GAP high-risk pools, if they are like the pools that exist today. To top it off, Senator McCain has offered no straight talk on how he would pay for these initiatives."" ""I am proud of the fact that I'm the only candidate in this race who has a health care plan that ensures quality, affordable coverage for all Americans. It is the right thing to do, but it is also the best way to lower costs for all Americans. It is past time that America address the health care crisis - not offer bandaids, or radical plans that undermine people's coverage - but real solutions. And that is what I will do as President."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"April 30, 2008","Hillary Clinton Statement on ""Cover the Uninsured Week""","During this year's sixth annual Cover the Uninsured Week, we are reminded of the 47 million Americans who do not have access to quality, affordable health insurance, as well as those who are just a pink slip away from losing the coverage they have and those who are struggling to pay for their health care bills. Premiums have almost doubled since 2000, and today medical bills contribute to 50 percent of all personal bankruptcies. As President, I will make achieving universal health care my top domestic priority. Under my American Health Choices Plan, I will lower costs, improve quality, and cover every single American. Cover the Uninsured Week, a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and its many sponsors, encourages people to participate in events to raise awareness about the millions of people without health insurance and promote solutions for providing care for the uninsured. Improving our health care system has been a life long passion of mine, and I welcome the efforts of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and others to raise the profile of this issue. As First Lady, I helped create the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and I have worked to protect and expand the program as a U.S. Senator. It is unconscionable that in the richest country in the world, in this day and age, some people die because they do not have health insurance. As President, I will work to guarantee that every single one of us has access to quality care that is affordable. Under my plan, all Americans will have access to health care - no one will be left out. People who are satisfied with their current health care plans can keep them unchanged. Those who do not have coverage or are unsatisfied with their current plan will be able to choose from the same options available to Members of Congress or opt into a public plan option similar to Medicare, in a new national insurance pool. People who can't afford health care will receive a generous refundable tax credit so that their premiums never exceed a small percentage of their income, and small businesses will receive a tax credit for providing insurance to their employees. I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against people based on age, race, gender, or other risk factors like pre-existing conditions. And under my plan, insurance will be portable - people will not lose their coverage if they change or lose jobs. I have a plan to reduce costs throughout our health care system that includes making it a condition of doing business with the federal government that health plans cover high-priority preventive services. I have also proposed modernizing our health care system through the use of electronic medical records, which will make it easier for patients to access their medical information and could, according to one estimate, result in system-wide savings of tens of billions of dollars. To improve the quality of care, I have proposed establishing an independent public-private Best Practices Institute that will finance comparative effectiveness research so that health care providers and patients can access the treatments and medicines that work best. I will also provide funding for research that will provide health care professionals with additional methods to obtain the information they need to better serve their patients. I'm proud to be the only candidate in the presidential race to have a universal health care plan. In order to cover all of the uninsured people in our country, we must bring every stakeholder to the table. That is why my plan is based on shared responsibility. Efforts such as Cover the Uninsured Week encourage people to reach out to their neighbors and their communities to develop solutions and do what Americans do best by coming together and working toward a common goal."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 1, 2008",Statement Of Hillary Clinton On Asian Pacific American Heritage Month,"It is with great enthusiasm that we celebrate May as Asian Pacific Heritage month  Lighting the Past, Present and Future. Since the late 1700s, Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have come from all over Asia and the Pacific Islands with the hopes and dreams of building a better life for themselves and their families. AAPI have played an important role in building our nation and I am pleased to celebrate the leadership, diversity, and harmony of this community and extend my gratitude to AAPIs for their sacrifices and contributions to enriching the lives of all Americans."" ""This year, Americans of all backgrounds, including AAPIs, have become engaged in the political process in record numbers. Through my travels around the country, I have had the fortunate opportunity to meet with AAPIs around the country from Iowa to Texas to California, Nevada and Pennsylvania. I have been honored and grateful to have the support of the AAPI community, especially many elected officials, business, and community leaders."" ""While AAPIs have achieved much for their families and the communities in which they live, I recognize there are still many issues confronting this community. That is why I have worked so closely with the AAPI community to promote policies that address the community's needs. Just last week, I was proud to be on the Senate floor to cast a vote for legislation that would restore veterans' benefits to the brave Filipino veterans who were called into service and fought under the United States flag during World War II. "" ""It is also important to acknowledge and honor the fact that, like the fabric that makes up America, the AAPI community is not monolithic  not only is it the fastest-growing community in the country, it is one of our most diverse. Like many Americans, many in the AAPI community face tremendous challenges due to a lack of access to quality, affordable health care. That is why I have proposed a truly universal health care plan that is based on the principles of shared responsibility and choice and address the issues of health disparities, cultural competency, and language barriers. Under my health care proposal small businesses would receive a tax credit for providing health care to their employees. This is important to the AAPI community that has one of the highest numbers of small business owners."" ""The state of the economy is important to all Americans, including the AAPI community, and we need to do more to help middle class families struggling to pay for everything from increased gas prices to college costs. That is why I have proposed tax cuts that would save families thousands of dollars who are struggling to pay for health care, college costs, or the care for an elderly parent or disabled child. It would also help families who are saving for a secure retirement. The cuts would provide middle class families with at least $100 billion in tax relief per year. I also have a plan that would create millions of new, good-paying green collar jobs that would not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil but strengthen our economy."" ""But we can only make our economy stronger with an educated workforce. While many AAPIs have succeeded in attaining higher education, I am fully aware that others in the AAPI community continue to struggle to reach these same achievements. For that reason I will continue to strongly advocate for making college affordable and accessible and propose universal pre-school education for all our nation's children. ""During APA Heritage month we are reminded that we must fix our broken immigration system that is separating AAPI families. Last year, during the debate on comprehensive immigration reform, I offered an amendment to address the backlog of family visas. I will continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that brings families together."" ""I recognize that many Americans including AAPIs continue to face discrimination in society and at the work place. Throughout my career, I have hired staff members who reflect America's diversity, including AAPIs. I am proud that over 20 percent of my campaign staff is AAPI. As President, I will ensure that AAPIs have a strong voice and role in my administration."" ""Finally, I will strive to restore America's standing in the world, and part of that is standing up for human rights and combating human trafficking."" ""While we celebrate the contributions and the achievements of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders this May, let us remember those among us who continue to struggle and commit to address the challenges facing the AAPI community and all Americans."""

I am also committed to continue working to end the demagoguery and divisiveness that has too often marked the immigration debate so that we can bring the American people together to achieve the reform we so badly need. ""I am proud to have been one of only two co-sponsors of Senator Kennedy's original comprehensive reform legislation back in 2004. I believe that reform must include -- as essential ingredients-- a strengthening of our border security, greater cross-cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to our state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar. ""Along with these changes, I believe we must repair those broken portions of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas.

Yet even these record results fell short of Wall Street expectations, and caused Exxon's stock to fall as a result. In reaction to this news, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:  ""There is something seriously wrong with our economy when Exxon's record $11 billion in quarterly profits are seen as a disappointment by Wall Street. This is truly Dick Cheney's wonderland. ""But on Main Street, middle class families are facing devastating choices every day between buying groceries and filling up their gas tanks to get to work. They are being squeezed by a vice grip of record high gas prices, record declines in housing values and an economy that is shedding jobs and tumbling into recession."" ""I believe these families need immediate relief. That's why I have called for making Exxon and other oil companies with record profits pay the federal gas tax this summer. Now, Senator Obama doesn't believe in any kind of gas tax holiday. And Senator McCain doesn't want to pay for one. I believe we should impose a windfall profits tax on big oil companies and use that money to suspend the gas tax and give families relief at the pump. They typical family could get $70 in relief, and families that drive more for work could get even more. Truckers will get a $50 break every time they fill up their tanks. ""At the same time, we need to set a new course for our long term energy strategy, and move away from oil and towards new sources of clean energy.

""Our brave young men and women in uniform risk their lives to protect this country, and yet the response to TBI - which has been called the signature injury of the Iraq war - has been virtually invisible. This is truly a dereliction of duty. "" ""When our young men and women sign up to serve our country, we sign up to serve them. We need a President who will stand up for our servicemembers and veterans. ""In the Senate, I have been working to ensure that all of our wounded servicemembers and veterans receive the health care and the assistance that they need and deserve. I have passed legislation to require the Department of Defense to implement a screening protocol for Traumatic Brain Injury within 180 days, to require research on servicemembers with TBI to monitor for signs of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegeneration, and to improve the transition from DoD to VA care to prevent wounded servicemembers, including those with TBI, from getting caught in bureaucracy and red tape. And along with Senator Bayh, I have introduced the TBI Access to Options Act, which calls for a one-year medical extension to allow soldiers suffering from TBI to retain active duty status, which provides them increased access to cognitive rehabilitation therapy."" ""When I am President, I will build on my Senate work to ensure that we provide nothing but the best for those who have risked their lives for us. I will hold the VA accountable for ensuring that we are doing right by our veterans with TBI. As President, I will ensure that all veterans have access to quality, affordable health care and mental health care and that we fully fund the VA so that it has the capacity to avoid backlogs and to handle greater enrollments. I will work to provide fast-track training for new claims specialists and expand the Benefits Delivery at Discharge Program to smooth the transition from service to discharge. And I will enact the GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century to offer servicemembers, veterans, and their families expanded education, housing, and entrepreneurial benefits. Our servicemembers and veterans deserve a President who will support them both on the battlefield and when they return home. I will be that President."""

It appears that many thousands have been killed and countless others are missing or otherwise hurt by the cyclone. My heart goes out to the victims of this horrible natural disaster and I hope the United States and the international community will respond to the needs of the Burmese people, who have suffered so much over the years. Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush led the drive in the aftermath of the Tsunami in neighboring countries to mobilize and coordinate the efforts of the international community to help those who were hit the hardest. We must now mount an international effort to help the victims of this terrible event. I call on the Burmese regime to put aside politics and allow the international community to aid the people of Burma. This must be a transparent process in terms of who has been harmed, what kind and how much assistance is needed, and how those in trouble can be reached.

This day of pride, joy and celebration for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans has been embraced by people of all backgrounds as a tribute to our deep historical, cultural and economic ties to Mexico. For the past seven years, we have had a president whose policies have been one of neglect and broken promises towards our neighbors to the south. Today not only marks an opportunity to recognize the many ways in which Mexican-Americans enrich our country with their culture and their contributions, but also an opportunity to recognize that we do indeed share common goals and challenges -- including addressing the needs of working families and fighting growing inequality, safeguarding democracy, and securing our borders. As president, I have four priorities for our hemisphere. First, my administration will work closely with our partners in the region to encourage effective democratic governance, the rule of law, and personal security for their citizens. Second, I am committed to helping to address the growing economic nequality within the nations of the Americas through expanded opportunity.

Emerging after the tragedy of the Holocaust, the Jewish State was reborn after two thousand years, fulfilling the biblical prophecy of a return to Zion. Since then, in just three score years, Israel has welcomed Jewish exiles from Europe, the Arab world, Africa, and the former Soviet Union. From my first trip to Israel in 1982 to my most recent visit in 2005, I have seen for myself Israel's achievements  and its challenges. The people of Israel, proud and free and always triumphing in the face of adversity, have built a strong and vibrant democracy, a diverse and rich society, and an innovative and thriving economy. Yet today, even as we celebrate all that Israel has achieved, we know that the Jewish state is still not safe. In every generation, Israel faces serious challenges to its security and threats to its existence. And just as the United States recognized Israel at birth, and has always stood by Israel when its survival and well-being were challenged, so too do the American people stand by Israel today, united by shared values and strong bonds of friendship. As President of the United States, I will be proud to continue and strengthen these bonds, so that the State of Israel will continue to grow, from generation to generation, in security and peace.

Sending soldiers into combat when they are medically unfit is more than a sign of strain on our armed forces  it is a sign of genuine disrespect to our soldiers who risk their lives to protect us. After more than five years, the Iraq war has imposed a grave toll on our military. The war has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 brave young men and women. Tens of thousands more have been wounded, many with invisible injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. We need a President who will relieve the strain being placed on our troops and place the care of our men and women in uniform as a top priority. As President, I will start by bringing this war to a swift and responsible conclusion. I will begin to bring our troops home within 60 days of taking office. I will not send a single soldier into combat who is not medically fit. I will ensure that, for every month our soldiers spend in the field, they will be guaranteed one month here at home. I will end the policy of stop-loss, which forces soldiers to remain in the military beyond their contractual time, and which has affected more than 70,000 enlisted soldiers so far. I will ensure that all veterans have access to quality, affordable health care and mental health care and that we fully fund the VA so that it has the capacity to avoid backlogs and to handle greater enrollments. I will work to provide fast-track training for new claims specialists and expand the Benefits Delivery at Discharge Program to smooth the transition from service to discharge. And I will enact the GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century to offer servicemembers, veterans, and their families expanded education, housing, and entrepreneurial benefits. Our servicemembers and veterans deserve a President who will support them both on the battlefield and when they return home. I will be that President."

""The bill includes new reforms to farm subsidies, along with disaster relief, country of origin labeling, support for renewable energy advances and resources to deploy broadband in rural areas. ""Unfortunately, the Bush Administration is signaling that the President will veto the bill. ""Saying no to the farm bill would be saying no to rural America.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 10, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Lebanon,"I am very concerned about the current situation in Lebanon. Hezbollah-allied militias, using weapons supplied by Iran and Syria, have seized control of West Beirut and are demanding that Prime Minister Fouad Siniora resign and hand over power to a military government. This is both an illegal challenge to a democratically-elected government and an issue of regional stability with international consequences. The United States must actively support the sovereignty of the Lebanese government and the independence of Lebanon. The United States needs to engage in vigorous diplomacy with its regional allies to support the Lebanese government. Outside parties, such as Iran and Syria, must immediately stop their interference in Lebanon and allow the election of the President to proceed."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 12, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on the Current Situation in Burma,"As the humanitarian situation in Burma continues to deteriorate, it is critical that the United States and the international community do everything possible to get humanitarian assistance into the country to save lives. The Burmese junta has blocked international efforts, prevented humanitarian workers from distributing assistance, and insisted that the junta control aid distribution itself. The Bush administration must work urgently and at the highest levels with other governments that have leverage with Burma to persuade its rulers to allow aid to reach those in need without interference. The United States should continue to press for access to deliver assistance directly. Equally important, the Bush administration should work through friends and partners in the region, including India, Japan, and Thailand. We should also provide aid, logistical, and other support to international organizations already on the ground. While I welcome reports of some increase in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, including the arrival of the first American aid flight, we must make it clear to Burma's military rulers that the international community will hold them responsible if they refuse to meet their international obligations by blocking access and aid to the people of their country who are in dire need. We cannot allow politics to obstruct the delivery of assistance that can prevent this grave humanitarian situation from getting worse."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 12, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Voter Identification Laws,"I am deeply concerned about efforts in Missouri and at least 19 other states to erect even higher barriers to voting than Indiana's unnecessary and unfair voter identification law - a law that the Supreme Court unfortunately upheld last month. By trying to require not just photo identification but proof of citizenship - proof that thousands of American citizens can't produce through no fault of their own - cynical Republican lawmakers are trying to build new walls between hundreds of thousands of eligible senior, minority, and low-income Americans and their civil right to choose their own leaders. ""Republicans claim that these requirements are needed to prevent fraud, but the reality is that they do little more than disenfranchise eligible voters. I believe that we should start from the premise that voting is a right, not a privilege, and we should make sure that the ballot box is open to every eligible citizen in our country. That is why I have been a strong and vocal opponent of these voter ID measures."""

He promises more of the same Bush policies that have weakened our military, our national security, and our standing in the world. Our country cannot afford more empty promises on Iraq. When I am President, the United States will no longer give Iraq a blank check. I will bring this war to a swift and honorable conclusion, and bring our troops home, beginning within 60 days of taking office."""

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 17, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"As the turmoil in Zimbabwe continues after a seriously tainted election process, President Mugabe is employing brutal tactics against dissenters in an attempt to retain power. In addition to raids on opposition party offices and the killing of opposition democracy activists by Mugabe supporters, there are increasing reports that the police are interrogating, arresting, and beating Anglican parishioners and preventing them from attending Church. ""I join with people of all faiths in the United States and around the globe in calling for an end to the religious persecution taking place in Zimbabwe. These offenses are an affront to everyone and, as we know, religious persecution anywhere is a call to action everywhere. ""Zimbabwe's families and communities teeter on the edge of starvation and economic distress while intimidation and violence toward people of faith is being carried out by the ruling party. ""This past Sunday while many participated in Holy Communion, a church service was raided and congregants had to run for safety instead of participating in their most holy sacrament. We, as a free nation, must join in prayer for the faithful of Zimbabwe. In April, the worldwide Anglican Communion called on everyone to pray for Zimbabwe's rescue 'from violence, the concealing and juggling of election results, deceit, oppression and corruption.' ""Let us all join in this call to prayer seeking an end to the persecution, for the church of Zimbabwe to remain faithful and strong for justice and truth, for an end to the drought that is creating a food crisis, for those suffering from the HIV/AIDS pandemic and their families and the clergy who are weary in their ministry. Let's work to lift up this nation during their time of distress. ""As First Lady and Senator, I have spoken out against religious persecution around the world, from China to Afghanistan to Ukraine. And in places such as Northern Ireland, I have worked on behalf of religious reconciliation to help foster peace. As President, I will continue to speak out for religious freedom and work towards religious tolerance and peace around the world."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 19, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement On Senator McCain's Speech,"It's hard to take lectures on economic policy from Senator McCain, who has admitted he doesn't understand economics, and who thinks the right way to fix our ailing economy is to embrace George Bush's failed economic strategy. Senator McCain and President Bush are like two sides of the same coin - and it doesn't amount to a whole lot of change. Senator McCain sees an economy that is failing middle class families and thinks the answer is more tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected. His plan would give $100 billion in new tax cuts to America's most profitable corporations, including $4 billion to the major oil companies and $2 billion to top health insurance companies. Senator McCain sees an economy that has lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs and $1000 in income for the typical household, and thinks the answer is four more years of George Bush's failed trade policies. His plan will turn its back on sensible labor and environmental standards and allow countries like China to continue breaking trade rules and put our workers at a competitive disadvantage. My economic plan will make a clean break from the failed Bush policies to put American families and American workers first again. I will provide more than $100 billion in middle class tax cuts to help families pay for college, healthcare and save for retirement. I will not raise taxes by a single penny on anyone making less than $250,000 dollars a year - that includes income taxes, capital gains and dividends taxes, and payroll taxes. And I will put in place a new pro-American trade policy that levels the playing field for our workers and ensures that all of our trading partners play by the rules. American families need a champion in the White House again, and as President, I will fight hard every day to make the economy work for all Americans."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 20, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Cuban Independence Day,"Today I join with Cuban-Americans and the people of Cuba to celebrate Cuban Independence Day. As we recognize this important occasion, we hope that the winds of change are beginning to stir, and wish for better days ahead. After nearly 50 years of one-man rule, the new leadership in Cuba faces a choice -- continue with the failed policies of the past that have stifled democratic freedoms and stunted economic growth - or take an historic step to bring Cuba into the community of democratic nations. Since Raul Castro formally took power, he has announced some measures that have the potential to make improvements in the lives of the Cuban people, including easing regulations on the purchase of computers and cell phones. Unfortunately, these are merely incremental steps in a society that yearns for genuine freedoms and a democratic opening. The new authorities should take immediate steps to release political prisoners, permit free expression and assembly, and set the stage for open and competitive elections. The people of Cuba want to seize the opportunity for real change, and so must we. The American people have been on the side of the Cuban people's struggle for freedom and democracy in the past, and we must and we will be on the side of the Cuban people in the future. As President, I will engage our partners in Latin America and Europe who have a strong stake in seeing a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba, and who want very much for the United States to play a constructive role to that end. I believe that we should maintain current restrictions on trade with Cuba until the government takes concrete steps to guarantee political and civil liberties and permit free and fair elections. We should also support providing assistance for independent Cuban civil society, Radio and Television Marti, negotiating direct mail service to Cuba, and upgrading telecommunications equipment to ease communication between the people of Cuba and their relatives abroad. I have also voted to support greater flexibility for immediate family members to visit Cuba in humanitarian cases. The United States must pursue an active policy to advance the cause of freedom, democracy, and opportunity for the people of Cuba. That is the policy I will pursue as President."

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 22, 2008",Statement by Hillary Clinton on Fix To Student Crisis,"It's a good day for American students and their families, who will no longer have to worry that they won't be able to finance their college education. I'm pleased that the House and Senate passed legislation similar to a proposal I made on the campaign trail, to address the student loan crisis, and that the Bush Administration implemented the measure in a timely fashion. This measure improves access to student loans by allowing the Department of Education to purchase loans from lenders. This legislation will help ensure that America's economic crisis does not stand in the way of students seeking a college education. Since early last year, I have been calling for action to address the subprime mortgage crisis. Instead of listening, President Bush stood by as the subprime crisis spiraled into a larger housing and credit crisis that is driving our economy downward. This year, the economic crisis threatened to claim another victim: student loans. I'm very pleased that instead of ignoring the problem and hoping it would go away, this time, the President listened, and is now implementing a commonsense solution, passed by Congress. I'm also pleased that the Direct Student Loan program has doubled in size since last year, and that the Department of Education is taking action to ensure that it has the capacity to administer those loans effectively. I called for the Department of Education to enact a temporary, fast-track alternative to expedite new applications to the Direct Loan program. The Direct Loan program is a cost effective, simple alternative to private loans that has proven to be a real lifesaver during this time of turmoil in the financial markets. As thousands of students prepare to start their college education for the next school year, Wednesday's announcement by the Department of Education sends a strong message that the students loans they need will be there when they need them. Congress sent that message with the passage of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, and I am pleased that the President signed the bill into law and that the Administration acted on the authority it was given."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 23, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"Hillary Clinton issued the following statement today in Brandon, SD: ""Earlier today I was discussing the Democratic primary history and in the course of that discussion mentioned the campaigns that both my husband and Senator Kennedy waged in California in June 1992 and 1968 and I was referencing those to make the point that we have had nomination primary contests that go into June. That's a historic fact. The Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Senator Kennedy and I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation, and particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive. I certainly had no intention of that, whatsoever. My view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to, and I'm honored to hold Senator Kennedy's seat in the United States Senate from the state of New York and have the highest regard for the entire Kennedy family."" Transcript from the Argus-Leader's editorial board meeting: HRC: People have been trying to push me out of this ever since Iowa. Q: Why? HRC: I don't know. I don't know. I find it curious. Because it is unprecedented in history. I don't understand it. Between my opponent and his camp and some in the media there has been this urgency to end this. And historically, that makes no sense. So I find it a bit of a mystery. Q: So you don't buy the party unity argument? HRC: I don't because again I've been around long enough. My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I don't understand it. There's lots of speculation about why it is. Q: What is your speculation? I don't know. I find it curious. And I don't want to attribute motives or strategies to people because I don't really know, but it's a historical curiosity to me."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 23, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement on Contracting Abuses in Iraq,"After years of mismanagement and a fundamental lack of accountability in Iraq, we have almost come to expect reports like the one released by the Pentagon this week on faulty Iraq war contracting practices. Yet the report has new shocking details of billions of dollars of American taxpayer money unaccounted for and likely wasted, which should be a wake up call to Congress and the Bush administration that the status quo is unacceptable. This new report indicates that the Pentagon doled out $8.2 billion in our taxpayers' money without following basic rules to ensure it was being well-spent - or in some cases being spent for public purposes at all. It included more than $100 million in payments to our allies with no explanation for why. A cash payment of more than $300 million authorized with the equivalent of a signature on the back of a napkin. $10 million exchanged for a contractor's voucher without any record of what was delivered. Meanwhile, another nearly $2 billion in seized or frozen Iraqi assets, much of it in stacks of cash, disappeared without any real accounting. The Pentagon itself is conceding this gross mismanagement. As President, I would ensure our government is accountable for the taxpayer dollars it spends. I will make certain that the Pentagon is handling taxpayers' money with care - and spending it in ways that demonstrably protect our troops and advance our security. These are the most basic functions of a government that operates with accountability and care. Restoring them requires leadership from the White House, as well as a set of new rules and checks to ensure the contracting payment system is working all the way down to the ground level. Among other things, I will:  Bring new transparency and competition to the federal contracting process including the public posting of a detailed description of the type and purpose of the work to be performed for every contract, with limited security exceptions.  Require senior government personnel, including political appointees, involved in the awarding of contracts to sign a sworn affidavit that they complied with open and competitive contracting rules, as well as addressing any financial conflicts of interest.  Restore a Clinton administration rule to require contractors to have a satisfactory record of compliance with the law.  Bar the practice of giving bonuses or awarding fees to contractors unless the contractor meets the stipulations related to cost, schedule, and performance outlined in the contract.  Appoint a special counsel to investigate where Iraq's oil profits are going and how reconstruction funds are being spent - or not spent.  Direct the U.S. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to conduct regular reports on corruption in the oil industry, with the option of withholding aid if the Iraqi government does not show results in its anti-corruption efforts.  End the practice of awarding contracts to companies that use offshore tax havens in order to avoid paying taxes. End the federal government's overreliance on private contractors to carry out the federal government's mission.   I will soon introduce legislation - and push aggressively for its passage - aimed at making our government contracting process work again."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 26, 2008",Hillary's Statement on Memorial Day,"Memorial Day is a solemn day for every American; a day to express our profound gratitude to the men and women who have given their lives in military service. A day to join in our thoughts and prayers with the families mourning loved ones. A day to cherish the freedoms and opportunities that so many have served, sacrificed, and died to defend. On this Memorial Day, I'm reminded of the words of a poet and a veteran named Archibald MacLeish. He served in World War I and witnessed incredible service and sacrifice. Before the close of World War II, to commemorate those who had died, he wrote of the responsibility of all of us who survive them. In his poem entitled ""The Young Dead Soldiers Do Not Speak,"" he reminds us that those we have lost: ""have a silence that speaks for them at night...They say: We have done what we could but until it is finished it is not done...They say: our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will mean what you make them...They say: we leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning."" How do we give these lives their meaning? I believe we must honor our service members by doing our best to serve the men and women who have served us. And I believe we must honor the lives we've lost by honoring the values for which they fought. That is our duty. And on this Memorial Day, let us recommit ourselves to fulfilling this sacred responsibility every single day. The United States has the finest military on the planet because we have the best soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen in the world. We owe them our support and resources while in-service and when they come home as our Veterans. We owe them a GI Bill of Rights that sees to their health care, housing, education and overall wellbeing. In many ways, everyday should be Memorial Day to honor and remember all they do for our nation, our communities and our families. Our moral obligation is significant for the simple reason that the sacrifice of those who serve and have served in our military demonstrates a profound example of commitment and love for our nation. We must return to them all they have given and we must remember and honor those who gave their all, their lives, for our great nation."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 27, 2008",Hillary Clinton Statement On The Record Decline In Housing Prices,"Today, the respected Case-Shiller index reported that housing prices declined by a record 14.1% in the first quarter of 2008. This is further evidence of the deepening crisis in our housing market, which is forcing millions of families out of their homes and eroding the value of most families' single largest asset. For more than a year, I have been speaking out on the need to take aggressive action to contain this crisis, and to help keep responsible families in their homes. I have called for a voluntary moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a freeze on subprime mortgage interest rates for at least 5 years. I support the bold plans being developed by Congressman Frank and Senator Dodd to extend government guarantees to help millions of families restructure their mortgages on more affordable terms. And I believe we should immediately pass a second stimulus package with at least $30 billion in emergency funds to help states and localities fight foreclosures in their communities. As President, I will work to ensure that these provisions become law, and that our government is fighting just as hard to help struggling homeowners as we are to help struggling Wall Street banks. Unfortunately, President Bush has offered too little too late when it comes to the housing crisis. Now, Senator McCain has pledged to continue President Bush's strategy of half-hearted half-measures on housing. That is a strategy that America's working families simply cannot afford. After today's record housing price declines, anyone who thinks we can continue President Bush's on housing is deeply out of touch with the crisis affecting millions of American families."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"May 30, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Investigating Oil Price Manipulation,"I am heartened by the news that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is investigating price manipulation in oil markets. However, with oil at record highs and gas at over $4.00 a gallon, we need more immediate, aggressive and comprehensive action to ensure that American consumers are not being ripped off at the pump. For several months I have raised concerns that speculation and market manipulation were unfairly pushing up the price of oil. Even top CEOs at U.S. oil companies acknowledge that oil prices today cannot be explained by supply and demand alone. That's why, in addition to the CFTC investigation, I have called for a broad range of aggressive actions to address price manipulation and help bring down the cost of oil. We need to immediately close the ""Enron Loophole,"" which allows some oil futures traders to avoid common sense regulations and engage in speculation. We must continue to urge the Federal Trade Commission to use its newly granted powers to vigorously investigate and pursue market manipulators who are pushing up the price of oil. And we should finally stand up to OPEC, by challenging their price-setting activities through the WTO and U.S. antitrust law. I will continue to fight for these measures in the coming weeks, and as President will work vigilantly to stamp out price manipulation and speculation and bring down the price of oil."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"June 2, 2008",Statement from Hillary Clinton On Gay Pride Month,"As we begin Gay Pride Month, I join the LGBT community in celebrating an historic year in which our country continues to make progress towards the fair and equal treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Still, we have so much work to do. I look forward to working with the LGBT community to make sure that all Americans in committed relationships have equal benefits and that nothing stands in the way of loving couples who want to adopt children in need. We need to expand our federal hate crimes legislation and pass a fully-inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And finally, we need to put an end to the failed policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Courage, honor, patriotism and sacrifice - the traits that define our men and women in uniform - have nothing to do with sexual orientation. To each and every LGBT American, I say this: You have done so much to help this country understand your lives by simply being open and honest about who you are and living your lives with dignity. Thank you for your courage. It is time that we recognize your hard work. I know that this country is ready for changes in the law that reflect the evolution in our hearts. You deserve a government that treats you with the respect you deserve. America deserves a President who appeals to the best in each of us, not the worst; a President who values and respects all Americans and treats all Americans equally no matter who they are or who they love. That is truly the promise of America."
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"June 25, 2015",Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on the Affordable Care Act,"Hillary Clinton released the following statement after the Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act in the King v. Burwell decision.""I applaud the Supreme Court's decision to affirm what the authors of the Affordable Care Act clearly intended and wrote into law: that health insurance should be affordable and available in every state across the country.""Republicans in Congress have waged a sustained attack against this promise. They've voted more than 50 times to repeal or dismantle the law, roll back coverage for millions of Americans, and let insurers write their own rules again  all without proposing any viable alternatives. Now that the Supreme Court has once again re-affirmed the ACA as the law of the land, it's time for the Republican attacks to end. It's time to move on.""The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but the evidence is clear: it's working. Sixteen million Americans have gained coverage. Millions of young people are able to stay on their parents' plans. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or charge women higher rates just because of their gender.""Republicans should stop trying to tear down the law and start working across party lines to build on these successes.""I've fought for the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American for decades. And I'm not going to stop now. Anyone seeking to lead our country should stand up and support this decision."""

Hodges case.""Along with millions of Americans, I am celebrating today's landmark victory for marriage equality, and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible. From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, the courage and determination of the LGBT community has changed hearts and changed laws.""This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another. It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving towards true equality.""But we know that the struggle for LGBT rights doesn't end with today's triumph. As love and joy flood our streets today, it is hard to imagine how anyone could deny the full protection of our laws to any of our fellow Americansbut there are those who would. So while we celebrate the progress won today, we must stand firm in our conviction to keep moving forward. For too many LGBT Americans who are subjected to discriminatory laws, true equality is still just out of reach. While we celebrate today, our work won't be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice. We cannot settle for anything less."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"July 7, 2015",Statement from Hillary Clinton on Puerto Rico,"Statement from Hillary Clinton on Puerto Rico""The people of Puerto Rico are hurting right now under a weak economy that has been struggling for years. Puerto Ricans are proud American citizens who work hard and contribute to our Nation every day and they deserve a chance to get ahead. Congress and the Obama Administration need to partner with Puerto Rico by providing real support and tools so that Puerto Rico can do the hard work it will take to get on a path toward stability and prosperity.""The challenge is multi-faceted, and will ultimately require Puerto Rico to find a way to pay back its debtors in an orderly fashion. As a first step, Congress should provide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already have to enable severely distressed government entities, including municipalities and public corporations, to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code.""We're not talking about a bailout, we're talking about a fair shot at success.""We also have to step back and look hard at how Puerto Rico's economy arrived at this dire situation. The deficit is a consequence of an economy that has lagged that of the States for decades and shrunk for eight of the last nine years. Puerto Rico needs a longer-term plan to address a declining population, eroding employment base, high utility rates and the impact of unequal federal investments. It will take tough decisions and real economic reforms.""But we should also recognize that the inconsistent  and incoherent  treatment of Puerto Rico in federal laws and programs has substantially contributed to the economic decline. One troubling example of this treatment is the lack of equity in federal funding for Puerto Rico under Medicaid and Medicare. This problem has been demonstrated in recent months by a scheduled cut in Medicare Advantage premium reimbursement rates. In 2008, I called for an end to the disparate treatment of Puerto Rico in federal health programs. Today, I renew that call, and commit to helping Puerto Ricans get on a path towards equal treatment under Medicaid and Medicare and other federal programs.""Underlying all of this is the fundamental question of Puerto Rico's ultimate future. That question needs to be resolved in accordance with the expressed will of our fellow citizens, the people of Puerto Rico.""Declaraciones de Hillary Clinton acerca de la situacin econmica de Puerto Rico""El pueblo de Puerto Rico est sufriendo por una economa que ha estado en crisis por aos. Como estadounidenses, contribuyen diariamente a nuestro pas y merecen una oportunidad para salir adelante. El Congreso de los Estados Unidos y la Administracin de Obama tienen que apoyar a Puerto Rico y proveer las herramientas necesarias para que pueda enfrentar el desafo y volver a la estabilidad y prosperidad.""El desafo es multifactico y requiere que Puerto Rico encuentre una forma adecuada de pagar sus acreedores. Como primer paso, El Congreso de los Estados Unidos y la administracin del Presidente Obama necesitan extender la misma autoridad fiscal que tienen los estados individuales de los E.E.U.U. a Puerto Rico para que las entidades gubernamentales bajo condiciones extremas, incluyendo los municipios y corporaciones, puedan restructurar sus deudas bajo el captulo 9 del Cdigo de Bancarrota.""No se trata de un rescate econmico, se trata de proveer una oportunidad justa para Puerto Rico.""Tambin tenemos que hacer un anlisis profundo para determinar claramente cules fueron las causas de la presente situacin econmica. El dficit es una consecuencia de una economa que no ha crecido como la de los E.E.U.U. y que ha contratado durante 8 de los ltimos 9 aos.""Puerto Rico precisa un plan a largo plazo para enfrentar la erosin de la base de empleo, el alto costo de los servicios pblicos, el descenso de la poblacin y la inconsistencia en la inversin federal. Requiere decisiones difciles y reforma econmica real.""Tenemos que reconocer el tratamiento inconsistente e incoherente de Puerto Rico bajo leyes y programas federales, un tratamiento que ha contribuido al declive econmico. Un ejemplo perturbador es la falta de igualdad en la asignacin de fondos federales para Puerto Rico en Medicaid y Medicare. El problema ha sido comprobado recientemente por una reduccin en el reembolso de las tasas de Medicare Advantage. En 2008, yo solicit que se terminara el tratamiento desigual de Puerto Rico en los programas federales de salud. Hoy lo solicito de nuevo y me comprometo a apoyar a los puertorriqueos para que sean tratados de forma igual en Medicaid, Medicare y otros programas federales.""Subyacente a todo esto, est la pregunta fundamental del destino de Puerto Rico.

With vigorous enforcement, unyielding verification, and swift consequences for any violations, this agreement can make the United States, Israel, and our Arab partners safer.""In light of the international community's long history and experience with Iranian behavior, the highest priority must be given to effective enforcement of the agreement. Signing is just the beginning. As President, I would use every tool in our arsenal to compel rigorous Iranian compliance. At the outset, we must see the verified roll back of the Iranian nuclear program required by the agreement. We can never permit Iran to evade its obligations or to place any suspicious site off limits to inspectors. And the response to any cheating must be immediate and decisive  starting with the return of sanctions but taking no options off the table, including, if necessary, our military options.""The message to Iran should be loud and clear: We will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon; not just during the term of this agreement  never.""Today's agreement is the culmination of a sustained strategy of pressure and engagement executed over many years. As Secretary of State, I logged tens of thousands of miles and twisted a lot of arms to build a global coalition to impose the most crippling sanctions in history. That unprecedented pressure delivered a blow to Iran's economy and gave us leverage at the negotiating table, starting in Oman in 2012. I know from experience what it took to build a global effort to get this done; I know what it will take to rally our partners to enforce it.""Going forward, we have to be clear-eyed when it comes to the broader threat Iran represents. Even with a nuclear agreement, Iran poses a real challenge to the United States and our partners and a grave threat to our ally Israel. It continues to destabilize countries from Yemen to Lebanon, while exacerbating the conflict in Syria. It is developing missiles that can strike every country in the Middle East. And it fuels terrorism throughout the region and beyond, including through direct support to Hamas and Hizballah. We have to broadly confront and raise the costs for Iran's destabilizing activities, insist on the return of U.S. citizens being held in Iranian prisons, and strengthen security cooperation with our allies and partners. Sanctions for terrorism, and other non-nuclear sanctions, must remain a key part of our strategy and must be vigorously enforced.""Israel has to be confident that the United States will always ensure its Qualitative Military Edge in the region and its capacity to defend itself by itself. As President, I would invite the senior Israeli leadership to Washington for early talks on further strengthening our alliance. We must also deepen our security relationship with our Arab partners threatened by Iran. This includes our continued presence and providing needed capabilities. Iran should have no doubt about our support for the security of our partners.""I know that there are people of good faith who oppose this deal - people I respect. They raise concerns that have to be taken seriously. They are right to call for extreme vigilance. I am as familiar with Iranian behavior and the need to confront it as anyone. I support this agreement because I believe it is the most effective path of all the alternatives available to the U.S. and our partners to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.""So we should applaud President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and Secretary Moniz for getting this done, and proceed with wisdom and strength in enforcing this deal to the fullest and in meeting the broader Iranian challenge."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"August 2, 2015",Statement from Hillary Clinton on President Obama's Clean Power Plan,"Hillary Clinton released the following statement about President Obama's newly announced Clean Power Plan:""The Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan is a significant step forward in meeting the urgent threat of climate change. It sets a smart federal standard that gives states the flexibility to choose how to reduce carbon pollution most effectively. And it drives investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, reduces asthma attacks and premature deaths, and promotes a healthier environment and a stronger economy. It's a good plan, and as President, I'd defend it.""It will need defending. Because Republican doubters and defeatists  including every Republican candidate for president  won't offer any credible solution. The truth is, they don't want one. They just keep making the same tired arguments they've been making for years. They refuse to accept science. They refuse to believe in American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, even though we've seen time and time again that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.""Of course, the Clean Power Plan standards set the floor, not the ceiling. We can and must go further. As President, I will launch a Clean Energy Challenge to give states, cities and rural communities that are ready to lead the tools and resources to succeed. By combining the Clean Power Plan with my Clean Energy Challenge, we'll achieve two big goals: We will have half of a billion installed solar panels by the end of my first term in office, We will generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years of my taking office.As President, I will build on the work of this Administration and make America a clean energy superpower and a global leader in the fight against climate change.

Their name is misleading. Instead of respecting workers or protecting their rights, 'right to work' laws depress wages and benefits, undercut unions, and concentrate power in the hands of corporations and their allies. They're bad for workers, bad for the economy, and bad for America.""Right-wing attacks on the labor movement are nothing new. But they are growing in number and intensity. I've been disturbed by repeated state-level attacks on basic protections that unions have fought hard for over the years, like a prevailing wage, union dues deductions, binding arbitration, and collective bargaining.""In Missouri, lawmakers said enough is enough. And by doing that, they scored a victory for Missourians and workers everywhere.""As President, I will stand up to anti-union leaders who try to make workers scapegoats in times of economic hardship. And I'll stand with all workers and lawmakers fighting for real workers' rights  like the right to organize, bargain collectively, be paid fairly and retire with dignity and security.

It has extended quality, affordable health insurance to millions of Americans, begun to rein in the growth of overall health care spending across the country, and provided important new protections to consumers, especially young people and anyone with a pre-existing condition. President Obama doesn't get enough credit for this historic achievement, and Republicans' obsession with repeal is dead wrong. We should be defending and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, not scrapping it.""I have proposed new reforms to build on the progress we've made and lower out-of-pocket costs for families. Too many Americans are struggling to meet the cost of rising deductibles and drug prices. That's why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac Tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal.""My proposed reforms to our health care system would more than cover the cost of repealing the Cadillac Tax, while also reining in skyrocketing prescription drug costs and out-of-pocket expenses for hard-working families.

In 2011, Alabama announced that it would require photo ID to vote. A comprehensive study of more than 1 billion ballots cast nationwide found only 31 instances of possible voter fraud  a rate of .00002%.""I strongly oppose Alabama's decision to close driver's license offices across the state, especially in counties that have a significant majority of African Americans. Just a few years ago, Alabama passed a law requiring citizens to have a photo ID to vote. Now they're shutting down places where people get those photo IDs. This is only going to make it harder for people to vote. It's a blast from the Jim Crow past.""We're better than this. We should be encouraging more Americans to vote, not making voting harder. As President, I'll push for automatic voter registration for every American when they turn 18, and a new national standard of at least 20 days of early in-person voting in every state. And I'll work with Congress to restore key protections of the Voting Rights Act.""African Americans fought for the right to vote in the face of unthinkable hatred. They stood up and were beaten down, marched and were turned back. Some were even killed. But in the end, the forces of justice overcame. Alabama should do the right thing.

But based on what I know so far, I can't support this agreement.""As I have said many times, we need to be sure that new trade deals meet clear tests: They have to create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security. The bar has to be set very high for two reasons.""First, too often over the years we haven't gotten the balance right on trade. We've seen that even a strong deal can fall short on delivering the promised benefits. So I don't believe we can afford to keep giving new agreements the benefit of the doubt. The risks are too high that, despite our best efforts, they will end up doing more harm than good for hard-working American families whose paychecks have barely budged in years.""Second, we can't look at this in a vacuum. Years of Republican obstruction at home have weakened U.S. competitiveness and made it harder for Americans who lose jobs and pay because of trade to get back on their feet. Republicans have blocked the investments that we need and that President Obama has proposed in infrastructure, education, clean energy, and innovation. They've refused to raise the minimum wage or defend workers' rights or adequately fund job training.""As a result, America is less competitive than we should be. Workers have fewer protections, the potential positive effects of trade are diminished, and the negative effects are exacerbated. We're going into this with one arm tied behind our backs.""I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was Secretary of State. I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"October 21, 2015",Hillary Clinton: 'Serious Concerns' About Proposed Mega-Mergers of Health Insurance Companies,"In a new statement released Wednesday, Hillary Clinton raised ""serious concerns"" about proposed mergers involving major health insurance companies Aetna and Humana, as well as Cigna and Anthem. The latter deal would combine two of New Hampshire's largest insurers.Clinton urged federal regulators to strictly scrutinize the proposed deals. She believes our health care system must put patients and consumers first, which is why she has proposed new measures to lower prescription drug costs? and other out-of-pocket medical costs.Below is the full statement from Hillary Clinton:""As we see more consolidation in health care, among both providers and insurers, I'm worried that the balance of power is moving too far away from consumers.""I have serious concerns about the proposed mergers between Anthem and Cigna, and between Aetna and Humana. One could raise market concentration in New Hampshire to excessive levels, and both have concerning effects on competition in other markets. These mergers should be scrutinized very closely with an eye to preventing the undue concentration that they appear to create. I am very skeptical of the claim that consumers will benefit from them because the evidence from careful studies shows that too often the companies end up pocketing profits rather than passing savings to consumers. These companies should commit to passing on savings and efficiencies to consumers as lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs.""I strongly support delivery system reforms and care coordination that drive innovation, value and quality at an affordable cost for Americans and that improve transparency about prices  but companies proposing to merge bear the heavy burden of demonstrating that consumers will benefit. As president, I would strengthen the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and appoint aggressive regulators to take on troubling concentration wherever it occurs in the health care industry, among other sectors. That's a pro-competition approach that is good for businesses large and small who want to compete on a level playing field and for consumers who should gain more choices."""

Abbott  a Texas redistricting case that could deny representation to anyone who isn't a voter, including every child and minor under 18, by changing how state legislative districts are drawn  Hillary Clinton released the following statement:""In the Supreme Court yesterday, parties challenging Texas' Senate apportionment plan insisted that political representation in our democracy should be based on eligible voters, instead of total population. This change would mean that many in America, including children and non-citizen residents, would no longer be counted for purposes of representation in every state in the country. Such measures are an insult to the millions of Americans who have fought throughout our history for our country to achieve equality and justice for all people.

The Every Student Succeeds Act is not perfect, but it puts us on a path to provide states and teachers flexibility to serve the needs of their students while also ensuring schools are held accountable to raise achievement for all studentsparticularly for low-income students, students of color, English Language Learners, and students with disabilities. The bill retains a commitment to high academic standards, enables communities to strike a better balance on testing, requires districts and states to take action to turn around struggling schools, and allows states to take a holistic approach when measuring school success.""The legislation also authorizes critical resources to support teacher development, increase access to early childhood education, and expand high-quality public charter schools. Whiletoday represents important bipartisan progress,we must be mindful of the work that lies ahead. Effectively implementing this law will take commitment and cooperationby our parents, teachers, schools and states. It will also require that the federal government continue to play a critical role in working towards an America where a world-class education is available to every child. That includes overseeing the design and implementation of effective state accountability systems. It also requires that funding be provided for the promises laid out in this legislation,and that we work together to increaseour investment in universal preschool and other early learning initiatives, so that every child can start school ready to build on the strong start they gained before Kindergarten. Only then, will the Every Student Succeeds Act live up to the vital promise that its title bears."""

This is an historic step forward in meeting one of the greatest challenges of the 21st centurythe global crisis of climate change.""The Paris agreement is testament to America's ability to lead the world in building a clean energy future where no one is left out or left behind. And it was made possible in part by every person, business owner, and community in the United States and around the world that stepped up to prove we don't have to choose between growing our economy and protecting our kids' health and futurewe can do both.""But we will only succeed if we redouble our efforts going forward to drive innovation, increase investment, and reap the benefits of the good-paying jobs that will come from transitioning to a clean energy economy. The next decade of action is criticalbecause if we do not press forward with driving clean energy growth and cutting carbon pollution across the economy, we will not be able to avoid catastrophic consequences.""We cannot afford to be slowed by the climate skeptics or deterred by the defeatists who doubt America's ability to meet this challenge.

Thankfully, Congress is finally moving forward on renewing the promise of health care we made to our heroes. It is about time. Too many of those who responded on 9/11 and in the days that followed are still suffering lasting health effects for their courage and bravery in the face of tragedy.

North Korea's goal is to blackmail the world into easing the pressure on its rogue regime. We can't give in to or in any way encourage this kind of bullying. Instead, we should increase pressure and send Pyongyang an unmistakable message that its nuclear brinksmanship won't succeed.""The United States and our partners, including the UN Security Council, need to immediately impose additional sanctions against North Korea. The Chinese government, which wields influence with the North Koreans, must be more assertive in deterring the North's irresponsible actions, and it should take actions to halt prohibited activities transpiring across its borders or its firms that participate in illicit trade or proliferation will have to face sanctions. We should also work with our allies to strengthen our missile defenses.""As Secretary I championed the United States' pivot to the Asia Pacific - including shifting additional military assets to the theater  in part to confront threats like North Korea and to support our allies.

For the first time ever, the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthoodincluding cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and STI and HIV testsand taking away health coverage from 18 million people. Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win. We can't let that happen.""We need a president who has what it takes to stop Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away a woman's right to basic health care. If I'm elected, I will be that president. I've fought for women and families my entire life, and I refuse to let anyone rip away the progress we've made.

I congratulate President Obama and his team, and I'm proud of the role I played to get this process started.""But we shouldn't thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations. These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East. Another American, Bob Levinson, still isn't home with his family. The treatment of our Navy sailors earlier this week was offensive, including the release of a demeaning and provocative video. Iran is still violating UN Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program, which should be met with new sanctions designations and firm resolve.""So we can't take our eye off the ball.

Some Republicans have even suggested President Obama has no right to nominate anyone, as if somehow he's not a real President. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and on average a confirmation or rejection has taken just two months. The Senate Republicans' refusal to hold hearings on any nominee by President Obama is unprecedented, and it is an offense to the President and to the American people who elected him. What's more, they are hindering the Court from doing its work  leaving it with only eight members for the remainder of this term and into the next.

As President, not only will I protect President Obama's executive orders and look to go further, but I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation from the moment I take office. While immigration reform is vital for our families, our economy, and our future, it's not the only issue where the Latino community needs progress.

The day that they were stopped on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, beaten savagely, knocked unconscious, and chased through the streets by state troopers for daring to raise their voices.""It was a day of horror and pain. But it was also a day of resilience and grace. Because men like John Lewis would not be beaten down. Women like Amelia Boynton Robinson would not be silenced. And so many others whose names we may never know would not be intimidated. Their mission was a holy and righteous onea mission for dignity, justice, and equality. Bigotry and hatred may have blocked the Selma march that day, but the long march to progress cannot be blocked on any given day.""But we know too well that our work is not done. Since 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, and 21 states have enacted new voting restrictionsfrom slashing early voting to instituting burdensome voter ID laws. Alabamathe very state where the Selma marchers demonstratedpassed a voter ID law and then closed dozens of driver's license bureaus where citizens secure photo IDs, including in seven counties where more than two-thirds of the population is African American.""We should be making it easier for all citizens to vote, not harder. We should be working to lift each other up, not stop others from exercising their rights. And although we will fight, we should not have to fight to break down the many barriers holding Americans backeconomic barriers and educational barriers, barriers of environmental injustice, barriers of discrimination in all its forms. We should not have to remind people that Black Lives Matter. We should be striving to demonstrate that foundational principle of our countrye pluribus unum. Out of many, we are one.

I'll fight to close the pay gap; make paid family leave a reality; ensure families have access to quality, affordable child care; increase the minimum wage; protect women's health and reproductive rights; confront violence against women; and promote women's rights around the globe. These issues ought to be core priorities of our government. They are not just ""women's issues""they are family issues, economic issues, and they're crucial to America's competitiveness and security.""This International Women's Day, let's take a page from the generations of women leaders around the world who never stopped working to make our world a better, more equitable place.

I was proud to stand with Governor Cuomo when he raised the minimum wage to $15 in New York and I hope more places do the same. A higher, fairer minimum wage grows the economy and lifts everyone up.

And I am honored to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. They are fighting every day for commonsense gun safety measures and to end the epidemic of gun violence.""The stakes in this election could not be higher. We need leaders in Washington who will close the loopholes that let guns fall into the wrong hands, and who will finally pass comprehensive background check legislation. We need leaders who will repeal the special legal immunity that the gun lobby secured for irresponsible gun makers and sellers, so they are finally held accountable for their products. What we don't need are the extreme and dangerous positions of Donald Trump, who has pledged to overturn President Obama's actions to strengthen background checks and mandate that every school in America allow guns in classrooms on his very first day in office.""The gun lobby may be the most powerful lobby in Washington, but I believe that the American people are more powerful still. We are stronger together. We will not be intimidated. We will not back down. And as long as children anywhere are being killed by gun violence, we will keep fightingbecause their lives are precious, and they deserve a president who stands up for them."""

This policy is good for our economyand it is true to our values as Americans. We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe every young person deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We know we are stronger together.""This anniversary also reminds us of how high the stakes are in this election. Right now, the United States Supreme Court is set to rule on the recent expansion of DACA and the creation of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). I strongly believe that these executive actions that are rooted in law and precedent will be upheld, but the fate of these policies, and of the millions of people who were impacted by them, will be in the hands of the next President.""If Donald Trump is that president, he has pledged to eliminate DACA and DAPA on day one. He has said he will create a 'deportation force' to round up 11 million people. He will tear apart families, separate parents and children, rip young people out of school and workers from their jobs. He has even said he will undermine that most fundamental American valuethat if you are born here, no matter who your parents are or where they came from, you are an American.""I believe America is stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we protect families, not tear them apart. When we build bridges, not walls.""It is why I co-sponsored legislation to protect DREAMers throughout my time in the senate as well as legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform, and it is why I will do everything in my power as president to protect President Obama's executive actions, go further to provide relief for families, and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office."""

Workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy.

For years, Nabisco had received tax breaks and investments from the people of Chicago and the people of Illinois to expand productiononly to turn their backs on their workers and on the community by announcing plans to lay off 600 workers and move their production line to Mexico. That's wrong.

By all accounts, she was a rising star. Her maiden speech in Parliament celebrated the diversity of her beloved Yorkshire constituency, and passionately made the case that there is more that unites us than divides us. It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of political intolerance.It is critical that the United States and Britain, two of the world's oldest and greatest democracies, stand together against hatred and violence. This is how we must honor Jo Cox -- by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together.My thoughts and prayers are with her friends, her family, and the British people."

As I have consistently said, I believe that President Obama acted well within his constitutional and legal authority in issuing the DAPA and DACA executive actions. These are our friends and family members; neighbors and classmates; DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. They enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day. We should be doing everything possible under the law to provide them relief from the specter of deportation.""Today's decision by the Supreme Court is purely procedural and casts no doubt on the fact that DAPA and DACA are entirely within the President's legal authority. But in addition to throwing millions of families across our country into a state of uncertainty, this decision reminds us how much damage Senate Republicans are doing by refusing to consider President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Our families and our country need and deserve a full bench, and Senate Republicans need to stop playing political games with our democracy and give Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and vote.""This decision is also a stark reminder of the harm Donald Trump would do to our families, our communities, and our country. Trump has pledged to repeal President Obama's executive actions on his first day in office. He has called Mexican immigrants 'rapists' and 'murderers.' He has called for creating a deportation force"" to tear 11 million people away from their families and their homes.""I believe we are stronger together.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"July 6, 2016",Hillary Clinton Statement on the Death of Alton Sterling,"After the Department of Justice announced it was opening a civil rights investigation into the shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:""The death of Alton Sterling is a tragedy, and my prayers are with his family, including his five children. From Staten Island to Baltimore, Ferguson to Baton Rouge, too many African American families mourn the loss of a loved one from a police-involved incident. Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin.""I am glad the Department of Justice has agreed to a full and thorough review of this shooting. Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense reforms like ending racial profiling, providing better training on de-escalation and implicit bias, and supporting municipalities that refer the investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies. All over America, there are police officers demonstrating how to protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build on those examples.""Progress is possible if we stand together and never waver in our fight to secure the future that every American deserves."""

I was proud to join the CWA on the picket line this year as they stood up to Verizon and fought for a fair deal.""And I will do everything in my power to defend American jobs and American workers. Any trade deal must meet three tests to earn my support: It must create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security. I do not believe that the Trans-Pacific Partnership meets this high standard. That's why I oppose the TPP  and that means before and after the election.""Above all, we must make sure unions have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House.

And CPC members know, as I do, that we are stronger together.""We are stronger when we have each others' backs. That's why we will fight to secure universal health care, raise the minimum wage, and protect Americans' fundamental right to votenot corporations' right to buy elections. It's why we will face up to the reality of systemic racism, and fix it together. And it's why we will say 'no' to trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would hurt American workers, and fully enforce our trade laws to protect American jobs.""We are stronger when all our people can retire with dignity and security after years of hard work. That is why we will stand up to Republican efforts to undermine or privatize the bedrock promise of Social Securityand we'll fight to expand it.""And we are stronger when we make our economy work for everyonenot just those at the top. That's why we will fight to make college debt-free and make the kinds of investments that will create good-paying jobs, with a bold plan to build 21st century infrastructure, revitalize American manufacturing, and combat climate change and make America a clean energy superpower.""Progressives know that in America, we don't tear each other downwe lift each other up.

UNITE HERE has been on the front lines for decades, fighting to raise the minimum wage and reform our broken immigration system. They've stood strong to protect the rights and safety of workers across the countryand they've stood up to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who personally signed a contract with a union-busting firm to try to keep UNITE HERE from organizing workers in Las Vegas. I was proud to visit with UNITE HERE workers on the picket line twice in the primary, and I was even prouder when they overcame Trump's intimidation campaign and were officially certified as a union earlier this year.""UNITE HERE knows, as I do, that America is stronger together. Workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy. In too many statehouses across the countryand even in the halls of Congressthese rights are under concerted attack by Republicans and big corporations who have forgotten that a strong economy requires a strong workforce. If I am elected President, workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House.

That means restoring the full power and protections of the Voting Rights Act and fighting back against Republican efforts to make it harder for women, young people, and people of color to vote by imposing onerous voting restrictions.""And it means overturning the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and putting our democracy back in the hands of the voters. In my first 30 days as President, I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. I will appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision deeply hurt our democracy, and I will fight for other progressive reforms to our campaign finance system, including more robust disclosure requirements, and measures that will make it easier for people who aren't rich or well-connected to run for office, like small-donor matching.""But we can't stop there.

This landmark law opened educational opportunities, expanded transportation, ensured equal access to public buildings, and outlawed employment discrimination on the basis of disability.

I am committed to realizing the full promise of the ADA expanding opportunity for the over 50 million Americans living with a disabilitybecause we're stronger together.""As President, I will continue to advance disability rights and work to fulfill the promise of the ADA. I will work to expand support for people to live in integrated community settings, consistent with the Supreme Court'sOlmsteaddecision. As part of that effort, I will push Congress to enact the Disability Integration Act so that Americans with disabilities who need long-term services and supports can receive that care in home- and community-based settings if they so choose.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"August 6, 2016",Hillary Clinton Statement on the 51st Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act,"Today, on the 51st anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement:""Fifty-one years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, Americans are now facing the most systematic effort to curtail those rights since the era of Jim Crow. Make no mistake, new voter restriction laws in seventeen states have replaced poll taxes and literacy tests as a thinly veiled attempt to achieve an old objective: disenfranchising African Americans, Latinos, low-income people, young people, and people with disabilities.""But we are fighting back. Last week, a court struck down North Carolina's voter ID requirement, saying it was designed to 'target African Americans with almost surgical precision.' Similar restrictions have recently been overturned in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, and Kansas after courts found they were intended to discriminate as well.""This November, the notion that every American has a voice in shaping our future is at stake. Donald Trump supports discriminatory voting restrictions  and actually claims that without them in place, the results of American elections should be questioned. It's a dangerous attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy.""I have a very different view. I believe America is stronger when we expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it. That's why I'll fight to repair the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting, and introduce universal, automatic voter registration. ?""Upon signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965, President Johnson said the right to vote 'is one which no American, true to our principles, can deny.'""He was right."""

That we are stronger together.""Social Security benefits 59 million Americans todaybut Republicans are relentlessly trying to attack and undermine this bedrock American guarantee. They want to cut benefits and gamble seniors' retirement security on the stock market through privatization.""And Donald Trump is no differentjust look who he chose as his running mate. Mike Pence spent his time in Congress championing efforts to dismantle Social Securityand to privatize it even faster than President George W. Bush and Paul Ryan proposed.""We cannot and we will not stand for that. When I served in the Senate, I helped lead the fight against the Bush privatization scheme. Instead of cutting or privatizing Social Security, we will defend and expand it.""When President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, he said it 'represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means completed.' Social Security works, but we can make it better. Millions of womenand menwho are widowed or who take time out of the paid workforce to raise a child or care for a sick family member are being left behind. As President, I'll expand benefits to cover these hardworking Americans, because no one should have to live in poverty because their spouse died or they did the vital work of taking care of a loved one.""Social Security isn't just a programit's a promise.

He resolved to do everything he could to ease others' suffering and prevent other families from going through what he had.""Since the launch of the Cancer Moonshot initiative, Vice President Biden has spurred unprecedented cooperation between federal agencies and leaders in the private and nonprofit sectors. Together, they are creating new protocols to promote the sharing of research data, pushing for more enrollment in clinical trials, and providing new tools for patients. And all of this effort is taking advantage of the incredible strides we have made in recent years to grapple with this disease. We know more than we ever have about the biology of cancer, how to prevent it, and how to treat it. We need to do more to build on these developments, advance our understanding, and develop more effective treatments. Simply put, if we make the right investments today, we can save lives.""To start, Congress should fulfill the administration's request for moonshot funding next year. Cancer does not discriminate, and I believe leaders of both parties can come together to tackle this disease as part of a comprehensive effort to improve medical research across diseases, both by restoring robust funding to the National Institutes of Health, including the National Cancer Institute, and by harnessing the power of the private sector. And we will continue to build on Vice President Biden's work to mobilize the cancer community, make sure that scientists work together, and enable more patients to enroll in clinical trials. By combining new funding with creative approaches, we will not only catalyze progress against cancer: We will strengthen the nation's entire scientific enterprise.""I could not be prouder to stand with Vice President Biden in this fight, and as President, I will take up the charge. My Administration will carry out the mission the Vice President has set, and continue to call on his advice, leadership, compassion, and sheer strength of will. Together, we will seize this moment. Together, we will make cancer as we know it a disease of the past."""

But today, it's too hard for working people to get ahead and stay ahead.""That's why the Working Families Party is so important.

We'll build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and finally make the minimum wage a living wage. We'll overturn Citizens United and protect every American's right to vote, not every corporation's right to buy elections. We'll end the era of mass incarceration and replace the school-to-prison pipeline with a cradle-to-college and career pipeline. We'll make sure every American can afford a college education and tackle our country's student debt crisis.

We must make sure that all resources are brought to bear in responding to the crisis and helping communities rebuild.""That is why I have called on supporters of this campaign to give what they can to the Red Cross, to bring much-needed aid and supplies to the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods. We also need to make sure that this crisis is not compounded by another, by ensuring mosquito abatement is happening hand-in-hand with flood response, to reduce the riska of mosquitoes that could carry the Zika virus from gaining a foothold in Louisiana.""The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today. I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.""In times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before.

Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"August 24, 2016",Hillary Clinton Statement on EpiPen Pricing,"Today, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement on Mylan Pharmaceuticals and their recent price hike on EpiPens:""Millions of Americans with severe allergies rely on their EpiPens. When an allergic reaction leads to anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death. But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen's manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high.""Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers.""That's outrageous  and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases. But it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.""That's why I've put forward aplanto address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I've made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens.""In addition, when it comes to treatments like delivering epinephrine that have been available for decades, my plan encourages the production of alternative products. That's how we can harness the power of competition to keep drug prices at a level that all Americans can afford."""

Throughout her campaign, Clinton has beenoutspokenabout the need for Congress to respond to the Zika epidemic. And two weeks ago, she visited a medical center in Miami that has been treating Zika patients to learn more about what we can be doing:""The United States faces new threats to public health, from pandemic diseases like those caused by the Ebola and the Zika viruses, to the risk of biological weapons and bioterrorism, to long-term challenges like more extreme weather and expanding ranges for Lyme disease and water-borne illnesses as a result of climate change. And in a global economy, diseases like SARS, MERS, and avian influenza cannot be contained in their countries of origin.""But despite these threats, we are not investing in public health preparedness and emergency response the way we should to keep our families and communities safe. A 2015 study found that spending on public health had fallenmore than 9 percentsince 2008. And uncertain long-term budgets leave our public health agencies dependent on emergency appropriationsmeaning that when Congress fails to step up, communities are left without the resources they need, vaccines languish in development, and more people get sick.""That is why as President, I will create a Public Health Rapid Response Fund, with consistent, year-to-year budgets, to better enable the CDC, HHS, FEMA, state and local public health departments, hospital systems, and other federal agencies to quickly and aggressively respond to major public health crises and pandemics. I will also ensure that our government has strong leadership and is organized to better support and work with people on the ground facing public health challenges. Doctors and public health experts have been warning for months that the Zika virus was likely to reach the continental United States, but Congress has failed to pass the President's emergency funding request. As a result, the Zika virus has gained a foothold in Miami, and 196 people have already been infected in the cityinfections that may have been preventable.""In addition, we need to do more to boost our preparedness for biological threats and bioweapons; to support research for new diagnostic tests, therapeutic treatments, and vaccines for emerging diseases; to build capacity in public health departments; to train the next cadre of public health professionals and ensure that public health and environmental health practices are standard to the educations of medical students; and to provide resources for states and local governments to plan for complex, multi-faceted public health threats, like the impacts of climate change, and build more resilient communities."""

Teamsters keep our planes in the air, they put food on our shelves, and they get packages to our doors. In fighting for better wages and safer conditions on the job, the Teamsters are fighting for all America's workers.""I have always been proud to stand with organized labor to create good jobs with good benefits and wages that make it possible to build a middle-class life. As President, I will stand with organized labor and I will always fight for workers' rights to retire with dignity and security, and to receive the benefits they have earned after years of hard work.""The stakes in this election couldn't be higher. The Republican candidate for President is a man who has said wages are 'too high' in this country. Donald Trump personally signed a contract to hire a union-busting firm to try to stop his workers from organizing in his Las Vegas hotel. His running mate is a man who consistently supported efforts to undermine Social Security and who repealed Indiana's 80-year-old prevailing wage law. Workers deserve better. And both of them support so-called 'right to work' laws that make it harder for workers to organize. I am proud to stand with organized labor against these laws, because 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.""If elected, American workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House--because when unions are strong, America is strong."""

Just this month, they brought together a record-breaking number of LGBT business leaders at their annual convention.""The stakes in this election could not be higher for LGBT Americans. When Donald Trump says he'll 'make America great again,' that's code for 'take America backwards.' He has said he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality. The man Trump chose as his running mate signed a law that opened the door for Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT people and said marriage equality could cause 'societal collapse.' As we've seen in North Carolina, discrimination isn't only wrong  it's bad for business. North Carolina's egregious HB2 measure has caused companies to pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state.""We have our work cut out for us. As President, I'll keep fighting for equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans by passing the Equality Act. And I want to be the small business president and make things easier for small businesses every step of the way. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it  no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.

Standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. uttered words now etched forever in our nation's history:'I have a dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'""His call to action sparked the momentum needed to pass the Voting Rights Act  knocking down legal barriers that had stood for generations, and ensuring every American could exercise their constitutional right to vote.""In 2016, we've come a long way since the days of Jim Crow. Yet too many Americans still face systemic racism and constant assaults on their franchise. Something is profoundly wrong when decades after Dr. King addressed the nation, so many Americans still feel that their country values them less, simply because of the color of their skin.""That's just one reason why the stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before. Those brave men and women who marched, and sat, and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain.""As President, I'll stand up to bluster and bigotry, and fight back against efforts to restrict access to the ballot. Let's make it easier for people to vote, not harder. Let's make sure every state has at least 20 days of in-person voting, and no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot.

And I couldn't be prouder to have them standing with me in this election. The stakes could not be higher.""From the beginning, Donald Trump has based his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He has insulted immigrants and demeaned women. He has called for banning 1.5 million people from so much as entering this country because of their religion. He mocked and mimicked a reporter with a disability. He would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality, and when the time came to choose a running-mate, he selected a man who signed a law that would have allowed Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.""Donald Trump does not understand a basic truth about America: we are stronger together.""Americans don't tear each other downwe lift each other up. We don't build wallswe break down barriers. Together, we'll fight to finally guarantee equal pay for women, protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, and build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.

They are entitled to the benefits they have earned and the respect they deserve.""That's why I am proud to stand with Senator Joe Manchin and the United Mine Workers of America in calling on Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and give the Miners Protection Act a vote before the benefits of these hardworking men and women start expiring later this year.""We also have a shared responsibility to reinvest in the coal communities that have been an engine of American economic growth. That's why last fall, I proposed a comprehensive revitalization and job creation plan including building 21st-century infrastructure and high-speed broadband, repurposing abandoned minelands and power plants to support new economic activity, and creating a Coal Communities Challenge Fund to support locally-driven economic development priorities in small business, agriculture, health care, tourism, housing, and other industries.""And we need to invest in carbon capture and sequestration, which will reduce emissions from coal and natural gas combustion, and will help us meet the global climate challenge more quickly and at lower cost, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That's why I support Senator Heidi Heitkamp and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act, which Senator Kaine has also co-sponsored.""Throughout her campaign, Hillary Clinton has stood up for the healthcare and retirement security of American miners and their families and challenged attempts by coal companies, includingPatriot Coal,Peabody Energy,Alpha Natural Resources,andWalter Energyto use bankruptcy courts to shirk their responsibilities.While under pressure some of these companieshave since reversed course,a federal backstop is required to protect coal miners, their families, and their communities.

This constitutes a direct threat to the United States, and we cannot and will never accept this.I support President Obama's call to both strengthen the sanctions passed earlier this year with the United Nations and to impose additional sanctions. At the same time, we must strengthen defense cooperation with our allies in the region; South Korea and Japan are critical to our missile defense system, which will protect us against a North Korean missile. China plays a critical role, too, and must meaningfully increase pressure on North Korea  and we must make sure they do.This is another reminder that America must elect a President who can confront the threats we face with steadiness and strength. We need a Commander-in-Chief committed to a bipartisan foreign policy, who can bring together top experts with deep experience to solve the toughest challenges. And we need a President committed to reducing  not increasing  the number of nuclear weapons and nuclear states in the world. More countries with nuclear weapons in Northeast Asia would increase the chances of the unthinkable happening. We cannot take that risk."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"September 10, 2016",Statement from Hillary Clinton,"Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half'  that was wrong. But let's be clear, what's really 'deplorable' is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called 'alt-right' movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values. It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. It's deplorable that he's attacked a federal judge for his 'Mexican heritage,' bullied a Gold Star family because of their Muslim faith, and promoted the lie that our first blackpresident is not a trueAmerican. So I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. I also meant what I said last night about empathy, and the very real challenges we face as a country where so many people have been left out and left behind. As I said, many of Trump's supporters are hard-working Americans who just don't feel like the economy or our political system are working for them. I'm determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are 'stronger together.'"""

Law enforcement officials are working to identify who was behind the attacks in New York and New Jersey and we should give them the support they need to finish the job and bring those responsible to justice - we will not rest until that happens. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack in Minnesota, and this should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups. I have laid out a comprehensive plan to do that. This includes launching an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out, and to spot lone wolf attackers. We also need to work with Silicon Valley to counter propaganda and recruitment efforts online. Americans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger. I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear."""
Hillary Clinton ,D,s,"September 20, 2016",Hillary Clinton's Open Letter to Wells Fargo Customers,"Dear Wells Fargo Customers,In America, we have faith that when we open up a checking account, we aren't opening ourselves up to being scammed. Whether you use a local credit union or community bank or one of the big national chains, we take it for granted that those institutions are fulfilling this basic responsibility to their consumers.That's why I was deeply disturbed when, last week, we found out that Wells Fargo had engaged in widespread illegal practices over many years. The bank secretly opened up millions of accounts for customers without their consent  betraying their customers, misusing their personal information and leading many to be slapped with unjust fees and other charges. Today, Wells Fargo's CEO will appear before Congress. He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.There is simply no place for this kind of outrageous behavior in America.Our economy depends on a strong and safe banking system to help keep it moving. But even after Americans spent years working hard to recover from the Great Recession, the culture of misconduct and recklessness that preceded that crisis too often persists.I have a plan to address it.First, we need to defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The unfair and abusive practices at Wells Fargo remind us that we need tough watchdogs looking out for customers. The CFPB worked with local authorities and enforced the law  assessing its highest penalty ever, and bringing the bank's illegal activity into the national spotlight.Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and Wall Street lobbyists are desperate to dismantle this effective agency, which is dedicated solely to protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. I won't let them put the CFPB under their thumb. I'll protect the CFPB and make sure it can continue its essential work on behalf of the American people.Second, we need real consequences when firms on Wall Street break the law. This past week, we learned that one of the Wells Fargo executives that oversaw the division that ripped off its customers left the bank  not with a pink slip, but with a $125 million payout. It's hard to imagine that top executives were unaware of a problem that involved thousands of the firm's employees. After all, they imposed sales targets and compensation incentives in ways that led to this behavior. And it's frustrating that a bank can simply pay a fine and keep doing business as usual  with massive compensation for the executives responsible. That compensation should be clawed back.I've put forward an agenda to enhance accountability on Wall Street. Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch. Their compensation should take a hit if their companies pay major fines. And they must face appropriate legal consequences if they break the law.Third, we need to make sure that no financial institution is too big to manage. I'll put additional safeguards in place to address the risks that the big banks continue to pose to our system. And if any bank can't be managed effectively, it should be broken up.I'll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress. I'll fight hard to make sure that Wall Street is working for Main Street  not the other way around.We need to keep pushing to make the financial system safer and fairer. Let's do it together.Sincerely,Hillary Clinton"

Every single one of those registrations carries the voice of the Muslim-American communityand there's no stronger message against Trump's hateful and divisive rhetoric than Americans coming together with pride and dignity. That's exactly that type of work that Emerge USA does: empower the next generation of Muslims to lead in their communities.""The Muslim community knows that the stakes in this election could not be higher. From proposing to ban all Muslims from entering the United States, to attacking a Muslim Gold Star family whose son sacrificed his life for our country, to suggesting we monitor Muslim communities and places of worship, Trump has spent his entire campaign pitting Americans against each other and denigrating the Muslim-American community. It's shameful. It's disrespectful. It's simply un-American. And it makes us less safe. Donald Trump's constant demonization of Muslims plays straight into ISIS' hands.""While Trump continues to paint a dark and misleading picture of the Muslim-American community, groups like Emerge USA remind us of the incredible contributions the community has made to our country. Muslim-Americans are entrepreneurs and inventors, they are students and teachers, soldiers and police officersin short, they are the best of America.

I have had the great honor of seeing Patriarch Bartholomew's spiritual leadership for myself, and am inspired by his work on human rights, religious tolerance, and environmental protection. I send my best wishes to His All Holiness on this momentous milestone."

In the meantime, we should assist these families in identifying and applying for relief as well establishing an expedited review process. We simply cannot allow this type of mistreatment of veterans, for any reason."""

It's appalling, but it's not surprising. This is a man who personally signed a contract with a union-busting firm to try to stop UNITE HERE and the Culinary Workers' Union from organizing in the first place, and engaged in a months-long intimidation campaign to bully his workers against voting to form a union.""I was proud to visit workers on the picket line at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and even prouder when they overcame Donald Trump's intimidation campaign and were officially certified as a union earlier this year. I believe that when unions are strong, families are strongand when families are strong, America is strong. And I will always stand with workers in protecting their rights to organize, bargain collectively, be safe on the job and retire with dignity, and if I am elected President, workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House."""
