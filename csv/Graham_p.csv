Lindsey Graham,R,p,"June 1, 2015","""I'm Running!"": Initial Email Sent by Lindsey Graham Announcing His Campaign for President","Just moments ago I officially announced that I am running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States.Will you stand with me today as a DAY ONE Founding Member of my campaign? Please follow this link to make an instant online contribution.I did not make this decision lightly. After months of consideration and years of working to protect and secure our country, I knew I could still do more.Our country very much needs a proven leader...Who is ready to be Commander in Chief on Day One and has the conviction to defeat our enemies...Who can inspire Americans to build on the best our country has to offer...And who can cast a vision for a strong, secure and prosperous nation that Americans can rally around and give their full support.The greatest issue America faces is the growing threat to our nation's security from terrorist organizations with more capabilities, more arms, more recruits and more safe havens to attack the U.S. than at any time before 9/11.I recently retired as a Colonel from the U.S. Air Force Reserves after a 33-year career in the Air Force, National Guard and Reserves. I've visited and served in Afghanistan and the Middle East more than 20 times gaining first-hand knowledge about terror groups that threaten our way of life.I have the understanding, experience and leadership that is needed to protect this country. If you agree that we need an experienced leader in the White House, then I hope you will stand with me today by making a Day One supporter donation.I'm running for President to do the big things. I believe in the near future our great country is going to face tremendous challenges  both at home and abroad  and we are going to need proven leadership to meet those challenges.I have a proven conservative record of getting things done and bringing common-sense solutions to the table. I've been in the middle of debates, confrontations and decision-making on the critical issues  taxes, job creation, debt, Social Security, energy, military spending and foreign policy.More than anything, our nation needs a president who will make the tough decisions needed to keep us safe and carry on the great promise of America.I am hoping that today I can count on you to become a Day One Founding Member of my presidential campaign.The road ahead will not be easy, but I take comfort knowing I have your friendship and support.Sincerely,Lindsey GrahamP.S. I am 100% committed to becoming the Republican nominee for president and going one-on-one against Hillary Clinton next year. I promise a hard-hitting, honest and winning fight, but I need your immediate help to ensure we have the funds needed to do so. Please send whatever you can afford today. Thanks, Lindsey"

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"June 4, 2015",Press Release - An American Upbringing," ""Now He's Ready To Take Those Leadership Skills To The White House"" Following today's announcement of his presidential campaign, Senator Lindsey Graham released the following web video, entitled ""An American Upbringing."" The video highlights his life experiences, expertise in foreign policy and describes how his background makes him uniquely qualified to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.VIDEO SCRIPT:""Some men are born leaders, others are tested, refined and forged through life's experiences.""Lindsey Graham is both.""Lindsey was born the son of a blue-collar family in the small town of Central in upstate South Carolina. His parents worked long hours to eke out a modest living running a tiny restaurant and liquor store.""From a young age, Lindsey learned about hard work and the value of a dollar. Like small business owners everywhere, if Lindsey's parents didn't open the doors each day, they didn't get paid  there were no sick days, and very few vacations. It was here that Lindsey learned to pull his own weight - both by helping with the business, and helping raise his younger sister, Darline.""Lindsey Graham was the first in his family to go to college. But, while attending the University of South Carolina, both of his parents tragically passed away.""While most young men his age were enjoying campus life, Lindsey took on the added responsibility of traveling home weekends to work in the family business and help care for Darline. With his parents gone, Lindsey was committed to providing for his sister. He took that commitment a step further by legally adopting her when she was in high school and with the help of a loving aunt and uncle, Lindsey made sure she not only finished high school but earned her college degree.""Despite these challenges and adversity, the work ethic he learned from his parents paid off; Lindsey graduated from USC with both a bachelor and law degree.""Following law school, Graham joined the Air Force. After 6 and a half years on active duty as a JAG officer, he joined the South Carolina Air National Guard and served stateside during the first Gulf War. Graham wore the uniform for 33 years, retiring this year as a Colonel with the Air Force Reserves.""First elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 and the Senate in 2002, Lindsey Graham has become the go-to-guy on Capitol Hill for national security and foreign policy issues, in part because of his military experience.""He has served as a reserve duty officer in Iraq and Afghanistan and has been to the Middle East more than 20 times, gaining first-hand knowledge about ISIS, the Taliban and other terror groups that threaten our way of life.""Because of his expertise on foreign policy issues, Lindsey Graham has been an outspoken critic of President Obama's failed foreign policy. His knowledge and experience makes him uniquely qualified to correct the mistakes of the past while providing the steady leadership and decision-making skills we need to keep America safe.""A respected problem solver, Lindsey Graham is a true conservative who's willing to tackle any issue head on - whether it's fighting for the American taxpayer or protecting and defending our constitutional rights.""Blue-collar upbringing, tireless work ethic, allegiance to family values, and a lifetime of military service, Lindsey Graham has lived the American dream - from sleeping in the backroom of a tiny restaurant to becoming a respected leader in the United States Senate. Now he is ready to take those leadership skills to the White House, to restore faith in America's exceptionalism, and our belief that the United States is still the leader... and best hope... for a free and safe world."""

In case you missed it, check out the video of the senator's remarks here and take a look at some of the coverage his announcement week made:""...as he announced his presidential bid Monday here in the tiny town where he grew up, Lindsey Graham sought to knock down the idea that he's a creature of Washington and instead told a personal story that's largely been overlooked over the course of his two decades in the House and Senate. It's the tale of a son of pool hall owners, who grew up near-impoverished in the back room of his parents' bar.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"June 10, 2015",Press Release - Statement On Letter From New Hampshire Leaders On Debate Criteria,"Alexandria, VA  Christian Ferry, Campaign Manager for Lindsey Graham 2016, today released the following statement on the letter, as reported by The Weekly Standard, regarding the Republican presidential debate criteria. See the full letter here.""We are thankful to the leaders in New Hampshire who wrote FOX and the RNC today to protect their well established and effective primary process. Our party has a tried and true system of early state caucuses and primaries, which allow voters the opportunity to personally interact with the candidates, see them in small group settings and make informed decisions without the filter of the media. The early states give candidates the opportunity to gain traction through grassroots campaigning and direct interaction with voters. A reliance on national polling to determine who participates in debates steals the traditional role of the early primary states.""We hope media outlets and the RNC will heed the advice of leaders in New Hampshire and other early primary states and revise their debate criteria so voters, rather than national polls, make determinations about who our nominee for president will be."""

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"June 12, 2015",Press Release - Letter to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus On Debate Criteria,"Alexandria, VA  Lindsey Graham 2016 Campaign Manager Christian Ferry released a letter sent to Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, regarding restrictive criteria for the first two RNC ""sanctioned debates."" Mr. Ferry expressed the concern, shared by dozens of activists in early primary and caucus states, that an exclusive reliance on national ""horse race"" polls will cause significant harm to the important role that Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and other early state voters have historically had in selecting a Republican nominee for President.Lindsey Graham 2016 applauds the RNC's leadership in taking an active role in the primary debate process, and urges the Chairman, the Debate Committee, and the full membership to stand up for its stated goal of making sure all Republican candidates have an equitable opportunity to make their case directly to voters through these sanctioned debates.Excerpts from the letter are below and the full letter can be found here.""I am troubled by the nationalization of the presidential primary process brought on by the decision to use national polls to determine which candidate is on what debate stage. This decision has a negative impact on the traditional role of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. I understand the position in which the RNC finds itself, but strongly believe the RNC has a responsibility to ensure these debates are open to all candidates in an equal manner, thereby protecting the early state primary and caucus system....""Our party has a tried and true system of early state caucuses and primaries, which allow voters the opportunity to personally interact with the candidates, see them in small group settings and make informed decisions without the filter of the media. The early state process prevents money and celebrity from being the determining factor in the presidential contest..."" ""A reliance on national polling steals the traditional role of the early primary states....""The fact is, the RNC continues to have influence over the media networks and could easily pull its backing from any network sponsored debate if the network does not give all the candidates for president an opportunity to participate on an equal footing. By refusing to publicly speak out against the media imposed restrictions, the RNC is placing exorbitant influence over our primary process into the hands of media executives instead of the voters of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and the other early primary states....""The only fair solution to the current proposed rules is for each network to hold consecutive debates, dividing the field via some sort of random draw. This solution would provide each candidate for president the opportunity to present his case to the Republican primary electorate."""

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"June 25, 2015",Press Release - Washington Free Beacon: How Lindsey Graham Would Defeat the Islamic State,"Washington Free Beacon: How Lindsey Graham Would Defeat the Islamic StateBy Daniel WiserJune 25, 2015Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) laid out a detailed plan for defeating the Islamic State terrorist group in an interview Wednesday with the Washington Free Beacon, offering a frank assessment of the necessity for more U.S. troops and a two-front strategy for Iraq and Syria.Concerns continue to be raised about the current U.S. strategy for defeating the Islamic State (IS), which now reportedly controls more than half of Syria and seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi last month. Despite U.S. airstrikes and the presence of about 3,500 troops to train and advise Iraqi forces, the Obama administration's plan to ""degrade and destroy"" IS does not appear to have slowed the group's momentum.Graham, one of the leading GOP voices on foreign policy and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said ""...Obama and [Vice President Joe] Biden have been very lousy generals"" in the fight against IS. He added that the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 only emboldened neighboring Iran, which has expanded its influence in Iraq by backing Shiite militias.""Nothing you see today was unpredictable,"" he said. ""It was the natural, logical consequence of a poor decision by the president.""Graham said he agrees with retired Gen. Jack Keane, one of the architects of the surge strategy in the Iraq War, on the need to deploy about 10,000 U.S. troops to Iraq. This would include aviation battalions and special operations forces that could call in airstrikes and better assist Iraqi forces on the front lines. The raid last month by U.S. commandos that killed a senior IS official in Syria should be replicated, he said.""If I were president we'd be doing that every night in Syria and Iraq,"" he said. ""They would never get a minute's sleep.""More U.S. advisers on the ground would also expedite the training of Iraqi forces and Sunni Muslim tribal fighters from the western Anbar province, who remain distrustful of the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad and its ties to Iran, he said....As president, Graham said he would tell Americans, ""if we don't deal with the threats over there, they're coming here.""""I've never seen so many terrorist organizations with so many safe havens, so much money, so many men, equipment, and material to hit the homeland as I do today,"" he said.IS has also demonstrated an ability to expand its so-called caliphate and global influence, making inroads in Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen, and inspiring attacks in Paris and Texas.""This is not a regional conflict,"" he said. ""This is a worldwide struggle of good versus evil, religious Nazis against the rest of us.""Turning to Syria, he said the chaotic civil war there ""makes Iraq look like a cakewalk."" ......The U.S.-trained rebels also do not have explicit approval to target Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a situation that Graham said has undermined regional support for the effort and must change. He said he would assemble a regional force composed of troops from Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to topple Assad and eradicate IS and other terrorist groups in Syria. Yet he added that ""big Arab armies haven't really fought much,"" meaning that more U.S. commandos will be required to give them a logistical edge and act as forward air controllers to improve the accuracy of airstrikes.Once IS has been decimated from Iraq and Syria, U.S. allies must hold the territory and begin a process of reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites, he said. A political settlement could begin to heal a post-Assad Syria, while neutralizing the influence of Iran in Iraq would create more stability in that country and the region. Graham added that he ""would walk away"" from the current nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran and ramp up pressure on Tehran with additional sanctions.Americans must be prepared for the long-term challenge in the region of rooting out IS and rolling back Iran's influence, he said, dismissing quick solutions such as the partition of Iraq and Syria.""This mess has got many tentacles to it,"" he said. ""As you pull up the caliphate by its roots, you've got to explain to the American peoplethis is going to be a long struggle to hold this ground, rebuild Syria and Iraq.""Read the full article here.###"

""He should have listened to his commanders.""Graham served in the U.S. Air Force and recently ended his military career as a colonel in the Air Force Reserves after 33 years.""If you're looking for a guy who will tell you we can beat ISIL without sending in more troops, I'm not your guy,"" Graham admitted. He suggested he would raise the troop count from 3,500 to 10,000 to deal with the enemy. ""I want our special forces guys on the ground killing these guys every night.""The candidate insisted Iraq can't be fixed without fixing Syria and Graham said Obama doesn't have a plan for Syria. He suggested bringing together other players in the region to gather their military might and work with the U.S. and go in and put this terrorist threat down for good.""There is a desire in the Middle East for America to come back,"" he said. ""And they need to stop funding terrorists.""The senator continued, ""Terrorism is growing because of the vacuum in Iran and Syria. The Middle East is falling apart. These guys are promising a glorious death. We need to be selling a hopeful life.""That would involve having a presence in the region to help establish infrastructure and opportunity, working with law enforcement and helping to setup educational opportunities for those who live in the region to succeed.""That will not be easy, but if somebody doesn't do it, there will be another 9/11. The reason they only killed 3,000 instead of 3 million was because they couldn't get a weapon to kill 3 million. But they're trying.""Graham also stressed the importance of keeping nuclear capability out of Iran. He indicated that any deal that doesn't include unrestricted access to Iran's nuclear project sites is a bad deal and shouldn't be made. The senator also noted that no funding should be sent to Iran as they will simply add it to their war chest....[Graham] knows first hand the importance of social security in the lives of families and is dedicated to fighting for its survival.""What would I do to save Social Security? Almost anything. Because it was there when my family needed it,"" Graham said of the survivor benefits he and his sister received when their parents past.But something has to give he pointed out, people are living longer and the working population is shrinking. Today, two people are being asked to fund one when the job used to fall on 16.""There are 80 million baby boomers that are going to retire. We want our money,"" he said, smiling.The keys to saving the program is raising the retirement age for ""younger"" workers and eliminating medical subsidies to those in high-end income brackets.""People in my income level can pay a little more or take a little less ... we're running out of money,"" Graham said, adding something has to give. ""We made more promises than we can keep. It's a problem for Japan. A problem for Western Europe. ... We're going to become Greece if we don't change.""He added, ""There's no easy way out  but there's a way out.""The key is leadership according to Graham. He indicated a need to get Republicans, Democrats and Independents in a room together to work things out because there is no other choice.""There's an $18 trillion deficit,"" the senator said. ""It's a result of bipartisanship. One party can't get you $18 trillion in debt.""...The candidate was asked, why, knowing what's causing the problems, is the United States still in the mess it's in?Graham's answer was simple, pointing out that people in his profession are worried about remaining in their position. ""Every bill is a jobs bill  our jobs.""During his opening comments, Graham took a few moments to thank everyone for the prayers regarding the recent tragedy in the state involving a teen and a racially motivated assault on a black church congregation which killed several members.""It's been a tough couple of weeks at home,"" he said. ""We have really been on people's minds ... Since that day until now, the people are looking forward. People are coming together in South Carolina like never before....Graham also addressed the role of the Iowa Caucus in the presidential election process.""The caucuses are good for democracy. Don't let them take away your caucuses,"" he said.Read The Full Story Here."

The Republican senator from South Carolina, meeting with Des Moines Register reporters and editors, outlined his ideas for comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He called out members of his own party who lump undocumented immigrants in the same category as rapists and drug dealers.He said he thinks climate change is real and must be addressed in a way that doesn't wreck the economy. He includes means testing for Social Security in a plan for entitlement reform that also includes raising the retirement age. He wants a flatter, simpler tax code but scoffs at the idea of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.Graham also wants to ban abortion after 20 weeks, repeal Obamacare while retaining a few provisions, and take a far more active military role in the world than the current administration is pursuing. He argues that the ability to make judicial appointments is the ""big prize"" for 2016 and he doesn't want Hillary Clinton to have it.

But the three-term senator from South Carolina can shift quickly and effortlessly from well-worn jokes to an intense discussion of the terrorist threat facing the United States.His blunt assessment of that threat has repeatedly led to charges that he needlessly resorts to hyperbole to make his point. (""The world is literally about to blow up,"" he said last year. ""The world is exploding in terror and violence ... The world is falling apart,"" he warned this spring.) But even Graham's detractors admit that as one of the most experienced candidates in a field of 16 Republicans expected to seek the party's nomination for president, Graham's biggest asset may be his willingness to tell voters things they don't want to hear.With regard to normalized relations with Cuba, for example, he told the Des Moines Register's Editorial Board this week that as president he would not normalize relations with present-day Cuba, despite the negative impact that could have on businesses in Iowa and elsewhere.""There's something more important here than just making a buck,"" he said. ""If you're doing business here in Iowa, I'm all for that, but you're not going to do business with Cuba until Cuba changes. It's not about money. Money is not everything that's important in this world.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 7, 2015",Press Release - Lexington Herald Leader: Lindsey Graham: A candidate unafraid to say the unpopular,"Lindsey Graham: A candidate unafraid to say the unpopularBy Ruben NavarretteLexington Herald Leader (KY)July 7, 2015Lindsey Graham just did something that in the world of politics  simply isn't done.The Republican senator from South Carolina, and 2016 presidential hopeful, performed a public service recently when he reminded us  at a town hall in Sioux City, Iowa  that running for president is about more than just winning a popularity contest. Often times, authentic leadership  especially on tough and controversial issues  requires saying and doing things that are unpopular.Like when someone stands up at a campaign event and suggests that the best way to fight the war on terror and keep America safe against the Islamic State is to outlaw Islam.How did Graham respond? I'll tell you in a minute.But first, here's some context to help explain why what happened next is so incredibly rare in American politics.Being an effective leader ought to be about telling voters the cold truth, instead of longing for a warm embrace. Running for office has become too much about striving to be liked....I had just about given up on finding someone who, when running for president, would tell the truth even if voters didn't want to hear it, push back against constituents who were trying to rope him into taking wild positions, and flat-out tell people not to vote for him rather than pander to crazies. That's the great Catch-22 of politics: You can't be someone who deserves to be elected unless you're willing to stand your ground in ways that might cost you votes.That's what Graham did in Sioux City. When the audience member suggested that we make a crime out of being Muslim, the Republican cut him off.""You know what, I'm not your candidate,"" he said. ""I don't want you to vote for me. I couldn't disagree with you more.""According to The Des Moines Register, Graham insisted that the best strategy for dealing with the Islamic State is to beef up the U.S. military and send more ground troops to Iraq. Not outlaw Islam.""The bottom line is I'm not trying to please him,"" Graham told a reporter after the event. ""I'm not putting up with that. He's got a right to say whatever he wants to say, but I have an obligation to the Republican Party, to the people of Iowa and the country as a whole to be firm on this. I'm not buying into that construct. That's not the America that I want to lead.""According to the newspaper, the man who asked the question left the event quickly.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 7, 2015",Press Release - New Hampshire Union Leader Op-Ed: Lindsey Graham: Want to Defeat ISIL? Here's How I Would Do It,"Alexandria, VA  Today, New Hampshire's Union Leader published Senator Graham's opinion editorial explaining how he would defeat ISIL if he were President of the United States. In case you missed it, view the article here and read the full text below:THE OBAMA-CLINTON Doctrine of ""strategic patience"" is a failure. It has led to allies who doubt our resolve and enemies who challenge us at home and abroad. Terrorist groups, like ISIL, are rich and growing while President Obama runs out the clock on his time in office.He states ISIL must now be turned back and Syria's Bashar al Assad must go. But he has no strategy for achieving these goals. His recent announcement of 450 additional troops amounts to nothing more than duct tape, a desperate attempt to hold together a crumbling Middle East just long enough for his successor to step in.I am running to be the next President. I am ready to change course on day one and demonstrate to friends and foes alike we have the capability, capacity and will to secure our nation. Today, the American military footprint in Iraq is insufficient in numbers and capabilities to regenerate an effective Iraqi fighting force. One of the architects of the 2007 Surge has said 10,000 American forces will be necessary to change the tide of battle. I agree. The current force that President Obama has dispatched is inadequate and will not lead to ISIL's demise.I would send additional forces as part of a new, comprehensive strategy for victory. These forces would allow us to put trainers and advisers with the Iraqis at the battalion level to strengthen their resolve. I would use air controllers and attack helicopters to create and continually apply pressure on ISIL's leadership. I would also change the approach in Syria. The current plan to train 5,000 Free Syrian Army soldiers puts us woefully behind ISIL's ability to recruit foreign fighters.And President Obama's hope of defeating Assad appears purely aspirational. Our Arab allies no longer accept another Iranian puppet wreaking havoc on the region. As long as Assad remains, he will be a magnet for radical Sunnis looking for a fight. The flow of Syrian refugees will continue to stream into neighboring nations, pushing our partners to the brink of a crisis they cannot contain. In particular, we cannot allow our friend, the King of Jordan, to be undermined by the bloodletting. He remains one of the best and strongest voices for moderation in the region.The situation in the Middle East will never be fixed while Assad remains. I would drive him from power by bringing together a regional effort with the support of forces from Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others. No Arab Army will commit to fighting ISIL while leaving Assad in power, and America should not take on this fight without regional support.As President, I would also provide enough American capability within this regional force to ensure success. The specialties we possess are lacking in regional forces, but are essential to the destruction of ISIL and pushing Assad out of power. The American ground component in Syria would be similar to that of Iraq, including Special Forces units, logistical support and an embedded U.S. presence at the Brigade level.We must understand that Iraq and Syria constitute a single battle space in the fight against ISIL and our approach must be comprehensive. We must also understand a complementary diplomatic effort is essential. To hold Syria, the Alawites, Sunnis and other factions must reach political consensus. In Iraq, a diplomatic surge in Baghdad is as imperative as any additional ground forces. However, no solution is achievable unless we first have security. That is the lesson our nation and I learned from the 2007 Surge.I would also heed the lessons of Obama's disastrous 2011 withdrawal from Iraq and refuse to hastily withdraw all our forces from the region. An American presence is critical to ensuring these areas do not fall into chaos once again. Finally, I would be honest with the American people about what kind of commitment this would entail, even when the truth is hard to hear.Under the failed leadership of President Obama and former Secretary Clinton, Syria and Iraq have become the perfect base from which to launch attacks directly against our nation by seasoned fighters holding Western passports. It is a base from which they already project a barbaric form of power that inspires other radicals and lone wolves, from Paris to Garland, Texas, while committing their heinous acts, including attempts at the systematic destruction of the Christian religion in the Middle East.Neither the denial of isolationists nor rudderless half measures will secure our nation. Only a bold strategy, backed by the firm resolve of a determined President will rid the world of both ISIL and Assad, stabilize the region, and prevent the forces of radical Islam from bringing their fight to our homeland once again.Our current Commander in Chief has neither the strategy nor the resolve. Hillary Clinton proved she lacks them too. I am ready on day one with both. "

I have a clear strategy to prevent a nuclear Iran, to confront ISIL and Radical Islam, to drive Bashar Assad from power, and to re-establish stability in the Middle East. I will restore our relationship with the State of Israel. I will engage with our Arab allies to achieve a regional solution. I will reinvigorate NATO and shore up the resolve of our European allies to develop a strategy to take on Putin. I will make it clear to our friends and our enemies that the U.S. once again has the capability, capacity, and will to be the world's greatest force for security.""  Senator Lindsey GrahamKEY OBJECTIVESDevelop Capability, Capacity, And WillWe must demonstrate we have superior capability, overwhelming capacity, and determined will to protect our nation and confront the forces that threaten global stability and security. Friends and foes alike must see we will no longer capitulate to our adversaries, alienate our allies, or abandon those who are confronting the naked aggressions of dictatorial regimes. We will reclaim our leadership role  backed by the necessary resources and resolve  and confront head-on the threats to our security. The plan is very simple: whatever it takes, as long as it takes, until we defeat them.Present Clear, Comprehensive Strategies For Directly Taking On ThreatsFrom Iran's nuclear ambitions and growing regional influence, to the rise of ISIL and Radical Islam, to Putin's aggressions in Eastern and Central Europe, to China's assault on freedom of navigation in the Asia Pacific region, the forces of violence and chaos are going unchecked. We must develop a global strategy for enhancing our security and our leadership role in a dangerous worldProvide The Necessary Resources To Deploy Both Hard And Soft PowerWe cannot secure our nation or reassert American leadership abroad while gutting our military or our ability to engage in development and diplomacy. Sequestration's non-strategic across-the-board cuts have diminished our capabilities while failing to address our national debt, which is itself a long-term threat to our security and prosperity. We must restore support for vital national security programs while addressing the largest source of our current and future debt  entitlement spending  through fundamental reforms that fully fund our security needs, rein in our debt, and put us on a secure and sustainable path.POLICY INITIATIVESIranPrevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability, which could be deployed against the U.S., Israel, or other allies, or shared with radical Islamic groups.Reject a bad deal. The current talks are on the brink of flooding Tehran with cash at the very outset, and ultimately making Iran a nuclear threshold state. This is a direct threat to Israel, the region, the United States, and the world.Return to the negotiating table only when Iran is prepared to accept terms that will end its nuclear weapons ambitions and its support for terrorism. This includes:Anywhere, anytime inspectionsA full accounting of the possible military dimensions of Iran's past nuclear programsSanctions relief only after Iran has fully complied with the terms of the deal and ended its support for terrorism in the regionRebuild a strong regional coalition with our Israeli and Arab allies to not only prevent a nuclear Iran, but to address its rising influence, its support for terrorists, its destabilizing efforts, and its conventional military build-up.Repair and rebuild our relationship with the State of Israel. This long-standing partnership with our close friend and only democratic ally in the Middle East is the bedrock of any hope for peace in the region.Ensure our regional allies have the resources  including weapons and defensive technology  to effectively combat Iran's aggressions.Iraq, Syria, And The Rise Of ISILSend a force of 10,000 troops in support of a coordinated regional effort to reestablish stability and put radical extremist groups like ISIL in a box. A force of this size would allow us to train and advise Iraqi forces at the battalion level, and would be part of a comprehensive strategy that will:Arm, train, and equip moderate forces, including the Kurds, who are taking the fight to ISIL and Bashar Al-AssadCreate safe zones, backed by no-fly zonesAggressively apply air power, including attack helicoptersExpand intelligence operationsFully utilize special operations capability to apply constant pressure on ISIL's leadershipWork in concert with our regional allies to develop a regional solution to the conflict in Syria and the spread of radical extremist groups.Our military presence and objectives in the region are not unilateral and cannot be allowed to be portrayed as such. This is a joint effort for security and stability that demands both U.S. leadership and broad regional cooperation.We must lead a united effort with the full support and involvement of our key partners  including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt  in order to ensure our success while limiting the burden on American troops and taxpayers.The execution of a regional effort  including the timing of the withdrawal of U.S. troops  must be based on a coherent strategy and circumstances on the ground, so that our gains are not reversed and our sacrifices squandered.Provide necessary humanitarian assistance, particularly in Syria, to combat the conditions of a failing state, which breed violence and can lead to the creation of terrorist safe havens.Syria is the source of the world's most acute refugee and IDP crisis, in the midst of a conflict that has already resulted in over 200,000 dead, half of which are civilians. The human costs are incalculable, while the devastation and chaos create a vacuum filled by ISIL, Al-Qaeda, and Iran.The destabilizing impact of this crisis is not only felt in Syria, but also in partner nations like Jordan, posing further threats to our security.

The senator detailed the U.S. troop levels he would want to see in Iraq (10,000), Afghanistan (9,800) and Syria (about 10,000, as part of a regional force) and warned darkly that he wanted to see a good deal with Iran over its nuclear ambitions  something he doubted President Barack Obama could achieve. If a military conflict was necessary, he said, Tehran would lose....Graham is also one of the GOP's biggest proponents of immigration reform, an issue he touched on toward the end of his appearance when he asserted that he didn't need a ""lecture"" on the issue from either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 9, 2015","Press Release - Graham: ""As President of the United States, I Would Shape World Events Rather Than Being Overwhelmed by Them""","Alexandria, VA - Senator Lindsey Graham outlined his national security agenda yesterday as the inaugural guest at the Atlantic Council's series ""America's Role in the World"" in Washington, DC. Graham addressed a wide range of foreign policy issues, including the negotiations with Iran, defeating radical Islam, securing Afghanistan, driving out Assad, and stabilizing Syria.Senator Graham is the first 2016 presidential candidate to outline a comprehensive approach to national security.CLICK TO WATCH THE FULL VIDEO:On The Failed Policies Of President Obama And Hillary Clinton: ""President Obama's Foreign Policy Has Been A Disaster, And Former Secretary Of State Clinton Was One Of The Chief Architects""""As recently as Monday of this week, President Obama claimed that our strategy against ISIL is working and that we're more prepared to deal with major attacks against the homeland. In my view, the president constantly oversells our successes and minimizes the threats to our nation. There is no coherent strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL, and there are more radical Islamic groups with the capability and capacity and desire to strike our homeland than at any time since 9-11. Our defenses are being overwhelmed by the number of threats. And as the threats grow we continue to cut our budget and embrace strategies that are designed not to destroy ISIL but to pass this problem along to the next president. Simply put, President Obama's foreign policy has been a disaster, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of its chief architects.""On His National Security Approach: ""Superior Capability, Overwhelming Capacity And, Most important Of All, Determined Will""""When it comes to foreign policy, Lindsey Graham offers a very clear and different path. The path that I embrace is going to be tough. But the outcome would ensure a safe America. The Obama-Clinton path has been one from leading from behind, hoping that threats would go away, claiming to have strategies to defeat and degrade ISIL that actually have no chance of working.""The foundation of my foreign policy would be as follows: Superior capability, overwhelming capacity and, most important of all, determined will. Without superior capability and overwhelming capacity, you invite aggression. And under the construct of sequestration, we're losing our capability and our capacity in hard and soft power. But without will, it's all talk.""On A Strategy To Degrade And Destroy ISIL: ""We Would Decapitate Their Leadership""""The strategy articulated by President Obama to degrade and destroy ISIL doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of working. You have to look at Iraq and Syria as a single battle space... You will never bring stability to Iraq, unless you deal with the Syrian safe havens. The capital of the caliphate is in Syria, not Iraq. I believe that you must have strategy with a ground component beyond the Kurds to actually destroy the caliphate inside Syria.""We have 3,500 American forces within Iraq. Too few to do what we need to do. If I were President of the United States I would follow Jack Keane's advice and increase ground forces on the U.S. side inside of Iraq. We would go to approximately 10,000... There would be a Special Forces component. That Special Forces component would hunt the leadership of ISIL morning, noon, and night. Not just a single raid, but multiple raids. We would decapitate their leadership.""On A Good Deal With Iran: ""I Want A Deal, But I Want A Good Deal""""I want a deal, but I want a good deal. A bad deal would create a nuclear arms race in the Mid-East. What is a bad deal? A deal in the eyes of the Sunni Arabs that gives the Iranians too much capability, so they could no longer sit on the sidelines as Sunni Arabs and not get into the nuclear arena themselves.""If I were president, I would create an international inspection regime unlike anything you've ever seen. Anytime, anywhere would mean anytime, anywhere. I would not give them a dollar more of money until they change their behavior... the inspection regime would not end based on the passage of time, it would end based on the change in behavior.""On Winning The War On Terror: ""It's A Roaring Hot Fire Today, Radical Islam, My Goal Is To Make It An Ember""""What is winning in the war on terror? Winning to me is when radical Islam can be contained by the armies and police forces within the region where it arose. That they have the capability to keep it at bay to protect themselves and us.""It's a roaring hot fire today, radical Islam, my goal is to make it an ember... That's going to take, ladies and gentlemen, a generational commitment. A small schoolhouse in a remote region in Afghanistan...educating a young girl would do more damage to the Taliban than any bomb we could drop on their head.""On Iran's Nuclear Ambitions: ""The Most Existential Threat To World Order Is The Nuclear Ambitions Of The Iranians""""The most existential threat to world order is the nuclear ambitions of the Iranians. There are some things you can get wrong and live to fight anther day. There are some things you have to get right, because if you don't, you will throw the world into chaos that we haven't seen since World War II. ...the Iranian regime is not moderate.""As to the nuclear ambitions of the Iranians. If you want a peaceful nuclear power program, and I'm president, you can have it... If you want an enrichment program large in nature that will lead one day to a nuclear breakout, like North Korea, you will not have it. If you want a war, you will lose it.""On Assad And Syria: ""Assad Wouldn't Last Two Minutes Without Iranian Support""""Assad wouldn't last two minutes without Iranian support. If Syria continues the way it's going in the next year, I fear that Lebanon and Jordan will collapse...What happens if we continue on the same track? What are the consequences to the region, if Assad is still in power in January 2017? ""There are more Syrian children in Lebanese schools at the primary level, than there are Lebanese children. The King of Jordan is being overwhelmed by Syrian refugees. At the end of the day, if Syria is not addressed, it's going to take Lebanon and Jordan down with it.""On Embracing Dictatorships: ""And As We Confront Dictators, The Worst Possible Thing You Can Do Is Draw A Red Line, They Cross It And Nothing Happens""""President Obama, I think, has blinked in the face of many challenges. The Arab Spring is still alive and well. The Arab Spring is a desire by women, young people and the disenfranchised to live a better life...So to anybody who wants to be President of the United States and embraces bringing back dictators, I think you've made two fundamental mistakes. One, you don't realize who we are as a nation. And number two, you don't understand what's going on in the world, especially in the Middle East...Young people, women and the disenfranchised will not live in dictatorships for our convenience any longer...""And as we confront dictators, the worst possible thing you can do is draw a red line, they cross it and nothing happens.""On The Primary Job Of The President Of The United States, Graham: ""President Of The United States' Primary Job... Is To Be Commander-In-Chief""""Number one. President of the United States' primary job, I think, is to be Commander-in-Chief. It's the most important job any president has to perform and we spend precious little time talking about it...We move from one outrageous topic to the other and it's pretty hard to focus on national security at a time when we should, so thank God that there's a place like the Atlantic Council.""On Being President Of The United States: ""I Would Shape World Events Rather Than Being Overwhelmed By Them""""As President of the United States, I would shape world events rather than being overwhelmed by them...I believe radical Islam in terms of what they want to do. I reject what they want to do. And as President of the United States, I will empower others to stop them... When it comes to being Commander-in-Chief, whatever it takes, as long as it takes."""

""It's because I want to defend a nation.""Even before Wednesday's speech, Graham was identified as the most hawkish of the 14 Republicans who have officially entered the 2016 presidential race.

My policy toward radical Islam is pretty simple: Whatever it takes, as long as it takes until we defeat them. So when he says he's not for an open-ended commitment I don't know what that means. It means he's hesitant. I'm not.""When it comes to Syria, Jeb and Marco and all these guys need to step up. What are you going to do? Are you going to impose a no-fly zone? I would do it the first day on the job. Assad's going to go standing up or sitting down. Because you can't fix Syria and the Mid-East until you fix Syria. So I would put on the table American troops would go in with Arab armies. The bulk of the force would be the Turks, the Egyptians, the Saudis and others in the region. You're talking about 30 to 40,000, at least, [ISLAMIC STATE] guys in Syria, it's going to take a big army to pull them up.

Kevin Costner was nowhere in sight, and there were no ghosts of early 20th century baseball players either.Nonetheless, when Lindsey Graham and I made it to the edge of right field at the iconic cornfield diamond in rural Iowa where ""Field of Dreams"" was shot, I considered asking the South Carolina senator to participate in a no-budget re-enactment of the movie's most memorable image.But Graham, I reminded myself, is seeking the nation's highest office, not a fleeting moment of Internet video notoriety.And so I began reassuring the Republican presidential candidate that I wasn't going to request that he wade into the corn for the benefit of our cameras. Before I could get the words out of my mouth, Graham had already taken his first step into the dense crop...Emerging from the corn like ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, Graham took a swing of an imaginary bat and offered me a celebratory fist bump  his preferred greeting to everyone under 40 whom he's encountered in the nation's first caucus state....In an era of carefully stage-managed events and always-on-script candidates, Graham was as freewheeling in his style as he was eager to highlight the areas in which he disagrees with Republican orthodoxy. When he was challenged repeatedly over his support for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol grounds or his opposition to advocating a constitutional amendment against gay marriage, he pushed back with vigor.At several points throughout the day, he brought up, without prompting, his support for comprehensive immigration reform  a deeply unpopular position among broad swaths of Iowa's Republican caucus-goers....Read Full Story Here"

So if I'm president, to the Iranians: If you try to breakout and get a nuclear weapon, we're going to stop you. We're going to put all of the force on the table that's necessary to keep you from getting a nuclear weapon, because I'm afraid they would use it...If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, they're the biggest threat to the world and I would not allow that to happen and they need to know that.""On The Obama Administration's Handling Of The Negotiations: ""...Everybody Running For President, Except Rand Paul, Could Negotiate A Better Deal...Give The Next President A Chance...""""I think a good outcome is to basically leave the interim deal in place. I think everybody running for president, except Rand Paul, could negotiate a better deal than the Obama Administration. Because when they drew that red line with Assad and did nothing about it, they're weak in the eyes of the Iranians. They don't believe Obama would use military force. So give the next president a chance to conclude a final agreement with the Iranians. And please understand. Of all the mistakes we could make as a world and as a nation, getting a bad deal with Iran is the worst possible outcome...So let's let somebody new negotiate because Obama's so flawed as a negotiator."""

""If it is true we are lifting an arms embargo without a change in behavior you have set in motion re-arming the most radical regime in the Middle East. From our point of view, I can't think of a worse outcome than to get the Ayatollah a guaranteed nuclear program. From the Sunni Arabs' point of view, it's a declaration of war. And it could be a death sentence for Israel.""The deal includes a compromise of inspection sites within Iran, allowing Iran to challenge requests for UN inspectors to access military sites, according to reports. It also reportedly calls for a UN arms embargo and missile sanctions to remain in place for five or eight years, respectively, and that sanctions can be restored in 65 days if Iran violates the deal. Graham said he would not honor this agreement as President.""I would not lift inspections until there was a certification they are no longer the largest state sponsor of terrorism,"" he said. ""I would not give them a penny of money or a bullet until they are no longer a threat to destabilize the region. I would tie any monetary relief or lightening of inspections to a complete change in behavior.""It's like taking a can of gasoline and throwing it on a fire. The Sunni Arabs are going to see this as a provocative act against their chief antagonist, they are not going to sit on the sidelines. And, oh my God, our friends in Israel. I feel so bad for them if any of this is true because it guarantees their chief antagonist will become a nuclear nation with the passage of time.""Graham laughed when asked whether the United States could trust Iran.""The simple question is, do we have a president who understands who the Iranians are,"" he said. ""Obama is dangerously naive about the Mideast. This decision is the biggest mistake any president of the United States could make. The Iranians are not wanting to become one of the family of nations.""...""All I can tell you is the idea of giving them a dollar, given their behavior, what do you think they will do?

""If she believes it's a good idea to lift the arms embargo without first seeing a behavior change by the Iranians, then her judgment as commander in chief will be very much in question.""He said President Obama put Democrats in an impossible situation: ""He's pitted Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party against common sense and the security of the American people.""...In addition to the lifting of the embargo, Graham said lawmakers in both parties will be put off by the fact that the restrictions on Iranian enrichment expire over time. ""There is no chance that this deal will be approved by Congress,"" he said, predicting rejection by ""an overwhelming super majority in both the House and the Senate.""Graham also predicted that the deal would lead to an arms race in the Middle East and expanded hostilities between Shiite and Sunni Arabs all over the region.

As to us, you've taken our chief antagonist, people who have killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq, who have toppled pro-American governments throughout the region including Yemen, you've given them the capability to become a nuclear nation.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 15, 2015",Press Release - USA Today Op-Ed: Senator Graham: Iran Deal Fails on All Fronts,"Alexandria, VA - Yesterday, USA Today published Senator Graham's opinion editorial explaining why he strongly opposes President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. In case you missed it, view the article here and read the full text below:Three perspectives must be taken into account to judge this deal: how it affects the United States, our allies in Israel and the Sunni Arab states. The agreement fails on each front.As Americans, we did not achieve our initial goal, which President Obama and I both shared, of dismantling and rolling back the Iranians' ability to build a nuclear bomb. Instead, we have ensured that with the mere passage of time, Iran will become a nuclear nation.There is no requirement that Iran change its behavior before restrictions on its nuclear program are lifted, and the deal does not require the Iranians to dismantle all their nuclear infrastructure. They will be allowed to continue research on advanced centrifuges.""Anytime, anywhere"" inspections of Iranian military facilities were dropped, and I am skeptical that Iran will be required to fully disclose all its past nuclear work. Worst of all, Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism, will receive more than $100 billion in sanctions relief in short order. We know from Iran's track record that this won't be used for roads and bridges, but to fund Hamas and Hezbollah and further entrench Bashar Assad in Syria.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement a ""mistake of historic proportions."" This may prove to be an understatement. This deal puts our close ally Israel in a box. Israelis understand we are giving their chief antagonist  the very people who hate Israel the most  the capability to develop a nuclear weapon. At the end of the day, I fear this could be a death sentence for the State of Israel.Finally, Sunni Arab nations are going to feel threatened by this deal and are going to try to get a nuke of their own. Iran already controls four Arab capitals. With more money, Iran's destabilizing influence will only grow. Restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile systems are beyond the scope of the agreement. This alone guarantees a nuclear arms race in the region as Iran's rivals seek the means to protect themselves.This agreement is far worse than I ever imagined it could be. Over time, it will prove to be a nightmare for our own national security, the region as a whole, and eventually the world at large."

It is ""always better than war, as long as you're dealing with the worst people with a philosophy and goal to make the world safer.""

It was during her time running the State Department, between 2009 and 2013, that American diplomats began to plant the seeds for the groundbreaking negotiations in Vienna. Late Tuesday, Clinton emailed her approval of the deal and made a detailed case on its behalf.""This is a political nightmare for her,"" Graham said, not quite buying Clinton's public enthusiasm. ""For her to support this deal, she'll have to do it saying it's good for our allies,"" despite the unremitting criticism and scorn out of Israel and grumbling from Sunni Gulf states like Saudi Arabia. ""She's got to own this, and it's going to be very difficult for her to convince the American people this was a smart deal.""""That,"" he said, ""will be up to her."" Having delivered one final jab, Graham was off, ready to make his case  at five events in the span of just three hours  to the good people of Manchester, New Hampshire.Read Full Story Here"

It's his third trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state this month, with another visit planned for next week.""From a political point of view it is a must do for Lindsey Graham,"" the senator told NH1 News.Asked why New Hampshire seems like a better fit for him that Iowa, which holds the first caucus, Graham instantly ticked off independents, who make up approximately 40% of the electorate.But Graham added that his good friend and colleague Sen. John McCain of Arizona ""won here twice and it proves to me that there's a market for a guy like Lindsey Graham, who's a problem solving conservative who understands that you have to work with Democrats at times. But I really think the commander in chief issue means a lot to people in New Hampshire and Iowa, but particularly here.""Graham fights for primaryAt his event, Graham, standing in front of Mayor Ted Gatsas, state Sen. Dave Boutin, Rep. Pam Tucker, former executive counselors Peter Spaulding and Ray Wieczorek, former NHGOP chairmen Fergus Cullen and John Stabile, and others, Graham touted the important role the early voting states play in winnowing the field of presidential contenders.""I would argue that the New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina primaries have never been in more jeopardy than they are today,"" Graham warned....Last month some of the top Republicans in New Hampshire sent an open letter to Fox News and the Republican National Committee that strongly criticized the move to limit the first debate to ten candidates. Leading Republicans in both Iowa and South Carolina followed suit.Some leading politicians and activists in the three states see what Fox is doing as a real threat to the first-in-the-nation primary status, by winnowing the field of candidates before New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina get to do so.Graham told NH1 New that limiting the debate to 10 candidates and using national polling as the criteria was ""an incredibly bad idea.""""National polling is celebrity and name ID. New Hampshire is about character and competence. I think we're going to exclude some good people based on inaccurate polling.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 18, 2015",Press Release - Iowa Republican: The Graham Agenda for Securing America,"The Graham Agenda for securing America By Senator Lindsey GrahamJuly 17, 2015President Obama's foreign policy has been a disaster, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of its chief architects. Under the Obama-Clinton doctrine, there has been no strategy to confront the threats to our nation. They have acquiesced to our adversaries and alienated our allies. They have made critical decisions based not on circumstances on the ground, but on political calculations. The net effect of this approach has been to embolden the forces of violence and chaos, to disquiet the forces of security and stability, and ultimately leave our nation less secure. Today we stand at the brink of a nuclear and enriched Iran, while facing more radical Islamic groups with the capacity and desire to strike our homeland than at any time since 9-11.In 2016, we face a clear choice as a nation. We could opt for a third term of the Obama-Clinton Doctrine by electing Hillary Clinton. We could take a hard look at the threats we face and try to turn away in fear, retreating into the isolationism that Rand Paul advocates. I am offering a better path. As president, I would restore the capability, capacity, and will to secure our nation and reclaim America's role as the world's greatest force for global security.First, I would address the greatest threat that America and our allies, particularly Israel, face today: the nuclear ambitions of a resurgent and emboldened Iran. The disastrous deal that President Obama agreed to - a process that Hillary Clinton put in motion through secret talks with Tehran -will immediately enrich the Ayatollahs, shield them from an effective inspections regime, and leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state. As president, I would reject such a dangerous deal. I would lift sanctions and restrictions only when Iran is ready to accept anywhere/anytime inspections, fully account for the possible military dimensions of its past nuclear programs, and permanently abandon its nuclear ambitions and support for terrorists. I would not be nave about Iran's intentions, but would demand full verification on all counts.Second, I would present a clear, comprehensive strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL, starting with heeding the advice of military experts by expanding our current U.S. force in Iraq to 10,000. A force of this size would provide the needed capability and capacity to be successful. We would advise and train Iraqi forces at the battalion level, making them far more likely to stay in the fight. We would deploy forward air controllers to enable effective air strikes, attack helicopters to give the Iraqi forces added capability, and a substantial special operations force to put pressure on ISIL's leadership morning, noon, and night.Just as important, my strategy would correct a fundamental flaw of the Obama-Clinton Doctrine - the failure to understand that Iraq and Syria constitute a single battlespace. Bashar al Assad, the Iranian puppet long installed as Syria's leader and the man responsible for 200,000 deaths and the displacement of half of Syria's population, must go and we must have a strategy to drive him out. This requires a regional effort with troops and resources provided by Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. The region must take responsibility for driving out Assad, destroying ISIL safe havens, and rebuilding Syria. But we must provide the leadership, and we must augment their efforts with the unique capabilities of the U.S. armed forces.If we fail to pursue this strategy, the direct threats to our homeland will proliferate uncontrollably. Syria will become the ultimate launching pad for a tsunami of terrorist attacks on the U.S. by seasoned fighters with Western passports. The humanitarian crisis will continue to spill out across the region, bringing close allies like the King of Jordan to the brink of collapse, further bolstering the forces of Radical Islam. This is a nightmare scenario for America and for Israel.But while the threats are great, they are far from insurmountable. A determined America with a clear strategy and the committed support of her friends is an unstoppable force. Radical Islam today is a burning fire. We can and will reduce it to an ember. Hateful ideologies may never be eradicated entirely, but they can be contained and minimized when the forces of strength, security, and hope unite and reclaim the initiative.This is an effort that will be neither easy nor quick. The hard truth is that we face a generational struggle. America must commit to a military effort that brings stability and enables regional efforts to be successful. We must also commit to making common cause with the moderate voices in the Middle East that make up the vast majority of the population and who want nothing more than to live with good governance and social justice. When women, youth, and the disenfranchised reject both totalitarian dictatorship and the tyranny of Radical Islam, we must stand with them. Our support for the education of young women in remote regions will do more good than dropping bombs ever could. Radical Islam offers a glorious death. We must offer a hopeful life.If we make this commitment, we will succeed. We will secure our nation and we will empower our partners to prevent the rise of terrorists that could launch attacks against us. By taking on threats directly, earning the trust of our friends and showing our foes we are unafraid, we will usher in a new era of security. We will shape world events, rather than be overwhelmed by them. This is my agenda and my vision as a candidate for president.The Read at Iowa Republican"

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 27, 2015","Press Release - On ABC's This Week, Graham Says He's ""The Best Person To Lead This Country"" And ""Defend This Nation In Times Of Great Peril""","Alexandria, VA - Today, Senator Lindsey Graham appeared on ABC's This Week where he announced his decision to upgrade the flip phone to an iPhone, Donald Trump and the Republican platform, the Iran nuclear deal, and the debate criteria.As highlighted by The Hill, Senator Graham also discussed why he's the best person to lead and defend our nation. Graham stated on Sunday that Donald Trump is 'bankrupt' when it comes to being Commander-In-Chief.Watch the full interview here:On Upgrading To An iPhone, Graham Joked: ""I'm Sure Apple's Stock Will Soar...""""Yes, it is an iPhone and I'm sure Apple's stock will soar, but I have got an iPhone... I don't know if I'm going to email, but I do have an iPhone. I needed to upgrade. Donald Trump has done something my staff could never get me to do, and that's get a new phone so thanks, Donald.""On Trump And The Republican Platform: ""...I Would Ask The Republican Party To Understand Why Most Major Companies Are Firing Mr. Trump And I Don't Think We Should Hire Him.""""Well number one I would ask the Republican party to understand why most major companies are firing Mr. Trump and I don't think we should hire him. You know, I'm not taking on voters, I'm taking on an idea that I think he's appealing to the dark side of American politics. He is not offering solutions to hard, complicated problems. He is basically selling fear and prejudice.On Trump's Success In The Polls: ""I Think There's A Market In Both Parties, If You Say Outrageous Things."" ""There's a market in my party for people. If you say that Obama's not born in America, that he's actually born in Kenya, there are people who want to believe that. If you say most illegal immigrants are drug dealers and rapists, there are people that want to believe that. And he's appealing to fear and prejudice and there's a market for that. If you said Bush was a war criminal or that he's stupid there's a market for that on the other side so, what Mr. Trump is offering is not really good for the party or the country but unfortunately there's a market for this... Here's what I believe about Mr. Trump, the marketplace will work over time and we're going to get serious as a party about winning in '16. We have a wonderful opportunity to win.""""Mr. Trump talks about his bank account a lot and how rich he is, my dad said something that stuck with me a long time ago 'don't judge a person by the size of their bank account, but by what's in their heart.' I can tell you as to the men and women who are fighting this war and who serve our nation that they have relatively modest bank accounts, but they have great hearts. I don't think Mr. Trump is qualified to be Commander-in-Chief, I think he's bankrupt when it comes to all the qualities you need to lead the men and women in uniform and to lead a great nation.""On Why He's Most Qualified To Be Commander-In-Chief: ""I've Been Busting My Butt Going To Iraq And Afghanistan...To Understand What's Going On In The Region... I Understand The Region Better Than Anyone.""""...for the last ten years I've been busting my butt going to Iraq and Afghanistan over 35 times to understand what's going on in the region to learn from Bush's mistakes, my mistakes, and Obama's mistakes...I'm the best qualified to be Commander-in-Chief I understand the region better than anyone. I've served 33 years in the Air Force and just retired last month. And when it comes to this Iranian deal let me tell you what we've done. We've given them a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it. This is a terrible deal and the reason we got such a bad deal was the Iranians don't believe Obama would ever use the military option to stop their nuclear breakout and they never believe for one minute that John Kerry would ever walk away.""On The Iran Nuclear Deal: ""I Hope That We Will Reject This Deal, Because If We Don't The Next President Will Have No Leverage To Get A Better Deal."" ""We can get a better deal, we must get a better deal, and here's what we need to understand, that this is a religious theocracy that practices a form of Islam that compels them to destroy the state of Israel and to come after democracies like the United States where you can worship god on your own terms. These people are religious fanatics and we've empowered them in a very dangerous way.""On The Debate Criteria: ""I Think It's A Mistake To Do It Based On National Polls."" ""National polling is not testing things that are eventually going to win the day. I think it's a mistake to do it based on national polls. Here's what I've learned from John McCain, you can be fifth in a four person race and come back and win if you've got a message. I am going to talk to people in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina about the threats we face, why I'm the best qualified to be Commander-in-Chief and why Mr. Trump, while he says a lot of controversial and loud things is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief and that he can not win and election that we cannot afford to lose."""
Lindsey Graham,R,p,"July 31, 2015",Press Release - The Des Moines Register: Lindsey Graham and Marjorie Dannenfelser: Late-Term Abortion: Recovering Our Humanity,"Alexandria, VA  Yesterday, The Des Moines Register published an opinion editorial co-authored by Senator Lindsey Graham and President of the Susan B. Anthony List Marjorie Dannenfelser on late-term abortion and the consequences America faces if legislation, such as Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, isn't passed. In case you missed it, view the article here and read the full text below:[Y]ou know, we've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not going to crush that part. I'm going to basically crush below, I'm going to crush above, and I'm going to see if I can get it all intact.""With these words, Deborah Nucatola, national medical director of Planned Parenthood, made the best closing argument for legislation to end the grisly practice of late-term abortion in the United States. More than 2.6 million Americans have watched a video of this young doctor blithely dining on wine and salad while discussing how her organization selects babies for brute destruction. Every American old enough to read a biology text should see this video to understand the stakes not just for this legislation, but for the core values of our civilization.The second video shows Dr. Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood's National Medical Council, negotiating the price of fetal parts obtained from Planned Parenthood facilities. Gatter urges her interlocutors to make an offer because, as she explains, ""Well, you know in negotiations, the person who throws out the figure first is at a loss, right?"" Gatter then suggests ""$75 a specimen,"" which can be adjusted if it proves lower than what Planned Parenthood's California clinics fetch. The third video, with more to come, may be the most devastating yet. In it, Holly O'Donnell, an ex-procurement specialist at an organ and tissue processing corporation, describes how she passed out while being shown organs from unborn children being teased apart and tweezered in a laboratory dish.Congress is responding to these revelations in a variety of ways. Comprehensive fact-finding hearings are needed so that Americans can see what the trade in baby parts is all about. But fortunately there is legislation that will deal frontally with this horror.The momentum behind the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which has passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice, is already formidable, and for good reason. Abortion in the United States is legal up to the moment of birth  through all nine months of pregnancy  by judicial fiat. As legal scholar Angelina B. Nguyen has documented, only six other countries on the entire planet  including North Korea and the People's Republic of China  permit elective abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.Our nation's radical policy was never chosen by the American people, and whenever given the opportunity to express their convictions, they reject that policy. The pain felt by unborn children is alone enough to justify a new direction. Advances in perinatal medicine, including fetal surgeries for children in utero as early as 18 weeks of pregnancy, fill the medical journals. Millions of Americans now know a child whose life or health was saved by medical interventions unknown a generation ago. The ultra-skilled perinatologists who develop the techniques and do these surgeries are heroes.The bedrock of human empathy is the ability to feel another creature's pain. With the Center for Medical Progress's videos, our empathy is automatic. The doctor who uses ultrasound to guide his forceps to crush a small baby's body, but leave its vital organs intact for laboratory use, is inflicting horrific pain. Planned Parenthood's defense that these mortal blows are all about science is hollow. No one can kill an innocent victim and pretend that donating their hearts, livers and lungs to science redeems what they have done, justifying their charitable status and tens of millions of dollars in government grants.The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a small beginning on the road to recovering our humanity. It will save the lives of 15,000 girls and boys each year and prick our consciences to save others. We are proud of the 45 members of the Senate who have cosponsored this just and compassionate bill. We thank the 242 members of the House who passed this bill in May and moved it closer to the statute books. Now we challenge every public official, including President Barack Obama, to ponder the excised hearts of these babies, then look into their own hearts. We are a better nation than this, one that welcomes every child as a precious gift from God, to be loved and nourished by family  and protected by law."
Lindsey Graham,R,p,"August 3, 2015",Press Release - Campaign Statement in Response to Today's Washington Post Article,"Alexandria, VA  In response to today'sarticle inThe Washington Post,campaign manager Christian Ferry, today released the following statement:""The article inThe Washington Postis nothing but a political hit job of the very worse kind. Using anonymous sources and salacious headlines,The Washington Posthas buried the truth of Senator Graham's distinguished and honorable service in the United States Air Force.While the headline claims Graham served 'light duties,' the article notes he spent 142 days deployed during his time in Congress, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan. While a subheading notes a 'no show assignment,' it is describing his decision to serve duty in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Additionally, the article notes retired general officers describing Graham as 'really talented,' 'in the top 1% of his peer group,' and 'a national treasure.' The Posthas chosen to bury the facts behind quotes from unnamed sources and absurd, un-representative headlines to generate clicks and sell newspapers. It is journalism at its worse.As Christopher Burne, the Judge Advocate General of the US Air Force said upon Senator Graham's retirement in June, 'Colonel Graham has faithfully served our nation for 33 years. He built a legendary reputation as Captain Graham. I could go on about Colonel Graham's integrity, service before self and excellence. These are his hallmark traits and they have not changed in 33 years.'The bottom line is, Senator Graham served his country with honor. For his service in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force awarded him both the Meritorious Service Medal and the Bronze Star. The article is nothing but irresponsible."""
Lindsey Graham,R,p,"August 3, 2015",Press Release - Military Leaders Applaud the Military Record of Senator Graham,"General David Petraeus, U.S. Army (Retired): ""I am not aware of any other current Member of Congress who, while in office, spent remotely as much time deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those of us who were privileged to serve with Colonel Graham remain grateful to him for the contributions he made to our nation while in uniform.""Alexandria, VA  Today, Graham 2016 released the following statements from military leaders discussing the strong military service of Senator Lindsey Graham:General David Petraeus, U.S. Army (Retired):""Lindsey Graham served nine times under my command in his capacity as an officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. This included three times in Iraq while I was commander there during the surge, three times in Afghanistan while I was commander during the surge there, and three additional stints in Afghanistan when I was the commander of U.S. Central Command (which oversaw both Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the Middle East and Central Asia). Each deployment was generally a week or more in length.""While in theater, Colonel Graham did not hang out at my headquarters or seek special treatment as a United States Senator; nor did he seek to publicize his service. (In fact, he did not even allow press to cover his recent retirement ceremony, which would have provided impressive bipartisan footage for his ongoing campaign.) Rather, he took on quiet assignments that were significant and important, that capitalized on his expertise as a lawyer and Judge Advocate General officer, and that typically required him to travel widely in each country. This encompassed work in areas such as the reform of Iraq's troubled detainee operations, included recommendations on the detainee review process that we ultimately established, and addressed a variety of other rule of law challenges we were seeking to confront in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His contributions on these matters were substantive and valuable.""I am not aware of any other current Member of Congress who, while in office, spent remotely as much time deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those of us who were privileged to serve with Colonel Graham remain grateful to him for the contributions he made to our nation while in uniform.""Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, General John R. Allen, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired):""Colonel Graham served with distinction on several week-long deployments under my command in Afghanistan, and he was a true leader in every sense of the word. Colonel Graham made particular contributions to issues of rule of law and detainee operations in Afghanistan. His counsel on detention issues directly influenced my conversations with President Karzai to resolve tensions associated with that complex issue, and substantially helped me at a sensitive moment in the campaign.""Vice Admiral Bob Harward, U.S. Navy SEAL (Retired):""As the Commander of JTF 435 for over two years, I was responsible for Rule of Law and detention operations in Afghanistan. Col. Graham was invaluable to my efforts. With his knowledge and experience, he provided hands-on leadership to both our US troops and our Afghan partners who worked so hard to develop all the components of a judicial system for the people of Afghanistan. He was critical to our mission of transforming detention operations to a valuable component of our Counter Insurgency program. He was individually responsible for aligning political aspirations, and concerns, of both the USG and GIROA senior leaders, to ensure all detainees in both Afghan and U.S. custody were treated in a just and humane manner, while participating in programs that contributed to their productivity in society at the end of the conflict, such as education and tradesman programs. In doing this he traveled throughout Afghanistan to support prisons and courts in every province in the country, placing himself at considerable risk.""He provided great service to me, the Task Force, and the American people, in a honorable fashion, adding great value to the mission in many ways. Something we all take great pride in.""Lieutenant General Jack L. Rives, U.S. Air Force (Retired):Formerly The Judge Advocate General, U.S. Air Force (2006-2010)""Senator Graham served as an Air Force officer for 33 years. He served on active duty for six and a half years and then in the reserve components (Air National Guard or Air Force Reserves) until his retirement in June 2015. He never asked for special treatment after he became a member of Congress. I worked directly with him when he was a lieutenant colonel and a colonel. His promotions followed the very strict policy directives that are provided in legislation and Air Force procedures. Colonel Graham served with genuine distinction. I was proud to serve with him.""Major General Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., U.S. Air Force (Retired):Former Deputy Judge Advocate General, U.S. Air Force (2006-2010)""As a retired general officer, I have no public opinion about any candidate for elected office  that's for the voters to decide. However, allow me to say that although I was only with Colonel Graham on one very short day trip to Camp Bucca in Iraq among his many deployments, I can assure you that during that time he explicitly avoided celebrity treatment.' When we were in Kuwait the day before flying into Iraq, he stayed in the same quarters as other officers of his grade, ate in the same dining faculty as everyone else, and even went to the gym on his own. From what I saw, most treated him as simply another colonel (and most at the base in Kuwait did not appear to be aware of his status as a senator).""It was true that when we got to Camp Bucca, some of the folks were deferential to him, but when asked what he would like to do, he cut them off and pointed to me and said You'll have to ask the general.' And that's the way it went, as I wanted, not him. I think we parted ways at Bucca  as I recall he went on to Baghdad and I went elsewhere in the AOR  but I was impressed by how studiously he maintained his military bearing as Colonel Graham.'""Use of Senator Graham's military rank, job titles, and photographs in uniform does not imply endorsement by the Department of the Air Force or the Department of Defense."

Bush in the 2000 New Hampshire primary. Dennehy, who's now working for Rick Perry's presidential bid, says McCain wasn't the first candidate to engage with New Hampshire voters in the town hall format, but he held so many of those events that they've become almost required for presidential hopefuls.""Voters want a dialogue,"" Dennehy says. ""They want to meet the candidate, shake their hands, look into their eyes, ask a question and have it answered. It's now become expected of presidential candidates because of John McCain's efforts in 2000 and again in 2008.""...It remains to be seen whether running the McCain playbook will work for any of this year's candidates, though Lindsey Graham seemed to be reading off several of its pages at the VFW hall in Manchester.

But an airman convicted of drug use successfully challenged Graham's unique status as both a judge and a sitting member of the Congress, forcing Graham off the Court.

The Post article stated: 'The Air Force agreed to let him deploy for unusually brief tours  between two days and two weeks  when it suited his schedule. He would travel to Iraq or Afghanistan with a congressional delegation, then stay to perform his military service.'""The implication seems to be that Graham shirked his duty, was granted inappropriate favors, and acted at his own convenience rather than in the interest of the military or the public.""Instead, one could have written: 'Sen.

The matter from his files that they portrayed as the most damagingthat Graham held a stateside teaching title but did not teachwas not quite the blemish that the Post implied. A careful reading reveals that the reason Graham did not teach is because he opted for a more dangerous assignment: overseas duty in Iraq and Afghanistan working on detainee policy in the wake of the Abu Gharib detainee scandal.

Graham sees the defeat of ISIL and radical Islam as well as the stabilization of the Middle East as fundamental elements not only of a safer, but more prosperous nation, connecting national security to the economy, energy independence and even the plight of debt-burdened college graduates.""I've learned from my mistakes, Bush's mistakes and Obama's mistakes and I believe I have a foreign policy that will be appealing to the American public,"" Graham said. ""I think that I can reset a world that's falling apart.""Graham said he believes that if the National Security Agency's metadata program had been in place years ago, there never would have been a September 11, 2001, attack on the United States, and that its data collection is merely putting together algorithms rather than eying the content of citizens' phone calls and texts. Graham also considers NSA leaker Edward Snowden more of a traitor than a patriot. ""Not in my book (is he a hero). He compromised lives,"" he said.""I don't want to listen to your phone calls. There are people already here that are planning the next attack on our country,"" he added.To put a stop to ISIL and stabilize the Middle East, Graham believes an additional 3,500 ground troops will be needed to train local forces in the region and that Special Forces operations need to be mobilized to take out terrorist leadership. ""I'm about security through strength, not peace through strength,"" he said, noting that the enemies our country faces now are not ""rational actors,"" as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War.""This is a generational struggle,"" he said. ""This is a religious war for the heart of Islam, even though most of them want to live in peace ... the outcome matters to us. This isn't a battle for the heart and soul of Vietnam or Korean Peninsula ...

It has faced endless delays from the Obama Administration. Expanding our energy infrastructure creates jobs for American workers, spurs greater economic growth and development here at home, and keeps our access to reliable energy secure.Pursue ""All of the Above Approach"" to Energy Production. We should not rule out any safe, reliable source of energy from domestic and trusted sources. We need to ensure we can gain access to vast, untapped onshore and offshore sources of oil and natural gas, including through hydraulic fracturing, in a safe and affordable way. Expanding nuclear energy, including the construction and operation of new reactors, must once again become a priority.Reduce Dependence on Dangerous Regimes. Energy security is national security. Relying on energy from regimes that are hostile to our nation and our values leaves us vulnerable. It also poses a threat to military strength and military readiness. We need to boost domestic production and invest in the infrastructure and technology that will allow us to become fully energy independent.Support Cost-Effective Renewable and Sustainable Forms of Energy. American innovation and ingenuity are the key to the future of our energy production. Harnessing the power of solar, wind, and water in a cost-effective way will provide essential sources of energy with less waste and pollution. Investing in cutting-edge technologies and discovering what lies ahead at the frontiers of science are also important steps toward true energy independence.Mitigate Environmental Damage and Promote Conservation. We must adopt economically sound principles for reducing negative impacts on the environment and becoming better stewards of God's creation. This can be achieved through greater efficiency, less waste, better use of technology, and more cost-effective measures.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"August 16, 2015","Press Release - On CBS' Face The Nation, Graham Says ""If I'm Commander-in-Chief, We're Going After [ISIL]... Until They Are Destroyed""","Alexandria, VA - Senator Lindsey Graham appeared on CBS' Face the Nationthis morning where he discussed how he would defeat ISIL as president, the latest on Hillary Clinton's emails and his 2016 presidential run. This morning's interview with John Dickerson comes before his upcoming visit to the Iowa State Fair and a campaign swing through eastern Iowa where he will continue to discuss the threats our nation faces and his plans to keep America secure.As highlighted in The Hill article, Senator Graham also discussed the need for more American boots on the ground in order to defeat ISIL and his concerns with Governor Bush's plan. Graham stated on Sunday, ""Jeb Bush is a fine man, but his plan to destroy ISIL doesn't have a ground component. And it's really not a whole different than that over President Obama. If you're not willing to commit more American boots in the ground in Iraq... if you don't understand we'll never destroy in ISIL in Syria without a regional army of which we will have to be part, you're not ready to be commander-in-chief.""Watch the clip on Hillary's emails here:Graham On The Next Commander-In-Chief: ""I've Got More Experience Than Anybody Running.""""I think I've got more experience than anybody running. For the last decade, I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan 35 times. 140 days on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan...Jeb Bush is a fine man, but his plan to destroy ISIL doesn't have a ground component. And it's really not a whole different than that over President Obama. If you're not willing to commit more American boots in the ground in Iraq, from 3,500 to about 10,000, if you don't understand we'll never destroy in ISIL in Syria without a regional army of which we will have to be part, you're not ready to be commander-in-chief. And really nobody on our side seems to be willing to put a plan forward that truly would destroy ISIL. And they need to be destroyed....If I'm commander-in-chief, we're going after these guys and go after them hard until they are destroyed...""On The Other 2016 Candidates And Foreign Policy: ""[I've] Been More Right Than Wrong"" And ""I Don't See Anybody On Our Side Coming Up With A Robust Plan That Truly Will Destroy ISIL.""""...I can tell you what I've been doing for the last decade in terms of foreign policy. I've learned from my own mistakes. I've learned from President Bush's mistakes, President Obama's mistakes. Senator McCain and myself have been more right than wrong. We've warned the president, 'Do not leave Iraq without a residual force. Help the Free Syrian Army,' three years ago when it would have mattered. We were standing by him to take action against Assad when he used chemical weapons. And the president failed to do so. I don't see anybody on our side coming up with a robust plan that truly will destroy ISIL. And if we don't hit them there, they're coming here according to the F.B.I. director and the director of national security. So on our side, I really don't see anybody...""On His Readiness To Be Commander-In-Chief: ""33 Years In The Air Force, 35 Trips On The Ground In Iraq And Afghanistan. I Know What Works And What's Not Working.""""I'm saying the last thing we need is somebody who is not ready to be commander-in-chief on day one. 33 years in the Air Force, 35 trips on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know what works and what's not working. President Obama's strategy to destroy ISIL is failing miserably. You can't do this from the air. The Kurds are not the ground component we need to go into Syria. Without Syria being fixed, you're never going to fix Iraq. And they're coming here.""On Hillary Clinton's Emails: ""...She Was In Charge Of Benghazi Where Four Americans Died... She Failed Them Miserably..."" And ""I Want To See The Benghazi Emails.""""Well, number one, Congress has a role here...So there's two things. The criminal investigation should be in the hands of professionals. She said two things that are not holding water. 'I turned over all the emails related to business to the State Department.' Now, we know that Sidney Blumenthal sent her 15 emails, one about Benghazi, others about business that are not in the batch she turned over to the State Department. She said she never passed classified information on the server. Now, we know that's not true. There is a criminal investigation potentially afoot. Let the professionals do that. But she was in charge of Benghazi where four Americans died. She was in charge of their security. She failed them miserably before, during, and after. And what I can't believe: Is there not one email from Hillary Clinton or to Hillary Clinton about the attack on September the 11th or the week thereafter? If there are no emails about Benghazi to her or from her, that just doesn't sound right to me. And I want to see the Benghazi emails."""

That is making this bad deal a joke. I've been told that, by others, the administration has not denied that arrangement. It would be absolutely irresponsible to allow the Iranians to go onto their military sites and tell us what they've done in the past without independent verification. I think this is a game changer.""On Congress Voting To Reject The Deal: ""If This Press Report Is True...That Should Be Enough For Every Member Of Congress [To Vote No]""""I think it's going to be harder for our Democratic colleagues to support this deal, until we see what's actually in the side deal. But if this press report is true that the Iranians  under the agreement  do their own inspecting, that should be enough for every member of Congress to say 'I will not vote for this deal, until I see the side agreement.' How can you make an informed decision about the past military activity of the Iranians, if you have no knowledge about the agreement and you can't look at it for yourself to see if it's solid? If this is true, that the Iranians have a veto basically over the inspection process, it makes a bad deal an incredibly bad dangerous deal."""

And I hope over time we'll start realizing that the next president needs to straighten out the world that's falling apart. They'll start thinking about experience when it comes to being commander in chief and protecting us all. The one thing I can say about ISIL, they would kill the lady in Kentucky, they would kill the wedding cake baker, and the gay couple. They don't see a difference.""On His Strategy To Destroy ISIL: ""I Would Send American Ground Forces""""I would send American ground forces in larger numbers to Iraq. About 10,000, rather than 3,500. A couple aviation battalions, American helicopters flown by American pilots, trainers at the battalion level so the Iraqi army could not cut and run, forward air controllers so we can drop bombs on the right people, and special forces to kill ISIL leadership. Then the hard one is Syria, Syria is ten times harder than Iraq...General Jack Keane believes that 10,000 along the lines that I've just described would turn the tide of battle. But Syria, how do you fix Iraq without Syria? And I don't see a ground force inside of Syria capable of destroying ISIL and replacing Assad, because that window has closed. There's nobody left in Syria to train, so you have to get a regional army of Arabs and Turks, and we'll have to be a part of it...""On ISIL Reaching The U.S. With Western Passports: ""We're Talking About Silly Things... I'm Most Worried About [Radical Islam] On The Move Over There And They're Coming Here."""" ...At the end of the day what I'm worried about most is not somebody coming from Canada, but somebody coming from Syria or Iraq with a western passport to attack us. Another 9/11 is coming, I agree with Dick Cheney and we're talking about pretty silly things. We're talking about building a wall between us and Canada. At the end of the day what I'm most worried about is radical Islam is on the move over there and they're coming here and we have absolutely no strategy to disrupt them before we get attacked.""On Trump's 'Plan' To Deal With ISIL: ""[His Plan] Is Ill Conceived...He's Making No Sense.""""Mr. Trump's solution to destroying ISIL is as follows: 'I'm going to send our guys and gals over there to take the oil from Iraq and Syria to pay our wounded warriors.' I don't think that destroys ISIL, Harold, I think that destroys our standing in the Middle East. ISIL would love that plan, it would be the biggest recruiting opportunity in the history of ISIL. That plan is ill conceived... So pay attention to what the guy is saying on national security, he's making no sense."""

During the show, they discussed Senator McCain joining Graham on the campaign trail this weekend, the 9/11 attacks and how to prevent our homeland from getting hit again, and why Senator McCain believes that Lindsey Graham is the most qualified to be Commander-in-Chief out of the entire 2016 presidential field.Senators Graham and McCain have been two of the leading critics of President Obama's strategy to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIL, and they continued to voice their concerns at a national security press conference Friday afternoon in Manchester, New Hampshire.Listen to the full interview here:McCain On Graham's Candidacy: ""The Day That Lindsey Graham Is Inaugurated As President, It Is Going To Send A Chill Up The Spine Of Mr. Baghdadi.""""Well thank you, it's my pleasure to be with you all and to be back up in New Hampshire. I'm with my friend Lindsey Graham and we're going to do the same thing we did in 2008 and that is to have one on one with the folks of New Hampshire and a lot of good town hall meetings. I believe that in the world we're living in now, it calls more for Lindsey Graham's knowledge, experience and leadership...Lindsey Graham is the happy warrior. He is a happier warrior than I am and he is funnier than I am. I think I've got a pretty good shtick but people are kind of tired of my routine. People come to town halls because they want to primarily see the candidate but they also want to have a little enjoyment and he does a great job at that because he's quick on his feet. But the other thing that is going to come through here is more and more national security is going to be the determinant in the minds of the voters. And they do examine the candidates and the more they see Lindsey Graham the more they are going to appreciate his qualifications... the world is in greater turmoil than any time since WWII...This will be the first election since 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected, that national security has the prominent spot that it does in this election. And there's nobody more qualified, and I've seen a lot of them...But the fact is that we need a leader who can hit the ground on inauguration day and hit it running.""...I will support the nominee of the party. I'm a good Republican, but I do believe that we need somebody with a broad breadth of experience. I'm sure you remember the day that Ronald Reagan was elected the hostages came home. The day that Lindsey Graham is inaugurated as President, it is going to send a chill up the spine of Mr. Baghdadi.""McCain On Remembering 9/11: ""We Still Revere The Memories Of Those Brave Fire Fighters Who Were Going Up The Stairs While Everybody Was Going Down The Stairs.""""Well all of us, every American that is alive, remember where they were on that day. I was in my Senate office as was Lindsey Graham and I happened to have the television set on and saw the impact. And then of course we evacuated the Capitol, and to this day we don't know where the airplane that crashed in Pennsylvania was headed but there is certainly speculation that the United States Capitol might have been one of the two targets. Either the White House or the United States Capitol. It changed America. It changed the world...It was a time that America united as very few times in our history. I'm proud of what we did. We had to go to Afghanistan. Those who argue well, we never should have gone to Afghanistan, the people who attacked the United States of America were there and we had to respond...we had to understand the nature of the new challenge that we face and frankly we still have not come up with solutions to this problem of radical Islam, which attempts to destroy everything we stand for and believe in. We still revere the memories of those brave fire fighters who were going up the stairs while everybody was going down the stairs.""McCain On Lindsey Graham Being The Most Qualified: ""I Believe That Lindsey Graham Understands This Threat Better Than Anyone I Know.""""...But right now, as we speak, and the reason I am so supportive of Senator Lindsey Graham is that there are thousands of young men particularly from Europe, but from all over the world that are going into Iraq and Syria and they're going to come out. Say that only 1% of them wanted to attack America, that's a whole lot of young men. Now I believe that Lindsey Graham better understands this threat better than anyone I know. He has been to Iraq and Afghanistan and the briefings and the work on the Armed Services Committee, and his own service of 33 years in the Air Force reserves qualify him in a unique kind of way. And that does not mean that I am diminishing any of those others that are seeking the Republican nomination, but I am saying that if you compare the record and compare the work that Lindsey Graham has done in the United States Senate and Congress, not just his active duty service but also on the major issues on defense, I think they're unmatched.""McCain On Benghazi And Glen Doherty's Family: ""When Lindsey Graham Is President Of The United States, You Will See This Issue Resolved.""""Yes you can, yes we can [do something]. Put them in contact with Lindsey and me and we will do something in the Armed Services committee on that, that's terrible. I also want to point out that the person who highlighted this tragedy and the malfeasance and malfunctioning of the Obama Administration was Lindsey Graham. There is nobody who has fought harder for the families of those brave four Americans who were killed and he has dedicated a number of hours on the floor on this whole Benghazi issue and we will never rest, and I can guarantee you one thing; when Lindsey Graham is President of the United States, you will see this issue resolved.""McCain On The Refugee Crisis: ""...Lindsey Graham And I Have Been Saying All Along That This Crisis Was Going To Happen.""""Could I just say to start with, Lindsey Graham and I have been saying all along that this crisis was going to happen. Maybe not in the dimensions that it has become, but we've been on the floor and in town halls all over America. Lindsey Graham and I have been saying that this is a catastrophe in the making. This is a failure of American leadership. Time after time this President [ignored] the situation. He called ISIS the JV... The whole thing in Syria, when the President ignored the red line, when he overruled his major advisors on providing weapons and training to the Free Syrian Army...If I were ISIS and I'm sure they're as smart as I am, I might be infiltrating some young people into that flood of refugees to make them capable of maybe doing some bad things once they got here...So I want to approach the issue very carefully, I want to make sure and I know Lindsey does too, that we're going to bring an end to this refugee crisis rather than emptying out every country in the Middle East.""Graham On The Refugee Crisis: ""It's A Direct Result Of President Obama Screwing This Up...He Doesn't Know What He's Doing.""""We should be screening them, we should take our share and we should get to the bottom of the problem like John said...If you go back over the last four years and look at what John said we should've done and when we should've done it, we wouldn't be having 11 million displaced Syrians and 2,800 people die in the process trying to flee Syria. So yes, refugees, we should take our fair share. We should vet them. But if we don't get to the bottom of this, there are 30 million people in Syria. They're all going to leave. I mean the ones that are not getting killed are going to try to leave. It's a direct result of President Obama screwing this up...Everything he has done in the Mid East has come back to bite him. He said no to troops in Iraq. He said no to a no fly zone and helping the free Syrian Army three years ago and at the end of the day, he doesn't know what he's doing.""Graham On Glen Doherty And Benghazi: ""...When They Needed Their Country, Their Country Wasn't There Because Of Their Commander-In-Chief.""""Kelly Ayotte's been all over this. She's met with the family a couple of times. We're going to help Kelly in anyway possible... The thing about Glen is he was killed in the last 30 minutes of the fight. They were there for nine and a half hours. And don't get me started on Benghazi. You know the emails are important, but it really goes to how could it have been a death trap...? Yes, we'll try to help Glen's family. I know Kelly has met with them. The answer is yes, we will try... At the end of the day, they were left hanging. I mean there were four Americans when they needed their country, their country wasn't there because of their Commander-in-Chief. You know, I still can't get over the fact that we know everything Obama did on the Bin Laden raid. They made two movies out of that...Can you tell me what he did that night? I have no idea what he did that night.""Graham On Today's Press Conference: ""We're Going To Walk People Through What A Miserable Failure [Obama's Plan] Is"" And What It Means ""To Not Degrade And Destroy ISIL.""""To the family members of 9/11, the victims: We're always with you. I remember it very well like John said... It was a year ago yesterday or the day before that President Obama announced his plan to degrade and destroy ISIL. We're going to walk people through what a miserable failure this is and what it means to us not to degrade and destroy ISIL. It means another 9/11 is what it means. I think the next 9/11 is coming from these foreign fighters going into Syria with western passports. That's the most likely scenario."""

And Graham, whom he called 'my partner and my brother,' is the man to fix it, McCain said.""'In no election since 1980 will the issue of national security play a greater role (than 2016), since Ronald Reagan was elected,' McCain said. 'I think the voters and our fellow citizens in New Hampshire should examine the credentials of a candidate who has served this country for 33 years in the military, a man who took countless trips to both Iraq and Afghanistan, a man who advised Gen. Petraeus on the very sensitive issue of detainees, a man who understands the challenges. Lindsey Graham predicted every single thing that has happened because of a lack of leadership  a failure by this President of the United States.'...""Graham said he has 'never been more worried ... about another 9/11,' citing a growing number of terrorist organizations worldwide. He also slammed President Obama as 'a weak opponent of evil, and a poor champion of freedom.'...""Because of Obama's lack of understanding, the gains of troops in Iraq were 'squandered needlessly,' Graham said....""In order to dismantle ISIL, the U.S. must 'fundamentally change our strategy,' Graham said.""'The reason I am running for President of the United States is to destroy ISIL and win against radical Islam,' he said. 'John and I know one thing: you can beat these guys with the right strategy.'...""When the senators were asked about Donald Trump, McCain said he wanted all candidates 'to be asked legitimate questions.'""'If you want to deport 11 million people, tell me how you'd do that,' McCain said. 'If you want to defeat ISIS and your answer is you're going to take away their oil, tell me how that works. In other words, I just think all candidates, including Mr. Trump, ought to give the details of their proposals, so the American people can examine whether they're viable and whether they can support them or not.'""'I'm not worried about Mr. Trump today,' Graham said. 'I'm worried about the American homeland.'Read Full Story Here."

Like Ronald Reagan facing down the Evil Empire, Lindsey Graham has the uncompromised determination to destroy radical Islam and keep American families safe.""The most important job of the President of the United States is to be the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military in the world.

And most Muslims throughout the world reject what radical Islam is trying to do to the world and their faith. So this is an example to me that Mr. Carson may be a good doctor, but he is not ready to lead a great nation.""Watch the full interview here:Graham On His Performance During The CNN Reagan Library Debate: ""[I Focused] In On Why I Am Best Qualified Above All Others To Be Commander-In-Chief On Day One.""""Well one, I had an audience. The first debate was like having a debate in a bathroom. So, interacting with people. But basically, loosening up, making some jokes to make a greater point. Having a determination to win a war that we can't afford to lose and focusing in on why I am best qualified above all others to be commander-in-chief on day one. Something that I think is going to matter over time.""On Why He's Best Qualified: ""I Understand This War, I Have A Plan To Win, I Intend To Win It""""35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan in the last decade, I understand this war, I have a plan to win, I intend to win it, 33 years in the Air Force, 140 days on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a United States Air Force Reservist, I understand the military. I've been on the Armed Services Committee since my entire career. I am ready to lead the finest military in the history of the world. I intend to destroy radical Islam with a plan to do it. We've got to go back to Iraq with some more ground forces, get a regional army to go in on the ground in Syria and destroy ISIL. I intend to destroy radical Islam.""On Ben Carson's Comments On Muslims: ""This Is An Example To Me That Mr. Carson May Be A Good Doctor, But He Is Not Ready To Lead A Great Nation.""""Number one, I think this shows that Dr. Carson's not ready to be Commander-in-Chief. He said that he didn't believe somebody of the Muslim faith could be loyal to the constitution. My belief is that an approximate 3,500 of American Muslims are wearing the uniform of the United States military, are loyal to their country, they're fighting and dying for their nation. When I was Colonel Graham  back in Afghanistan a couple of years ago during the second election of Karzai  I had an opportunity to go to a polling station during the election with military members in charge of providing security. One of those military members was a young man who grew up in Kabul, went to this particular high school, he came to America, he was a member of the United States Army, he was so proud of what happened in Afghanistan, he was proud to wear the uniform. I had a cup of coffee with him, and yes, one day, I hope that young man can grow up to be President of the United States. America is an idea. Not owned by a particular religion, race, or anything else...So I think Dr. Carson needs to apologize to this young man, and every other Muslim serving their country, and to the American Muslim community. And if he understood the world, and how dangerous it is he would not say things like this. We have to partner with people in the faith to destroy radical Islam. And most Muslims throughout the world reject what radical Islam is trying to do to the world and their faith. So this is an example to me that Mr. Carson may be a good doctor, but he is not ready to lead a great nation.""What would he say to the young man that I met in Kabul who left Afghanistan, became an American citizen, joined the United States Army? What would he say to the approximately 3,500 American Muslims who have been to Iraq and Afghanistan fighting for our freedom, risking their lives? What he should say is thank you for serving our great nation. We're all in this together.""On Dealing With China: ""I Would Have A Clenched Fist And An Open Hand.""""We particularly had that problem in steel where they were dumping steel into the world marketplace. They manipulate the value of the yuan, they keep it artificially low, they don't let it go to its true value, which creates a discount on every product made in China. What would I do with China? I would have a clenched fist and an open hand. I would tell them that no longer will they be able to hack into our systems without reprisal, no longer will they be able to cyber attack our country and steal intellectual property. If you want a good relationship, you have to act in a responsible fashion. I would push back against building islands over resource rich waters owned by others. And I would tell China, 'You're going to lose access to our markets if you keep cheating and you keep being provocative.' We will suffer, but they will suffer more. It is time to really reset the relationship with China.""On The Economy: ""I Would Build This Economy By Unleashing Potential. Deregulate.""""You're never going to create a job in this economy, because it costs to much to create a job. Obamacare hangs over the entire economy. If you reduce work hours to 30 hours from 40, you're not covered by Obamacare. If you're a small business  which most people in the economy are  if you hire over 50, you're covered by Obamacare, so if you're at 48, you wouldn't go to 51. I would change Dodd Frank to allow people to have better access to capital. I would repeal and replace Obamacare with something that's more job-friendly. I would do something with the Highway Trust Fund. I'd repatriate corporate earnings parked overseas that won't come back over 35 percent. Have a one time good deal to put the money in the Highway Trust Fund. I'd build more nuclear power plants. I'd become more energy independent. I would build this economy by unleashing potential. Deregulate."""

The way he intends to destroy ISIL apparently is to go to Syria and Iraq and invade both countries, and take their oil for our benefit to pay our wounded warriors. That's not going to destroy ISIL. That turns the whole Middle East against us. But what he did say last night was very disturbing regarding Syria. He said he was OK with Russia being in Syria militarily and fighting ISIL. I am not OK with that. Russia is supporting Assad, and Assad is the magnet of this war. Assad is a puppet of Iran. The Syrian people will never accept him as their legitimate leader. ISIL and other radical Sunni Islamic groups recruit using Assad as a tool. He's an Alawite tied to Iran. So when he says he's OK with Russian involvement in Syria, which means this war never ends, and that means the Donald doesn't understand Syria.""On A Plan To Defeat ISIL: ""The Next President Needs To Be Clear As To What They Will Do. I Intend To Destroy ISIL.""""Here's what I think. I think you need to explain to the American people how you're going to destroy ISIL and what you would do in Syria. Now's the time not to guess what somebody would do as Commander-in-Chief. The one thing that I can tell you what I'll do as Commander-in-Chief is that I will rebuild our military and we will win this war. We will get a regional army together, there is nobody left in Syria to train, Bill. They have been slaughtered, and President Obama has screwed this up every way you can. The next president needs to be clear as to what they will do. I intend to destroy ISIL. There will be a ground component coming from the region, 90% them and 10% us. We're going in on the ground, and we're going to destroy ISIL, we're going to destroy the caliphate and Raqqah. We're going to take the territory back and push Assad out. If you can't say that, then you're not ready for this job and you surely don't have a plan to destroy ISIL. You should be able to say that.""On American Muslims And Other Candidates' Comments: ""If I'm President, We're Going To Align Ourselves With People In The Faith And Take This Fight Against Radical Islam.""""I have a problem with any person running for president who would apply a religious test to any religious group inside of America. Mr. Carson is a fine man but the Constitution is clear here. The one thing I would tell Dr. Carson, Mr. Trump and everyone else, is that if you want to destroy Radical Islam, you have to work with people in the faith. The good news for us is that the overwhelming majority of Muslims throughout the world are not buying what ISIL is selling. They don't want to turn over their daughters over to ISIL. So if I'm president, we're going to align ourselves with people in the faith, and take this fight against radical Islam, which is a threat to the faith and to the world at large. It's ISIL vs. humanity. So Dr. Carson is not really helping the cause when he suggests that a group of Americans cannot run for president because of their faith. That's specifically prohibited by the constitution. One last thing, there are 3,500 American Muslims serving their country in uniform. I have served with them in Iraq and Afghanistan and God bless them for taking up arms to protect our country and taking the fight to radical Islam.""On His Readiness To Be Commander-In-Chief: ""I Don't Want One Novice Replacing Another Novice When It Comes To Being Commander-in-Chief.""""You know, I don't know. I think he's had a heck of a record as governor, and he's a really good man...I don't want to analyze his campaign, I just want to make the case that above all others I'm the best person ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one. I want to solve problems here at home, I'm going to destroy ISIL, and I will tell you what exactly we need to do: an American ground component in Iraq and Syria working with a region. You're not going to destroy these guys from the air. I think a lack of a clear vision in many ways is going to hurt a lot of our candidates. Mr. Trump owes it to the American people to tell us what he would do to destroy ISIL. I don't want to guess about it anymore. I don't want one novice replacing another novice when it comes to being Commander-in-Chief... I'm going to fight to be Commander-in-Chief for the finest fighting force in the history of the world. They've had our back, I'm going to have their back."""

He stated yesterday,""We're one of seven nations in the entire world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks, the fifth month of the pregnancy.

This is a joke. Iran gets to do the samples, nobody gets to be with them when they test the samples. I'm going to stop all funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency. I'm going to try to until we see the side deal. I have a vote on the floor of the senate saying that we're going to suspend all funding until they give us the side agreement with Iran. This whole process is a joke - a dangerous joke. It would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous. So we're going to let every Democrat and Republican I hope vote on whether or not you want to take American tax payer dollars to give it to an international organization that will not allow the Congress to take a look at the deal that affects our national security.""On White House Reaching Out To The Pope: ""If I Am President Of The United States, We Will Set This Deal Aside And The Hostages Will Come Home.""""This is a new low for me. This deal with Iran is dangerous to the region, it's a death sentence to Israel. You're giving an Ayatollah 100 billion dollars with no requirement to change his behavior, and you couldn't get four hostages out. A pathway to a bomb with a missile to deliver it. If I am president of the United States, we will set this deal aside and the hostages will come home. But having to rely upon the Pope, to me, is a new low to me.""On Who Is To Blame For Syria: ""It Goes Back To President Obama Not Understanding The Role Of Leading From The Front... President Obama Screwed This Up.""""Well again, it goes back to President Obama not understanding the role of leading from the front. Three years ago, we all begged him to help the free Syrian army when they were intact, impose a new fly zone. Assad was on the ropes of a no fly zone, and Obama said no. We predicted that the free Syrian army would collapse, and they have. Gretchen, there's nobody left in Syria to train. He let that window close. It's going to be a lot harder now, but we're going to need a regional army to go in and destroy ISIL and push Assad out. If Assad doesn't leave, the war never ends. So this is a complete mess and with Syria, the worst is yet to come and these guys are coming here. Lebanon and Jordan are going to collapse if we don't deal with the problem in Syria. President Obama screwed this up.""On Comments By Trump And Carson Regarding Muslims: ""If I'm President We're Going To Rally The People Within The Faith...We're Going To Destroy Radical Islam.""""I think you tell your children that it is not what Johnny or Susie does, it's what you should do. What I would've done is corrected the man and said the following, 'I don't doubt President Obama's faith' and here's what I would've told him. 'I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan. Radical Islam is a threat to humanity, and the biggest victims of radical Islam are other Muslims.' And that if I'm President, we're going to rally the people within the faith, the overwhelming majority, and together we're going to destroy radical Islam. That's what I've learned from my visits to the region, that most moms and dads in the region and the Muslim world don't want to turn their daughters over to ISIL. That's what I would've said.""You know what I would say, there's 3,500 American Muslims in uniform and I have served with them in Iraq and Afghanistan. I went to a polling place during one of the elections in Afghanistan with a young man who grew up in Kabul, came to America and joined the American military, and we went to his high school where they were having an election and he was so proud. So I want to let every American Muslim serving in uniform know that I honor your service and I want to be your Commander-in-Chief. Dr. Carson is a good man, but he's created a religious test that our Constitution prohibits and to the American Muslim community, this is your country too. We're all in it together and to those American Muslims who have joined the American military to fight radical Islam, God bless you."""
Lindsey Graham,R,p,"September 23, 2015",Press Release - NH 1 News: Steinhauser: Graham Slams GOP Rivals and Clinton,"Steinhauser: Graham slams GOP rivals and ClintonBy Paul SteinhauserPosted on September 23, 2015MANCHESTER - Moments after touring a defense sub-contracting company, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina started firing away at some of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.And in a one-on-one interview with NH1 News, Graham said he's starting to see some ""momentum"" and increased fundraising from his performance in last week's Republican presidential debate.The longtime member of the Senate Armed Services Committee appeared in his element Wednesday morning as he toured Granite State Manufacturing, a defense sub-contractor located in Manchester's west side....Graham was in a playful mood at he toured the manufacturing plant and greeted workers. As he walked up to a bomb disposal robot that the company manufactures, Graham joked that ""I want to take that thing deer hunting.""He took the controls of the robot, kidding that he could use it against the media.Graham knocks Kasich and FiorinaBut later, after touring the plant, Graham was serious as he took shots at fellow Republican presidential candidates.Graham told reporters that ""we have candidates on our side, John Kasich in particular, went to Portsmouth and said we need more base closures, we need a base closure commission to keep people on their toes. I don't think John realizes how shaky our defense are, how bad shape we are militarily and how hard they work at Portsmouth. I want to tell the people at the Portsmouth naval shipyard and all across the country, to those civilians who are supplying our military with the best equipment possible that I'm not worried about keeping you on your toes, that I want to have your back.""Graham was reacting to recent comments the Ohio governor made at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard regarding the Base Realignment and Closure process. Kasich, who like Graham is spending a lot of time campaigning in the Granite State but who unlike Graham has seen his poll numbers rise, said ""I think the concern about base closings and BRAC makes everyone more efficient,"" adding that it ""keeps everyone on their toes.""Asked by NH1 News what his message would be to the Ohio governor, Graham said ""I don't think that John Kasich gets where the world is at, that the dangers to this country do not justify gutting the military and when you suggest that we need to close bases, you really don't understand how our footprint actually is, we need to increase our military footprint around the world because the threats are growing around the world.""...Graham also questioned Carly Fiorina's commander-in-chief credentials. Describing her stance on battling ISIS in Iraq, Graham told NH1 News that ""she says 'I'm not ready yet to commit troops on the ground, more boots on the ground, we're not there yet.' Well I don't know, if we don't' do it soon, we're going to pay a heavy price. So I don't know if she has the same understanding as I do about the state of this war. It's up to here to prove that she is ready to be commander in chief. We need ground troops, more of them, in Iraq, and eventually in Syria. Syria's hell on earth.""Graham sees 'momentum' ...Graham didn't make the cut for the prime time showdown, but pundits applauded his performance in the undercard debate. Graham told NH1 News that he's getting a bounce out of the debate.""The momentum is real. People starting sending money. I think they enjoyed the message. I tried to be a little bit funny but also serious about our foreign policy and trying to find a way to bring us together. The key to me is New Hampshire. I'm trying to meet as many people as I can and just keep doing what I'm doing,"" he said.Graham was also asked about Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who ended his GOP presidential bid earlier this week. Walker urged others in the large Republican field to call it quits.""I agree with him. I think they should all drop out expect me,"" Graham joked.Asked by NH1 News if he's considering taking Walker's advice, Graham said ""I appreciate what he had to say but I'm sticking into this.""Graham slams Carson, Trump, and Clinton Asked about Ben Carson's controversial comments over the weekend that he would ""not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,"" Graham said ""I don't agree with Dr. Carson. There are 3,500 American Muslims in uniform today. I have served with them in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of them have paid the ultimate price. I honor their service. Can one of their children grow up to be president. Yes I definitely believe so.""""When you say things like this it hurts us abroad. We have thousands of soldiers stationed in the Mideast. We should be a country respectful of all religions. I am,"" Graham said, adding ""when you say things like this I think it means you're not ready to be commander-in-chief.""...Graham also fired away at Hillary Clinton's announcement Tuesday that she opposes the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which would transport Canadian crude oil to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. The former Secretary of State had been repeatedly criticized by Democratic nomination rivals Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who oppose the pipeline, for not taking a stand.""I think she is worried about a primary. I think she's giving into the left. I think her campaign is imploding. I think she did this the day the Pope came to try and hide the fact that she won't build a pipeline. Well Hillary you're not going to be able to hide from the American people,"" Graham said.""The Canadians are going to sell the oil to the Chinese if we don't buy it. So saying no to the pipeline is giving in to environmental extremists. Giving into a version of global climate change that is not rational. It shows that she's feeling the pressure from Bernie Sanders and that she is playing politics with our national security. She will not be able to hide the fact over time that she's rejecting building a pipeline that would create American jobs and make us energy independent because she's afraid of the left. In many ways she's cow-towing the left like a lot of our guys are cow-towing to the right,"" Graham continued.Read Full Story Here"

It's a great recruiting opportunity for ISIL, because Assad is an Alawite aligned with Iran. So, when the Russians double down on Assad, it means this war continues and Syria continues to fall apart... The next 9/11 is most likely to come from Syria. So, Russian involvement on behalf of Assad means he doesn't go, means the war continues.""On Implications From Russian Involvement: ""It Means [Assad] Doesn't Go. It Means That The Radical Sunni Islamists Will Have A Great Recruiting Opportunity.""""...It means that the radical Sunni Islamists will have a great recruiting opportunity. The Syrian people want two things. They want Assad out, their brutal dictator. They want ISIL destroyed, because they're not radical Islamists. It means that they're not going to get either anytime soon. ""On How A President Graham Would Keep Tabs On Putin: ""...Tell The Russians That [Assad's] Going To Go, That We Will Not Accept Syria With Assad.""""The first thing, in Syria, is I would find a ground component that would destroy ISIL and put military pressure on Assad to leave. He's never going to leave while he's winning on the battlefield, so it's in our national interest to destroy ISIL. That means a ground force... to train Syrians. But, my number one priority would be to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria. You have to look at it as one battle space. Then, put pressure on Assad to leave and tell the Russians that he's going to go, that we will not accept Syria with Assad. That's a non-starter for us... But, you have to get in on the ground to destroy ISIL...""On Russian Military Shipments: ""If You Begin To Take The Fight To ISIL More Effectively...The Russians Will Begin To Understand That Assad Cannot Stay.""""If you begin to take the fight to ISIL more effectively, they begin to lose caliphate  you pull them up by the roots so to speak, then turn your attention to Assad  that the Russians will begin to understand that Assad cannot stay. The Syrian people will not accept him. At the end of the day, they Alawites under his enclave, we have to reconcile with them. They're worried about being slaughtered, so you have to have a diplomatic path as well as a military path..."""

I am running for president because I am the only candidate with in-depth knowledge of these challenges and a detailed strategy for taking them on.""Why We Need Troops On the Ground in SyriaBy Senator Lindsey GrahamIJReviewOctober 15, 2015Our next president's greatest task is to undo the Obama Doctrine and reclaim our indispensable role as a force for global security. I am running for president because I am the only candidate with in-depth knowledge of these challenges and a detailed strategy for taking them on.I have made dozens of trips to the Middle East. I know the region and the players, and I understand fully what is at stake. I have concluded that most people are not buying what ISIL is selling, and I have a plan to stop them.Russia's entry into the Syrian war marks a dangerous new phase in this conflict, escalating the threat level against the United States and highlighting the consequences of President Obama's failure to project leadership in the Middle East. Putin has long been a factor in this crisis, helping to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad with financial support and material. But the arrival of Russian troops and launching of Russian airstrikes on Syrian soil are harbingers of even greater violence, devastation, and instability.The beneficiaries of these developments will be:ISIL, who will be strengthened in their ability to recruit foreign fighters and exploit the chaos;Assad, the war criminal who has waged a brutal four-year assault against his own people;Iran, another Assad benefactor; andPutin, who is reclaiming a strong Russian position in the region.Those who will suffer most will be the Syrian people, neighboring nations like Lebanon and Jordan, the moderate Muslims who are seeking to reclaim the initiative from radical Islam, and the United States, as our interests are supplanted by Russia's and the risk of attacks on our homeland compounds.President Obama deserves much of the blame. He made the disastrous choice to withdraw our troops from Iraq in 2011, renewing instability and opening up a space into which ISIL and Iran expanded. He refused to help the Syrian people when they rose up against Assad, not even to enforce his own red line on the use of chemical weapons. This gave oxygen to the rise to ISIL and other terrorist groups, created a global recruitment magnet, and signaled clearly to the region and the world that Obama is as weak as he is untrustworthy. The resulting leadership vacuum has been readily filled by Sunni and Shia terrorists, the Iranian Ayatollah, and now Putin.Syria is now the perfect launching pad for devastating attacks against our homeland that could make the September 11 attacks pale in comparison. Seasoned fighters with Western passports will be in a position to inflict incredible harm. Tehran's emboldened and unchecked role in the Middle East is adding fuel to this fire, prolonging Assad's reign of terror and preventing a resolution to the conflict. Russia's arrival exacerbates this reality even further. The massive flow of Syrian refugees is not just a terrible humanitarian crisis. It threatens the stability of our close allies in the region and poses a considerable challenge to our friends in Europe, which, ultimately, undermines our own security.As president, I would increase our current presence of American troops in Iraq from 3,500 to 10,000 in order to turn the tide of battle. It brings me no pleasure to conclude we must send troops back into Iraq, but doing so would allow us to embed with Iraqi forces at the battalion level, as well as deploy attack helicopters to give the Iraqi army a substantial advantage over ISIL.I would put in place robust special operations capability to apply constant pressure on ISIL's leadership and supply better arms and equipment to the Kurds. Together these efforts would reclaim the gains of the Surge and restore stability in Iraq.However, the heart of the fight will be in Syria, where ISIL is headquartered. This will require a regional force with troops from Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. This is their fight, first and foremost. But it directly affects our security, and we must be a part of it to provide leadership and additional capability. I would also provide assistance in dealing with the enormous humanitarian crisis that is overwhelming the region and acting as a barrier to efforts to extinguish the flames of radical ideology.I will bring this detailed strategy to the White House. Most important, I will bring the will to defend our nation and restore America's global leadership role.I am the only candidate who has the credentials and strategy to keep America safe. As tempting as it may to withdraw from the terrible violence and chaos engulfing the Middle East, we have seen that terror will arrive on our shores if we don't confront it at the source.ISIL offers the people of the Middle East a glorious death. We must offer a hopeful life. In return, we will restore stability over there while increasing security here at home. I am running for president to ensure that we have the capability, capacity, and will to protect America and bring about a safer, more peaceful and prosperous world."

Even under this relatively charitable assessment, she has proven herself unfit to lead. A Commander in Chief is supposed to comfort the families of the fallen, not mislead them. A Commander in Chief is supposed to make sure those in battle are well equipped, not left defenseless.""Benghazi hearing shows Clinton unfit to be Commander in Chief By Senator Lindsey GrahamUnion LeaderOctober 26, 2015Last week's hearing of the Select Committee on Benghazi made irrefutable what has long been increasingly clear: Hillary Clinton is unfit to be Commander in Chief. Her actions before, during, and after the attack have unmasked a lack of leadership and fundamental untrustworthiness that were not befitting a Secretary of State, and would be disastrous for a President. Above all, the facts of Benghazi demonstrate the centrality of her role in an administration that is not only an utter failure in its foreign policy, but that actively misleads the American people about its failures for political gain.Many in the media, including pundits, have asserted that the hearing was pointless and that Clinton won the day. To the contrary, through Chairman Trey Gowdy's excellent work in investigating what happened, we now know several salient facts that demonstrate precisely the opposite is true.We know that she failed to reverse conditions that made the attack possible, if not inevitable. 600 requests for additional security were submitted from Libya, all of which were denied by then-Secretary Clinton's State Department. During this time, the British diplomatic mission was attacked, and their ambassador subsequently withdrew. The Red Cross also withdrew as security conditions deteriorated. The grim joke made by Ambasador Chris Stevens to colleagues before his death that he might have to turn to Qatar for backup paints a tragic picture of how isolated our team in Libya was.We know that on the night of the Benghazi attack, when our consulate was under siege and four Americans, including Stevens, were being murdered, Secretary Clinton did not so much as place a call to the Secretary of Defense or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She had failed those serving under her in the leadup to that night, Sept. 11, 2012, and she failed them in their hour of greatest need.Finally, we know that in the aftermath, she was complicit in the administration's efforts to shield its own failures and reinforce a false narrative that al-Qaida was in retreat in order to salvage President Obama's reelection bid. With less than two months to go before that election, Clinton, Susan Rice, and the entire administration sought to blame the Benghazi attack on a spontaneous protest to an anti-Muslim video that was circulating online.We know that Clinton informed the government of Libya, the government of Egypt, and her own family within 48 hours of that attack that it was a coordinated terrorist attack that had nothing to do with a video. And yet, on Sept. 14, she met with the families of the fallen and led them to believe that the video and a fictitious protest were to blame. Two days later, then-ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice went on television to peddle this spurious account. Clinton sat on the sidelines while the public was misled.Getting to the truth of Benghazi is a worthy and essential endeavor. We owe the families of the fallen a full accounting. We owe every single member of our diplomatic corps the assurance that we are making the changes to ensure that their lives are not similarly at risk.Given what we now know, the best defense of Hillary Clinton's actions is that she was utterly negligent and failed to grasp conditions on the ground before and during the attack, and that she was unwilling to correct the record when Susan Rice misled the American people. Even under this relatively charitable assessment, she has proven herself unfit to lead. A Commander in Chief is supposed to comfort the families of the fallen, not mislead them. A Commander in Chief is supposed to make sure those in battle are well equipped, not left defenseless.An even more damning interpretation of the facts would be that she knowingly withheld needed security assistance in Libya because it would negate Obama's false narrative that he had defeated al-Qaida, brought stability to the region, and made America more secure. Whether her sins were primarily of commission or omission, there is no denying that she does not have the leadership or the trustworthiness necessary to be President."

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"November 4, 2015","Press Release - On The Hugh Hewitt Show, Graham Says, ""I'm Not Looking For A Fair Fight. I Want To Have Superior Capability Over Any Enemy.""","Alexandria, VA  Yesterday evening, Senator Lindsey Graham joined The Hugh Hewitt Show to discuss national security issues including, talks between China and Taiwan, Navy carriers vulnerable to Chinese missiles and downsizing of the military, the advantage of the new B-3 bomber, troops in Syria, and talks between Iran and Russia on how to handle Assad.""[China's] Much More Militaristic, They're Much More Threatening To Their Neighbors, And We're Much Weaker... And That's What Happens When You Lead From Behind.""""In a world where there's no American leadership  if I were living next to China  I'd probably start talking to them too, because you can't trust America anymore...Nothing's changed inside of China to make you believe they're a better nation when it comes to democracy. They're much more militaristic, they're much more threatening to their neighbors, and we're much weaker. So I would imagine Taiwan sees a growing China, militarily and economically, a retreating America, and are making accommodations. And that's what happens when you lead from behind.""""The Next President Needs To Rebuild The Navy"" And ""Build The Military Consistent With The Threat Levels.""""I mean, numbers do matter. We've got much more efficient ships. Our virtual ships are, you know, they're very, very modern, but you need capacity... And the next president needs to rebuild the Navy to make sure that the world does hold together...""Number one, build the military consistent with the threat levels. You know, you always have a defense structure around the threats to your country. So 350 ships versus 275 would allow you to make sure that the Marine Corps can actually land Marines without having to outsource and contract with landing crafts of other nations. 14 aircraft carriers gives you a presence in Asia and the Gulf that you can't maintain today, and it allows for our sailors to have some time at home. So 500,000 person Army versus 420, where we're headed by 2021, allows you to have an Army that can be more present in Europe...So a 500,000 person Army, I think, is the minimum we need given the threats.""""The Ability To Have A Stealth Bomber That Can Penetrate Any Air Defense System Is A Terrific Advantage For Any American President, And Bad For Our Adversaries, Good For Our Allies.""""I'm Not Looking For A Fair Fight. I Want To Have Superior Capability Over Any Enemy.""""The triad still is relevant. You know, we have nuclear submarines, you have land-based missiles, and you have manned bombers...The ability to have a stealth bomber that can penetrate any air defense system is a terrific advantage for any American president, and bad for our adversaries, good for our allies...it's time. I'm not looking for a fair fight. We're headed to spending 2.3% on GDP versus 5, which is the normal level of spending by 2021. What happens is that you don't have money to modernization. You have too few people, and old weapons. So I want to get back up to 5% of GDP, have a robust Navy, a robust Army, and I'm not looking for a fair fight. I want to have superior capability over any enemy.""""Every Commander-In-Chief Owes It To Those That They Send Into Battle, Or Into Harm's Way, To Give Them A Chance To Win.""""He's put 50 brave Americans in a no-win situation. Now, those who serve in the military expect to take risks for their country. But every commander-in-chief owes it to those that they send into battle, or into harm's way, to give them a chance to win. So from an ISIL point of view, this is less than being all in. When the President says I'm going to degrade and destroy you, and the enemy hears 50 people, that means they're emboldened. They know that he's weak. When our allies hear 50 people, that's the signal we're not committed. And the 50 people are in harm's way without a chance of winning... I'm going to write a letter to the Department of Defense asking them to give me a detailed plan as to how these 50 people will be used, and how we're going to train the Free Syrian Army in the future before I throw good money after bad... We've taken a couple hundred billion dollars to train 50-something people, and got nothing for it. You know what I would do? There would be three ground components if Lindsey Graham were president - a Free Syrian Army, we would have a no-fly zone to train them to give them more capability, a regional force made up of regional armies with an American component to make sure we win...You've got to go in on the ground, and you need more than 50 people.""""I'm Trying To Test Candidates, As Well As Prove To You That I'm Best Qualified To Be President.""""I'm trying to test candidates, as well as prove to you that I'm best qualified to be president. I want to have a discussion with Donald Trump. He says let Russia fight ISIL. ISIL is a direct threat to our homeland. They make al Qaeda look like the Rotary Club. There's no way on Earth we should allow Russia to fight ISIL. They want to keep Assad in power. We need to destroy ISIL, because it's in our national security interest to do so. Withdrawing from Syria is a huge mistake. I want to have the discussion. What would you do differently in Syria than Obama? And be specific.""""Russia And Iran Have Won... Obama Has A Hands-Off Policy When It Comes To Assad.""""At a minimum, the [Assad] regime survives. So Russia and Iran have won. The Syrian people have lost. And we have lost. Russia and Iran will fight for Assad. Obama has a hands-off policy when it comes to Assad. The people we trained at the CIA have been bombed by the Russians. Their goal was to take Assad down. The Russian president killed the people we trained, and the response by our president is to say we're not going after Assad in the future...Russia and Iran will say who runs Syria. It may be Bob Assad rather than Bashar Assad, but they're in the driver's seat, because Obama's refusal to help the Syrians go after Assad, and Russia's insistence that he will stay in power. We have given Russia and Iran control over Syria. That's bad for us, because it means the war never ends."""

He mixes anecdotes from his childhood in South Carolina with stories from his 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan....""The reason I talk about this first is because the next commander in chief will have to deal with this problem,"" Graham argues. ""The goal is to test Republicans who want to be our standard bearer, and we've failed to do that so far.""...Graham says the focus on national polling ignores campaigns trying to build momentum in early primary states. Graham is going all-in on New Hampshire, while other candidates are banking on a strong showing in Iowa.Graham says he's optimistic because he knows he can win, both as a candidate and as commander in chief.""When I tell them that the only reason we lost 3,000 on 9/11 and not 3 million is that Al Qaeda didn't have access to a nuclear weapon, their heads nod. They get it,"" Graham says. ""The majority of people understand that they are coming for us here if we don't stop them over there.""Graham says his hawkish stance has already forced the rest of the Republican field to spend more time addressing foreign policy, even through Americans are weary after more than a decade at war.""ISIL beheading people has brought it back to our consciousness. The bombing of that Russian plane has brought it back to our consciousness,"" Graham adds....""This isolationist movement in the party had some resonance. Then Obama decides to withdraw from Iraq,"" Graham recounts. ""John McCain and I were the lone voices in the wilderness saying 'Don't do it!'""While Paul told students at UNH last week that President Obama's decision to send 50 U.S. Special Forces into Syria would drag us into an escalating war, Graham says it's not enough. He pledges to send U.S. troops back in to stabilize Iraq, and several thousand soldiers to lead a multinational force against ISIL in Syria....""Ninety percent them, and 10 percent us,"" Graham says.Graham thinks support for Paul's isolationist stance has faded, and most of his fellow Republicans are now backing a greater U.S. role in Syria.""They stumble over ground forces, but they are catching up with me a bit,"" Graham says with a laugh.Graham says he's driven the debate, and forced Republican voters to acknowledge the need to degrade and destroy ISIL.""We're in a war. You may be tired of fighting them. They aren't tired of fighting you,"" Graham concludes.Having his invitation to tonight's debate rescinded freed up some time on Graham's schedule. So he'll be campaigning in New Hampshire, a happy warrior sharing a spirit of optimism about a war he thinks we can win.Read the full article here. "

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"November 11, 2015","Press Release - Lindsey Graham On Medium: ""I'm Running To Be A Commander-In-Chief Worthy Of Our Veterans' Sacrifices""","To the American people, I will fight every day to keep this nation safe. To the men and women of the military - both those currently fighting and those who have previously worn the uniform I will fight every day to honor your service and be worthy of the enormous sacrifices you make.""Honoring Their ServiceBy Senator Lindsey GrahamMediumNovember 11, 2015Today we honor the enormous sacrifices of our veterans. The men and women of the U.S. military don't simply do a job, they commit their lives. They go wherever they are needed, whether that takes them to the front lines of battle or to lonely outposts to perform vital support work. They put unfathomable strains on their physical and mental health, and they often do not return home whole. They miss out not only on birthdays and anniversaries but on the quiet, daily comforts of being home with their loved ones. Their entire families must continually start over in new neighborhoods and new schools, with their spouses often bearing the brunt of these challenges on their own. These are enormous weights that we ask our veterans and their families to bear, and I have seen first-hand the mixture of dedication and stress with which they bear them.While it is a debt we can't fully repay, there are ways that we can and absolutely must pay back what we owe our veterans. First and foremost, we need a commander in chief who will always give our service men and women the support they need to succeed and never squander the gains they have achieved.President Obama has failed our veterans on both fronts. Here at home, he has presided over defense cuts that are gutting our military's capability, capacity, and readiness. Military equipment is aging and falling behind technologically. Troops are not receiving the full training they need to prepare for what lies ahead. Our overwhelming global superiority is deeply threatened, and yet President Obama had the gall to veto this year's defense funding authorization bill for purely political reasons.Even more disturbing are President Obama's actions overseas that are squandering the hard-fought gains our troops have already made and jeopardizing their ability to succeed in the future. Our men and women in uniform did their jobs in Iraq and did them admirably. The Surge worked. It stemmed the violence, made common cause with Sunni leadership, and created space for political progress. This tremendous success came at a steep price, including thousands of American lives and tens of thousands of American wounded. Our service men and women did their duty regardless of the costs because they had seen the enemy up close and understood that we must take the fight to them before they attack us again here at home. President Obama, however, failed to understand this, ignored the advice of his military commanders, and risked it all with his total withdrawal from Iraq in 2011.He has compounded this disastrous decision - which created the conditions that have allowed the rise of ISIL and the resurgence of Iranian influence in Iraq and throughout the region - with one failure after another. He refused to stand with the Syrian people when they rose up against President Assad, refused to assist the Free Syrian Army when it could have made a difference in the fight against both Assad and ISIL, and he even refused to enforce his own red line on Assad's use of chemical weapons.He has incrementally sent U.S. troops into the region, first in Iraq and now a small handful of special forces into Syria, while failing to develop an overall strategy that these troops can fight to achieve. All the while, he has embarked on quixotic efforts to appease and cajole the Ayatollah of Iran, strengthening this religious Nazi's position regionally at the expense of Israel and our Arab allies. The net effect of these repeated blunders has been to threaten the gains of our military, both past and future. They make a mockery of the sacrifices of our veterans and their families. Our next commander in chief will have to ask our men and women in uniform to correct these failures and re-take that ground.I am running for president because I have an unshakeable commitment to these brave men and women. I wore the uniform for over 30 years. I spent more than six years on active duty, including several years deployed to Germany. I've made dozens of trips to Iraq and Afghanistan as a reservist and a Senator. I understand that as president there is no greater responsibility than to be a worthy and successful commander in chief. I will never send a single man or woman into harm's way without the strategy and resources to succeed. And I will never squander the gains they make at great personal cost.I also will never break faith with those who return from the fight bearing the scars of service. Every day that a single man or woman who has suffered in service to our country goes without proper care is a national disgrace. I have been fighting - and will continue to fight each day - to ensure that every single veteran receives timely, quality care. This includes reforming a broken VA system, but I believe we must go much further by providing access for every veteran to private health care outside of the VA. If the VA isn't working for you, you should be able to go to another facility that will. Increased access will improve the lives of veterans, and increased competition will ultimately strengthen the VA system itself and ensure its long-term viability. I won't rest until all our veterans receive the care they need, when they need it.To the American people, I will fight every day to keep this nation safe. To the men and women of the military - both those currently fighting and those who have previously worn the uniform I will fight every day to honor your service and be worthy of the enormous sacrifices you make."

That's why I worry so much about this nuclear deal. What I think we've accomplished with the deal with Iran is to give the Ayatollah's regime power in perpetuity. He's stronger, not weaker, a pathway to a bomb in 15 years. He doesn't have to cheat. He can get a bomb, a missile to deliver it in a few years, and $100 billion dollars to pay for it all.

Lindsey Graham,R,p,"November 16, 2015",Press Release - Destroying ISIL and Stopping the Spread of Radical Islam,"I am ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. I have a clear strategy to confront ISIL and Radical Islam, prevent a nuclear Iran, drive Bashar Assad from power, and re-establish stability in the Middle East. I will restore our relationship with the State of Israel. I will engage with our Arab allies to achieve a regional solution. I will reinvigorate NATO and shore up the resolve of our European allies to develop a strategy to take on direct threats to the West. I will make it clear to our friends and our enemies that the U.S. once again has the capability, capacity, and will to be the world's greatest force for security."" - Senator Lindsey GrahamKEY NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVESDevelop Capability, Capacity, And WillWe must demonstrate we have superior capability, overwhelming capacity, and determined will to protect our nation and confront the forces that threaten global stability and security. Friends and foes alike must see we will no longer capitulate to our adversaries, alienate our allies, or abandon those who are confronting the naked aggressions of dictatorial regimes. We will reclaim our leadership role  backed by the necessary resources and resolve  and confront head-on the threats to our security. The plan is very simple: whatever it takes, as long as it takes, until we defeat them.Present Clear, Comprehensive Strategies For Directly Taking On ThreatsFrom the rise of ISIL and Radical Islam, to Iran's nuclear ambitions and growing regional influence, to Putin's aggressions in Europe and the Middle East, to China's assault on freedom of navigation in the Asia Pacific region, the forces of violence and chaos are going unchecked. We must develop a global strategy for enhancing our security and our leadership role in a dangerous world.Provide The Necessary Resources To Deploy Both Hard And Soft PowerWe cannot secure our nation or reassert American leadership abroad while gutting our military or our ability to engage in development and diplomacy. Sequestration's non-strategic across-the-board cuts have diminished our capabilities while failing to address our national debt, which is itself a long-term threat to our security and prosperity. We must restore support for vital national security programs while addressing the largest source of our current and future debt  entitlement spending  through fundamental reforms that fully fund our security needs, rein in our debt, and put us on a secure and sustainable path.POLICY INITIATIVESIraq, Syria, and The Rise Of ISILSend a force of 10,000 troops to Iraq to reestablish stability, take back lost territory, and destroy radical extremist groups like ISIL. A force of this size would allow us to train and advise Iraqi forces at the battalion level, and would be part of a comprehensive strategy that will: Arm, train, and equip moderate forces, including the Kurds, who are taking the fight to ISIL and Bashar Assad Create safe zones, backed by no-fly zones Aggressively apply air power, including attack helicopters Expand intelligence operations Fully utilize special operations capability to apply constant pressure on ISIL's leadershipWork in concert with our regional allies to develop a regional solution to end the conflict in Syria and stop the spread of radical extremist groups. Neutralize Russian influence in Syria.  Russian forces are in Syria to solidify Putin's position in the region, secure Russia's access to strategically important bases and ports, preserve Assad's power - and by extension, Iran's and Russia's - and drive moderate rebel forces into cooperation with radical groups. Russia's continued presence in Syria will make the current conflict longer and bloodier and radicalize moderate Sunni forces and populations. The United States must reassert its leadership role in the Middle East and refuse to allow Russia's strategic aims supplant ours. If Russia is allowed to have a presence in Syria, it will be determined by the Syrian people not force of arms. Develop a united, regional force under U.S. leadership. Our key partners - including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt - must be actively engaged and provide the bulk of the resources for this fight. The United States must provide the leadership and added capabilities that only the U.S. military can provide. This kind of cooperative effort is the only way to ensure our success while limiting the burden on American troops and taxpayers. The region will pay for this war. We paid for the last two. Make military decisions based on military conditions. The execution of a regional effort - including the timing of the withdrawal of U.S. troops - must be never be based on politics, but rather on a coherent strategy and circumstances on the ground, so that our gains are not reversed and our sacrifices squandered.Provide necessary humanitarian assistance, particularly in Syria, to combat the conditions of a failing state, which breed violence and can lead to the creation of terrorist safe havens. Syria is the source of the world's most acute refugee and IDP crisis, in the midst of a conflict that has already resulted in over 200,000 dead, half of which are civilians. The human costs are incalculable, while the devastation and chaos create a vacuum filled by ISIL, Al-Qaeda, and Iran. The destabilizing impact of this crisis is not only felt in Syria, but also in partner nations like Jordan, posing further threats to our security. Our humanitarian support is an essential stabilizing force. Establish a no-fly zone so Syrians do not have to flee their country. No refugees will be allowed in the United States without thorough vetting."
