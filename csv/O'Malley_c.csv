Martin O'Malley,D,c,"May 30, 2015","Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Baltimore, Maryland","My fellow Americans.I want to talk with you today about The American Dream we share...its powerful history,its current condition, and most importantly,its urgent need for rebuilding.Our nation was founded on two self-evident truths...That All of us are created equal.And that we are endowed by our Creator with the rights to Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.With these words, the American dream began.No fine print. No expiration date.All of us are included.Women and men.Black and white people.Irish Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, Native Americans. Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Americans.Young and old. Rich and poor. Workers and Business owners. Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and straight Americans.Every person is important, each of us is needed.In our idea of country, there is no such thing as a spare American.There is, however, a growing injustice in our country today.It is the gap between the strong and just country our children need for us to be,... and the country we are in danger of becoming.For today in America, seventy percent of us are earning the same or less than they were 12 years ago. This is the first time that has happened this side of World War II.Today in America, family owned businesses and farms are struggling to compete with ever larger concentrations of corporate power,...Fifty years ago, the nation's largest employer was GM. An average GM employee could pay for a year's tuition at a state university with two weeks' wages.Today in America, with dreams of college, a decent paying job, and a secure retirement slipping beyond the reach of so very many,... the American Dream seems to be hanging by a thread.And yet, for America there is always a yet.The final thread that holds us just might be the strongest.It is the thread of the generosity, the compassion, and the love of one another that brings us together as One American People.For over 200 years we've been the architects of our own future. And now we must build anew today.My father and mother, Tom and Barbara O'Malley, were born to the Great Depression and grew up as part of that great generation that won the Second World War. My dad flew 33 missions over Japan in a B-24 Liberator, and went on to college only because of the GI Bill.My mom, herself, flew in the Civil Air Patrol at the age of seventeen.They raised their children  the six of us  to a middle class future secured largely by the sacrifices and better choices of their generation.But they would never accept the notion that somehow theirs was the ""greatest generation."" For they believed and they taught us that every generation of Americans has the ability  and the sacred responsibility  to become great.And so we must. No matter how long the odds, no matter how large the challenge, and no matter how tough the fight.This is the urgent work calling us forward today: to rebuild the truth of the American Dream for ALL Americans. And to begin right now!Last month, television sets around the world were filled with the anger and the rage, and the flames of some of the humblest and hardest hit neighborhoods of Baltimore.For all of us who have given so much of our energies to making our city a safer, fairer, more just and more prosperous place, it was a heartbreaking night in the life of our City.But there is something to be learned from that night, and there is something to be offered to our country from those flames.For what took place here was not only about race...not only about policing in America.It's about everything it is supposed to mean to be an American.The scourge of hopelessness that happened to ignite here that evening, transcends race or geography.Witness the record numbers of young white kids killing themselves with heroin in suburbs and small towns across America.The hard truth of our shared reality is this: Unemployment in many American cities and in many small towns across the United States is higher now than it was eight years ago.Conditions of extreme and growing poverty, create conditions for extreme violence.We have work to do...Our economic and political system is upside down and backwards and it is time to turn it around.What happened to our economy  what happened to the American Dream  did not happen by chance.Nor was it merely the result of global forces somehow beyond our control.Powerful, wealthy special interests here at home have used our government to create  in our own country  an economy that is leaving a majority of our people behind.An economy that has so concentrated wealth in the hands of the very few that it has taken opportunity from the homes of the many.An economy where a majority of our people are unheard, unseen, un-needed, and left to conclude that their lives and labors are literally worth less today than they were yesterday,... And will be worth less still tomorrow...We are allowing our land of opportunity to be turned into a land of inequality.Main Street struggles, while Wall Street soars.Tell me how it is, that not a single Wall Street CEO was convicted of a crime related to the 2008 economic meltdown. Not. A. Single. One.Tell me how it is, that you can get pulled over for a broken tail light in our country, but if you wreck the nation's economy you are untouchable.This is not how our economy is supposed to work!This is not how our country is supposed to work!This is not the American Dream!And it does not have to be this way!This generation still has time to become great.We have saved the world before and we must save our country now  and we will do that by rebuilding the American Dream!As I look out here this morning over the original ""land of the free and the home of the brave,"" I see the faces of people who have done so much for so many in our City and our State.Together, we made our City a safer, healthier and better place for kids.Together, we made our city Believe again. We invented a new and better way of governing called CitiStat, and we got things done.Together, we made our State's public schools the best in the United States. We made college more affordable for more families.We led our people forward through a devastating national recession. We took greater care to protect our land, our air, and the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.We passed Marriage Equality and we passed the DREAM Act.Together, we raised the minimum wage and we sustained the highest median income in America. We achieved top rankings for innovation, entrepreneurship, and minority and women's business development.Yes, understanding precedes action.And it took new leadership. New perspectives. And new approaches.But we believed in the dream,...together we took action to make it real,... and that is exactly what we must do as a nation today.Our economy isn't money, our economy is peopleall of our people.We measure success by the growing prosperity and security of our peopleall of our people.A stronger middle class is not the consequence of economic growth  a stronger middle class is the cause of economic growth.Together, as one nation we must build an American economy that works again for all of us.That means good jobs and wage policies that allow hardworking families to actually get ahead. That means a higher minimum wage, overtime pay for overtime work, and respect for the rights of all workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages.If we take these actions...the dream will live again.Climate change is real. We must create an American jobs agenda to build a new renewable energy future.We must launch a new agenda to rebuild America's cities as places of Justice and Opportunity for all.And if we take these actions... the dream will live again.For the sake of our country's security, and our country's well-being, and our country's economic growth, we must also bring 11 million of our neighbors out of the shadows by passing comprehensive immigration reform.Because the enduring symbol of our nation is not the barbed wire fence,... it is the Statue of Liberty.We are a nation of immigrants. We are a compassionate and generous people. And if we act according to our principlesand the better angels of our natureif we return to our true selves, the dream will live again.Make no mistake about it  our ability to lead the world and be safe in this world depends on the strength of the American Dream here at home. The challenges we face in the world today are different from the challenges we faced in the 1990's.Together, we must construct a New National Security Strategy and build new alliances that are forward-seeing and forward-acting.The center of this new strategy must be the reduction of threats. Fast-evolving threats  from violent extremism, pandemic, cyber attacks, nuclear proliferation, nation-state failures, to the drought, famine, and floods of climate change.Together, we must craft a New Foreign Policy of Engagement and Collaboration. We must join with like-minded people around the world  especially with nations here in our own hemisphere  for the cause we share of a rising global middle class.We must put our national interest first, we must put America first.But we cannot rebuild the American Dream here at home by catering to the voices of the privileged and the powerful.Let's be honest. They were the ones who turned our economy upside-down in the first place. And they are the only ones who are benefiting from it.We need to prosecute cheats, we need to reinstate Glass-Steagall, and if a bank is too big to fail without wrecking our nation's economy...then it needs to be broken up before it breaks us...again.Goldman Sachs is one of the biggest repeat-offending investment banks in America. Recently, the CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he'd be just fine with either Bush or Clinton.I bet he would...Well, I've got news for the bullies of Wall Street The presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families.It is a sacred trust to be earned from the people of the United States, and exercised on behalf of the people of the United States.The only way we are going to rebuild the American Dream is if we re-take control of our own American government!The poet laureate of the American Dream, Bruce Springsteen, once asked:Is a dream a lie, if it don't come true?...Or is it something worse?Whether the American dream becomes a lie, or becomes an ongoing truth that our children can enjoy,...can build upon,... can live,... is really up to you and me.It is up to all of us.It's not about Wall Street, not about the big five banks, it's not even about big money trying to buy our elections.It's about U.S.It is about whether, together, We the People still have the will to become great Americans.I believe we do.My decision is made.Now you will all have a vital choice to make next year, for the good of your families, and for the good of the country you love and carry in your hearts.It is a choice that people will ask you about for years to come.And so, when a child with a world of learning ahead asks who you voted for, I want you to be able to tell that child, ""I voted for you.""When you see a dad sweating through another long shift in order to give his daughter a better future, I want you to be able to tell him, ""I voted for you.""When you see a mom working long hours at two jobs for the dream of sending her son to college, I want you to be able to tell her, ""I voted for you.""When you see a young father who hungers for a decent job to support his family, I want you to be able to tell him, ""I voted for you.""The story of our country's best days is not found in a history book, because this generation of Americans is about to write it!And that is why today,... to you  and to all who can hear my voice  I declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States....and I'm running for YOU.May God Bless you and may God Bless the United States of America."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"June 21, 2015","Remarks at the United States Conference of Mayors 83rd Annual Meeting in San Francisco, California","It is so good to be back here among great friends and colleagues at the U.S. Conference of Mayors.President Kevin Johnson, Mayor Lee, I greatly appreciate your kindness in allowing me to speak with you this afternoon.My name is Martin O'Malley. I am the 47th Mayor of Baltimore.I am running for President of the United States in order to rebuild the American Dream for all Americans, and I intend to rebuild that Dream by rebuilding the hearts of America's cities.Once a mayor, always a mayor.It has been 86 years since any Mayor served as President of the United States.In our short time together, I want to speak with you  Mayor to Mayor  about the Dream we share, the grief we bear, and the urgent life-saving work that calls us forward.We come together in a sad week in the life of our country.Another senseless gun massacre in America.Newtown, Aurora, Washington Naval Yard, and now Charleston.The entire world must think us mad  sending trillions to Afghanistan and Iraq while the casualties pile up here in our own cities and towns.Not long ago, I had the privilege to visit Mother Emmanuel Church in Charleston and South Carolina. I sat with Rev. Senator Pinckney, with church leaders, and community leaders. Total hospitality, total generosity of heart.We spoke in that same church basement about the hopes and dreams we shared for our country and our children.None could foresee the tragedy that was to come.Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of Emmanuel AME Church who have lost so much, to the people of Charleston, and to their Mayor  and our friend and brother  Joe Riley.Joy and suffering go together in life we are told.As Mayors, you are all too often called to the sides of families suffering an unfathomable loss.To scenes of unspeakable and incomprehensible human cruelty.And yet, out of the carnage of this despicable racial massacre, we saw the true spirit of our nation rise.I am talking about the courage  the excess of love  we witnessed when the families of the victims, found the strength, through God's grace, to look the killer of their family members in the eye and to forgive him.Forgiveness...If they can do that, is it really too much to ask that we as a nation do better???I heard some elected official say this week: ""laws can't change this...""Actually, they can.So too, can the actions we take as caring human beings.So too, can the expectations we set for our children and for ourselves.What a terribly jarring and callous sight then  in the wake of this racist massacre  to see the American flag at half staff, while above it at full staff over the state Capitol of South Carolina flew a Confederate flag...If the families of Charleston can forgive, can let go of their anger, is it really too much to ask the state government officials of South Carolina to retire the Confederate flag to a museum?America must do better.This I believe from my own service as Mayor:The most poisonous force in American politics is not bad people who do bad things; it is good people who do nothing.The shrug of the shoulders, the resignation that somehow this is the best we can do.One of the sad triumphs of white racism is the degree to which it has succeeded in subconsciously convincing so many of us  black and white  that somehow black lives don't matter.If the thousands of young men killed by gun violence every year across America were young, poor and white rather than young poor and black, it is hard to imagine that our Congress would continue to block common sense measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.A single American life is worth more than all the guns in the United States.How many senseless acts of violence do we have to endure as a people before we stand up to the Congressional lobbyists of the NRA?How many more Americans have to die?In Maryland, we banned assault weapons and the kinds of high capacity weapons that exist only to inflict human casualties. We fixed the permitting process to ensure people didn't hide behind straw-buyers.We need a national assault weapons ban. We need stricter background checks. And we need a nationwide commitment to keep straw-buyers from obtaining guns for others.The truth we share is this: Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter!As soon as I was sworn in as Mayor of Baltimore in 1999, we began a pattern of regular neighborhoods meetings on a rotating basis.We dubbed these large neighborhood meetings, ""Mayor's night out.""Our City had allowed herself by that year to become the most violent, most addicted and the most abandoned City in America.We had work to do.We had to start getting things done again.And we had to do it together.In a crowded school auditorium in East Baltimore this night, a 12 year-old girl named Amber waited her turn, and stepped up to the microphone.She said, ""Mr. Mayor, there are so many drug dealers and addicted people in my neighborhood that people in the newspaper call my neighborhood, Zombieland. And my question for you is do you know,....and are you doing anything about it???""...Yes, I knew. And, together, we did something about it.We brought forward a new and better way of governing called, Citistat.With 311 for all customer service calls, we started measuring the performance, the outcomes, and the deliverables of government rather than just the annual budgetary inputs.We improved our schools; we cleaned up our City.We improved public safety with real-time data. We greatly expanded drug treatment, and over the next ten years we produced the largest drop in major crime of any big city in America.We didn't make perfect, but we did make progress. Every day. Like mayors do.Every day we strived to better understand what works; to become smarter at reducing crime; and to become tougher on the causes of crime...I have now spent the last two years traveling all across our country.There is much that I have heard and learned that is good.Thanks to you and your work, people generally feel much better about how their cities are governed than they did say ten, fifteen years ago.But I have also felt and seen a growing gap of injustice that threatens to tear our country apart.There is urgent work that calls us forward today.It is the urgent work of rebuilding the American Dream That beautiful truth we share as Americans that wherever you start, through your own hard work, commitment, and love of family, you should be able to get ahead.To rebuild the truth of the American Dream, as a nation we must rebuild America's Cities as places of Justice and Opportunity for All.This isn't about pilot projects; this isn't about public private partnerships.This is about U.S.  U period. S period.The fact of the matter is that 85% of our national gross domestic product is produced in the metropolitan areas of our country.And cities are at the center of these metropolitan engines of jobs and opportunity.Cities are also where the greatest numbers of our citizens live who are being failed, left behind, un-needed and unseen by a brutal economy.Cities are where our people feel most the icy cold indifference of a Federal Government where powerful wealthy special interest rule.Where gridlock and sequester cuts triumph while our national interest gets kicked to the curb.Our nation has produced a great many outstanding Mayors over these recent years across our country  but our national economy isn't producing enough jobs in the places where our people need them most.No Mayor by him or herself, no Governor by him or herself can fix this problem.Nor can a single President can fix in two terms a twisted economy that was 30 years in the making.This is something we must do as a nation.And you and I know solving this national problem will require Presidential leadership.This is not a matter of following the polls; it is a matter of forging a new consensus for American progress  progress that harnesses the enormous untapped potential in the hearts of America's cities.For the hard truth of our times is this  for all the good work that President Obama has done to save us from a second Great Depression, to extend healthcare coverage to all, to get our economy to create jobs every month for 64 months in a row... most Americans feel we are all working harder but slipping further behind.And they are not wrong.The fact of the matter is that 75% of us are earning the same or less today than we were twelve years ago.This is the first time that has happened this side of World War II.Think of what another decade of declining wages would mean for American families, for our American economy...This is not the American Dream?This is not how our country is supposed to work.This is not how our economy is supposed to work.The great poet laureate of the American Dream, Bruce Springsteen, once asked: ""is a Dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something worse...?""For far too many of our citizens, the dream is danger of becoming a lie.For all of the progress we have made in making our cities better governed, safer, healthier, cleaner, and more livable places, the hard truth is this  Unemployment is higher today in Baltimore than it was eight years ago.Unemployment is higher in Chicago is higher than it was eight years ago. Higher in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and many other cities as well.We have created an economy that has concentrated wealth and power so very tightly in the hands of the very few that it is sucking opportunity out of the homes and neighborhoods of the many.When any nation reaches this height of inequality, there are two and only two paths ahead.One is a sensible rebalancing based on the common good we share, the other, is pitchforks, or stones: more of them in the hands of ever more angry, unemployed, and despairing young men.How do we solve this problem? How do we rebuild the American Dream so we can give our children and grandchildren a better, healthier, more prosperous quality of life?First and foremost, by remembering that our economy isn't money, our economy is people  all of our people.We must not only keep the minimum wage above the poverty line but we must raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour wherever we can  and cities are leading the way!We must also pay for overtime work, adopt policies like paid family leave. We must make it easier rather than harder for workers to join unions, and we should make easier for people to vote and not harder. We must expand Social Security and we must get 11 million of our neighbors out of the shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform.Wage polices that allow hard-working families to eyed their children and get ahead are key.Full participation and inclusion is the way.But there are some investments we can only make as a nation if we are to give our children a future with more opportunity and more security rather than less.That is why  this week  I proposed an American Jobs Agenda for the Climate Challenge, and that is also why I came here on Father's Day to ask for your help in crafting a New Agenda to Rebuild America's Cities as places of Justice and Opportunity.Here too, Cities are pointing the way forward, but only the United States of America can make the investments needed to build up our own nation.The Chinese and the Indians aren't going to do it for us; they have countries of their own to build.That is why we must create jobs by designing greener, more livable, more energy efficient cities.This means making cities the market leaders in our nation's move to a clean distributed energy future!From transforming housing authority properties into a new generation of energy efficient living to accelerating the building of Net Zero Energy Homes, to creating Green Empowerment Zones to creating and a Universal Right to National Service!This means investing more in CDBG, not less. This means investing more in Homeland Security and Public Safety grants, not less. This means doing more, not less to support the special education needs of City Schools.This means making long overdue investments in mass transit, city circulators, and other infrastructure that create jobs. This means designing and building a new generation of Net Zero Energy Workforce Housing that the full economic participation of our people demands!Do we know?And are we doing something about it?After the unrest in Baltimore two months ago, there were neighbors who woke up at dawn to clean up the streets and sidewalks from the rocks and bottles and broken glass of the night before.They set to work cleaning up. Many were wearing t-shirts that a church group had made.Screen-printed on the shirt was a simple, beautiful instruction:""Do better,"" it said.Do Better...We can do better.America must do better.We still have time to become great Americans.We can make our country a safer, stronger, more just and compassionate nation.But it will take work. It will take leadership. And it will take all of us.Together, we can rebuild the American Dream.Together, we can rebuild the hearts of America's cities.Together, we can change the course of our country's future for the better!Thank you for leading America forward."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"June 25, 2015","Remarks at the TruCon15 Conference in Washington, DC","I. IntroductionThank you for having me here today.For more than a decade, the Truman National Security Project has been at the forefront of nurturing a new generation of leaders in foreign policy and national security.From military bases in San Diego to federal agencies in Washington, you are not only advocating for a strong, smart, principled approach to international affairsyou are taking action, every day.Through Operation Free, you are mobilizing a coalition of veterans, activists, and experts who know our reliance on fossil fuels threatens the security of our country.Through No Exceptions, you are working to make sure that our military recruits the most talented Americansregardless of gender.And through the Frontline Civilians Initiative, you are supporting the diplomats, journalists, NGO workers and development professionals who are not in uniform, but who nonetheless put their lives on the line to alleviate human suffering.Thanks to all of you, the Truman Project has emerged as a valuable source of ideas on the toughest challenges facing our nation today.And we need those bold ideas now, more than ever.II. America's Role In The WorldAmerica's role in the world is to advance the cause of a rising global middle class free from oppression, free from want, free from fear.But after twelve years on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.......and after a global financial crisis and long recession that our people are still struggling to recover from......it is understandable that many Americans would like to disengage from the world.Understandable, but not responsible.Because our country's securityand our children's prosperitydemand that we be more engaged with the world around us, not less.We do this primarily by making our nation more prosperous and secure here at home.And we do this by exercising our economic, diplomatic, military, and healing power around the world, in ways that are consistent with our moral principles.In essence:We must create a more far-sighted and a more pro-active foreign policybased on engagement and collaboration, rather than going it alone.And we must construct a new framework for our national security strategy, focused on the reduction of threats.Today's challenges defy easy solutions. We may have the most sophisticated military in history, but we do not have a silver bullet.This morning, I want to share a vision for a more agile, innovative, and forward-thinking approach, one that will enable us to master the challenges of our timesrather than falling victim to them.My purpose here today is not to offer soundbite solutions to a laundry list of crises.My purpose here today is to lay out a long-term framework for pursuing our national interests in a fast-changing world.III. HistoryA little bit of important history.As America and her allies brought World War II to a close, a plain-spoken man named Harry Truman became our President.Having fought in the First World War, Truman knew something about courage, about service, and about sacrifice.It was Truman who concluded World War II.It was Truman who brought forward the Marshall Plan that would turn our former enemies into democratic allies.It was Truman who led the United States to recognize Israel immediately upon her founding.And it was Truman who crafted and signed into law the National Security Act of 1947 the most lasting overhaul of our National Security strategies and institutions.We must take the broader lessons of what worked in Truman's dayand apply them to the emerging threats of our own time.Because today, we face an equally daunting array of threats.These threats are much different and far more complex than those of the 1990's.Violent extremism. Nuclear proliferation. Pandemics. Cyber-attacks.Rising inequality. Failed nation-states. The mega-droughts, famines, and floods caused by climate change.And more refugees than at any time since World War II.It is time for a New National Security Actone focused on the reduction of threats like these.IV. Key QuestionsUnderstanding precedes action.To understand, we must ask the right questions.Among them:How do we balance the use of our military, diplomatic, and economic tools to advance our national interests, in ways that are consistent with our most deeply held American values?What enhanced roles might institutions like the Defense Threat Reduction Agency or the Centers for Disease Control play in looking over the horizonto alert us earlier to emerging threats?What are the forward-looking investments and new alliances we can makewith other nationsthat will stem the root causes of instability?And how can we best prepare to defend ourselves from our enemieswhile doing all we can to prevent conflict in the first place?IV. Protecting The People Of The United StatesThe first and foremost responsibility of the President of the United States is to protect the American people.Today, this means transforming our military's force structure to focus on 21st-century challenges.It means protecting our privacy and our security at the same time.It means reducing security threats not only with better technology, but with better human intelligence.It means transforming the way we partner with the private sector and civil societyharnessing the energy and talents of the American people to advance our values.It means joining with allies to deploy renewable energy technologiesboth at home and around the worldto confront the very real and present danger of potentially irreversible climate change.It means understanding that comprehensive immigration reform is both an economic and a national security imperative.It means protecting the United States from cyber attacks on the digital battlefields of servers and smartphones.It means re-thinking how we deal with nations like Russia and Chinawhich are neither trusted allies nor total adversaries.It means forging a New Alliance for Progress right here in our own American hemisphere, which we have under-valued and neglected for far too long.And it means forming regional partnerships to address emerging threatsin places like the South China Sea, the Arctic, and the sea lanes of the Middle East.There is urgent work to be done.V. Climate ChangeNowhere is this more collaborative approach more important than in confronting the growing and immediate challenge of severe climate change.For years, the Pentagon has recognized global warming as an urgent national security threat.Your organization's leaderformer Army Captain Mike Breenput it best at a recent Congressional hearing, when he said:""Over 97 percent of climate scientists say that man-made climate change is a reality.""""As a combat leader, if 97 percent of my intelligence indicated that I was about to face a lethal danger that would risk the lives of my paratroopersI would be committing unconscionable malpractice if I did not listen and act.""Mike is right.The energy technologies needed to combat climate change exist todayit's only the political will that is lacking.America can, and must, lead the wayby pursuing an ambitious plan to ensure our country is powered 100 percent by clean energy, by 2050.Climate change is not only a very real existential threat to human life, it is also the greatest business opportunity to come to our country in a hundred years.We must seize this opportunity by creating an American Green Jobs Agenda that is a match for the climate challenge.We need to invest in resiliencefrom the Jersey Shore to California's Central Valley.We need to spur innovationto develop cutting-edge technologies that will create jobs at home, and unlock new markets abroad.We need to embrace new ideas at the state level, as we have in Maryland where, in just eight years, we increased renewable energy capacity by 57 percent, became a clean-tech jobs hub, and cut carbon emissions by 10 percent.America's leadership and example are essential.Because climate change is a global challengewith global consequences. It is the transformation that transforms everything.And by confronting this challenge, we can realize global economic opportunitiesand job opportunitiesfor the United States.We must partner with emerging markets, in our own hemisphere and beyond, to distribute renewable energy solutions and green design.We must aggressively push for global emissions agreements in venues like the upcoming UN climate summit in Paris.And we must seed, scale, and deploy American-made renewable energy technologies throughout the world.To reduce mankind's carbon footprint.To preserve the living systems of this earthfor ourselves and our posterity.VI. TradeLike climate change, trade is a global challenge. And it also has global consequences.In our closely connected world, prosperity is not a zero-sum game.While the cause of a rising global middle class is vital to our long-term economic and national security, our power is grounded in the strength, here at home, of our own middle class.What gain for the United States can be found in secret trade deals that fast track the export of American jobs, and undermine wages for American workers?Trade deals that raise standards for workers and the environment are good for the United States.Trade deals that lower standards for workers and the environment are bad for the United States.This is not a call for protectionism.It is a call for fair competitionthe kind that is consistent with our most deeply held American values.The national interest of the People of the United States of America is not measured by the bottom-line profits of multi-national corporationshowever large.No nation ever off-shored its way to greatness.To rebuild the American Dream, we must stop making it easier to ship American jobs abroad and start making better investments to grow our economy, here at home.VII. CyberOne such investment is cybersecurity a new domain that is both an emerging opportunity and an emerging challenge to every facet of our society.For centuries, nation-states sought to protect themselves from attacks by land and sea. And later, from attacks by air.Now, in the information age, we must move to defend ourselvesand our economyfrom attacks carried out through the Internet.Last year, global cyberattacks jumped by nearly 50 percent.Stolen intellectual property and other opportunities lost to cybercrime could cost us as many as 200,000 American jobs annually.And our critical infrastructure remains extremely vulnerable to hackers.Nuclear power plants, public transportation, air traffic control, water systems, and even the electric grid itselfall are in danger of being shut down with a few lines of malicious code.The harm would extend far beyond just the loss of our personal datait could grind our national and metro economies to a halt.We must develop and follow-through on a comprehensive new agenda for cybersecurity that protects every level of our society.To accomplish this goal, we must harness the skills of American engineers, designers, and scholarsfrom Silicon Valley to Fort Meadeto secure our networks.And we must empower our National Guard with a new missionthe mission of protecting our cyber-networks in the Homelandon a state-by-state level.I have seen this need firsthand.As the President's appointed co-chair of the Council of Governorsa group charged by an Act of Congress to work with the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland SecurityI advocated for a new national initiative to recruit, equip, and train cybersecurity units in every state's National Guard.These are highly-paid skills in the private sector.And the quickest and most cost-effective way to stand up this capacity is in the citizen-soldier context of every state's National Guard.Furthermore, National Guard Cyber Units are best suited under our Constitution for the Homeland mission of collaborating with public and private sector partners to protect vital networks.VIII. Sustainable DevelopmentLike cybersecurity, sustainable development is a national security imperative. It requires a long-term commitment to advance the cause of a rising global middle class.This is not a fanciful dream. Hard-won progress is being made.Inspired by the Millennium Development Goals, the United Statesin partnership with the global communityhas cut extreme poverty and child deaths in half over the past 25 years: one of the greatest measurable leaps ever achieved in human prosperity and health.And yet, still more than a billion people in Asia, Africa and Latin America live on less than $1.25 a dayall of them vulnerable to the scourge of extreme poverty and violent extremism.Is it any surprise that, in Liberiaa country with just one medical school and meager hospital suppliesmore than 10,000 people were infected with Ebola?Is it any surprise that, in Hondurasa country with the world's highest murder rate and the most brutal drug traffickingthat thousands of people have fled for their lives, in our own hemisphere?Our leadershipin collaboration with other nationsis essential.To be successful, we must involve more Americans from all walks of life in the cause of developmentscientists and students; entrepreneurs and security experts; business executives and urban planners.We must better integrate our development and military teamsensuring that we are tailoring our assistance to get things done within the local culture.We must support American businesses that project our values in emerging markets.We must adequately fund our diplomatic and development agenciesparticularly USAID and the State Department.And we must achieve the goal of ending extreme poverty, hunger, and preventable child and maternal deathall within the next 15 years.By promoting open societiesand by protecting the dignity of human lives in fragile stateswe not only build the next generation of political and economic partners,......we also reduce the threat of our being drawn into more costly conflicts in the decades to come.As James Mattis, the former Commander of U.S. Central Command, put it bluntly: ""If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.""IX. Managing The Most Immediate Security ThreatsDevelopment, Defense, and Diplomacy must stand together as equal and essential parts of our national security.They are also critical in reducing threats in what may be the most volatile and dangerous area in the world today: the Middle East.Over these last several years, I have had the opportunity to talk with dozens of patriotic Americans who have given their energies and talents in this troubled region of our world.I agree with noted national security expert Phil Gordon's conclusions on our core national interests in the Middle East:To protect our allies and prevent regional war.To keep sea lanes open and provide humanitarian assistance.To prevent terrorist safe havens. And to prevent nuclear proliferation.Indeed, a nuclear-armed Iran is one of the most immediate threats we face.I believe negotiations are the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon,...the best way to avoid even greater conflict in the region,...and the best way to stop widespread nuclear proliferation across the Middle East.It was for this purpose that the United States forged an unprecedented international partnershipincluding Russia and Chinato apply the strongest set of sanctions Iran has ever faced.Those sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table.If we reach a verifiable, enforceable agreement that cuts off Iran's multiple pathways to a weaponand its ability to sprint to a bombCongress would be wise to support it.And if Iran is found to be cheating, its leaders must know that we stand ready to reinstate the full array of sanctions that decimated their economy.X. Containing, Degrading and Confronting ISISBut no threat better illustrates the unintended consequences of a mindless rush to warand a lack of understandingthan the emergence of ISIS.Containing, degrading, and defeating ISIS will require an integrated approachan approach focused not only on military power, but on political solutions.The invasion of Iraqalong with the subsequent disbanding of the Iraqi militarywill be remembered as one of the most tragic, deceitful, and costly blunders in U.S. history.We are still paying the price of a war pursued under false pretenses and acquiesced to by ""the appalling silence of the good.""In confronting ISIS, we must avoid mission creepand be mindful that American boots on the ground can be counter-productive to our desired outcome.We will not be successful in degrading ISIS if the number of militants taken off the battlefield is exceeded by the number of new recruits replacing them.But we must also ensure that our partners have what they need to contain, degrade, and ultimately defeat ISIS.In partnership with other nations in the region and across the world, we must counter ISIS propaganda and use our own communications tools more effectively.We must do more to amplify credible, local voices in the region to reveal ISIS for what it is: a gang of murderous thugs who have perverted the name of one of the world's great religions.And we must make every effort to encourage the Iraqi government to govern more inclusively, as they train up a new army with committed leadership, and a will to defend their own country.XI. New Times Require New Relationships And Better IntelligenceAddressing threats like ISIS will require new relationships and better human intelligence.This is also true in every other theater of engagement.There is no substitute for human relationships and the work of patriotic Americans in our foreign service, and our national security agencies.To succeed in a world of rapid change, we must adapt our national security institutions to better anticipate fast-emerging threats.And we must recognize that there are real lessons to be learned from the tragedy in Benghazi:Namely, we need to know in advance who is likely to take poweror vie for itonce a dictator is toppled.Twitter and Facebook are no substitute for personal relationships and human intelligence.We must recruit and retain a new generation of talented American diplomats.And we must give them the tools to identify and engage with a new generation of leaders from different walks of lifeoften in hostile environments where we lack historic ties; where we lack relationships.That was the work that Ambassador Chris Stevens was about. He gave his life reaching out to those emerging from the rubble of Qaddaffi's dictatorship.In remembering him, his grieving father said:""He died doing what he loved mostworking to build bridges of understanding and mutual respect between the people of the United States and the people of the Middle East.""""Chris was successful because he embodied the traits that have always endeared America to the worlda commitment to democratic principles, and respect for others, regardless of race, religion or culture.""XII. Strength At HomeThe greatest power we possess as Americans is just that: the power of our principles.We project that power around the world primarily through our own exampleof the inclusive society and inclusive economy we build here at home.The challenges we face today: to rebuild the American Dream at home,...to craft a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration,...to refocus our National Security Strategy on 21st century threats,......these challenges are all connected, and their pursuits are mutually reinforcing of one another.But ultimately, the source of America's global strength is our own prosperity at home.Our economy isn't money. Our economy is peopleall of our people.Only with a stronger and more inclusive economy can we maintain our security.Only with a stronger and more inclusive American economy, will we succeed in pursuing a more effective foreign policy for the cause that we lead: of a rising global middle classfree from oppression, want, and fear.XIII. ConclusionIn thinking deeply about America's role in the world, I find myself drawing inspiration from the very troubled world that my parents' generation tamed, and the planet they saved from the brink of nuclear annihilation.My parents were born during the Great Depression. They were part of the great generation of Americans that went on to win the Second World War.My dad flew 33 missions over Japan in a B-24 Liberator, and went to college only because of the GI Bill. Mom flew in the Civil Air Patrol at the age of seventeen.They raised their childrenthe six of usin a world secured by the sacrifices and the better choices of their generation.We must remember the abiding truth of their successthat our strength abroad depends upon our strength at home.No fighter jet or troop battalion will keep us as safe as a vibrant economy, a strong democracy, and a growing middle class.By restoring an American economy that works for ALL of us again,.......we will make ourselves a more prosperous and a more secure nation.We will give our children a future with more opportunity, rather than less.And we will make our planet a healthier, more peaceful, and more just place for all of humanity.These are the ambitions worthy of a truly great people.This is why I am running for President of the United States.Thank you."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"July 13, 2015","Remarks at the National Council of La Raza Conference in Kansas City, Missouri","It is such a pleasure to be here with you. Thank you Janet Murguia for the introduction and for the invitation to speak today. This is Janet's tenth year at the helm of the National Council of La Raza. That means ten years of exceptional leadership in the battle for Hispanic civil rights and for a sane, humane vision of immigration.As many of you know, Janet and her family have lived one of the greatest American success stories you'll ever hear. Janet's grandparents moved to the United States to escape the Mexican Revolution. Neither her mom or dad made it past the seventh grade in school, but they believed in hard work, family, community, possibility - all that this nation promised. Growing up, everyone in Janet's family shared one bedroom. But they also shared something else - an unshakable belief in the American Dream.Janet and her six siblings grew up to pursue college degrees and law degrees. Janet went on to work at the White House, to serve as a top administrator at the University of Kansas, and of course lead this fine organization. One of Janet's brothers is a federal judge. One of Janet's sisters is a federal judge. That's the first time in our country's history a brother and sister have served on the federal bench. And that too is the American Dream come to life. And now Janet helps lead the fight to make that dream available to every Hispanic American, to every American family.Janet had big shoes to fill after the 30 extraordinary years Raul Yzaguirre spent making this organization a national force in pursuit of Hispanic equality and opportunity. When Raul was a child in south Texas, his family faced a nightly Hispanic curfew. Despite growing up in the face of exclusion, his distinguished resume includes his decades of leadership of NCLR, his appointment as American ambassador to the Dominican Republic, and a host of other great achievements in service of the cause.Along the way, Raul benefited from one of the most far-sighted, transformative investments this country has ever made in its people and the growth of its middle class. Raul went to college on the G.I. Bill. Millions of lives have now been touched by Raul's life's work - in part because this country had the good sense to invest in him.I know the power of that investment personally. My dad, Tom O'Malley, went to college on the G.I. Bill as well. I think it's fair to say he went to college only because of the G.I. Bill. His dream was set in motion when my great grandparents came to this country from Ireland. My great grandfather, his name was also Martin O'Malley, had no money, and his first language was not English. But the hopes and dreams he had for his children were purely American.He started from zero. Just like so many New Americans today start from zero.The New Americans he worked beside then risked their lives in the mines of southwest Arizona to feed their families, and to give their children a better future. New Americans today have that same experience. The same drive. The same spirit. the same love that builds our country up, one person, one family at a time.It's a spirit that has always made us the Land of Opportunity.For many years I have very intentionally and repeatedly used the term ""New Americans"". The genius of our country is not so much about where you came from, it's where you're going  and where we're all going, together.Today's New American immigrants are not the first to face the ugliness of fear and exclusion.During my service as Mayor and as Governor, I have always kept a sign from the 1890s on my desk - it says ""Help Wanted: No Irish Need Apply."" Those signs were once common in America.And for me that sign was a daily reminder that not only were we all once strangers in a strange land...but we are all in this together and ""we must help each other if we are to succeed.""I suppose this truth is why I have always seen, in the eyes of my New American neighbors, the eyes of the great-grandparents I never met. The cause we share is the cause of human dignity, the work we share is the strengthening of our common good as a people. It's the dream made real by the Murguia family. The dream made real by the Yzaguirre family. The dream made real by MY family...by every family who loves their children and loves our country.It is the American Dream made real, that lifts us all.As governor of Maryland, I fought to make that dream real every day.We did this by including more of our people...more fully...in the economic, social and political life of our state. In Maryland, we didn't wait for the federal government to act, we pursued our own DREAM Act to ensure that 36,000 Dreamers could have access to affordable higher education.After I signed the DREAM Act into law, our brothers and sisters in the Republican party petitioned the DREAM Act to a referendum. It was a straight yes or no vote - we were losing our case in the polls, 47 to 39. But we forged a new consensus, and we became the first state to defend the DREAM Act at the ballot box. And we won with 59% percent of the vote.This was not simply a victory for the DREAMers' future. It was a victory for Maryland's future.In Maryland we expanded access to driver's licenses, because people need to be able to get to work safely, and obey the rules of the road.In the very start of my Administration, in 2008, I established the New Americans Commission, to highlight and welcome the skills that were being brought to our state by New American immigrants. That effort was helped by our first Labor Commissioner, a name that might be familiar to you now: Tom Pereznow our Labor Secretary for the United States of America.During my two terms as Governor, we increased government contracts to Latino businesses by 154 percent. We became the first state in the nation to pass a living wage and we expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, not once but twice. We raised the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour so that by 2016 hundreds of thousands of Marylanders will have gotten a raise.We froze tuition four years in a row, and did better than every state but one at keeping down the cost of tuition. This helped Hispanic students earn twice as many associate degrees and bachelor's degrees during my service as governor. We kept Maryland's unemployment rate among Hispanic workers down to one of the lowest in the nation.Anyone can talk about it, but we actually did it.Las palabras NO son hechos,Del dicho al hecho hay mucho trecho.We created real opportunity in Maryland. We did it by investing in our people. We did it by including more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our state. Together, we made the Dream real for more and more families.Tomorrow, I will lay out a detailed immigration policy for the sake of our nation. Today, I want to share with you the core principles that guide my thinking. First, we are, and always have been, a nation of immigrants E PLURIBUS UNUM, out of many, we are one. Second, we are a compassionate and generous people. The enduring symbol of our nation is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty. Third, it is in everyone's best interest for us to reform a system that is callous, irrational, inhumane, and unjust.Our fight for immigration reform isn't only about our values as Americans. It is also about creating an economy that works for all of us.It's about bringing our neighbors out of the shadow economy and into the light of an open and inclusive economy. It is about making wages go upagainfor all Americans. We must begin by providing immediate relief to the millions of New Americans whose hopes have been dashed time and time again because Congress has failed to do its job.Many leaders within the Republican Party vilify, scapegoat, and seek every opportunity they can find to speak ill of New Americans and have fought tooth and nail against immigration reform. I know you share my disgust with the comments Donald Trump recently made.The real problem isn't that the Republicans have such a hate-spewing character running for president - the problem is that it's so hard to tell him apart from the other candidates. The Los Angeles Times ran a headline the other day: ""Republican Field Divided on Donald Trump's Comments about Mexican immigrants.""Divided. As in, not sure he's wrong?!Two days ago, Mr. Trump attracted a crowd of over 4,000 people to listen to his hate speech rant against New American Immigrants. What does it say about the direction of today's Republican Party that Donald Trump calls all New Americans from Mexico ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers"" and ""murderers..."" and the best their leadership can summon up is that they're ""divided."" There's nothing to be divided about here!If Donald Trump wants to run on a platform of demonizing immigrants, then he should go back to the 1840s and run for the nomination of the Know Nothing Party.But let me speak to you now about leadership in our own American Hemisphere.Maybe it's an Irish sensitivity, but I have a soft spot for island people who are treated poorly.I would like to speak to you, therefore, about our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, and our neighbors in this hemisphere on the island of Hispaniola.Boricuas have been our fellow citizens for almost 100 years. They have contributed to our economy, fought and died to defend our country. But today, they're suffering through what may be the worst economic and fiscal crisis in the island's history. We must not let their economy collapse. I led the field in calling for Congress to approve legislation giving Puerto Rico the same ability to negotiate with its creditors that states have under the U.S. Bankruptcy code.And I led the field in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to end the inequitable treatment of Puerto Rico under Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.We must all demand action.And on the island of Hispaniola, where mass deportations of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent have already begun, I was the first AND ONLY presidential candidate to call on the United States to work with our allies and the United Nations to use the full force of our diplomatic might to stop this atrocious affront to human rights.We wouldn't tolerate the expulsion of citizens without due process based on their skin color or ethnic background - and we should not remain silent when such an injustice is being perpetrated in our own hemisphere. Speaking up is the right thing to do, and we all must demand action.The people of this world, the people of our own American hemisphere, care a lot more about what we do than what we say. That's why I pledge to you that I will always act according to my principles and guided by our better angels. It is who I am, it is how I've led, and how I will continue to lead.We are the greatest and most powerful republic ever brought forth on the face of this planet. We have literally saved the world before, and we must save our country now. We have come a long way since the depths of the recession. But a great deal of work remains.We must raise the minimum wage, and pay overtime wages for overtime work. We must respect the rights of all workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages. We must send our children to college without having their future's swallowed whole by college loans.We must create an American jobs agenda to build a new renewable energy future. We must rebuild America's cities as places of Justice and Opportunity for all.And we must protect the American Dream from ever being wrecked again by the elite and powerful of Wall Street. And we should stop entering into secret so called free trade agreements that lower wages, lower standards for workers, and export American jobs.And I want to leave you with this American story.You all remember the scene last year, when refugee children were streaming north from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador - fleeing death at the hands of murderous drug gangs. When children arrive on our doorstep, fleeing starvation and death gangs, we can't turn our backs, we can't turn them away. Or worse pen them behind chain link and barbed wire in conditions that look more like those you would see at a local humane society than from a humane country. No  We must act like the generous, compassionate people we have always been. I said we should care for them decently and with respect for the dignity of every child.Some governors around the country spoke of these children as if they were some kind of invading swarm of jackrabbits. One of my advisers warned me that I was going out on a limb here.But I spoke truthfully to the compassion and the generosity in the heart of our people  and our people rallied. We rallied faith leaders and accommodated through foster care more children per capita than any other state in the United States. But I knew this was the right thing to do.Some months later, when I held a holiday open house, there was a long line of people waiting to shake hands and say hello. One gentleman came up to me and said, ""Governor O'Malley, I want to introduce you to Manuel. He's 13. And he was one of the refugee children who just came here from Guatemala.""The little boy had braved the desert and deprivation and so much else to get away from the drug gangs that infested his homeland.Manuel didn't speak English. But he took my hand to shake - and as he did he pulled me into a hug.I will never forget that moment. Because his dream is our dream. The dream of everything that's ever been possible only in America."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"July 17, 2015","Remarks at the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame Dinner in Cedar Rapids, Iowa","My name is Martin O'Malley, I am running for President, and I need your help. Tonight I would like to talk with you about the American Dream that we share. You and I are part of living, self-creating mystery called the United States of America. We've been given a giftnot an old car to be tossed aside and traded in when we are done with itbut a country. We must accept this gift with an open mind, and an open heart, if we are to give it to our children and grandchildren in a stronger and healthier condition than we received it ourselves. Make no mistake about it, our ability to give our children a better future depends on the strength of our country.Let me ask you all a question: how many of you firmly believe that you've enjoyed a better quality of life than your parents and grandparents? Raise your hands...Second question: how many of you believe just as firmly that your children and your grandchildren will enjoy a better quality of life? Raise your hands...That, my friends, is the question at the center of our table of democracy. Whether we are still that country where regardless of where you start, through your own hard work and your own talent and your own love of family, you can still get ahead. Whether we are still that nation that finds a way in every generation to include more and more of our people more fully in the social, economic, and political life of our nation.FDR told my grandparents in their day, not to be afraid. John Kennedy told my parents that to govern is to choose. I say to you that progress is a choice.Now I am not the only candidate for president in the Democratic Party who holds progressive values, but I am the only candidate for president with fifteen years of executive experienceas a big city mayor and as a governorturning those progressive values into actions.Getting things done. New leadership. Action, not words.In Baltimore, we took action to save lives by reducing record high violence to record lows. We increased drug treatment to free thousands of our courageous neighbors from the scourge of drug addiction. In Maryland in the face of the recession, we took action to raise the minimum wage, to create jobs, and to make our state #1 in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. Driver's licenses for new American immigrants, marriage equality, and a ban on assault weapons: and we didn't just talk about it, we actually got it done.We took greater action, not less, to make our public schools #1 in the country. We took action to freeze college tuition four years in a row in order to make college more affordable for more families. We fought for the DREAM Act and won, and we expanded family leave because when women succeed, America succeeds!As a nation, we have come a long way since the Wall Street crash and the Bush recession of 2008. As our country teetered on the brink of a second Great Depression, we elected a new president in Barack Obama to move us forward, and that is exactly what President Obama has done.Sixty-four months in a row of positive job creation: our country is clearly doing better, but most American families are not. The hard truth of our times is this: seventy percent of us are earning the same or less today than we were twelve years ago, and that is the first time that has happened this side of World War II.There is a growing injustice in our country, an economic inequality that threatens to tear us apart. Wealth and power have been so concentrated in the hands of so few that it is actually taking opportunity out of the homes and the neighborhoods of the many. And make no mistake about it, this did not happen by accident. Powerful, wealthy special interests have used our government to create in our own country an economy that is leaving a majority of our people behind. The promise of the American Dream is on the ropes, and most daysyou know this Dave Loebsackin this obstructionist Republican Congress, it's not even a fair fight.Fifty years ago, the nation's largest employer was GM. And the average GM employee could send a kid to college for the equivalent then of two weeks' wages. My father, like so many of his generation, went to college only because of the G.I. Bill. But today, we are saddling our graduating kids with more college debt than any developed nation on the planet.Meanwhile, as wages flat line or decline for most of us, family-owned businesses and farms are finding it harder and harder to compete with ever-larger concentrations of corporate power and monopolies. Get this: last year, Wall Street bonuses alone totaled twice what every American working at minimum wage earned combined. Tell me how it is that not a single Wall Street executive was convicted of a single crime related to the 2008 meltdown? Not a single one. What have we come to as a nation that you can get pulled over for a broken taillight, but if you wreck the nation's economy you're untouchable? Main Street struggles, while Wall Street soars. This is not the American Dream, this is not how our economy is supposed to work, and this is not how our country is supposed to work! We can do better!We must return to our true selves. Our economy isn't money. Our economy is people, all of our people. A stronger middle class is not the consequence of economic growth; a stronger middle class is the cause of economic growth. Therefore, we must take actions that actually lift incomes and wages again for all Americans. Can we all agree that no American family who works hard and plays by the rules should have to raise their children in poverty? So let's take action to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour wherever and however we can. Let us return to the economic justice of paying overtime pay for overtime work and expanding Social Security. Let's make it easier and not harder for any worker to join a labor union and collectively bargain for better wages.Can we all agree that every American family should have the option of sending their kids to earn a college degree debt-free? Then let's take the action to make debt-free college a reality and an option for every American family.A new era of American progress calls for a new agenda to rebuild our cities as places of justice and opportunity. It calls for a new national security strategy and new alliances that are more forward-seeing and more forward-acting to reduce threats. What's more, a new American era of progress calls for a cleaner, greener, renewable energy future. I am the first candidate, but let's hope I am not the last, to call for moving America forward by 2050 to a 100% clean-powered electric grid for the good of our country, creating good jobs and creating more opportunity.None of these things happen by chance; they do not happen by accident. To get wages to go up there's another thing we need to do, and that is to get 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground economy and into the open light by passing comprehensive immigration reform.There are also a couple of things that we need to stop doing, as a party and as a country. Among them, giving a free pass to the bullies of Wall Street. We must reinstitute Glass-Steagall, and we must reinstitute it today. We must prosecute financial crimes, and if a bank is too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to manage, then it's too damn big and it needs to be broken up before it breaks us up.We must also stop sending American jobs and profits overseas with bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Many of you remember the return on NAFTA. It was nada. We traded away good manufacturing jobs like Maytag's there in Newton, and in return, we got back empty promises and empty pockets. I am fundamentally opposedas an Americanto secret trade deals that our Congress is forced to vote on before we're even allowed to read them.Your Republican governor, Terry Branstad, has shown us the direction their party would take us: cutting taxes for big corporations, and then telling you that Iowa doesn't have the money to invest in your own children's education. Well, welcome to today's Republican Party. They once had leaders and visionaries: Lincoln, Eisenhower. Now they create traffic jams and dismiss science.Now the leading candidate for president is Donald Trump. After his racist, hate-filled commentstrue storyThe Los Angeles Times ran a headline, and I quote: ""Republican Field Divided on Donald Trump's Comments about Mexican immigrants."" Divided? As in, not sure he's wrong? If Donald Trump wants to run on a platform of demonizing immigrants, then he should go back to the 1840s and run for the presidential nomination of the Know Nothing Party!My friends, I leave you with these final thoughts: in this summer of anger and frustration and discontent, if you become doubtful about our country's better future, just talk to her young people. You will seldom find among them a climate change denier, someone who wants to discriminate against gay couples, or someone who wants to bash immigrants.The poet laureate of the American Dream, Bruce Springsteen, asked once:Is a dream a lie, if it don't come true?...Or is it something worse?Whether that dream is made true again for all of American families or not is not up to the big banks, it's not even up to big money trying to take over our elections, it's really up to you and me. It is about whether we still have the ability as a people to move our country forward. You have a vital choice to make and I need your help.After this election's over, when a child with a world of learning in front of him asks you who you voted for, I want you to be able to tell that child, ""I voted for you.""When you see a dad sweating through another long shift in order to give his daughter a better future, I want you to be able to tell him, ""I voted for you.""When you see a mom working long hours at two jobs for the dream of sending her son to college, I want you to be able to tell her, ""I voted for you.""When you see a young father who hungers for a job to feed his family, I want you to be able to tell him, ""I voted for you.""We are Democrats for good reasons. Because ours is the party of the people. Ours is the party of action. Ours is the party of our country's better future. Ours is the party that will rebuild the American Dream and make the promise real for all Americans again!God bless you. Iowa! God bless the United States of America!"
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"July 26, 2015","Remarks to the St. Paul's School Advanced Studies Program in Concord, New Hampshire","When I was only about three years older than you I was up in the great granite state knocking on doors and making phone calls for a little known presidential candidate. There is a fine linewhen you are running for president at 1% nationallybetween delusion and imagination. But I felt passionately about my candidate who wasa person of substance and ideas for the future of our country. And now I'm here in front of you and speaking withyou today. As a former big city mayor and a former Governors candidate, and as a candidate for President, I've spoken with a lot of teachers and educators all across the country in the course of this last year and a half, but I can tell you that what you have here at the Advanced Studies program is truly unique in the country. Perhaps many of you know that and that's why you work so hard to apply and be admitted. You should be very proud of making it through the gauntlet of this very challenging program.Your tradition of outstanding alumni is impressive: Congressmen and women, my friend Alan Khazei, a U.S. Senator, not one but two astronauts went to this larger institution and then set up civic work. And I understand until last year you even had three judges on your Board of Overseers.My wife Katie is a judge, so I know how very intimidating it must be to be overseen everyday by a judge.Now for many of you, this is probably the first time that you've lived away from home for this long period of time, and probably the first time you've forged a community with your peers in the dorms. You've had a taste of what the next chapter of your life might be like and your education and perhaps a career beyond that.Being in the company of the most promising students from Pittsburg down to Pelham, it would not surprise me one bit if one of you were standing up here in the not too distant future giving this address perhaps as a candidate yourself one day for President of the United States. Civic engagement is in the blood of so many who pass through these walls and halls.And Civic Engagement is what I would like to speak with you about today.What you did here this summer was not only learning to be good learners. What you did here this summer was also learning to be good listeners, which is one of the most important and sometimes apparently missing skills in our republic and in our democracy today. It is one of the most important skills in good citizenship.Anyone could shout over an opponent.But that is not debate.Any one can shutdown a conversation.But that is not how we forge a new consensus for progress, is it?Democracy challenges us to listen to one another.If there is no disagreement, then there can be no understanding.And if there is no disagreement, then there is no democracy.Speaking of disagreement...I understand that there's been something of a cell phone controversy in the program this summer. You can nod or otherwise give us a hand signal to tell me whether or not that's true.I even heard Mr. Ricard here has confiscated some of your phones during hours when it was inappropriate and they were supposed to have been put them away. I know that some of you were deeply unhappy about this. I myself like to stay plugged in. I was the first Presidential candidate to use SnapChat. How about that?So I get it, I get it. I have one foot in the baby-boomer era and one foot in the era of my children. So I, too, like to be connected.I understand some of you felt so strongly about the cell phone rule that you had a petition started - challenging the rule for being too harsh, and trying to make the rule better. In a word, you protested because you felt your opinion was not being heard or considered.So on the cell phone debate, I say, good for you. Education without internet connection is tyranny.Although I may actually agree with Mr. Ricard here, in the special summer programs there is something to having something to pass the time, some opportunity for reflection and solitude where you can be truthfully present and engage with your teachers and one another. A space where you can hop off of Facebook. But at the same time, I believe we should respect and understand the importance of this agreement and challenge. This is a life lesson that we have learned in the advanced studies program, and you will apply that to other things not merely on parking spaces on college campuses, but to other more waking questions - like the debate over whether or not college education is a common good or whether it's a toll road that only student going through it should have to pay for.Perhaps a discussion about why it is that we are the only advanced nation on the planet that saddles our graduating college generation with a mountain of debt. We can turn to heavier issues, darker more challenging issues like: how do we balance civil liberties in a world of asymmetrical warfare where terrorism seems to be on the rise? How do we keep our streets safe while healing the wounds of a racial legacy of injustice and violence that has been so painfully intertwined throughout our history with drug policy? With public safety? With law enforcement? And the interactions of law enforcement in America?These last few issues are something I know a little bit about. When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore in 1999 it was not because things were going well. It was because we had allowed ourselves to become the most violent, most addicted, and the most abandoned city in America. Against two far, far better known opponents I ran as a minority white mayor in a majority African-American city. And that through a long summer where the only issue was fighting crime, and drugs, and law enforcement, and race. That I won the votes of every single council district in our city, including my two African American opponents in their own districts.Thenwe set about taking the actions that come from a deeper understanding of listening to one another about our own feelings and perceptions about justice and injustice in our neighborhoods and we took actions. I was very, very close as circuit leader to a lot of pain, and a lot of grief, and a lot of loss on the days ahead. I buried along with our neighbors ten police officers killed in the line of duty - five of them black. I once filed with my neighbors in front of seven caskets, including five little children who with their parents where fire bombed by a sweep by drug dealers for calling the police for protection in their neighborhood.We put Baltimore a path to achieving the greatest reduction of part one crime of any major city in America over the next 10 years. And over the longer arc of 15 years we saved upwards of around a thousand lives that otherwise would have been lost had we not made a change. So you can imagine the broken parts across Baltimore when in a couple of our neighborhoods, after the tragic custodial death of Freddie Gray, two of our poorest and hardest hit neighborhoods erupted in anger.I was in Europe at the time, I was supposed to be there for three days. Did Iimmediately cut itshort to come home because I was a Mayor? No, I was a former Mayor. Because I was Governor? No, by then I was a former Governor. I came home because I hold that same title that you hold - citizen. And I wanted to be present with my neighbors.I came across this quote this morning and I felt like sharing it with you.It was written some 40 years ago by a great American mystic named Thomas Merton, in different times, or perhaps not so distant. He wrote ""the population of the affluent world is nourished on a steady diet of brutal mythology and hallucination. Kept at a constant pitch of high tension by a life that is intrinsically violent in that it forces a large part of the population to submit to an existence which is humanly intolerable. The problem of violence then is not the problem of a few rioters and rebels. But the problem of the whole structure, which is outwardly ordered and respectable and inwardly written by psychopathic obsessions and delusions.""These are not easy issues. If they were easy issues, they would not be important issues.My parents and teachers taught meas I believe your teachers here have taught younot to run away from them. To force yourself out of a place of comfort and into the place of pain and loss and suffering where those things are most intensely felt.As a servant of the public good, I have chosen to meet with those who protest, instead of running away, to listen and to learn. Tostrive, always, to understand more deeply so that I might act more intelligently and with more compassion.This is what all of usas good citizensmust do as well. This is what are to do if we are to form, in our own day, a more perfect union.If we are to overcome the great challenge to our humanity of climate change.If we, and our children's children, are to live with one another in peace and justice. And yes, economic justice.I believe in the lesson you are learning here at ASP - whether it's cell phones or other issues of the day, are important lessons. Protest is a healthy and a necessary part of our democracy.Progress is often born out of great protest as those of you in the course 'Changing the World' learned this Summer. But also understand this: that lasting progress can only be secured by the deeper understanding that comes from listening to one another as human beings; from seeing ourselves and feeling ourselves in the perspective and position of another.Empathy.Compassion.Generosity.Connection.What DeTocqueville called, ""the strength of soft ties.""This is a time of great challenge in our country and you are at the heart of it. I understand one of your housemasters, Bowman Dixon, did an exercise in Chapel with you, sort of a human graph, since Bowman is a math teacher.Rows of you gradually stood up in your seats as a visual demonstration of progress year-by-year on marriage equality in our country. You started with Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maryland and beyond.Many of you exulted and cheered as this progress and movement spread across the whole country. Everyone in Chapel stood up to show that marriage is a universal right in America.But then Bowman took you back through the same exercise in reverse...He showed you by sitting down in those states where you could still be fired for being gay - or states where your transgender brother and sisters do not yet have equal protection of law.You are the generation that will have us, I believe, on our feet quicker and quicker for progressand the Advanced Studies Program has been a place to be with other visionaries. Whether your service will be as teachers, as engineers or as artists, in law, government or other areas.I have drawn my great inspiration for where our country's headed from talking to our young people. And at the age of 52 I now describe that as people under 40. I rarely meet young people under 40 in America who believe that climate change isn't real or think that government shouldn't do something about it. I rarely meet people under 40 who want to bash immigrants or want to discriminate against gay couples.We are headed to a much more connected and compassionate place, and you are going to lead us there. A more just, and connected future.Never lose sight of your intense desire to see over that horizon.Protest, challenge and engage.Never lose your zeal for the way that things ought to be.It is what makes New Hampshire and America great.But just as importantly: listen, learn, feel, and understand the perspective of other persons with whom you share your life, your country, and this small planet of ours.Teilhard deChardin once wrote: 'There is an absolute direction to growth, and life moves in that direction, and life is never mistaken about its road or its destination. It tells us towards what point on the horizon we must steer if we are to see the dawn's light grow more intense.'ASP has been a part of your remarkable path, I'm proud to congratulate you on your achievement and wish you every success in your senior year and beyond.So thank you, good luck until we meet again.And if Mr. Ricard has given you your phone back..feel free to follow me on Twitter!"
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"July 31, 2015","Remarks to the National Urban League Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida","I want to thank the Urban League and Marc Morial, your CEO, for inviting me to be with you here today.Mayor Morial and I will always share the bond of having served as Mayors together of two of America's oldest and greatest cities  the Revolutionary Cities of New Orleans and Baltimore.Mayor Morial and I have discussed many issues over the years: issues of justice and injustice, how to rebuild our cities, how to improve our schools, how to create jobs and opportunity for alland, the topics that I would like to speak with you about today:How can we save lives?How can we improve and reform our criminal justice system?How, together, can we make real the promise of equal protection under the law?When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore as a long-shot candidate in 1999, it was not because the City was doing well. Despite many well intentioned efforts, our City had become the most violent, addicted and abandoned City in America.Every year we buried nearly 300 young black men who died violent deaths on our streets.And black lives matter.I want to share with you a true story from my service as Mayor in those very difficult turnaround years.It was Oct. 16, 2002.The phone by our bed rang at 3 a.m., loud and insistent.I suppose it is possible to get a phone call at that hour with good news, but phone calls to mayors at that hour are never good news.On this night, Deputy Mayor, Jeanne Hitchcock, had the rotating duty of screening emergency calls...""Mayor?"" Jeanne ssaid, ""there's been a fire,... A very bad fire,... in a house,... with a mother,... and we think five children. The father is real bad too. He is in intensive care, very badly burned.""""Awful,"" I said.But something in Jeanne's voice told me the story wasn't over.""Mayor... police and fire here believe it was intentional,"" she said. ""They are very shaken up,... I'm here. Neighbors are here. They are very angrythey say it was retaliation.""""Retaliation??? For what?"" I asked. ""By who?""""For calling the police about drug dealers,"" Jeanne said. ""This is so terrible.""And indeed it was.In my 23 years of public service as a Baltimore city councilman, as a two-term mayor, and as a two-term governor of Maryland, the tragic events of that early morning are seared into my memory forever.The reality was this: Carnell and Angela Dawson lived with their five children in a row house at the corner of Preston and Eden Streets on the Eastside of Baltimore.Mom and Dad both worked.They loved their children, provided for them, reveled in their individual talents and ways.But like so many families in so many neighborhoods of our city on those days, they were threatened, harassed and made miserable by the open air drug dealing in their neighborhood.They would call the police to complain.Mrs. Dawson would dutifully go to court to testify against the young men who were making life on her street unbearable.Two weeks earlier, someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail through the Dawson's living room window.The bottle failed to explode.The police responded.There were no witnesses.The State's Attorney's office and the city Housing Department offered to relocate the family for their safety.The Dawsons refused to be driven from their own home and neighborhood.The Eastern District police gave the house special attention.The district major personally rode by the house at 1:20 a.m.Like many families in humble neighborhoods who have a hard time making ends meet, the Dawsons were keeping their home heated that night by leaving their gas oven open and on.At 2:20 a.m., a 21-year-old young man from the neighborhoodmore of a look-out than a dealerlit the rag that topped a full glass bottle of gasoline. He kicked in the Dawson's front door while the family slept and tossed the bottle inside, where it smashed on the stairs.The old row house was engulfed in flames in seconds.Everyone in the house died quickly and painfully, except for Mr. Dawson who clung to life badly burned.I stood in line a couple of days later with the good people of East Baltimore as, together, we filed in respect at March Funeral Home by the closed little caskets, with the children's school portraits framed on top of each.As the perpetrator was brought to federal trial, Angela Dawson's mother and other relatives made clear to the prosecutor that they did not want to see the death penalty pursued.They did not want these deaths to lead to one more death.Life without parole was the sentence imposed.To this day, it is impossible for me to think of the Dawson's without becoming very sad and emotional.I suppose it always will be.Their little house became our Alamo.The Dawsons are buried together at Dulaney Valley Cemetery - the same resting place of so many of Baltimore's fallen  black and white, police and fire fighters who have given their lives in the line of duty.Every time I visit that cemetery on fallen heroes day or other sad occasions, I walk just over the hill to the Dawsons' grave.And I still wait, in hope, for love and peace and justice to have the final word.You and I are part of a living, self-creating mystery called the United States of America.Our country was not born in perfection, or without original sin.Because of the sacrifices and perseverance of so many in generation after generation, we have moved toward a fuller respect for one another, we have moved toward a more equal justice and more equal protection under the law.But we are not there yet.Every headline or video of official abuse, injustice, indifference, killing, or murder reminds us of how far we still have to go.Every story reminds us that Americans of color must endure a constant state of random vulnerability even when they're just driving to work.And all of us must ask, how many individuals, like Sandra Bland, have been subject to abusive arrest when the cameras weren't rolling?How many names will we never know?How many Walter Scotts have been savagely shot down - and then setup to take the blame for it - when cameras and cell phone technology were not rolling?How many names don't we know?There are certain beliefs we share as Americans: abelief in the dignity of every individual, abelief in our responsibility to advance the common good, and an understanding that we're all in this together.In our idea of country, there is no such thing as a spare American.As Americans, we believe that you do not surrender your human dignity when you change lanes without signaling.As Americans, we believe that you do not surrender your human dignity when your tail light burns out.And no American surrenders their dignitywhatever the emergencybecause of the color of their skin.If you do not believe that, you are not qualified to run a city.If you do not believe that, you are not qualified to wear a badge and carry a gun.Leading my city and my state forward to achieve the largest violent crime reductions in modern history, we strived every day to become smarter about public safety policies and actions that actually work to save lives, and redeem lives.The constant search for better ways shaped our approach to courts, to prisons, to increased drug treatment, to policing and policing the police, and to everything else.From 1999 forward, a thousand fewer black men died violent deaths in Baltimore thanks to the biggest ten year improvement in public safety of any big city in America.52 days into office as Governor, we closed the most notorious and violent prison in our state, the Maryland House of Corrections.By the time I left office as Governor in January, we had reduced violent crime to a 35-year low in Maryland, we reduced recidivism by 15 percent, we reduced our incarceration rate to a twenty year low,And we reduced new prison admissions by 19% compared to ten years before.How?By doing the things that work, like expanding reentry programs,dramatically increasing drug and mental health treatment,expanding education and workforce training inside the wall,giving ex-offenders an ID card before release so that they can apply for jobs, housing, and benefits.We also did this by doing away with the things that clearly did not work: we decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and we restored voting rights to 52,000 citizens with old felony records.Not on our first try, not on the second try, but finally on the third try, we abolished the Death Penalty in Maryland.Lots of people can talk about criminal justice reform, I have actually done it.Today, I'd like to talk to you about a new agenda for criminal justice reform for our entire nation.Policing will always be locally controlled and locally directed. But there is a vital role for the federal government to fulfill in setting standards, and funding programs that serve the larger cause of justice and the common good we share.We can reduce racial disparities, we can reduce and redirect the dollars we are currently spending on incarceration, and we can give more of our people opportunities to turn their lives around.First, our laws must allow punishments to suit the crime.Congress appears to be making progress to reduce mandatory minimums for non-violent crimes, and I support this important bi-partisan and long overdue effort at the federal level.As President, I will root out the mindless sentencing disparities like the one that still exists between the possession of crack and powder cocaine;And as President I will forge a consensus to repeal the death penalty in America and thereby remove the United States from the small group of nations responsible for a majority of the world's public executions.Second, I will take actions that put the work of rehabilitation at the center of our justice agenda.Our nation currently has the highest incarceration rate of any nation in the free world.We must recognize that investments we make behind bars pay for themselves by reducing recidivism.Our federal government must expand investments in re-entry programs that workprogramsthat provide job training and help in securing employment. We must support community services that help people return to their families and transition back to a productive life.To that end, our federal government must lead by example in banning the box so that a past criminal record does not prevent a person who has paid their debt to society from obtaining gainful employment.Third, we must recognize that many people who fall into our criminal justice system would be better treated by our public health system.Police are often our first responders to people in crisis.As President, I will invest in training and equipping law enforcement to better prepare officers for encounters with those suffering from mental illness. And, I will dramatically expand our federal commitment to drug treatment and our investment in community mental health services.Fourth, we must improve policing, and the way we police the police.When I first ran for Mayor of Baltimore in 1999, I was not endorsed by the Fraternal Order of the Police.In that election, I promisedfor the protection of both our neighbors and our policewe would do a much better job of policing our police.With better recruitment, better training, and better pay, that is exactly what we did.There are things every police department must do every day to improve the trust necessary between citizens and the police officers who are sworn to serve and protect us  all of us.Among those things  an adequately staffed Internal Affairs Division, an independently staffed Civilian Review Board, Reverse Integrity Stings to safe-guard the professional integrity of every police force.Our federal government can play a vital role in lifting up these practices and advancing their adoption across the country.Today, every police department in the nation reports the seven federally measured UCR crimesamong them, murder rape, and robberyand reports them in a timely, accurate, and publicly open way.As President, I will require every police department to publicly report all custodial deaths, all incidents involving use of lethal force, and all complaints of discourtesy and excessive force.We cannot understand what we do not see.We cannot improve what we do not measure.But once we measure, once we see, and once we understand, we can certainly improve.The reality is that racial injustice and law enforcement in America have been painfully intertwined since the first days of our nation.If we are to have any hope of improving police and community relations in America  for our own sakes and for the sakes of our children and grandchildren  these measures of professional policing must be open and visible for all to see.We must also advance the deployment of new technology like body cameras and cruiser cameras that promote openness, transparency, and accountability.Technology won't fix everything. But it is a vital step toward achieving accountable, respectful, professional policing.We must free ourselves from the tyranny of ""that's the way we've always done it.""Every policy must pass the test of whether it saves lives, or redeems lives.This is the ongoing work we share as a nation - to do more of what works, and less of what does not.To create an America where there is truly ""liberty and justice for all.""The great Barbara Jordan once said, ""The gap between the promise and reality of America can one day be finally closed,... We believe that.""Barbara Jordan grew up amidst some of the harshest segregation in our country, denied everything from the use of a water fountain to admission to her state's university.But she never stopped believing that we could make the promise of America a reality.She became the first African American in the Texas Senate since the days of Reconstruction. She became the first African American in Texas ever sent to Congress.And there she fought for voting rights and human rights and what was right.One of her very first acts in Congress was to advance a funding and reform effort to strengthen Prairie View A&M; - which happened to be the school where Sandra Bland was to work, the school where Sandra Bland never made it to work on July 10th.Barbara Jordan was fond of saying that when it came to justice, people who are right must do battle with people who have the might.When Barbara Jordan passed away - not yet even 60 years old at the time - the Houston Chronicle headline read: ""A Voice for Justice Dies.""I don't believe that is true - because voices for justice never die.Voices for justice will always resonate.Sandra Bland told the police officer she couldn't wait to get to court so that her voice would be heard - we are hearing her voice right now.We can make ourselves a more just nation, a more just people.We can teach all of our children a more generous, compassionate, and caring way forward.There is more that unites us than divides us.""We must help each other if we are to succeed.""And, love, peace, and justice will have the final word."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"August 22, 2015","Remarks at the Young Democrats of America Convention in Los Angeles, California","Thank you. Thank you very, very much.It is wonderful to be here with all of you. I want to thank Atima Omara, your YDA president, Dina Cervantes, your convention host chair. Big round of applause for both of them, shall we? Eric Bowman, our Democratic Party vice president, and all the convention team and staff. Big round of applause.It's really great to be with all of you, and I'm looking forward to talking with you afterwards, too. I'm going to mill about and look forward to meeting each and every one of you. I cannot thank you enough for the invitation to be with all of you today.My name is Martin O'Malley. I am not a former Republican. I am not a former Independent. I am not a former Socialist. I am a Democrat and I'm running for President of the United States. And I am running for one reasonand one reason onlyand that is to rebuild the truth of the American Dream we share, and I need your help.I was just talking to the chair of the county Democrats, and I said, ""You know what the young people of our Party should lead a movement on? Two constitutional amendments."" And I know that you still have a few more days in your convention, so maybe there's a possibility to consider these. One of the constitutional amendments that we need to pass, and work state by state to pass, is a constitutional right to vote. You guys can run with this ball. The second one is a constitutional amendment to overturn one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of late, and that is Citizens United. Corporations are not people. I know if you run with both of those, I think they can be game-changers. Let the other guys in the Republican Party explain to voters why they're against a constitutional right to vote, huh? Instead of nibbling around the edges, let's just go right to the heart of the matter. Let's ask all of those guys on their debate stage whether or not they believe that corporations are people, huh? There are certain things we stand for as a country, and I know you guys carry those truths in your heart. Let me share a couple thoughts with you, and as I do so I want to tell you that I really need your help. I'll make a full pitch here, but there's not a doubt in my mind that there's a huge generational shift going on in our country. There's a new generation of leadership that's emerging throughout our nation, and all of you represent it here in this room.You see, you and I are part of a living, self-creating mystery called the United States of America. But the promise that's at the heart of that mystery is no abstraction.It is the very concrete promise, the very real covenant between us as a people, if you will.That whatever your parents' zip code, whatever your parents' or income, in our country you start where you start. But through your hard work you're able to get ahead.So call it an economy that works, call it the American Dream. Whatever you call it, the truth of the matter is that it worked very, very well for us as a country for the better part of 240 years. That is, until we took a little bit of a detour down a path called trickle-down economics. But it is not too late. It can work again. In fact our economy, our American economy should work for all of us and not just a few us.Wages should risenot fallwith productivity.No American child should go to bed hungry every night.Earning a college degree shouldn't saddle a student, or a whole generation of students and their parents, with a mountain of debt for the rest of their lifetimes. And our parents and our grandparents should be able to live out their retirement years in security, not in poverty: with dignity, not having to choose between their medicine and their food.These are also all of the pillars of the 15 Goals for Rebuilding the American Dream that I rolled out this week in Iowa, one by one, policy action by policy action, each one actually reinforcing the other and complimenting the other. Bold ideas, concrete plans, actions to make our country stronger, to make the American Dream true again in the most important places in our country. Namely, the kitchen tables of every single American family.Make no mistake about it: how you campaign determines how you govern, and how far you can go in governing.The challenges of our times, the challenges of these times, actually the challenges of your times, demand a new way of leadership. What do I mean by that?I mean that your baby-boomer parents and even grandparents were oftentimes accustomed to a way of leadership that was ideological, that was hierarchical, that was bureaucratic and riddled with -isms. Where political authority was most often based on the rule of ""because I said so.""But to solve the problems of a new day, you demand a new way of leadership, a new way of governing.A new way of solving problems that is actually fundamentally entrepreneurial, that is collaborative in its method, and that is interactive in a relentless sort of way, asking the question always, ""Does it work?"" All legitimate authority resting on that question. Show me that it actually works.There's a tremendous generational shift going on in our country, and that is why I wanted to be here. Sadly, most of the established leaders of our own Party don't even see that it's coming. What does it tell you that six months out from the first primaries and caucuses of our Party's presidential nomination, I am the only one of our presidential candidates that took the time and wanted to be here with you?Let me talk with you about this generational shift and why it is I believe that our Party would be best served by having more debates and having them now.On one side of this generational shifton your parent's side, if you willthere is a tremendous amount of oftentimes unspoken fear, anger, or worse: resignation.On your side there is fearlessness, there is hope, and an unrelenting resolve to make better.What I am talking about is this: most of your parents and grandparents are plagued by a low-grade fear that they can barely even give voice to. It is the fear that by neglecting our country, we have given you a future of less: less opportunity, less health, less prosperity, and less security. Younger Americans, on the other hand, that I've had conversations with all across our country, understand that fear and anger never built a great country and never was very good at solving problems.You are too focused on the urgency and opportunity of now to waste time and energy on resignation.If you want to know where our country is headed, talk to her young people, young Americans especially under 30, as I have all across our country.You will rarely meet among the young Americans people who deny that climate change is real or think that their country shouldn't do something about it.You will rarely find among young Americans under 30, people who want to bash New American immigrants, or deny rights to gay couples and their children and families.There's no doubt in my mind that the country you carry in your hearts is a stronger America, a more compassionate and generous America, a more loving, honest, and life-giving America.The political question at hand in this presidential election is whether we advance the arrival of that country we carry in our hearts sooner rather than later, or whether we take a bad detour through a nation of fear and loathing.I believe that we need to move forward.\tDid you watch that Republican debate last week? Anyone want to admit watching the Republican debate last week? It was like a bad episode of that Johnny Knoxville series, wasn't it?You didn't hear one word about climate change. Or the minimum wage. Or voting rights. Not. One. Word.You did hear talk of raising the retirement age for senior citizens, about cutting taxes for billionaires. You heard all sorts of hateful language about immigrants and all sorts of denigrating language about women. Welcome to today's Republican Party. Their party once had leaders and visionaries. Lincoln asserted our unity, didn't he? And our common humanity. Eisenhower liberated the world and built our nation's highway system to connect us. Now Republicans create traffic jams, denigrate New American immigrants and women, and dismiss everything from climate science to vaccines. Give them a few more weeks and they'll be shunning Copernicus.We need new leadership, not new hates. And today, for the progress of our nation, that leadership must come from the Democratic Party! I am not the only candidate for President who holds progressive values, but I am the only candidate for President with fifteen years of executive experienceas a big-city mayor and as a governorturning those progressive values into progressive realities, progressive results, progressive accomplishments.It's about getting things done. What do I mean?In Baltimore, we saved lives by reducing record-high violence to record lows, and we helped thousands of our courageous neighbors free themselves from the scourge of drug addiction.Actions, not words.When I ran for governor of Maryland, we set out bold goals. And I did something that the political consultants say you're not supposed to do: attaching deadlines within your term of office to those goals. And I led my state forward to making nation-leading progress even in the face of a recession.Instead of cutting public education, we actually increased public education funding by 37%, and we made our schools the best in America five years in a row.Those were actions, not words.In Maryland, we defended the highest median income in the nation all through the recession and created jobs at a faster rate than our neighbors north or south.Actions, not words.We froze college tuition for four years in a row.Actions, not words.We expanded family leave and voting rights, we passed Driver's licenses for New American immigrants, and we banned the sale of assault weapons.Actions, not words.We fought for the DREAM Act, we fought for Marriage Equality, and we defended them at the ballot, and we won!All of those were actions, not words. The ability to form a new consensus.In tougher times than these, young Democrats, Franklin Delano Roosevelt told our grandparents not to be afraid. John Kennedy told our parents in changing times that ""to govern is to choose.""I say to you that progress is choice. Job creation is a choice. Whether or not we make our country weaker or stronger, this too is a choice. And you and I have work to do. True story: my wife, Katie, and I have four kids. Two boys, two girls. Our oldest daughter, Grace, is 24 years old. She is heading into her third year as a first-grade teacher. Teach For America, at Walter P. Carter Elementary School in Baltimore City. A couple months ago, after her father had announced for president, there was a buzz in her school when Miss O'Malley returned to her first-grade class: adorable 100% African-American kids, eager and ready to learn.And one little girl in her classroom tugged her on the sleeve, true story, and said to her, ""Miss O'Malley? I'm not so sure about this idea of your father running for president, because quite frankly I kind of like Barack Obama.""Well a lot of us like Barack Obama. We have come a long way as a nation since the Wall Street crash and the Bush Recession of 2008.As our country teetered on the brink of a second Great Depression by the recklessness on Wall Street and the home-grinding machines of foreclosures, we elected a new leader in Barack Obama to move our country forward, and that is exactly what he's done! A lot of the decisions that he had to make individually were not popular. We don't elect presidents to be popular; we elect them to make the right decisions to move our country forward.And get this, this is the good news: our country is doing better. We can see that in 65 months in a row of positive month-over-month job creation. That's the good news.But here is, my fellow Democrats, the tough truth of our times: 70% of us are still earning the same or less than we were twelve years ago. That is not how our country is supposed to work. There is still a growing, compounding injustice in our country and economic inequality that threatens, quite literally, to tear us apart.Wealth and powerover the course of these last thirty or forty years of trickle-down and sometimes trickle-down light, and sometimes Democrats not having the spine to stand up for the more common-sense economics that our parents and grandparents practicedwe have so concentrated wealth and power in the hands of so few that it is literally taking opportunity out of the homes, and the wallets, and the neighborhoods of the many.This did not happen by accident.Powerful, wealthy special interests in our own country used our government to create an economy that is leaving a majority of our people behind, where we work harder but we do not get ahead.My father went to college after flying 33 missions over Japan in a B-24 liberator. He went to college on the G.I. Bill.Just two generations later, my daughters went to college and our whole family got saddled with a mountain of bills.We are the only nation on the planet that saddles our college graduates with a mountain of debt that they will be paying off for a lifetime, and it doesn't have to be this way.Get this: last year, Wall Street bonuses alone totaled twice what every American working at minimum wage earned combined. That's not an economy that's working for all of us.Tell me how it is that not a single Wall Street CEO was ever convicted of a single crime related to the 2008 economic meltdown. Not a single one.What have we come to as a nation that you can get pulled over for a broken tail light, but if you wreck the nation's economy you are untouchable? What's that about?That's not the American Dream. That's not how our country is supposed to work, and that's not how our economy is supposed to work.The genius of our nation is that in every generation we take action to include more and more of our people, more fully in the economic, in the social, and in the political life of our country. That's our formula. That's what makes us great. That's what makes our economy grow.That's the formula we followed in Maryland. We didn't try to cut our way to prosperity. We made the investments that included more of our people with higher levels of skills. We made it easier, not harder, for people to vote. It's about including more people in the life of our country. In other words the good news, my friends, is this: in order to continue this work and build upon the good things that we have done for the last eight years under president Obama's leadership, we need only return to our true selves and remember:Our economy is not money; it is people. It is all of our people. A stronger middle class is not the consequence of economic growth; it is the cause of economic growth. No American family who works hard and plays by the rules should have to raise their children in poverty, and so yes, we must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can and wherever we can! We must return to the economic justice of paying overtime pay for overtime work! We must make it easier and not harder for workers to join labor unions and collectively bargain for better wages for all of us!We must advance the cause of paid family leave so that women can participate fully in the economic life of our country, because when women succeed, America succeeds!Last week, I put forward 15 Goals to Rebuild the American Dream we share, and to make it true in the homes of all Americans:Improving the net median wealth of American families by at least $25,000 in ten years.Increasing wages by 4 percent a year within four years, Cutting Youth Unemployment in half within 3 years, with national service and the other things that actually work to put our people to work.Full employment for American veterans, and instead of cutting Social Security, we need to expand Social Security! In our country, there is no such thing as a spare American.And so we must reform our criminal justice system to save more lives, redeem more lives, and to reduce our appallingly high incarceration rate as a nation.And if you want wages to go up, then let's bring 11 million our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy and into the full light of an open on-the-books American economy with immigration reform! Comprehensive immigration reform. What has made us great generation after generation is that we have attracted the best and the brightest from all over the world. They have made our country a stronger and better place.What have we come to now that we are so gridlocked in Washington that we can't do what's best for our nation's economy and our nation's security? But we can spend money on chain-link fence and barbed wire to intern women and children and families.That's not my America, and that's not the America you carry in your hearts. The enduring symbol of the America that you carry in your hearts is not chain link and barbed wire. It is the Statue of Liberty!So let's take action, shall we? Let's take the actions necessary to make a debt-free college degree something that's available to every American family within the next five years! And let's, as Americans and the great nation that we are, square our shoulders to the challenge of our times by moving America forward to a 100% clean electric grid by 2050, and create 5 million jobs along the way!We are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress.Together we have to take the actions necessary to walk through that door, to rebuild America's cities and towns as places of justice and opportunity.To invest in our infrastructure, not just clean air, but clean water and better transportation. These are only things that we can do for ourselvesChina's not going to do it for us, India's not going to do it for us. This is our country. We're Americans. We need to make the investments in our country in order to make real the promise of opportunity for all. None of these things can happen by themselves. They happen because of the actions that we take.There are also a few things that we need to stop doing, though, as a Party. One of them is giving a free pass to the bullies of Wall Street to run rough-shod over the best interests of the American people.We must reinstate Glass-Steagall and restore robust prosecution to Wall Street.And if a bank is too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to manage, then it's probably too damn big, and it needs to be broken up before it breaks up our economy again.We also need to learn from the past. We need to build a much more circulatory economy here in the United States, mindful of life-cycle cost, of consumption and production, and the need for employment here at home. That is why I am against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the fast-tracking of American jobs and corporate profits abroad!It's not what other countries are doing to us. It is what we are not doing for ourselves! We need to build up our own American economy. These are the goals worthy of a great people. These are the actions that will give our children a stronger country and more opportunity. I leave you with these words:The great poet laureate of the American Dream, Bruce Springsteen, once asked:Is a dream a lie, if it don't come true?Or is it something worse?Whenever a nation reaches the point in her history that we have reached, of such extreme income inequality, there are only two paths forward. Just two.Only one of them is good. That is a sensible rebalancing based on the belief we share and the dignity of every person, and based in an awareness that we share a common good as a people.The other path is pitchforks, or stones, or rocksmore of them in the hands of more and more unemployed, angry, and desperate young men who feel they're unneeded, unwanted, and unnecessary in their own country.I vote for a sensible rebalancing, and I bet you do as well.But I need your help.I want you to be my state coordinators of this presidential campaign; I want you to be my county coordinators of this history-changing presidential campaign. I want you to run as delegates to the national convention for this campaign.So I am going to be hanging out afterwards, and I'm going to have some able staff with me.If you have both the courage and the inclination to join me in this march across the battlefield of democracy, see me afterwards and I will give you a rank of responsibility that no other campaign can give you. Within this very hall are the leaders of the Democratic Party who can win this presidential contest for the country we carry in our hearts.Together, we can forge a new consensus for progress, we can make and re-make our country and our world.I know that some in our Party who pat you on the head and tell you, ""You're going to inherit this party someday.""That's nonsense. This Party is already. This party is yours right now! Think about it. Think about this:In 2012, Mitt Romney won a majority of the votes cast by Americans over 30, but Barack Obama won a vast majority of votes cast by Americans under 30.This Party is already yours. Their Party looks to the past; our Party looks to the future.Without you, there is no Democratic Party.I know that there are some in our Party with positions of great responsibility, even those that tell us we've become such an impoverished Party we can only afford one debate in Iowa before the Iowa caucuses. They will tell you that we've become so poor as a party that we can only afford one debate in New Hampshire. And they are the same people that will tell you that ""one day, you will inherit this country.""Horse hockey! This country is your country right now. You take it where you want to take it!Does anyone seriously believe that marriage equality would be the law of the land in the United States today without younger people showing us the way forward?Teaching us how to recognize the human dignity in one another, not only in the law but in our hearts?Without you we cannot confront climate change, without you we cannot pass immigration reform, without you we cannot make our economy work again for all of us.But with you, we can.That is why this election isnt about the power of the Koch Brothers.It's not about Donald Trump, or big money and the hate that seeks to poison our politics.It's about us. It's about you and me. Us: U, period, S, period.It is about whether or not we still have the grit, still have the determination, still have the compassion for one another to make our country a better place by forging a new consensus for progress!I believe we do, and I am betting you believe it as well.So join me in this fight for the country we carry in our hearts!Join me for the better future we can make together!The affirmation for the duty we have to transform our nation.This is our country now right now and together let's make the most of her!Thank you all very, very much."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"October 24, 2015",Remarks at the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson Jackson Dinner in Des Moines,"I. INTRODUCTIONThank you, Dr. Maguire. It is a great honor to stand on this stage before you along with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanderstwo people for whom I have enormous respect.My name is Martin O'Malley.Former Mayor of Baltimore, former Governor of Maryland. I am a life-long Democrat. I am running for President of the United States. I intend to win, and I need your help!It's great to be here with all of you.As I was driving down to Des Moines from Osage today, I couldn't help but think about my first visit to Iowa. I was 20 years old. Four or five of us drove out in a little Subaru from Maryland. It was a long drive and my friends dropped me off in Davenport at 6 in the morning at the Greyhound bus station. All I had was my guitar and a duffle bag of winter clothes.I was here to work on a fledgling, underdog presidential campaign, and over the next several months I fell in love with the State of Iowa and her people.The best part of running for President is meeting young people who share this same idealism and belief in all things possible.I know it is is easy to become discouraged by the gridlock in Congress. The division and polarization of our national politics.So I urge you to do as I do.If you want to know where our country is headed, talk to young Americans under 30.You will rarely find among them anyone who denies that climate change is real, or thinks their government shouldn't be doing something about it.You'll rarely find among them people who want to bash New American Immigrants, or people that want to deny rights to gay couples or their children.All of this tells me that we are moving to a more connected, more compassionate, and more generous place as a country.II. OUR TRUE SELVESOn Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden spoke eloquently about the values we share: our belief in the dignity of every person, respect for one another, a commitment to advance the common good we share...He spoke about the growing income inequality in our country  a growing injustice that threatens to tear our country apart.He called on us, as Democrats, as Americans, not to run away from the Obama-Biden record of progress, but to build upon what we have achieved.To be fearless about our progressive values... our ability to solve this problem...and our ability to make our economy work again for all of us.All of us here tonight agree that we cannot allow Donald Trump or any of the Trump wannabes in this year's Republican field to take over the White House.But we differ on who is best prepared to lead America forward  especially in these new times. Who gives us our best chance as a Party to win in November?In three months, the people of Iowa will make a critical decision. It's not about yesterday. It's not just about today.It's about our country  it is about the future our children will share.III. ACTIONS, NOT WORDSWhile all of the candidates here tonight share progressive values, not all of us have a record of actually getting things done.I do.With fifteen years of executive experience  as Mayor and as a Governor I have learned how to be a very effective leader. I have learned how to get things done. I am clear about my principles.Passing a living wage and raising the minimum wage. Freezing college tuition for four years in row.Actions, not words!As Governor, I made it easier  not harder  for workers to bargain collectively for better wages for all of us.Actions, not words!Instead of cutting public education funding, as Governor, I increased funding for public education by 37% and  memo to Governor Branstad  ...We made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row!Actions, not words!I brought people together to pass the Dream Act, to pass Marriage Equality, and to pass the most comprehensive gun safety legislation in the nation with background checks and a ban on the sale of combat assault weapons!Actions, not words!IV. A GROWING INJUSTICEMy wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace and Tara, William and Jack  like you  there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them better, fully lives with more opportunity than we've had.(Grace story)Our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008 when millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.Thanks to President Obama's leadership, we are creating jobs again  67 months in a row of positive job creation! There is no progress without jobs!Our country is clearly doing better. But we elected a president not a magician.There is urgent work to be done.For there is in our country today a growing economic injustice.Our middle class is shrinking. Our poorest families are becoming poorer.And seventy percent of us today are earning the same or less than we were twelve years ago.This is not how our economy is supposed to work. This is not how country is supposed to work.Injustice does not solve itself. We must solve it  with new leadership, and with action.Actions to make wages go up again for all Americans. Actions to invest again in our own country's potential. To make college a gateway to opportunity, not a trap-door to a lifetime of crushing debt. Actions that square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change  and makes this challenge our opportunity!V. AGENDAAs Americans, we make our own future.We must return to our true selves, and remember:Our economy is not money, our economy is people - all our people. A stronger middle class is not the consequence of economic growth - a stronger middle class is the cause of economic growth. No American family who works hard and plays by the rules should have to raise their children in poverty!Therefore we must take action, together, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour  wherever and however we can! We must advance the cause of paid family leave so that all women can participate more fully in the economic life of our nation  because ""when women succeed, America succeeds!""Over the summer, I put forward my 15 Goals to Rebuild the American Dream:Making the option of debt-free college a reality within 5 years.Instead of cutting Social Security  like all of the Republican candidates want to do  we must expand Social Security!I am the first candidate  but let us hope not the last  to put forth a plan to move America forward to a 100% clean electric energy grid by 2050, and create 5 million new jobs along the way!Do we want wages to go up and not down?Bringing 11 million our neighbors out of the off-the-books, shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform!Kenia Alejandra Calderon, an Iowa DREAMer is here with us tonight.Kenia was born in El Salvador and is now a student at Drake. Along the way she's become a fearless advocate for citizenship rights for herself and millions of Americans like her.To that immigrant bashing, carnival barker, Donald Trump Let us stand up together, and say, the enduring symbol of our nation is not the barbed wire fence,... it is the Statue of Liberty!VI. BACKBONENothing we care about can be accomplished by words alone. We must take action.As Democrats, we must cast aside the worn out politics of the past.We must find our backbone again to stand up for what is best for our country and best for all Americans!We must stop giving a free pass to the bullies of Wall Street.I have never represented Wall Street and, I sure as hell won't be taking economic orders from the big banks of Wall Street when I'm in your White House!As your President, I will have the independence and the backbone to fight for you: if a bank is too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to manage, then it's too damn big, and it needs to be broken up before it breaks our national economy once again!Tell me how it is, that not a single Wall Street CEO was ever convicted of a single crime related to the 2008 economic meltdown. Not. A. Single. One.What have we come to as a nation when you can get pulled over for a broken tail light in our country, but if you wreck the nation's economy you are untouchable?Presidential leadership is about the good of the many  not the greed of the few!TradeThat is also why I say we must stop sending American jobs and profits overseas with bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Many of us remember NAFTA. We traded away good manufacturing jobs like Maytag's in towns like Newton, and in return, we got back empty promises and empty pockets.I am fundamentally and adamantly opposed  as an American  to secret trade deals that our Congress is forced to vote on before the rest of us are even allowed to read them!It's not what other countries are doing to us. It is what we are not doing for ourselves!We need to build up our own American economy!Gun ViolenceAnd finally, we must have the courage to put our children's safetyeach and every day ahead of the craven and morally bankrupt interests of the National Rifle Association.The NRA has one goaland one goal onlyselling as many guns as possible, no matter the cost in lives. Well that might be their interest  but that is not what is best for America!For forty years, they've dictated what laws should be written.It's high time we find our backbone again as Democrats and stand up and say no to the NRA.As President Obama said, if terrorists had killed 400,000 Americans with guns over the last 15 years, we'd move heaven and earth to stop them.But Americans have killed 400,000 Americans with guns. And we cower to the political lobbying power of the National Rifle Association!Enough is enough.Sandy and Lonnie Phillips lost their daughter Jessie in the mass murder that occurred in that theater in Aurora, Colorado. They are here with us tonight.What they have endured is unfathomable. But so too is their courage and resolve.For they set out to transform their grief into action. They went to court to hold accountable those who recklessly armed a mass murderer with 4,000 rounds of ammunition.They sued the man who sold the ammunition used in the attack. That man didn't ask what those bullets were for. He didn't care.And not only did the Phillips' case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 of court fees because of special immunity to lawsuits that the NRA managed to muscle out of our own Congress. It doesn't have to be this way.To save lives we must require universal background checks;To save lives we must ban the sale of combat assault weapons;To save lives we must use the buying power of our federal government  the biggest customer gun companies have  and refuse to buy guns from any company that doesn't use the latest and best safety technology;And to save lives we must stop giving immunity to gun manufacturers and gun dealers who sell weapons of mass murder to criminals and psychopaths!Senator Sanders join me now. Secretary Clinton join me now and together we can forge a new consensus for change Because one American life is worth more than all the gun sales in America. VII. CONCLUSIONIn 100 days, the people of Iowa will decide.New leadership, or the same old battles?Actions, or words?Do we want to get things done or just shout at each other?It's not about polls and pundits. It's about you. You decide whether we move forward or back.Thomas Jefferson once said, ""in matters of fashion, swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.""In these fast changing times, America needs a President who will stand like a rock.A weather vane shifts its position every time the winds change.Effective leaders do not.I know who I am, I know what I believe, and I am willing to fight for it.We cannot move beyond today's gridlocked politics by returning to the divisions of our past.I'm not about that.I believe we are all in this together.I believe that to solve our problems we must face tomorrow.We need new leadership. New ideas. Someone with the courage to stand up for what's right  even when it's not always popular!None of us has the answers to all of the problems we face, none of us can predict the future. But I promise you this: I can govern. I can lead, and I can do so with heart and skill.A lot of people tell me that I face a tough fight in this race.And there are also a lot of people who would look you in the eye and tell you that you've got a tough fight giving your children and grandchildren a better life than you've enjoyed...Well you know what?  I kind of like the tough fights. I've always been drawn to the tough fights.Perhaps the toughness of the fight is the way the hidden God has of telling us we are fighting for something worth saving!The American Dream is worth saving.Our children's future is worth saving.Our country is worth savingOur planet is worth saving.It's time to join the fight.I am in this to win this.I need your help.Together, you and I can and will rebuild the American Dream. Thank you. May God bless Iowa, and may God bless America in our journey together!"
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"October 30, 2015","Remarks at the Iowa Safe Schools Spirit Awards in Des Moines, Iowa","Thank you for having me. It is a tremendous honor to join you in celebratingIowa's LGBTQ students and educatorsand the schools who are improving the lives of LGBTQ youth across the Hawkeye state.On the heels of the 5th annual Spirit Day...and just a few months removed from that historic Supreme Court decision of marriage equality, and I happen to have had the good fortune on that dayit was a rare day because I was not in IowaI was in D.C. on the steps that day as people throughout our country came together and hugged each other. And what a tremendous day it was, so I'll never ever forget that.I am proud to say that we are finallyand rightfullyin a spirit of dialogue and openness, actually having a real discussion about how to ensure equal protection under the law forallLGBTQ Americans, in every part of our public life.I truly believe that the genius of our nation is that in every generation, we take actions, not words but actions to include more of our people more fully in the economic, the social, and the political life of our country. We did not come into being as a republic as a perfect union, but every year we can make ourselves more perfect by recognizing that there are certain powerful beliefs that unite us, whether we're Democrats or Republicans or Independents. And those beliefs are a belief in the dignity of every individual person, our belief in our own responsibility to advance the common good that we share as a people, and our understanding that we're all in this together. And that in fact we actually need each other, and that we have to help each other if we're going to be able to succeed.It is upon those beliefs that I run for president of the United States. Not because our country is in an easy time, but because our country is facing difficult challenges and big problems. But I also know that we are the greatest problem-solving people on the planet, and that is because we recognize that our diversity is our strength, and we bring different perspectives to the table of our democracy in order to solve our problems. One of the big ones we face right now is this: we hear President Obama rightly saying that our country is doing better, and we are. We're now creating jobs again. When we elected President Obama eight years ago, we were this close to being plunged into a second Great Depression.But we still have so much work to do on so many fronts. Without jobs there is no progress, but for the first time this side of World War II: we are earning the same today, 70% of us, as we were twelve years ago. So it's understandable that people extrapolate that out. And we all worry that maybe we're not all going to be able to give our kids the better future with more health, more security, more opportunity that we've enjoyed. That's an understandable fear, it's a very real anxiety, but fear and anxiousness and division never made our country great.Our country is made great when we come together around the beliefs that unite us and restore in every generation that promise that is in essence the American Dream. That says wherever you start, you start, wherever your zip code, whatever your parents' incomes, but wherever you start you're able to work hard and get ahead because of your grit, your determination, and your talent. It's because of that formula we put into actionalways, always, alwaysgreater inclusion, not lesser inclusion.So let me talk with you tonight, and perhapsmy staff said to me, Kristen who's here with us said, ""I'm not sure that any presidential candidate's ever given an entire speech on LGBTQ issues before the Iowa caucuses, in Iowa."" So maybe this is historic.Over the past decade, there is no group of people in our country who have fought harder to beincluded, who have challenged us to live up to our ideals as a peopleto be able to enjoy the same equal rights as any other Americansthan all of our Americans who are part of the LGBTQ community.I consider myself very, very blessed and very, very fortunate to have been in public office at the time of such a movement, and such a change, and such a deepening of understanding that led to actions and led to a pace of progress that even the most optimistic of us would have thought was impossible fifteen, twenty years ago.As Mayor of Baltimore, I signed our state's very first transgender anti-discrimination bill.And actually prior to that, on the Baltimore City Council, I was one of ten voteswe had eighteen members, and nineteen with the council president, so ten was a magic number; if you had ten, that meant you were going to get something done. And I was one of ten co-sponsoring votes for this earth-shaking, earthquaking issue called domestic partnership benefits. How far we have come.How far we have come.As Governor of Maryland, I expanded our state's longstanding protections against discrimination, so that no one could be fired, denied housing, or denied public or private services in our state because they are gay or transgender.And throughout my public service, the tours of duty the people of my city and my state have given to me, I've been very fortunate to work closely with advisors and senior staff and really committed activists who reflect the diversity of the LGBTQ community: including young people, immigrants, people of color. And each of them a more effective, a more empathetic, and more connected leader.But perhaps what I'll always remember is the effort in Maryland we waged in standing up formarriage equality, not as a state right but as a human right for all.During the debate on marriage equality in our state, I joined supporters outside of the very old historic rotunda, that state house where George Washington resigned his commission, gave the power of our army back to the representatives of the people. And in that historical dome, I remember being in the chambers as we were awaiting the vote. And as you could hear the debate going on in packed chambers about marriage equality, I have to tell you that it was probably one of the most moving debates I ever listened to.It was considered bad form in our state for the governor to sit in the gallery and glare at people who weren't voting for that thing.That was considered bad form. But I listened to it on the squawk box, and many, many times got goose bumps and was moved to tears by the love and by the passion and by the courage that so many people were giving voice to in that public forum of ours.There, I met two moms and their 4-year-old son Will. After standing for hours outside those halls, Will was very, very, very tired and all of us who have kids know that there reaches a point for any 4-year-old where ... He was tired, he seemed a little bit disinterested. I could only imagine what was going through his head.But the next day I saw a photo of Will and his family taken right after the vote. And man, his little face was all lit up, he was reenergized. And whatever the nuances, the ins and outs, the process of history and the procedural failures and triumphs that led to that moment: what Will knew was that the entire state had acknowledged the dignity of his family, and the dignity of the love that is at the center of every family. He might not have understood the debates and all of the process, but he knew that.After I signed marriage equality into law, we thought we were out of the woods. But our Republican brothers and sisters, not all of them because quite honestlyand let me say this, and this is true: I think we do our democracy a disservice if we say that all Republicans are our enemies. All Republicans are not our enemies. They are oftentimes our uncles, they are oftentimes our family members, they are our friends, they are teachers, they are the firefighters that come when we dial 9-1-1. And I can tell you this, because I counted every single vote and had to track down people late into the evening all over Annapolis, we would not have passed marriage equality in the state of Maryland were it not for a few Republican votes that voted for human dignity.So let me correct myself in my remarks on the fly. Because of some who thought they could defeat marriage equality by petitioning it to referendum, they put it on the ballot, and then we had to defend it on the ballot.But we took our message of human dignity to the people of our state. And there were a lot of people very sadly were saying, ""I'm not sure you're going to be able to pull it off in Maryland given the demographic mix of your state, given traditional religions in your state, and you might not be able to pull it off."" And you know what: we might not have been able to pull it off, but actually we did. And we became the first state in the Union, an hour ahead of Maine, to defend it and pass it at the ballot in the state of Maryland.Let me talk with you a little bit about bullying. This is an issue very near and dear to me.Now, thanks to the brave Americans who earned a victory before the Supreme Court marriage equality is the law of the land ineverystate.And I'm also very proud of the fact that Jim Obergefell and his husband had traveled to Maryland to legally marry, so Maryland had a role in that historic Supreme Court case as well.But look, the struggle is not over. Progress never ends. It sometimes zigs and zags, but there is always more to do, and the good Lord gives us plenty of work in our own life to make our state and our country a better place. This struggle is not over.We must continue to improve our laws because it's all about making individuals more fully included in the economic, social, and political life of our country, to protect the rights of every individual.Nowhere is this work more important than when it comes to preventing and addressing bullying. Today in America, no child should be excludedfrom getting a safe, quality education, and an environment that is open and welcoming.But this problem with bullying is very real, and it's persistent. Because of the nature of our connectedness and communications, and all of our kids and the cell phone and the texting and all of that, it's not the sort of thingI mean when I went to school, once you left the recess yard, or left school and you got home, you were in a safe place. But now with the texting and the other things, it's a pretty challenging and oftentimes a brutal environment for kids, sometimes lethal.Too often, the most frequent victims of bullying are transgender kids. This leads to far more than hurt feelingsit leads to lower performance in school, diminished career aspirations, and shocking disparities in healthcare, and sometimes even worse.Get this, more than half of LGBTQ students say in surveys that they feel unsafe in school. More than half. And three out of four have been harassed because of their sexual orientation.In my own state, my wife Katiewho is a judge and cannot participate in politics, so I really hope she votes for me.My wife, Katie, took this on as one of her major issues as first lady of Maryland. She was in court and on the bench eight hours a day, but her passion was this issue of bullying, to prevent and address bullying as a matter of principle and primary importance for our state.As Governor, I signed legislation requiring our state to develop a model policy for prohibiting bullying, harassment, and intimidation in every school. And when I led on that with Katie's help, it was amazing how many other people came to the fore and how many great and courageous educators stepped up as well.Bullying over social media pushedtrue storya Howard County teenager in our own state to take her own life. When I came home one night, I heard in the governor's residence conversations going on in the smaller dining room. And I walked in and I met the parents of this beautiful girl, and they were talking with Katie at great length about their story. And so in addition to making cyber-bullying a criminal offense, we established Maryland's first-ever bullying awareness week.We also required schools to report incidents of harassment and intimidation. If we don't report these things, there's no way that we can be able to tell whether we're doing better this week than we were last week, or whether we're doing better this year than we were last year. But with openness and transparency and reporting, and leaders in every school and in the state and in the counties declaring that this is a problem and that we need to addressing this problem, it's amazing how much progress actually can be made. Armed with that information for the first time, we worked with school boards to target hotspots of bullying, and to protect our most vulnerable students.And we used a better system than Survey Monkey, so if my former colleague in the National Governor's Association, Governor Branstad, would like to talk about sharing best practices, I'm here in Iowa.I understand, and you all are more aware of events that are taking place, but just this week we've learned that some in the Iowa legislature are launching an investigation, I guess they would call it, or holding hearings against our host here tonight, Iowa Safe Schools for holding an anti-bullying conference. To those reactionary forces, to those fear-filled forces, I want to encourage you to just keep doing what you are doing. Affirm the dignity of every single student, of every person, because there is a lot of goodness in our country. And people are very, very smart and they're intuitive, and so I encourage you to just be strong and keep moving forward. The leaders of Iowa Safe Schools have come together to educate students and teachers, they join hands to promote diversity, equality, and social justice. Wow, what a radical idea.In other movements in American history, in other chapters, just because you're promoting these sorts of things doesn't mean there won't be some that try to stop you, or try to fell trees or put up roadblocks in your way. But the longer arc of American history is that we always move to greater respect for all, greater equality for all, actions that uphold the dignity of every person. I've been very, very fortunate in my life to have been in public office at these times. I want to tell you that as president, I am going to embrace a comprehensive agenda to tackle bullying in every single school, all across the United States of America.And as president, I intend to use every power at my disposal to require that all schools and districts implement anti-bullying and anti-harassment policies that are crafted specifically to prevent and prohibit bullying of LGBTQ students.And as we move to make debt-free college a reality again in the United States of America, the nation that built the greatest middle class in the world more of our people at higher and better levels without crushing them with debt, I also intend to mandate that public colleges and universities do the same and also implement anti-bullying and anti-harassment policies.I plan to clearly prohibit discrimination in public schools on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation under our laws. I plan to launch a new federal grant program to help schools and colleges put anti-bullying policies in place, learn from one another. One of the things I learned as a big city mayor is that the most important people that can show police officers how to do things that are actually effective are other police officers. And the same is true with educators and school administrators. Let's lift up best practices. Let's do the things that work, that actually make a difference in the classroom and in our schools.I also intend to create real and meaningful penalties when schools fail to create safe learning environments, when they look the other way-When they look the other way and pretend that ""that's not a problem in our school."" I'm sure that all of us as parents have probably had that experience of making the official complaint and then having people pat us on the head and say, ""That's not a problem here."" And as parents we ask, ""Well, how do you know?"" ""Well we know because we don't have the problem here."" But they don't have policies that actually encourage the reporting and the stepping up. Schools that allow for unlawful discrimination should risk losing federal funding. Students who experience harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence should actually have some recourse to due process, to get the situation changed, some action under the law.We know that bullying is not the only challenge that our children face, though. Even though we've made progress, a lot of LGBTQ youth still face a lifetime of uncertainty.Too many of our young people are still asking: ""Will I be able to get my dream job?"" ""Will I be discriminated againstor attackedfor the way I look?"" ""Will I be able to live in the open, free of fear, with the person I love?""I believe that the answers to these questions are answers that we have to provide not only with our compassion but with the actions that we're willing to take as a people, all across our country, at every level. This isn't something any one leader can do. There's a campaign that's going on right now to end the sort of predatory behavior and sexual abuse and rapes that happen on college campuses. The ... say it's on us. So too is this on us. This is a crowd-sourced deal. We all need to work on this.While President Obama and Vice-President Biden have been powerful advocates for the LGBTQ community, too many Americans are still waiting for lifeto get better.There's a lot of pain in the world. There's a lot of xenophobia. There's a lot of homophobia. There's a lot of racism. We wish that it weren't so, but it is. People are evicted from their homes, fired from their jobs.LGBTQ immigrants are abused and assaulted when they are detained behind chain link fences and razor wire.Trans women of color are attacked and murdered.Runaway gay and trans youth don't know where to turn for help without experiencing hatred and violence.To truly achieve the sort of equality to which we aspire as a nation, we must winallof these struggles. And as president, I will stand with you. And I will lead not with words, but with actions.So, first and foremost, one of those actions we would have to embrace is the passage of the EQUALITY Act.I was proud to be the first presidential candidate to endorse this critical legislationbecause I saw how important comprehensive non-discrimination legislation has been in our state.It is time to end discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, education, credit, and more as a nation!We must come together, to ensure that all of our childrenespecially our most vulnerable childrenare able to live in a loving, caring, and stable home that is equally protected under the law.That also means ending discrimination in adoption and foster care.Reauthorizing and strengthening the Runaway and Homeless Youth Actso that we can locate, treat, and support homeless LGBTQ youth and their families.Making greater strides, also, against human trafficking, something that is a scourge in our nation and that we can only address by coming together, acknowledging and realizing that many of the people that law enforcement in the past were trained to see as perpetrators are actually victims. We need to train law enforcement and other social service interveners to be able to identify.We must fight to strengthen access to accessible, affordable, and quality care for all of the LGBTQ community.One, by making it very clear to health providers, that when they receive federal assistance they have an obligation not to discriminate against people based on their gender identity or sexual orientation.Secondly, by repealing ineffective abstinence-only education programs and providing comprehensive sex-ed for young peopleincluding LGBTQ youth.And three, by continuing and fully funding the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programwhich provides vital medical care and support services to young people.And we must stop doing things that actuallyhurtour young people...Banning deceptive and harmful ""conversion therapies,"" so-called.Ending the practice of immigrant detention, especially for LGBTQ people;And pushing states to repeal laws that criminalize people with HIVbecause these laws are inconsistent with science, and they are harmful to public safety and they also impede the improvement of public health.These are actions. These actions are not just common-sense solutionsthey are also extensions of the principles of who we are as human beings.These are what I believe the next horizons are that we need to move to. These are the next challenges that we have in order to become a more inclusive people, a more compassionate and vibrant nation.Other candidates in our race for president may want to spend a lot of time talking about what side of the debate they were on way back in the day when DOMA was being debated. But I want to talk with you in the course of this campaign about where we must move today, and tomorrow.Unlike the other candidates, I can point to a long record not of following polls, but of always being ahead of the curve and being an effective leader by leading with our principles, speaking to the goodness within, by forging a new consensus to get important things done. That's what leadership is all about. Our country, I absolutely believe, is searching for new leadership, and we are searching for a leader who's not afraid to call forth the goodness within us.I leave you with the words of a great man who said that ""there is an absolute direction to growth, and life moves in that direction. Life is never mistaken either about its road or its destination. It tells us towards what point on the horizon we must steer if we are to see the dawn's light grow more intense.""Keep up your good work. Thank you."
Martin O'Malley,D,c,"November 23, 2015","Remarks at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire","Thank you for having me. Thank you for your leadership and what you've done for our country and for your kind invitation.I'd like to speak with you today about the new challenges we face as a nation in this new century. How we rise  as a people  to meet these challenges and master the profound changes of these new times.There is no prosperity  no freedom  without security.Therefore I would like to begin by addressing the changing nature of warfare and conflict in the 21st Century  a change brought home to our consciousness by the attacks on the citizens of Paris last week, and the imminent threat facing Brussels as we gather here in New Hampshire today.Since the attacks of September 11th, the nature of conflict and warfare has changedWar was very different 25 years ago when the United States in broad coalition with European and Arab nations pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.We were dealing with sovereign states, standing armies, limited objectives, and public support for limited military engagement.There are very few rules from 25 years ago that still apply to the nature of most conflict today.Peace is no longer achieved when one army on a battlefield waves a white flag. Sending in overwhelming numbers of Marine Divisions will not solve the security challenges we face today.Victory is not defined by surrender or regime change. Peace and must be constantly maintained. Extremist violence does not follow the Geneva convention. Jihadist ideology does not confine itself to a single theatre of conflict.Globalization of information, of financial markets, of travel, of economies, has brought with it the globalization of this new form of conflict.In an era of constant technological change, failed states, international terrorist networks and humanitarian disasters on a scale not seen since World War II...we need new thinking and fresh approaches to confront this new evil in the world while protecting our security and our values here at home.Governors have led us to victory through two world wars. Not with speeches. Not by retreating to ideology or past positions. But by bringing people together to overcome great challenges. And that is what we must do today.We must understand how war has changedand adapt to it, so we can master those changes.America's security needs in the 21stcentury demand new thinking... more effective information sharing... and greater collaboration with like-minded people around the world. People who share our interest in protecting human life and defending the global commons we share.""As our problems are new, so must we think anew and act anew.""In just the past month, we saw a Russian airliner go down in Egypt. Dual suicide bombings in Beirut. The terror in Paris. Hundreds killed and wounded in Ankara. And almost two dozen dead in Mali. ISIL has developed from its safe haven an ability to strike civilian targets well beyond the borders of Irq and Syria.We must respond to these new developments by BOTH the actions we take abroad AND by the actions we take here at home.This latest iteration of violent jihadist extremism known as ISIS must be confronted and its leadership destroyed. The United States must work in the broadest possible coalition with all nations of the region and the world who share our interest in protecting the global commons.While the United States maintains the best and most technologically advanced armed forces on the planet, the military tools we we choose use must be tailored to meet our security needs, and not to undermine them.This is a global problem that requires a global solution. We must lead this effort, but we should not lead it alone.Last week, the Security Council gave us a springboard to do just that. In a unanimous vote, it called on member states to ""redouble"" action against the Islamic State and to ""take all necessary measures"" in the fight against ISIS.All five permanent members of the UN Security Council have now seen their citizens murdered by ISIL within the past year. Americans and British beheaded. Russians bombed in mid-flight. Chinese taken prisoner and killed. And French youth massacred in the City of Light.The United States must take the lead in making this Security Council resolution real. To lead as one strong nation among nations  a concerted international effort to destroy the operational capacity of ISIS. This means using the tools at our collective disposal to destroy and dismantle their deadly operations on many fronts.When it comes to protecting our global commons against this threat, we must recognize that nations have ground responsibility for their own front yards. Our regional partners must provide the front-line ground forces for this effort.We can and must provide all necessary military support to those partners, including close air support, Special Forces, intelligence and logistics.We must work with other nations to internationalize Special Operations.And we must work with other nations to stop the two-way flow of foreign fighters. This means: shifting intelligence-sharing from a need-to-know criteria to need-to-share imperative; developing solutions with private sector experts on cyber and encryption issues; and sharing best practices with other nations on border and homeland security.We must improve international efforts to cut-off ISIL's means of financing and funding.We must do our part in a comprehensive international approach to addressing the humanitarian crises in the region, including global funding to address immediate needs of refugees fleeing the genocidal terror of ISIS.We must expose ISIL's true nature through a concerted national AND international communications campaignunderstanding the cultural and religious misrepresentations that attract the disillusioned and isolated to ISIL's ranks.Such a campaign must involve the international Muslim community at all levels. As many have done already, they must take the lead rejecting and marginalizing those who have so distorted and hijacked their religion for the purpose of murder and genocide.There is also important work we must do here at home.On Sept. 11, 2001, I was serving as mayor of Baltimore. On that day and in the ensuing years as governor of Maryland, the knowledge that terrorists might strike us again at any time was always in the back of my mind.In response, my administration set out 12 homeland security core competencies to make our state as prepared, resilient, and secure as possible.We strengthened the effectiveness of our intelligence fusion center. Created interoperable communications systems for all of our first responders, throughout our state. Networked our closed circuit television cameras, and adopted face-recognition technology.We rapidly shared intelligence information at every level. We made our transportation infrastructure more secure. We gave our first responders the protective equipment they needed, put the right response teams in place, and drilled and exercised them to up their game.And now we need to do more.Complacency has allowed our Congress and too many of our States to put the development of stronger Homeland Security capacities on the back burner.Local, state and federal law enforcement must redouble efforts to improve information sharing  this means creating truly functioning intelligence fusion centers in every major City and State. This means interoperable communications and personal protective equipment for all first responders. This means improving the perimeter security and resiliency of our critical infrastructure.In the age of ISIL-inspiredattacks, achieving these core competencies in every state is just as important as our military efforts in Syria and Iraq.This is not an either or choice. We must do both and more.The Paris attacks were far more likely to have been stopped by better Homeland security actions in Brussels and Paris than by more firepower in Syria and Iraq.As far as we know, all the terrorists most directly involved in the attacks in Paris were European nationals, and only one of them had actually traveled to Syria.Improving human intelligence and the timely sharing of that intelligence will be the key to better results on the ground in Iraq and Syria, and it will be the key to better protection of the our Homeland and the global commons.Ultimately, our success in confronting this threat  our long-term success in defeating this evil  depends upon the power of our values.Democracies are very vulnerable to turning upon themselves in the aftermath of a terror attack. Denying this victory to terror depends upon the courage and resolve of the American people.Individual citizens must resist the fear-based appeals of their own politicians. Some of these appeals are based in fear. Some are based in the sort of political opportunism that can precede fascism or the plunging of our Republic into a security state.This danger of fear-driven politics in the United States has been on display for the whole world to see over the last two weeks.Instead of taking steps to improve our nation's homeland security, many Republican governors and presidential candidates are stoking apprehension and fear. Even worse, some are actively stigmatizing the victims of ISIS brutality and genocide. Some are playing right into the hands of ISIS by turning us upon are Muslim-American neighbors solely because of their religion.Ben Carson said it would be a ""huge mistake"" for the United States to give refuge to Syrian refugees.Jeb Bush implied we should admit Christians, but turn away Muslims.Chris Christie said he opposes taking in Syrian orphans, going out of his way to single out ones ""under five.""And Donald Trump proposed a national registry of American Muslims. In response, one Jewish organization observed: ""We've seen that. It doesn't end well.""How far the Party of Lincoln has veered - even from just a few years ago.President George W. Bush deserves great credit for visiting a mosque just six days after 9/11 to make clear that while the United States would rightfully go to war, it was not a war against Islam. Inspired, in part by the example of his presidential leadership in this instance, as Mayor, I too began visiting mosques. Other Mayors across America did as well.Those now casting suspicion upon an entire faith communitywith millions of adherents in the United States and billions across the worldhave forgotten that lesson.ISIS' goal is to create a religious war on global scale. Donald Trump and others are playing right into their hands.Of course, we must take actions to screen and mitigate against the potential risk of terrorists trying to take advantage of our refugee resettlement program.That is the reason we have in place what is probably the most thorough and comprehensive refugee screening process of any country in the world. It involves more than a dozen steps and can take up to two years  just ask the rescued members of the Chaldaen Christian community, many of whose members sit in U.S. detention centers awaiting the completion of this arduous screening process.Every single refugee candidate completes an extensive interview with the Department of Homeland Security.Those wishing to do us harm will almost certainly pursue an alternative route into America.None of the 9/11 terrorists came to America as refugees.Several months ago, I became the first presidential candidate to say the United States should welcome 65,000 Syrian refugees next year. I have personally met with Syrian refugees who fled the same type of violence that engulfed Paris on Friday. I have looked into the eyes of their children.The United States that my father fought for  the United States that so many of our sons and daughters have fought and died for  does not turn it's back on families fleeing genocide.As Americans, we must stand with and learn from our brothers in France. They understand that safety and providing refuge to those fleeing death is not a zero-sum choice. The French people are strong enough to overcome fear and remain true to their values: they will still welcome 30,000 Syrian refugees over the next two years.Have we become so intimidated as a nation by these barbaric thugs that we are willing to surrender the values of the United States in the face of their threats?Strength at home is not just about security. It's about our values. It is about our ability to do justice. It is about our compassion as Americans. The symbol of America's greatness is not the barbed wire fence; it is the Statue of Liberty!As Americans, we are united by the belief of every person's dignity. By our service to the common good we all share.The best part of running for President is meeting young people who share this idealism, and belief in all things possible.If you want to know where our country is headed, talk to young Americans under 30.You'll rarely find among them people who want to bash New American Immigrants or refugees, or people that want to deny rights to gay couples or their children.You will rarely find among them anyone who denies that climate change is real, or thinks their government shouldn't be doing something about it.All of this tells me that we are moving to a more connected, more compassionate, and more generous place as a country.As Americans, we make our own future.Our ability to craft a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration with like-minded nations,... our ability to craft a more effective national security strategy of threat reduction,... these things depend on our ability to give our own children and grandchildren a healthier future  with more opportunity than we have enjoyed  here at home.The good news and the bad news of our times is this: our country has created now 68 months in a row of positive job growth, so our country is doing better. The bad news is 70% of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago  and that is the first time that has happened this side of World War II.The great poet laureate of the American Dream, Bruce Springsteen once asked: ""is a dream a lie if don't come true, or is it something worse.We cannot claim our country is working well if our middle class continues to shrink and our poorest families are becoming poorer.We must return to our true selves and remember, that our economy is not money, it is people  all of our people.Together we must take actions to include more of our people in the economic success of the United States.No American family who works hard and plays by the rules should have to raise their children in poverty.Therefore we must take action, together, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour  wherever and however we can!We must advance the cause of paid family leave so that all women can participate more fully in the economic life of our nation  because ""when women succeed, America succeeds!""The option of debt-free college should be a reality for every student in America, within 5 years!Instead of cutting Social Security  like all of the Republican candidates want to do  we must expand Social Security!I am the first candidate  but let us hope not the last  to put forth a plan to move America forward to a 100% clean electric energy grid by 2050, and create 5 million new jobs along the way!Do we want wages to go up and not down? It's time to bring 11 million of our neighbors out of the off-the-books, shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform!Nothing we care about can be accomplished by words alone.We must take action - guided by our values as Americans.Therefore, we must stop giving a free pass to the bullies of Wall Street.I have never represented Wall Street and, I sure as hell won't be taking economic orders from the big banks of Wall Street when I'm in your White House!As your President, I will have the independence and the backbone to fight for you: if a bank is too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to manage, then it's too damn big, and it needs to be broken up before it breaks our national economy once again!Our country has always been about the good of the many  not the greed of the few!And finally, our values must give us the courage to put our children's safetyeach and every day ahead of the craven and morally bankrupt interests of the National Rifle Association.The NRA has one goaland one goal onlyselling as many guns as possible, no matter the cost in lives.For forty years, they've dictated what laws should be written.It's high time we find our backbone again as Democrats and stand up and say no to the NRA.Right now, as we respond to the attacks in Paris, people on the FBI's Terrorist Watch list can legally buy assault rifles and other deadly weapons because of a loophole in our laws.Yet every single Republican candidate, when challenged on this issue, has cowered to the political lobbying power of the National Rifle Association. But the NRA is fighting to protect that loophole, and to protect the right of terrorists to buy weapons of mass murder in the United States!Enough is enough. One American life is worth more than all the gun sales in America.Next year, the American people will decide.New leadership, or the same old battles?Actions, or words?It's not about polls and pundits.Thomas Jefferson once said, ""In matters of fashion, swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.""A weather vane shifts its position every time the winds change.Effective leaders do not.I know who I am, I know what I believe, and I am willing to fight for it.We are all in this together.To solve our problems, we must face tomorrow.A lot of people tell me that I face a tough fight in this race.Well you know what?  I kind of like the tough fights. I've always been drawn to the tough fights.Perhaps the toughness of the fight is the way the hidden God has of telling us we are fighting for something worth saving!The American Dream is worth saving.Our children's future is worth saving.Our country is worth saving.Our planet is worth saving.I am in this to win this.I need your help to move our country forward.Thank you."
