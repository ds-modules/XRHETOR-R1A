Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following statement today in support of Governor Mike Pence\'s effort to defend religious liberty and protect against the government forcing individuals to violate their deeply held beliefs:""I want to commend Governor Mike Pence for his support of religious freedom, especially in the face of fierce opposition. There was a time, not too long ago, when defending religious liberty enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Alas, today we are facing a concerted assault on the First Amendment, on the right of every American to seek out and worship God according to the dictates of his or her conscience. Governor Pence is holding the line to protect religious liberty in the Hoosier State. Indiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties. I\'m proud to stand with Mike, and I urge Americans to do the same.""'"
Ted Cruz,R,s,"April 3, 2015",b'Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on the Announcement of a Nuclear Deal with Iran',"b'Releases statement reacting to President Obama\'s announcement of nuclear deal with IranHOUSTON, TX  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas released the following statement in response to President Obama\'s agreement with Iran:""President Obama\'s agreement with Iran, the details of which he has largely kept secret, is as he said \'historic\' because of the catastrophic risk it poses to the security of the United States and our allies.""The so-called deal, unilaterally arranged without any consultation with Congress, lifts sanctions and effectively puts Iran on the path to the bomb after a 10-year horizon. The likelihood of Iran using those weapons against Israel, which its leaders call \'little Satan\' and have explicitly said they would like to \'erase off the map\' and America, which it calls \'the Great Satan,\' is unacceptably high.""Under no circumstance should a U.S. President lift sanctions and grant nuclear capability to a nation that proudly chants \'Death to America.\'""It is unfortunate that throughout these negotiations the President continually reserved his harshest language not for the Iranian regime, but for the United States Congress and the Prime Minister of Israel.""Finally, let us remember to lift those Americans who remain unjustly detained by the Iranian regime in our prayers. The President had an opportunity to speak out for their freedom yesterday and did not. We must continue to give them a voice. Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, must be freed and Robert Levinson must be found.""President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and other negotiators have publicly said the choice is between their bad deal and war. That was a false choice. America should not accept a bad deal, under any terms. The Obama Administration should have pursued a good deal that forces Iran to renounce its nuclear program, stop threatening Israel, and release our American brothers.""This is a very bad deal and it is a grim day for America. President Obama is right to be concerned that it will likely face considerable opposition from the American people and their representatives in Congress. Because absent Congress\' consent, it will not be binding when President Obama leaves office.""'"

Let us also pray for protection from the enemies of freedom.""The Passover Haggadah asks each generation to look upon the exodus from Egypt as if we had personally experienced it ourselves reflecting on Psalm 114, \'When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.\'""In our generation, there is no shortage of modern-day Pharaohs who seek to destroy freedom-loving people everywhere.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Easter:""He is risen!""Heidi and I are in Charleston, South Carolina where we attended a beautiful sunrise service.""As Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are reminded of the true hope for the world.""Today I am reminded of the touching anecdote President Reagan once used to explain the prevailing promise of God\'s word.""As Reagan said in his famous \'Tear down this wall\' speech at the Brandenberg Gate:""\'The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship. The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront. Years ago, before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the television tower at Alexander Platz. Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower\'s one major flaw, treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind. Yet even today when the sun strikes that spherethat sphere that towers over all Berlinthe light makes the sign of the cross. There in Berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.\'""Today is a day to cherish our faith, our freedoms, and all precious gifts that we have been blessed to receive.""As it is written in Luke 24:7 \'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.\'""Heidi and I wish you and your family a very Happy Easter.""'"

Rand is a good friend, and we have worked side by side on many issues. I respect his talent, his passion, and the work he has done for Kentuckians and Americans in the U.S. Senate.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement regarding President Obama\'s meeting with Raul Castro, the communist dictator of Cuba:""Keeping up with a disturbing trend of this administration, President Obama is in the process of striking another very bad deal, now with the communist dictatorship of Cuba. President Obama\'s approach gives the Castros exactly what they want  economic relief and legitimacy on the international stage  and effectively abandons the pro-U.S. opposition. This President has shown he is willing to do what nine previous presidents of both parties would not: cave to a communist dictator in our own hemisphere.""The President said today that his unprecedented meeting with Raul Castro was a step towards the future. Unfortunately, he is leaving the Cuban people imprisoned in the past.""Of course we should look for new ways to bring relief to the people of Cuba, but if the United States is to provide an economic lifeline, we must first extract significant concessions. For instance, American fugitives being harbored in Cuba should be extradited. We should demand significant legal reform so that the Cuban government can no longer detain its citizens indefinitely with no process. We should demand that the political opposition to the Castros be included in any and all negotiations with Cuba, so their concerns will be addressed. And we should calibrate any relaxation of sanctions directly to the cessation of their human rights violations.""If Cuba will not show it can operate in good faith by making such changes before sanctions are lifted, we have no assurance that the Castros will take real action to improve the lives of their impoverished and oppressed citizens. Meanwhile, American dollars will flow exclusively into the Castros\' pockets while the Cuban people continue to suffer.""'"

But the good news is that we\'re ready for Hillary  we know exactly what to expect.""Hillary Clinton represents the failed policies of the past and there\'s going to be a very clear choice to make in 2016. Does America want a third Obama term or are we ready for strong conservative leadership to make America great again?""Her announcement raises a critical question: Is the world a safer place because Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State?""The answer is obvious. No. The Obama-Clinton national security policies have made the world more dangerous for America and for our allies.""She designed and implemented \'leading from behind.\' On her watch we have witnessed the rise of Russia, Iran, and ISIS. Radical Islamic terrorists are on the march.Here at home, the Obama-Clinton economic policies have made life harder and harder for millions of hard-working Americans.""We know that a Hillary Clinton Administration would be no different than an Obama Administration.""Obamacare, amnesty, and the ongoing assault on our constitutional rights would continue. Our rights to religious liberty, to free speech, and to keep and bear arms would continue to be threatened by the federal government. There would be more scandals, more corruption, more lawlessness, and more abuse of power.""The American people have had enough. I believe now, more than ever, is a time for truth.""It is time to champion the rights of the American people, and to defend America\'s sovereignty and the Constitution.""Courageous conservatives can and will reignite the promise of America.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement regarding President Obama\'s decision to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism:""When it comes to making any deals with world dictators, the President of the United States should use two words: Prove it. Cuba must prove it is willing to change its behavior before the United States takes a single action to remove it from the list of state sponsors of terror. Fidel and Raul Castro have a decades-long track record of violent hostility towards our nation. It is dangerous and reckless to use a terrorist designation as a negotiating tool, as their regime continues to support and harbor terrorists who have murdered Americans. We need better than a promise of future change; Cuba needs to prove it. And, until Cuba does, any discussion about changing its terrorist designation should be off the table.""'"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement marking Tax Day:""Tax day is upon us again. But this year it\'s different. This year, on top of the frustrating reminder that Americans are giving too much of their income to fund too many wasteful government programs, families are now being forced to pay the Obamacare tax for the first time.""Instead of government-run healthcare that increases taxes, limits options, and puts the government between patients and their doctors, imagine a free-market system that enables healthcare to be personal, portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets Americans fill out their taxes on a postcard. Imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the IRS.""More of Americans\' hard-earned wages should be able to stay in their wallets so they can be free to invest more in their families and businesses, not in growing big government.""Tax reform is crucial to reversing our current economic stagnation, sparking economic growth, and expanding opportunity. I\'m running for President because I believe that together, we can make D.C. listen, we can repeal Obamacare, we can implement fundamental tax reform, and we can restore our nation as a place that champions prosperity and opportunity for all.""'"
Ted Cruz,R,s,"April 23, 2015",b'Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on Support for Traditional Marriage',"b'HOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement regarding a report in the New York Times addressing his support for traditional marriage:""It speaks volumes that the New York Times considers it newsworthy that a Republican who believes marriage is between a man and a woman would meet with people who hold a different view. The purpose of the meeting and the primary topics of conversation were national security, foreign policy, and America\'s commitment to standing with Israel. On the subject of marriage, when asked, I stated directly and unambiguously what everyone in the room already knew, that I oppose gay marriage and I support traditional marriage.""One person further asked how Heidi and I would react if we found out one of our (4 and 7-year-old) daughters were gay. My reply: \'We would love her with all our hearts. We love our daughters unconditionally.\'""A conservative Republican who is willing to meet with individuals who do not agree on marriage and who loves his daughters unconditionally may not reflect the caricature of conservatives promoted by the left, but it\'s hardly newsworthy.""I know it\'s been a long time since we\'ve seen it, but this is what it means to truly be a \'big tent Republican\' instead of a panderer. I\'m happy to go anywhere to anyone to champion conservative values. We\'re not always going to agree on everything, and I\'m not going to change my fundamental values. But at the same time, I\'m hoping to offer enough bold leadership on a broad slate of issues that many voters will decide we agree on far more than we disagree.""'"

The recent revelations about previously undisclosed contributions to the Clinton Foundation only create more doubt about whether the former Secretary of State can be trusted.""The Clinton Foundation collected tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments including donors who had business interests with the State Department while Clinton was Secretary. She made decisions in that capacity that likely benefited the same people who were giving large donations to the foundation.""At the very least, these revelations present a clear conflict of interest. I call on Hillary Clinton to return the donations from foreign governments. Until she does, how can the American people trust her with another position of power?""'"
Ted Cruz,R,s,"April 28, 2015",b'Statement by Senator Ted Cruz the on Supreme Court Marriage Case',"b'Issues statement on Supreme Court marriage caseHOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement regarding today\'s oral arguments in the Supreme Court concerning whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to license marriages between two people of the same sex and to recognize same-sex marriages licensed and performed in another state:""In recent years, federal judges have defied the power of the people to define marriage through their elected representatives as a covenant between one man and one woman. At the behest of those seeking to use unelected judges to strike down democratically enacted marriage laws, courts across the country have seized for themselves the authority to redefine marriage. Today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases raising the question of whether such judicial intrusion is constitutionally proper. It is not.""For millennia, the union of a man and a woman has been the fundamental building block of society, and the Judeo-Christian value of traditional marriage is a cornerstone upon which the strength of our Nation rests. Before 2004, no U.S. state recognized same-sex marriages. And to preserve the traditional understanding of marriage, thirty states have amended their state constitutions to define marriage as between one man and one woman, and in total over forty states have passed laws or amendments to protect traditional marriage.""This effort to redefine marriage by judicial fiat poses a serious threat to the religious liberty for those who embrace traditional marriage. We are seeing businesses shut down and individuals threatened with costly lawsuits simply because they do not agree with same-sex marriage. There was a time when the defense of religious liberty was an issue of bipartisan agreement. Yet now the progressive left is seeking to force their view of marriage upon all Americans, regardless of their religious convictions.""Resorting to federal courts to further that effort is unconstitutional. Under our Constitution, courts do not make law. This is why I am proud to have filed an amicus brief in support of the right of states to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. It is my sincere hope that the Justices of the highest court of our land will rule on the side of the U.S. Constitution and let the people, through their elected State representatives, continue to define marriage as it has been understood since the beginning of time.""In case that does not happen, I have also introduced legislation and a constitutional amendment in the Senate last week to prevent federal courts from further interfering with any state\'s Constitutionally-protected authority to define marriage.""Last week, Sen. Cruz introduced the Restoration of Marriage Amendment and the Protect Marriage from the Courts Act of 2015.The Restoration of Marriage Amendment would amend the Constitution to guarantee the right of the people to define marriage in their laws as the union of one man and one woman and to prevent the courts from misconstruing the Constitution to tear down those democratically adopted state marriage laws.The Protect Marriage from the Courts Act of 2015 would bar federal courts from having jurisdiction to strike down state marriage laws. Congress has express power under Article III of the Constitution to limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts and to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This legislation would eliminate the jurisdiction of federal courts to determine the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.'"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to the riots in Baltimore:""Today 85,000 Baltimore city children will not be going to school. Buildings have been set ablaze, stores have been looted, the police in the streets have been seriously injured, and strict curfews have been imposed.""No man, woman, or child should fear for his or her safety in Americanot in their schools, not in their neighborhoods, not in their citiesbut today families are scared.""Our government must perform its central functions and purposes: to preserve the peace, protect the people, and serve justice.""The government exists to ensure our domestic securitywhether it\'s from a city riot, or the threat of a terrorist attack on our homeland. We have to restore that trust and prove to the people we can make America safe again.""Every case deserves justice, and the facts surrounding Freddie Gray\'s death should be thoroughly and impartially investigated. But rioting and mayhem are not the answer.""While we continue to pray for a peaceful conclusion to the events in Baltimoreand pray for the families of those injuredI hope we all remember that our nation\'s law enforcement consists of thousands of heroic officers who deeply respect the dignity of each person they serve to protect. Targeting law enforcement for violence is wrong, and it cannot be allowed to persist.""Likewise, the small number of those who have wreaked destruction upon Baltimore over the past few days are not emblematic of the thousands of honest, hard-working families who are proud to call the city home.""There is, and has always been, far more to celebrate in America than to worry about. Don\'t lose sight of that fundamental truth.""We will always face challenges and, together, we must rise to address them with strength and confidence in the future of our nation.""'"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today released the following statement regarding the Obama Administration\'s removal of Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list:""The removal of Cuba\'s Castro Regime from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list is only the most recent example of the failed Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy. The Castros have done absolutely nothing to merit this change beyond give vague \'assurances\' that they will not engage in terrorist activities, while the administration claims the regime has not engaged in terrorist activity \'at least for the last six months\'  a laughable rationale that ignores their more than a half century of relentless violent hostility towards the United States.""We need look no further than the example of North Korea to predict the ramifications of this most recent bad decision. In 2008, despite having done nothing to merit it, the Hermit Kingdom was removed from the list in the hopes that the concession would bring them to the negotiating table. Seven years later, an emboldened North Korea has become more dangerous  testing nuclear weapons, engaging in clandestine nuclear programs with Iran, launching cyber attacks against America, and most recently, threatening our homeland with a nuclear weapon. Furthermore, North Korea was intercepted in 2013 trafficking weapons from none other than Cuba.""The State Sponsors of Terrorism list is not a bargaining tool. It is a tool to measure the bad behavior of hostile regimes and hold them accountable for it. But the Obama Administration seems to want an embassy in Havana more than they want to do the hard work of securing the American people.""This dangerous recklessness must stop.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court\'s decision on King v. Burwell:""Today\'s decision in King v. Burwell is judicial activism, plain and simple. For the second time in just a few years, a handful of unelected judges has rewritten the text of Obamacare in order to impose this failed law on millions of Americans. The first time, the Court ignored federal law and magically transformed a statutory \'penalty\' into a \'tax.\' Today, these robed Houdinis transmogrified a \'federal exchange\' into an exchange \'established by the State.\'""As Justice Scalia rightfully put it, \'Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \'established by the State."" He also said, \'We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare\'  I agree.""If this were a bankruptcy case, or any other case of ordinary statutory interpretation, the result would have been 9-0, with the Court unanimously reversing the Obama administration\'s illegal actions. But instead, politics intervened.""For nakedly political reasons, the Supreme Court willfully ignored the words that Congress wrote, and instead read into the law their preferred policy outcome. These judges have joined with President Obama in harming millions of Americans. Unelected judges have once again become legislators, and bad ones at that. They are lawless, and they hide their prevarication in legalese. Our government was designed to be one of laws, not of men, and this transparent distortion is disgraceful.""At the same time, crocodile tears are flooding our nation\'s capital today over the Supreme Court\'s decision to illegally rewrite Obamacare, which has been a disaster since its inception. But one day of faux outrage from the Washington Cartel won\'t fool the millions of courageous conservatives across our country. They know the Republican leadership in Washington is quietly celebrating the Court\'s decision. If they believe this issue is now settled so they don\'t have to address it, they are sorely mistaken.""Every GOP candidate for the Republican nomination should know that this decision makes the 2016 election a referendum on the full repeal of Obamacare.""I have made repeal of this disastrous law a top priority since the first day I arrived in the Senate and have made its repeal central to my campaign. Any candidate not willing to do the sameand campaign on it every dayshould step aside.""The Court adopted the IRS\'s blatantly unlawful reading of the statute to make subsidies available to individuals on federal exchanges, when Congress expressly provided the opposite.""After today\'s ruling, Obamacare will now be responsible for imposing illegal taxes on more than 11 million individuals and for burdening hundreds of thousands of businesses with illegal penalties on their workers, killing jobs, and further slowing economic growth. President Obama\'s health care law remains deeply unpopular and is harming countless Americans by increasing costs and worsening the quality of care.""I remain fully committed to the repeal of Obamacareevery single word of it.

There is no equivalence between Israel\'s extraordinary efforts to protect civilians and Hamas\' use of the Palestinian people as human shields. Being party to any body that believes there is only perpetuates this injustice. The United States should stop legitimizing the UNHRC withour membership and withdraw now.""'"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Independence Day:""If you are like me and pay attention to the news every day, you can easily be overwhelmed by all the simultaneous events that seem to indicate an impending American decline. But I don\'t believe that. Everywhere I go, I see it in their faces and hear it in their voices. Americans want to believe again.""On this July 4th, I want to share with you my hope for America.""In the summer of 1776, Patriots gathered to dissolve the political bonds they had with England and declare their independence. The bold call for independence presupposed that the colonists were equal in station to the British Empire. They listed their grievances as justification for the split.""The fifty-six signers from the thirteen colonies affixed their signatures to the document. It could only mean one thing  war. Indeed, the American Revolution came.""Today, we live out the Founder\'s promise to America  that a free people pursuing their dreams would lead to limitless possibilities.""My father came to America from Cuba in 1957. He had very little money, and spoke little English. My Irish-Italian mother was the daughter of working class parents. Both my parents worked hard and were the first to graduate from college. In a single generation, their son became a United States Senator and now I am running for President of the United States. That could only happen in America.""What I understand is that story is not unique. Most Americans have a similar story in their family history.""These stories demonstrate how America is truly the land of limitless opportunity. The Fourth of July always reminds me of the opportunity America gave my family, and I ask myself, \'What have I done today to ensure that same opportunity exists for future generations?\' We\'re an exceptional nation, and it is up to each of us to keep it that way.""Happy Fourth!""'"

Kerry Leave Vienna ImmediatelyHOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement regarding the disastrous nuclear deal the Obama Administration is trying to make with Iran:""It is time to acknowledge that the Iran talks have been a disaster. Today I am calling upon former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose leadership this bad deal began, and other Presidential candidates to join me in demanding that Secretary Kerry stop negotiating with this hostile and violent enemy of America and immediately leave Vienna.""We are now on the eve of what is by my count the fifth \'deadline\' for a comprehensive nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is still unclear if this arbitrary date will be more respected than any of its predecessors, but it hardly matters at this point. By any metric, the negotiations have failedat least from the perspective of America\'s national security. All of our key prioritiesstopping enrichment of uranium, removing stockpiles of enriched uranium, and exposing and eradicating the potential military applications of Iran\'s nuclear programhave been ceded to the Iranians.""Perhaps there was some hope for this process two years ago when Hasan Rouhani became president of Iran. Given Iran\'s dire economic circumstances caused by the unprecedented program of international sanctions, we could have demanded concessions from the mullahs before any negotiations took placenotably the release of all Americans unjustly held in Iran and the recognition of Israel\'s right to exist as a Jewish state. Once negotiations began, we could have made it clear the above conditions would have to be met before sanctions relief. And rather than stove-piping Iran\'s nuclear program from its abysmal human rights record, aggressive state sponsorship of terrorism and ballistic missile programthe only purpose of which is to deliver a nuclear weaponwe should have insisted these issues be addressed to our satisfaction as well.""Unfortunately, in their unseemly eagerness to make a deal, President Obama and Secretary Kerry have squandered all our advantages and ceded all our priorities. There is no possibility for an acceptable agreement at this point because there is no incentive for the Iranians to make one. Our first priority must be to end this farce; the best we can do is cut our losses.""'"

Congress should immediately begin an investigation of Planned Parenthood\'s activities regarding the sale and transfer of aborted body parts, including who is obtaining them and what they are being used for.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran:""Today, the international community ledby the United States has agreed to not only legitimize and perpetuate the Iranian nuclear program, but also to further arm and enrich the brutal theocratic regime that has oppressed the Iranian people for more than thirty years  a regime that is wrongfully holding United States citizens captive, that is sponsoring radical Islamic terrorism across the globe, and that regularly promotes the destruction of both Israel and America throughout its streets.""Despite these facts, it seems President Obama would concede almost anything to get any deal  even a terrible deal  from the Islamic Republic of Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Under the terms of this deal, Iran will retain all of its centrifuges, one-third of which will continue to spin. Rather than the most intrusive inspections regime in history that we were promised, IAEA inspectors must petition the mullahs to visit sensitive sites, and wait for two weeks for their permission. In a final, shocking concession, the United States will support lifting of the United Nations arms embargos that restrict the Iranian ballistic missile program and arms trafficking. And in return, billions of dollars of economic relief will flow to Tehran.""Yet, in his remarks this morning, the President glossed over the truth about Iran\'s world-leading state-sponsorship of terrorism that is violently destabilizing the region, and would grow more deadly should the Iranians get a nuclear bomb. He failed to mention American citizens, Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, who continue to languish in Iranian prisons or Robert Levinson, who is still unaccounted for. For them, today is no \'opportunity to move in a new direction\' as the President claimed. We owe it to our fellow Americans to elevate, not ignore, their plight, to demand their swift and unconditional release by the implacably hostile regime that holds them.""Even by the low standards of the Joint Plan of Action, this is a staggeringly bad deal. It is a fundamental betrayal of the security of the United States and of our closest allies, first and foremost Israel.""But thankfully, it is not a done deal. We still have an opportunity to tell the truth about what Prime Minister Netanyahu called today a \'bad mistake of historic proportion.\'""Congress will have 60 days to review it, and the American people will have 60 days to tell their elected representatives just what they think of it. I urge all my fellow citizens to speak out and let their elected leaders know that even if President Obama won\'t see it, we know the leaders of the Islamic Republic who lead crowds in chants of \'Death to America\' and \'Death to Israel\' are not our partners in peace, and must not be put on the path to a nuclear bomb.""'"

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in response to yesterday\'s act of terror in Chattanooga, Tennessee:""Yesterday, members of our armed services in Chattanooga, Tennessee, went to work in the service of our nation. Some went to a recruiting center to assist the young people who, like so many before them, would walk through the door on any given Thursday morning and volunteer to defend the United States of America. Four brave Marines went to a Naval Reserve Center to perform their duties to the Tennessee National Guard.""But one of the young people who visited two of those facilities was not like the others. He was there not to volunteer to serve America, but to attack America. Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was there to carry out jihad, an act of radical Islamic terrorism. An act of war, in which those four brave Marines lost their lives, while at least two others were wounded.""In the wake of this vicious attack on our nation we need to rid ourselves of two dangerous delusions, first and foremost that a \'lone gunman\'as President Obama described the shooteris somehow isolated from the larger threat of radical Islamic terrorism. In the modern world, no one acts in isolation. Through social media ISIS, al Qaida, and other groups are infiltrating our nation with impunity while our government will not even admit that radical Islamic terrorism is a problem.""The second delusion is that this attack is somehow isolated from previous episodes, notably those in Little Rock, Arkansas and Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009both of which were attacks on American military facilities. The Obama administration was woefully reluctant to call either an act of radical Islamic terrorism, instead suggesting \'workplace violence\' as a justification for the killings. Finally, after years of effort, the victims of Fort Hood were properly recognized as victims of attacks by foreign terrorists when they received Purple Hearts on April 15, 2015. Likewise, the victim of the Little Rock attack received a Purple Heart on July 1, 2015.""We cannot afford to wait six years to recognize what happened in Chattanooga for what it was. We need to see with clarity right now what has happened. We can immediately hold hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee on the need for our enlisted men and women to have the right to be armed in military facilities. Congress can pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act that would allow our government to stop Americans who travel overseas to train with terrorist groups from coming back to attack us at home. We can thoroughly overhaul our broken immigration system that is allowing this type of individual to gain citizenship. And we can accept the reality that while we might wish it otherwise, the forces of radical Islam are at war with us.""'"

However, the Court\'s decision that SB 14 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is profoundly disappointing.""There is nothing \'discriminatory\' about a law that protects the legitimate votes of American citizens and promotes the integrity of our elections  which is precisely what Texas\' common sense Voter ID Law does.""I\'m encouraged to hear that Governor Abbott intends to continue fighting to combat voter fraud to ensure that the vote of every Texan counts.""As Texas Solicitor General, Sen.

In light of recent attacks against police officers, specifically Deputy Sheriff Darren H. Goforth in his hometown of Houston, Sen. Cruz is calling for leadership to stand up against the assault on law enforcement across our country:""We stand with our police officers, we stand with our fire fighters, with our EMS, with our first responders. These are brave men and women who risk their lives keeping us safe. We are seeing a manifestation of the rhetoric and vilification of law enforcement that is coming from the top  all the way to the President of the United States and senior administration officials.""Cops across this country are feeling the assault. They\'re feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down as we see, whether it\'s in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the President, of the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.""I\'m proud to stand with law enforcement, to stand with the police and fire fighters and first responders. They are American heroes. And they need a President who doesn\'t attack and vilify them and who doesn\'t seek to tear us apart along racial lines to inflame racial divisions. Instead we need a President who works to bring us together and unify us behind shared American values.""'"

I stand with every American that the Obama Administration is trying to force to choose between honoring his or her faith or complying with a lawless court opinion.""In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts rightly observed that the Court\'s marriage opinionhas nothing to do with the Constitution. Justice Scalia observed that the Court\'s opinionwas so contrary to law that state and local officials would choose to defy it.""For every politician  Democrat and Republican  who is tut-tutting that Davis must resign, they are defending a hypocritical standard. Where is the call for the mayor of San Francisco to resign for creating a sanctuary city  resulting in the murder of American citizens by criminal illegal aliens welcomed by his lawlessness?""Where is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws, our welfare reform laws, and even his own Obamacare?""When the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.""Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office. That is the consequence of their position. Or, if Christians do serve in public office, they must disregard their religious faithor be sent to jail.""Kim Davis should not be in jail. We are a country founded on Judeo-Christian values, founded by those fleeing religious oppression and seeking a land where we could worship God and live according to our faith, without being imprisoned for doing so.""I call upon every Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis.

To the teacher, law enforcement officer, civil servant, factory worker, and countless others, I say thank you. Thank you for working daily to provide for your family, to contribute to our economy, and to keep America strong.""We should foster a robust economy, and stop stifling growth and opportunity. Under the Obama economy, we have seen the lowest labor force participation since the late 1970s. Families, small businesses, minorities, and young people are being crushed by rising premiums and fewer good-paying jobs due to Obamacare, vast costs from new agency regulations, and a byzantine tax code. Manufacturing has steadily declined during Obama\'s presidency, and the industriousness that has empowered workers and pioneered innovation is fading under his watch.""But with strong Presidential leadership, we can turn things around quickly: we can eliminate onerous regulations, repeal Obamacare, simplify the tax code, and welcome job creation in every sector  from energy to manufacturing to agriculture.

The United States has a long history of response to humanitarian disasters and this should be no exception. Our immediate role should be to support our regional allies who are on the front lines through public and private assistance to the international organizations who are best poised to administer aid.""In terms of settling the migrants, if the ultimate goal is to return them to their homes, which I believe it should be, it doesn\'t make sense from a logistical or a security standpoint to move large numbers of them to far-off countries like the United States.""Ultimately, we need to address the cause of this crisis or we will just have more and more migrants displaced.""Bad actors like Turkey\'s Erdogan and Russia\'s Putin, both of whom have contributed tangentially to this crisis, announced this week that the West is to blame. This is disingenuous at best. The blame should be laid squarely at the door of the vicious, radical Islamism that is tearing communities apart from Libya to Syria and Iraq, creating the terrible circumstances that are causing the migrants to flee their homes. The failure of the United States has been an unwillingness to name and confront this threat.""The regime in Tehran and their proxies may be Shiite and ISIS and its affiliates Sunni, but they are the cause of this problem. They are branches of the same poisonous tree  radical Islamism. Until we recognize the threat from this savage, twisted totalitarian ideology and develop a coherent strategy to combat it, we will at best be putting a Band-Aid onto a life-threatening wound.""'"

The worst terrorist attack on our homeland taught us two things: that our oceans would not protect us from a determined enemy in the 21st century, and that radical Islamic terrorism was not a regional annoyance with limited capacity, but a real and present danger to our very way of life.""Today, we remember the victims: the people in the twin towers of the World Trade Center, that emblem of America\'s economic power, and the first responders who charged in to save them. The military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon working to keep our country safe. The innocent passengers on those four doomed flights, some of whom heroically sacrificed themselves to minimize the casualties on the ground.""But as we pause in their honor, we must also look forward. The hard fact of the matter is that today, we again face a gathering threat from radical Islamists who may have changed their name or affiliation, but who are unchanged in their determination to degrade, and ultimately destroy, the West.""Today, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism is still very much as real as it was fourteen years ago. From Nidal Hassan yelling \'Allahu Akbar\' before he murdered fourteen innocent people in Ft. Hood, Texas, to the Boston marathon bombings, a beheading in Oklahoma, and the attack in Chattanooga that left four marines and a sailor dead.""September 11th, 2015 should be more than a day of reflection and remembrance. It should be an opportunity to resolve that we will not allow political correctness or complacency to lull us into the same false sense of security that al Qaida exploited fourteen years ago. We owe it to the memory of those whose lives were lost to squarely face the ongoing, virulent threat of radical Islamic terrorism, unafraid to call it what it is, as we defend ourselves and the founding principles that make America the greatest force for good in the world.""'"

On this holiday, we remember the miracle that enabled a freedom-loving people  led by the heroic Maccabees  to defeat the oppressive dictator Antiochus so that they could once again freely worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the eight days of Chanukah, the Jewish people commemorate their liberation from oppression and the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. As the Talmud teaches, God delivered \'many into the hands of the few, strong into the hands of the weak, and evildoers into the hands of the righteous.\'""Today, the Jewish people, together with freedom-loving people around the world, once again find their religious faith and liberty under attack from radical forces of oppression and intolerance. Whether it is the BDS movement on college campuses, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, or radical Islamic terror in Israel and around the world, we need modern-day Maccabees to stand together and push back against the forces of evil. As a nation founded by a people seeking religious liberty, America stands with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in protecting the light of faith and liberty.""The victory of the people of Israel is a testament to God\'s providence. On these nights when Jewish families around the country and the world celebrate with latkes, lighting the menorah, and playing dreidel, Heidi and I join with you to recognize, \'Nes Gadol Hayah Sham,\' a great miracle happened there. We only need look at our nation\'s heritage to know that great miracles have happened here too, \'Nes Gadol Hayah Po,\' and will continue to happen with God\'s blessing.

Ted Cruz,R,s,"December 6, 2015","b""Statement by Senator Ted Cruz in Advance of the President's Address""","b'Statement by Ted Cruz in Advance of President Obama\'s White House AddressHOUSTON, Texas  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz released the following statement in advance of President Obama\'s White House address:The recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino have further confirmed that radical Islamic terrorists are at war with the West. The attack in San Bernardino was the worst Islamic terrorist attack on American soil since the attack on Ft. Hood in my home state of Texas.At the time of that attack, the President insisted that it was a case of ""workplace violence"" ignoring the clear evidence that it was a terrorist attack. I was proud to have been able to help ensure that each of the victims of the Ft. Hood attack finally received a Purple Heart for their sacrifice.The reality is that what President Obama, Secretary Kerry and Hillary Clinton have done has not worked. Their policies have in fact made the world more dangerous. It is time for a dramatic shift in both foreign and national security policy.Tonight when President Obama addresses the nation, I hope that he will acknowledge and take responsibility for the failed policies of his administration and will take concrete steps to reverse the damage done.He should start by finally calling our enemy by its name. Denying who the enemy is will only delay their defeat. The terrorists call themselves the Islamic State. So tonight, I challenge President Obama to finally acknowledge the enemy that the United States and our allies face. It is radical Islamic terrorism.Second, after naming our enemy, the President should lay out a bold strategy to defeat ISIS, not to try to change the subject to gun control or the compliant media headline to global warming, but rather lay out a plan for decisive action for victory over evil.Third, Americans want to know how this administration intends to keep them safe here at home. Border security is national security. We can no longer accept a border that is not secure and the President should announce the immediate steps he will take to ensure that it is.We now know that one of the attackers was here on a visa. She went through the same background checks that the President says the refugees from Syria will go through. We also know that ISIS has made it clear that they intend to infiltrate the refugees in order to get to the United States. That can\'t happen.The President should place an immediate moratorium on refugees from countries with a significant al Qaeda or ISIS presence, such as Syria. I\'ve introduced legislation to make this happen; it is not a desired step, but a necessary step for the security of the United States.Finally, the President should resist using terrorist attacks to try to take away the rights of law-abiding Americans. Millions of Americans have chosen to protect themselves and their families by purchasing a firearm. This is their right; indeed protecting their families is their obligation. The President should be looking to stop those who would do us harm  not attempting to take away the constitutional liberties of millions of innocent Americans.The American people know that the threat is very real. They will be looking for the President to address restoring America\'s role in the world, defeating ISIS, securing the border, and keeping them safe from radical Islamic terrorism here at home.They want to know the specific steps the President intends to take to keep them safe.We need American leadership, and we need America winning again. The world does as well.I look forward to the President\'s remarks.'"

A day that took more than 2,000 of our service members and citizens. A day that set aflame Pearl Harbor. A day that ended any hope that the United States could avoid entering the carnage of World War II.Americans rose courageously against the threat to our freedom. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared war on Japan the very next day  before Congress, he spoke for the nation: ""No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.""Some four years later, our ""righteous might""  rooted in a strong adherence to Divine order and consecrated through the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans  defeated the forces who sought to extinguish our liberty.Today, as we commemorate the brave souls who died that December morning 74 years ago, the memory is particularly prescient. Just shy of a week ago, the modern evil of radical Islamic terrorism penetrated the city of San Bernardino and murdered 14 innocent civilians. Though the circumstances are different, the need is ever present to remain a people of righteous might: for good against evil, for strength in the midst of uncertainty, and for an ever greater resolve to always protect the ideals that have made this nation a land worth defending.'"

That same hope illuminates each soul, guides us through uncertainty, and reminds us to share in His everlasting joy.""America\'s grateful and generous spirit is still very much alive throughout our cities and towns. Thousands of families participate in Salvation Army\'s annual Angel Tree program, bringing Christmas cheer to children who otherwise may not receive a gift. Wreaths Across America partners with local businesses, volunteers, and organizations to lay memorial wreaths at hundreds of locations  including 230,000 wreaths honoring our fallen heroes at Arlington Cemetery. And communities across the country continue to launch local efforts to serve their neighbors. To take one example, in Cloverdale, Indiana the police department partnered with high school FFA students to host a Christmas celebration, providing gifts to more than 600 children and serving meals to 146 families. These are just a few of the countless acts of charity in our midst.""Families, churches, and communities continue to bring the light of Christ to our fellow citizens. Heidi and I are grateful for Americans\' generosity, and most of all, we are thankful for God\'s willingness to send His Son to us.

We have had at least eight ISIS inspired attacks on innocent Americans, including law enforcement, yet he refuses to acknowledge the root of the cause of these attacks, radical Islamic terrorism. Our military needs greater support and the economy only works for those in Washington.""The President gives lip service to ""We the People"" yet has rejected the entire idea of a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people.""

No judge, president, or lawmaker has any authority to disregard life as knit together by God. We should instead embrace life as a precious gift from God and do everything within our power to defend the most vulnerable among us. This is a question of national character, and an opportunity for families, churches, and communities to stand united and restore the promise of the Declaration.""Millions of Americans recognize the fundamental right to life, and they have fought tirelessly to rectify this injustice and defend the unborn. Their heroic efforts continue to speak the truth in love and make great strides in restoring the sanctity of life throughout the 50 states. I thank them for their unwavering stand for life. Together, we will bend the arc of history towards justice.""In light of both Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the Roe v. Wade anniversary this week, Ted Cruz penned an op-ed in The Resurgent. See excerpt below:""We cannot neglect the current climb towards justice for all  especially for children.""Just five years after Reverend King\'s death, another grave injustice stained our nation. The Supreme Court ruled that unborn children have no right to life. That decision defied the very essence of freedom  without life, there is no liberty. Without life, there is no pursuit of happiness. Yet, since Roe v. Wade, that right has been snatched away from 56 million unborn children.""As Reverend King\'s niece, Dr. Alveda King, has rightly stated: \'Abortion and racism are evil twins, born of the same lie.\' The lie that there is no inherent worth in humanity. The lie that some people do not deserve the chance to become the next musicians, scientists, architects, leaders, and service members. The lie that not every life is equally valuable to our Creator.""This is the lie that Reverend King devoted his life to not simply dispelling, but to displaying to the world its utter perversion. He did so powerfully  with grace and conviction. Today, we are called to do the same with any degradation of human dignity.""This week, as thousands gather from across the country to march for life, passing those same steps upon which Martin Luther King, Jr. stood, let us remember his call: \'Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God\'s children.\'""May we honor this noble wish by cherishing each life  born and unborn  and by working tirelessly to defend those who cannot defend themselves.

And we honor the heroism of the Jewish people  and all those who were persecuted  their courage will always reverberate throughout the world.""Just last week, it was reported that the Israeli citizen and Holocaust survivor Yisrael Kristal is thought to be the world\'s oldest living person. It\'s a testament to his incredible fortitude, and to that of so many survivors, and we should seize every opportunity to learn from these living witnesses of that dark chapter in human history. Last year I was honored to spend time with Elie Wiesel and his wife Marion. We spoke about his experiences during the war, what it was like rebuilding his life after all had been destroyed, and the importance of American leadership in the global war against jihad. On the eve of Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s address to Congress, I was proud to co-host an event with Mr. Wiesel to shed light on the threat of a nuclear Iran to Israel and the United States.""Israel is an everlasting beacon of the faith and strength of the Jewish people. The people of Israel have rebuilt and rededicated the land to justice, freedom, and tolerance. The State of Israel not only welcomes the Jewish people, but also protects vulnerable minorities in the Middle East. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim holy sites are well protected under Israel\'s domain. We shudder to think what would happen to the Church of Holy Sepulchre in an East Jerusalem under the control of Hamas.""As we honor the memory of the six million, we must rededicate our efforts to fighting tyranny and jihad around the world, to combatting anti-Semitism  whether in Europe or on our own college campuses, and to preventing Iran\'s Ayatollah Khamenei, or any other dictator, from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. We must defeat evil with truth and resolve  and that begins with honoring the brave survivors and victims so that together we ensure that never again does such an atrocity occur.""'"

Because of Reagan\'s vision and resolve, the Iron Curtain became the ash heap of history. Freedom again overcame the stronghold that sought to extinguish it. As it always will.""The world is more free and prosperous because of President Reagan\'s courage to speak the truth and defy the norms of Washington. And today, as I join my fellow Republican candidates on the debate stage in New Hampshire, we are reminded of when then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan came to New Hampshire 36 years ago. He was the underdog despised by the Washington establishment and dismissed by the media. He was thought to be 15 to 20 points behind, but the people in the Granite State propelled him into first place and against all odds he went on to win the nomination. Right now, we face a similar time for choosing, and if we once again unite to stand courageously for freedom, prosperity, and security, we can once again ignite the promise of America.""'"

And he authored some of the most important decisions ever, includingDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, which recognized our fundamental right under the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. He was an unrelenting defender of religious liberty, free speech, federalism, the constitutional separation of powers, and private property rights. All liberty-loving Americans should be in mourning.""Justice Scalia\'s three decades on the Court was one of President Reagan\'s most consequential legacies.

We do not have to bring terrorists to our shoresto prove how enlightened we are. The fact is that GTMO is an indispensible detention facility for radical Islamists who wanted to kill us before 9/11, who tried to kill us on 9/11, and who will go back to trying to kill us if we release them or bring them here. Just last week there were media reports that Ibrahim al Qosi, an inmate released by the Obama administration in 2012 to Sudan, has taken up arms again as a top al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula commander. We have to stop giving these terrorists additional opportunities to wage jihad against us.""It is laughable to think that the most spendthrift president in our history has suddenly become a fiscal conservative over the money we spend to detain the worst of the worst at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Make no mistake: he\'s not doing this to save taxpayer dollars. He\'s doing this to satisfy his far-left-wing base who won\'t even? utter the term \'radical Islamic terrorism,\' let alone admit it is a problem.""GTMO is not a bargaining chip the president can use in his dangerous game of rapprochement with Fidel and Raul Castro. It has been a key American strategic asset for more than a century. The detention facility is only the most recent of a series of vital functions it has filled, and it is a necessary tool that we should be using to protect our country. As President Reagan famously said of the Panama Canal, we built it, we paid for it, it\'s ours and we\'re going to keep it. We cannot allow President Obama to abandon it simply to pursue his foolhardy ideological fantasies. Our commander-in-chief has abandoned his duty to safeguard our homeland. Congress must now do what is necessary to keep the American people safe.""Sen. Cruz has introduced or supported the following legislative efforts to prevent the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention center:Sen. Cruz introduced legislation (S. 2510) in 2014 to temporarily ban the transfer of detainees until the details of the Taliban 5 transfer were explained. The bill would also have required each transfer receive the personal approval of the President, instead of delegating responsibility for national security and detainee recidivism to the Secretary of Defense.Sen. Cruz introduced an amendment to the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act that would have prohibited the transfer of detainees to those countries which the State Department deems unsafe for American citizens and are therefore issued travel warnings. There were exceptions to this for travel warnings that were issued for medical, natural disaster, or criminal reasons.Sen. Cruz introduced an amendment to the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act to authorize the Department of Defense to transport medical supplies and required personnel to GTMO for any medical care. While this amendment did not pass, it further demonstrated Sen. Cruz\'s commitment to keep detainees at GTMO.Sen. Cruz is also a cosponsor of S. 165  the Detaining Terrorist to Protect America Act of 2015, and was a cosponsor to a FY2016 amendment by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) to prohibit the transfer of detainees to Yemen which was adopted in the final Defense Authorization Act of 2016.Addionally, Cruz opposed the release of detainees from GTMO in:AJune 9, 2014floor speechopposing on Cruz legislation regarding Prohibition on Transfer of GTMO Detainees;AJune 18, 2014 letterto Majority Leader Harry Reid;AJune 19, 2014 letterto President Obama;An op-ed titled ""President Obama, How Does Releasing Terrorists Make Us Safer?"".'"

Ted Cruz,R,s,"March 23, 2016",b'Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on the One-Year Anniversary of the Cruz for President Campaign',"b'One year anniversary of launch of the Cruz for President CampaignHOUSTON, Texas- Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz today released the following statement celebrating the one year anniversary of the launch of the Cruz for President Campaign on March 23, 2015:""One year ago today, we launched our presidential campaign. We did so because we still believe in the promise of America - and we believe it is far from extinguished. Heidi and I want our daughters, and your sons and daughters, to have the same opportunities that our parents and grandparents had; for anyone to be able to pursue their aspirations and achieve the unimaginable.""A year after our announcement, this much is certain: in 302 days, President Obama will depart the White House. On that day we will have a new President of the United States, and if Republicans, conservatives, and Americans who care about the future of our country unite, it will be the beginning of a new era of freedom, prosperity, and security.""We will no longer have to imagine rising wages and students coming out of school with three, four, or five job offers; we will adopt a simple flat tax, abolish the IRS, repeal Obamacare, and unleash unprecedented opportunity.""Nor will we be left to imagine a president who protects all our constitutional rights - I will champion every right, starting with the right to life.""And when it comes to national security, a strong America won\'t be a distant hope; it will be made real through rebuilding our military strength and leading with moral clarity. We will not bow down to political correctness; we will call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and we will defeat ISIS.""That is the promise we are one year closer to setting in motion.""It\'s been an unforgettable year, but not because of any single candidate. But because of the millions of Americans who have risen up to take this country back, and I want to thank you for standing courageously for morning in America.""If we continue to unite, this time next year a conservative revolution will be underway. No longer will taxpayers be beholden to Congress\' plush deals for special interests; instead Washington will work for you. And the only place where we\'ll shrink the cash flow is inside the beltway so that small businesses, families, and communities from coast to coast can once again flourish.""'"
Ted Cruz,R,s,"March 25, 2016",b'Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on Good Friday and Easter',"b'Good Friday and Easter StatementHOUSTON, Texas - Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz today released the following statement on Good Friday and in advance of Easter Sunday.""This weekend, Christians of every denomination remember the most transformative event in history - Christ\'s crucifixion and resurrection - the ultimate sacrifice that redeemed the whole world.""The light of Christ brings hope to every corner of the world. This year Heidi and I pray that in the wake of the Brussels attack, as we mourn for the victims who lost their lives in the subway tunnels and airport corridors at the hands of baseless terrorists, we will remember that the light of truth is stronger than the darkness of terror.""I am reminded of Saint John Paul II\'s first return to Poland as Pope. In 1979, upon his arrival, he kissed the tarmac. And the dust that had all but covered the churches ruptured as the bells rang out - one after another. Soon millions of people lined the streets. And when Saint John Paul II addressed the crowds before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he spoke these immortal words: \'On how many battlefields has that solider given witness to the rights of man, indelibly inscribed in the inviolable rights of the people, by falling for \'our freedom and yours\'!\'""And he asked for the Lord\'s blessing upon the land:\'Let your Spirit descend.And renew the face of the earth,the face of this land.\'""That is the redemption message. By His sacrifice we are made new. And as we remember the gift of salvation on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, let us be so bold to ask the same. We face a different enemy than in 1979 - but one with the same goal - to snuff out the light of freedom. But we also know that just like Communism in 1980 it can be defeated because good overcomes evil, truth illuminates the world, and freedom breaks the bondage of tyranny.""'"

We must redouble our resolve to band with friends and allies to defeat it. Our prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Pakistan.""'"

On the important issue of the sanctity of life, what\'s far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply about the unborn child; it\'s also about the mother  and creating a culture that respects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn\'t be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world.""'"

Given the presence of hostile terrorist organizations ranging from ISIS to Hezbollah on Israel\'s northern border, it is foolhardy and dangerous for elements in the international community to try to pressure Israel to abandon the Golan to the chaos engulfing Syria. The path to peace cannot involve Israel\'s abdication of its own security.""I applaud Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s courage in standing up for the safety of his people.

That\'s the latest in a string of Obamacare failures that have led to American families losing their doctors, having few or no insurance options, and facing skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.""Sadly, none of this comes as a surprise. Conservatives predicted this result years ago, and yet here we are: with health insurance that is worse and costs more, with a system that kills jobs and lowers paychecks, and with a federal government that stands between Americans and their doctors.""Strikingly, this slow-rolling catastrophe has been lost on the other two Republicans in the presidential race: one who actually expanded Obamacare as governor, and the other who wants to go further than Obamacare and implement universal health care. Both John Kasich and Donald Trump would dig the country deeper into the Obamacare hole.""That\'s why I have consistently opposed Obamacare and will begin the process of repealing and replacing this disastrous law from the first days of my administration as President. We literally cannot afford to have Obama\'s signature failure continue to drag down our economy, destroy what\'s left of our health care market, and punish American families. I will repeal Obamacare and replace it with health care that\'s personal, portable, and affordable, and stops getting in between patients and their doctors.""'"

ISIS is on the march and radical Islamic terrorists seek to destroy the Jewish culture and western way of life. Earlier this week, we witnessed terror strike again on the streets of Jerusalem. But we rest in the confidence that the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses continues to watch over those who seek Him.""As we celebrate the gift of Passover, we give thanks for the Lord\'s promise in Exodus: Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.\'""'"

Mr. Trump owes a full and immediate accounting to members of the media and the American public. Mr. Trump must confirm or deny reports in the media that others in the Washington Cartel\'s industry of foreign policy for personal gain were involved in the drafting of this address  indeed, were the principal authors. In addition to the authors of the speech, he must fully identify the role and involvement of Mr. Manafort who is widely recognized for his entanglements with corrupt foreign regimes and anti-Democratic rulers.""This speech is the most dramatic evidence thus far that Donald Trump fails the presidential test. With this address he is now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists, even as he proclaims ""America first,"" he puts K Street lobbyists first. He is never going to fight the system, he is the system. He and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. She has made her millions from inside and Donald Trump has made his billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. Both are part of the culture of foreign policy for personal gain.""'"
