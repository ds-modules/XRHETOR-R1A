Mike Huckabee,R,c,"February 11, 2007","b'Interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News\' ""This Week""'","b'Stephanopoulos began by asking Huckabee what ""paradoxical Republican"" means. HUCKABEE: It means that I take sides of issues that I think people don\'t expect Republicans necessarily to join up with. For example, one of my real passions is music and art in the curriculum of students. And when I talk about that and talk about it with the kind of passion that I do, people say, ""Are you a Republican?"" as if Republicans don\'t like music. There\'s such a value in developing both the left and right sides of the brain. And yet there\'s this perception that Republicans sort of stay away from the arts. Well, I want to prove them to be wrong. STEPHANOPOULOS: What\'s your favorite song? HUCKABEE: Oh, don\'t ask that because then you start getting me into stuff, which artist. It\'s going to most likely be a Mellencamp or Rolling Stones or Beatles song. Maybe Creedence. But can you tell, it\'s got to be heavy guitar music in there? STEPHANOPOULOS: Heavy guitar, but you\'re not going to choose your real politician.Here\'s what your critics say, though. HUCKABEE: OK. STEPHANOPOULOS: They say you\'re not paradoxical... HUCKABEE: You mean I have some? STEPHANOPOULOS: A few, a few. HUCKABEE: OK. STEPHANOPOULOS: They say you\'re heretical. They look at your record in Arkansas and say: Gas taxes went up. HUCKABEE: Yes. STEPHANOPOULOS: Cigarette taxes went up. The sales tax went up. Spending skyrocketed during your two plus terms as governor. HUCKABEE: We cut 90 taxes during the time I was governor. We eliminated the marriage penalty. We doubled the child care tax credit. We incomed -- indexed the income tax for inflation so that people wouldn\'t be caught in tax brackets they shouldn\'t be paying. We lifted the threshold over which people pay taxes -- the first broad-based tax cut in the history. We cut capital gains tax. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you did raise those other taxes. HUCKABEE:Well, here\'s what we did. On the gas tax, yes. You know what we did? We put it on the ballot. And 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for those fuel taxes because they wanted better roads. I wanted better roads. I have no apology for building better roads in the state, creating 40,000 jobs in the process of doing it, and taking our roads from what Truckers magazine said were the worst in the country to the most improved in the country. That\'s economic development. STEPHANOPOULOS: So taxes aren\'t always the root of all evil? HUCKABEE: Well, you know, when people say we shouldn\'t have any taxes, you know what? When you dial 911 and your house is on fire, you want a fire truck to come. Guess what pays for it? Taxes. What Americans don\'t want is unfair, unnecessary, exceptionally high taxes where the money is wasted. But Americans understand that, if you have the garbage pickup, or the fire trucks and police cars out there, or for that matter if you have a highway, then it\'s got to be paid for. STEPHANOPOULOS: So how does that extend, then, to the job you\'ll have to do as president? You know, a lot of your opponents in this race are signing this pledge -- the Americans for Tax Reform taxpayer protection pledge -- basically saying we\'re going to oppose any effort to increase the income tax. You haven\'t signed it. Do you think it\'s a gimmick? HUCKABEE: It\'s not necessarily a gimmick, and I may decide I will sign it. But, right now, what I want to make sure is that I don\'t assign something that says that if we had a catastrophic incident, a world war, which I think we\'re in the middle of or at least in the beginnings of already, I don\'t want to put myself in a box and make a pledge to an interest group that isn\'t really as sacred as the pledge that I would make to the people of the country to uphold the Constitution. Stephanopoulos: You talk about the fact that you believe we\'re in World War III right now... HUCKABEE: I do.  Stephanopoulos: ... in your speech earlier. [Clip of Huckabee: We do have a war -- a world war that is on fire and we have to recognize that the next president must face that and must face it clearly and must understand its theological base.] How do you fight a worldwide religious war without turning it into a 21st century crusade? HUCKABEE: I think you have to be very careful that we don\'t think that our goal is to take our religion and impose it on somebody else. That\'s not what this war is about. But we have to understand it from the point of the Islamic fascists who really would like to annihilate us. I think you have to take seriously that this is, at heart, an effort where they believe that God has put them on this planet so that they will bring a complete cleansing of all the infidels -- which they consider us to be. And the only cleansing that can really be done is not to isolate us to our part of the world, but is to annihilate us. That\'s why this is such a more dangerous situation. STEPHANOPOULOS: So how does the president combat that? HUCKABEE: Well, I think part of it has to happen from that we don\'t combat it by ourselves. There\'s got to be a sense in which the balance of moderate Muslims will have to take a more visible and, frankly, vocal role in bringing a sense of balance and sanity within the Islamic community. STEPHANOPOULOS: But how do we encourage that? HUCKABEE: We encourage it by the same way that we saw a lot of things happen that changed to Soviet Union -- when they realized we\'re not monsters, when they realized that we really aren\'t out to destroy them. There are many of the true Muslim people that don\'t want a world war. They don\'t want a war -- a war in a world where, every day, somebody has to just be vaporized. We have to hope that that takes hold within those communities themselves. STEPHANOPOULOS: George Will says voters this year are going to hold candidates to what he calls the seven-minute test. [Clip of George Will: ""Nightmare scenario. You\'re the security advisor. You\'re awakened in the middle of the night. You have three minutes to get the details of an attack coming on the United States. Then the president, who you notify, has four minutes to answer. That\'s seven minutes. Which candidate fits the seven minute question?] How can you convince voters that you\'re the candidate to pass that test? You\'ve only served as governor of Arkansas. HUCKABEE: I have. Ronald Reagan had been an actor and had been governor of California. Bill Clinton had only been governor of Arkansas. Democrats... STEPHANOPOULOS: This is the post-9/11 world where we\'re in World War III, by your admission. HUCKABEE: It is, but it still is the same type of situation where what you really have in the case of a leader is not so much where he\'s been, but what his operating system is; what his judgment is. Does he handle crisis? Can he assimilate facts quickly and, then, can he communicate? And is he decisive? These are qualities, I think, that come from being a governor. STEPHANOPOULOS: What is the closest you have you have ever come? What\'s the most difficult question you\'ve ever had to handle that is even close to responding to an attack on the... HUCKABEE: Well, I think there have been several that -- nothing is close, maybe, to world war, but when Katrina hit the Gulf shore, we had 75,000 evacuees that came to Arkansas. Our population increased 3 percent in five days. We managed that in a way that most of the nation didn\'t know, but the ones who did marveled at it, because we didn\'t have the problems that many other states had in trying to assimilate all of these evacuees that came in suddenly, unexpectedly, and with nothing but -- literally -- the dirty, muddy clothes on their back. And we did it by bringing all of our resources together, marshalling the troops of both the public and private sectors, and taking charge of a situation where it was clear the federal government was in complete meltdown. STEPHANOPOULOS: I have looked at everything you said. I\'m actually having a hard time figuring out: Do you support the president\'s plan to send more troops to Iraq now or not? HUCKABEE: Well, what I try and say, George, is I support that the president has the right to make these decisions as commander in chief. We need to give him time to let it work. STEPHANOPOULOS: So if you were in the Senate, you\'d vote for the plan? HUCKABEE: I would give him a chance. You bet I would. But here\'s what I would also do. I would caution the president: Mr. President, you cannot continue to overstress these National Guard and Reserve troops. And that\'s what worries me. If we have a worn-out Army and we have a worn-out Reserve force, what do we do when something breaks loose in Iran, Russia, Venezuela, North Korea? STEPHANOPOULOS: So, then, the question is: How much time do we have? And you wrote in your book that we should set a timetable for the Iraqis. What would your timetable be? HUCKABEE: Well, I was careful not to say there should be a specific timetable. In fact, I\'ve said it\'s like a baseball game, not a football game. You can\'t put it on a specific clock. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you said you have to give the Iraqis a timetable for progress? HUCKABEE: We have to tell them, look; we\'re not going to be here indefinitely. What we\'re going to expect of you is, you\'re going to have to get control of this sectarian violence, this civil war that is just ripping this whole thing apart. Because the American people are not going to stay indefinitely. Now, when I say a timetable, I want to be very careful that you don\'t just say, OK, December 31, that\'s the last day; we start pulling out the helicopters and fly away. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you know, realistically, aren\'t we really on a timetable because of the political situation here at home? I think about -- we\'re, what, 11 months or so away from the New Hampshire primary. If the situation in Iraq doesn\'t improve by the time voters here go to the polls, won\'t they be clamoring for anti-war candidate? HUCKABEE: It all depends on how things go over the next year. If things continue to go with the sectarian violence, and the Sunnis and the Shias are just at each and bawling (ph) each other up, I think we\'re in for a very, very rugged season. And it\'s going to be tough, if somebody takes any position other than what, just, cut our losses and go. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let\'s talk about immigration. I was struck by something in USA Today this morning, a headline that says, ""Immigration Becomes KKK Rallying Point."" You\'ve said that you believe that there is some racism behind the immigration debate today. What did you mean by that? HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, I didn\'t mean that everybody who has some anxiety about immigration is a racist. And that was one of those things that suddenly blew up and people said, ""Oh, he accused us all of being racists."" Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are concerned. I\'m concerned. I\'m concerned that our borders are porous and we\'re allowing people to come in and out without any real check as to who they are, where they\'re going, why they\'re here, do they have a communicable disease or a criminal background? We need to know those things. I\'m not as worried about somebody who\'s coming across to pluck a chicken or pick a tomato or make a better Laquinta. I\'m particularly concerned about somebody who might cross this border with a shoulder-fired missile. But even those people who are coming to pluck chickens and pick tomatoes, frankly, I want them to come in an orderly way. I want them to cross the border legally. When I go to the Little Rock airport, I have to go through all kinds of hoops just to get on the airplane. Now, they know who I am. They all call me by name, but I still show a photo I.D. I take my shoes off, I take my computer out and I put on a different little basket. I get my jacket off and the whole deal. I don\'t mind that because that\'s the way I\'m supposed to get on the plane. But I go through several layers of security and authenticate my personhood with the proper documentation. I\'m a taxpaying U.S. citizen. I\'m a person who\'s been a public official, but I go through those layers... STEPHANOPOULOS: But you\'ve also said we\'re going to be judged by how we treat the illegals who are here right now. HUCKABEE: We shouldn\'t have amnesty where we just say, ""Fine, everybody\'s good, we\'re going to let it go."" We should have a process where people can pay the penalties, step up and accept responsibility for not being here legally. But here\'s the point. The objective is not to be punitive. The objective is to make things right. Right for us. Right for them. And what I have objected to in the past is when we are punishing the children for the laws that maybe their parents have broken. I do have a problem with that. STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney is considering saying that the children of illegal immigrants shouldn\'t automatically become citizens. What do you think about that? HUCKABEE: Maybe that should be looked at. I mean, if people are rushing across the border, illegally, delivering a baby and then saying, ""Whew, now we\'re here."" I think that\'s a little disingenuous to the concept of really being a naturally-born U.S. citizen. But it\'s not an issue that I have put a stake in the ground and said: This is how we ought to handle it. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you another question about Governor Romney. His religion, he\'s a Mormon, has become -- is going to become a big part of this campaign, clearly. You\'re a Southern Baptist, a former Southern Baptist preacher. And that denomination teaches, I believe, that Mormonism is a cult. How bit a hurdle is that going to be for Governor Romney in this campaign? HUCKABEE: Well, you know, I\'m not sure. And I don\'t know that anyone knows. What I can tell you is about my faith and what it means. And I think people ought to look at every person who runs for office and they ought to ask them questions about who they are and what they are about and what drives their decisions. I\'m not as troubled by a person who has a different faith. I\'m troubled by a person who tells me their faith doesn\'t influence their decisions. Because if a person says to me, ""Here\'s my faith, but it doesn\'t influence me at all,"" what it says to me is: ""My faith isn\'t very significant."" STEPHANOPOULOS: How does it influence yours? HUCKABEE: It totally drives it. It makes everything click for me. And that will explain to you why I have a passion for life. But it means that my pro-life position doesn\'t end at the birth canal; that I believe that life is more than a gestation period. I believe life begins at conception; I just don\'t think it ends at birth. And that\'s why, as a governor, I\'ve fourth hard to see children have medical insurance and decent schools and safe neighborhoods and drinking water and affordable housing, because that\'s consistent with me being pro-life. I don\'t want to see some single mom, you know, worry and struggle that she\'s not going to be able to have food for her kids. I don\'t want some wife to have the daylights beaten out of her by some abusive husband and have nowhere to turn. Those are things that are driven because of my faith. That\'s not a political position. It\'s a faith position. STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Giuliani said he hates abortion, but he\'s pro-choice. Is that position a game-ender in the Republican primaries? HUCKABEE: We\'ll find out in this election, it looks like, because it\'s going to be an issue that will clearly separate some of the candidates. But I\'m pro-life because I think it\'s consistent with who we are as an American people. We are a culture and a civilization that celebrates life. We cherish our children\'s lives. We grieve when they die. I think it is the great contrast between us and, frankly, the Islamic fascists, who would strap a bomb to their own children\'s chest and march them into a room full of innocent people and blow them up and then be proud of their children\'s martyrdom, and think somehow that that\'s a great thing and it\'s going to give them a special place in heaven. STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven\'t been shy about taking on pop culture. And I was just wondering, what did you think when you saw all these headlines this morning about Anna Nicole Smith? HUCKABEE: Tragic story. Two tragedies: One is a life of a person who obviously struggled for significance and found it in, really, the realm of pop culture. The other tragedy is that it, sort of, took everything else off the front pages and took all the oxygen out of the room. Here we are in the midst of Iraq and immigration and all the issues that people face, with whether they\'re going to have a job at the end of the week and whether their pension\'s going to be eaten up by some time white-collar criminal who will rob the company of the money and leave people with nothing who have built the wealth. And what\'s everybody fascinated by? How Anna Nicole Smith died. And it\'s a point of curiosity and I feel terrible for her family. Her life story is one that\'s filled with tragedy. But I\'m not sure that it\'s the number one news story on the planet Earth today. STEPHANOPOULOS: You really became known on the national scene when you lost 110 pounds. HUCKABEE: Yes. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was some claim to fame. Right now, Barack Obama is trying to quit smoking. So what advice can you give him? HUCKABEE: It\'s about the discipline and focus of saying, ""This is good for me and it\'s also an example for others."" I\'ve never smoked, so I don\'t understand the nicotine addiction. I know it\'s real. Too many people I\'ve known who have been smokers said it\'s more difficult than anything they\'ve ever dealt with. But, boy, it\'s a deadly habit. And there\'s not a thing about it that is healthy, good, wholesome or that brings about any sense of value. So it\'s something I hope that he will do, not just for himself and his family, he\'s got kids, so he needs to do it for them? But it\'d be a great thing to do for the country to say, ""I kicked it, so can you."" I hope he does. STEPHANOPOULOS: You said you had to learn to look at a plate of fried chicken and say, ""That\'s a threat, not a pleasure."" HUCKABEE: Yes, and it sort of erased all the things I\'d grown up with because when you grow up in the Deep South and you have food, kind of as your only major source of comfort, it\'s your security when you don\'t have many other points of security. It\'s real difficult and you have to break away and mentally understand what it is that drives you to those comfort foods. And once you realize it -- and that\'s really was for me, the breakthrough -- then, you can say: ""You know what? I don\'t have to have that anymore. There are better ways to be secure."" STEPHANOPOULOS: You probably know the Clinton\'s better than any other candidate in this race. How do you assess her candidacy so far? HUCKABEE: Republicans underestimate Hillary Clinton at their own peril. She\'s a brilliant woman, brilliant intellectually, and she\'s brilliant politically. And I think, when I hear Republicans say, oh, I hope Hillary\'s the nominee, oh I hope Hillary\'s the nominee -- boy, will it just... STEPHANOPOULOS: I\'ll bet you don\'t. I\'ve seen polls that show her beating you in Arkansas. HUCKABEE: Oh, on any given day. I think I would win in Arkansas. But you know something? I will tell you that Hillary Clinton will be a very strong candidate across America because she knows how to win. She\'s been through struggles. She has overcome many things. And she is absolutely a brilliant human being. Again, I think people underestimate her. And I think, when they do, they\'re going to be sorry. STEPHANOPOULOS: You\'d be the second president from Hope, Arkansas. What did you learn from the first? HUCKABEE: When I talk to groups, particularly if it\'s Republican groups, I say something that really, I think, puts them on their heels sometimes. I say, regardless of what you think about Bill Clinton, whether you liked him or not, whether you thought his policies were horrible or whether you thought his personal habits were terrible, just remember one thing, that here is a guy who came out of a small, impoverished southern state; in his case, came out of a dysfunctional family, had everything going against him, but he became president of the United States, not once but twice. You know what? He is an affirmation of the American dream. Don\'t ever take that from a kid growing up in this country. Don\'t ever let it be lost on us that if a Bill Clinton, or for that matter, if a Mike Huckabee can become president, we\'re still a great country. STEPHANOPOULOS: And no one will ever forget Hope, Arkansas. HUCKABEE: I hope not. STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor, thanks very much. HUCKABEE: Thanks, George.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"April 8, 2007","b'Interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News\' ""Face the Nation""'","b'SCHIEFFER: And joining us this morning from Little Rock, Arkansas, governor--former Governor Mike Huckabee. He is a candidate who is different. Among other things, he\'s the only candidate that is offering diet advice to voters. He is also a candidate who says what he thinks, and he is one of the more interesting people around politics, if I do say so. Governor, welcome. And I want to start right in with something you said to one of the Arkansas papers, the Pine Bluff Commercial Appeal. It really caught my eye because what you said is that some Republicans, particularly Christian evangelicals, talk as if Republican candidates are not going to be held to a standard of personal accountability and responsibility for their personal lives. And you went on to say, if that is true, there are going to be a lot of Republicans who owe Bill Clinton a great big public apology. What do you mean by that, governor, and who are you talking about? I assume you\'re talking about Rudy Giuliani, among others. HUCKABEE: I\'m really not talking about the candidates so much, Bob, as I am about Christian leaders who were very vocal in speaking out about Bill Clinton\'s personal life and his behavior. And if those same standards don\'t apply to Republicans, then it\'s just a matter of sheer hypocrisy. Principles have to be applied to all of us, and it shouldn\'t be applied differently to Republicans or Democrats. Now, that--that gate ought to swing both ways. Republicans have to be fair to Democrats, Democrats need to be fair to Republicans. Whatever standard we set, we ought to all just be honest about it and make that the standard for everybody. And that\'s what has concerned me, is that there\'s sort of a almost this, well, ""things are going to be different in this election cycle."" Well, principles don\'t change. People do, but principles and basic standards of decency and appropriate behavior shouldn\'t change, and we shouldn\'t make exceptions just because we happen to maybe be in the same party. SCHIEFFER: Well, but I take it what you\'re saying is there ought to be a thorough examination of all the candidates\' personal lives, for example that Rudy Giuliani has been married three times, John McCain twice. And you\'re saying that Republicans ought to do that. Is that what you\'re saying here? HUCKABEE: Well, I\'m saying that we\'re going to be evaluated, all of us who run for president. In fact, we were evaluated as we ran for governor in my case, or mayor in the case of Giuliani or others. I\'m just saying that those who claim that they represent a certain branch of our party, primarily the Christian evangelicals, got into politics because of adherence to certain moral principles. Now, if those moral principles no longer are the driving force, they render their whole purpose for being in politics irrelevant, and that\'s why I think we have to sort of--I\'m not calling out the candidates, I\'m calling out the Christian leaders and saying if you\'re going to be Christian leaders, then be Christian leaders. Don\'t just be political players, because then you defy the very reason that you claim you needed to be involved in the political process. SCHIEFFER: Well, let me ask you about another rather unusual thing you said. You said Hillary Clinton is focused, you said she is disciplined and you--and she said--you said she is brilliant. I guess I have to ask you, if your campaign doesn\'t work out and she wins, are you angling for a place in her Cabinet? HUCKABEE: No. I don\'t think she\'d ask me, and I don\'t think I\'d accept. And truly, those are words that I said spoken simply as an observation of having known her. I think that\'s why I\'m the best candidate on the Republican side. I know her better than anybody else on the Republican ticket running, and I know how, frankly, how dangerous she can be as a candidate. That\'s one of the reasons that I believe that my candidacy offers the clearest contrast and an opportunity for America to have maybe a real solid choice. SCHIEFFER: Well, let\'s talk about some of the other Republican candidates. Mitt Romney, for example, he seems to be having some problems with--he seems to have developed some, I guess I would say some evolving positions. He said one thing when he was governor of Massachusetts and when he was running for that office. He now seems to be saying some quite different things. For example, he recently revealed that he had just joined or that he was a member of the NRA, the National Rifle Association and said he was a life-long hunter. And then we find out that, his campaign said, well, actually, he\'d only been hunting twice. What do you make of that, governor? HUCKABEE: Well, certainly, he\'s wanting to appeal to a lot of the voters that I think I naturally appeal to, and that\'s folks in the South and people in the Midwest and, for that matter, people in New Hampshire who truly value their Second Amendment rights. And it\'s not just about hunting, but hunting certainly is a part of it. I think it was, you know, the major mistake to try to portray himself--""I\'ve been a life-long hunter,\' when he\'s been twice. It\'d be like me saying, ""I\'ve been a life-long golfer\' because I played putt-putt when I was nine years old and I rode in a golf cart a couple of times. The best thing to do is just say, ""Look, here\'s who I am. I support this issue, but I\'m not particularly close to it."" Let me--let me say that I have a great respect for Rudy Giuliani, who--who I thought made a real gutsy move in South Carolina this week when he said that he still supports federal funding for abortion. Now, I disagree with him. I don\'t think we ought to use federal tax dollars for abortion, and I wouldn\'t if I were president. But I thought it was at least a statement of extraordinary honesty and candor on the part of Giuliani that he would go into South Carolina, a very pro-life environment, and just say, ""Look, this is who I am. I\'m not going to change just to get your votes.\' And I think American people are looking for authenticity, they\'re looking for people whose statements today match what they said five, 10, 15, 20 years ago, and match with what they\'ve done in office, match their record with their rhetoric. SCHIEFFER: Let\'s talk a little bit about the money side of it. Mr. Romney, I think--well, let\'s just take a look at the figures as what some of these national Republicans have raised. Romney has now raised, we are told, $23 million; Rudy Giuliani, $15 million; John McCain, $12 1/2 million. You, at this point, have raised about a half million dollars. HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm. SCHIEFFER: We\'re going to have a very different kind of campaign this time. We\'ll have Iowa. We\'ll have New Hampshire. But then, in early February, maybe as many as 30 states holding primaries on the same day. That means we\'re basically going to have a national campaign, and you can\'t campaign in all those states at one time. So it\'s--money is going to play a tremendous role, a more important role than ever. Frankly, I find that somewhat obscene. But how do you, as someone who\'s not even raised $1 million yet, how can you possibly compete in that kind of an environment? HUCKABEE: Well, Bob, it--I think the word ""obscene"" is a great word to use. This is a time when people\'re talking about $100 million before the end of the year. If that\'s the case, do you really want someone in charge of the federal treasury who burns $100 million before the first vote is cast? I think that is obscene. Now, what I would remind people is that a lot of people are talking about how much money was raised in the first quarter, and it\'s sort of like saying, ""Gee, the first quarter is the whole game,\' but it isn\'t. I\'ve only been at this about six and a half weeks. We started from ground zero, didn\'t have a capacity to transfer money from a Senate account. We\'ve met our rather modest fund-raising goals for the first reporting period because we got a late start. The question is not how much I raised in the first quarter, but how much am I going to continue to raise over the next two and three quarters. And that\'s where we feel like it\'s got to happen. Plus, this is the kind of environment in which a candidate can catch fire and people go to the Web site that he has and make contributions over the Internet, and I could raise $20 million overnight if everyone watching this show just simply went and said, ""I\'ll make $100 contribution.\' The point is that things could change so rapidly. SCHIEFFER: Well, governor, that\'s kind of a big if. I mean, you know, they always say, you know, the dog could\'ve caught the rabbit if he hadn\'t stopped to make that phone call. HUCKABEE: Yeah. SCHIEFFER: But, I mean--I mean, reality is reality. You\'re going to have to have a tremendous sum of money to even have a chance. I\'m not saying that\'s fair... HUCKABEE: Sure. SCHIEFFER: ...but it\'s simply the golf course that politics is played on these days. And--and I just--it\'s not clear to me how you can get from there to here. HUCKABEE: Well, it--again, if--if I thought that I\'d raised all the money that I was going to realistically raise, I\'d be out of it today. But what I\'m telling you is, we\'re on the front end of our fund-raising, not on the back side. We have two biggest fund-raisers that we\'ve had to date that haven\'t even happened. One that\'ll happen this month, one in May, that I think are going to do--be the kind of events that give us the opportunity to keep going. But our miles per gallon, I would say, is pretty darned impressive because, with very modest fund-raising so far and the fact that we\'ve only been at it a few weeks, not several months or in the case of some candidates several years, we\'re still competitive and... SCHIEFFER: All right. HUCKABEE: ...are growing momentum rather than trying to run on the fumes of what momentum I\'ve had. SCHIEFFER: OK. Well, let\'s talk a little bit about what you\'re for and what you\'re against. I noticed that you said at one point, ""We have to stop driving God out of the public square."" You are an evangelical, I take it? HUCKABEE: Yes. SCHIEFFER: What is the connection between government and God in your view? HUCKABEE: Well, the First Amendment\'s pretty clear, and it\'s simply this, that government should neither prefer or prohibit the practice of religions. Government shouldn\'t go and tell people how to worship or even that they should worship. Government ought to have a hands-off attitude. But what government shouldn\'t do is to tell people that they can\'t or put restrictions. And so I think we\'ve made something complicated out of something that the founding fathers really made very simple in the First Amendment. You neither prefer one religion over another, but you don\'t prohibit the free exercise thereof. And so when there are efforts made, whether it\'s because of political correctness or court decisions that have run amok, where you say you can\'t have a nativity scene or a menorah on capitol grounds, that\'s absurd.. SCHIEFFER: All right. HUCKABEE: We ought to be able to welcome the discussion of faith in the public square. SCHIEFFER: And where do you come down on the war? HUCKABEE: We got to win, it\'s simple as that. We can\'t just pull away and demoralize our military and create an incredible instability in the Middle East. I think it\'s a wrong-headed decision on the part of some of the Democrats who want to set a firm timetable and announce it. That\'s like playing football and saying, ""We\'re only playing through the middle of the third quarter and then we\'re leaving, regardless of the score."" Well, that\'s a sure way to know that your opponent doesn\'t have to be better than you, doesn\'t have to beat you, just has to stay on the field until you\'ve already announced you\'re going to leave. SCHIEFFER: Governor, we have to end it there, and I would also like to congratulate you on actually losing 100 pounds. I know you see obesity as a big problem in this country, and you have shown... HUCKABEE: Yes, I do. SCHIEFFER: ...by your example that something can be done about this problem. Thank you very much. You\'re an interesting interview, and we wish you the best. HUCKABEE: Thank you, and happy Easter to you and all your viewers.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"August 12, 2007","b'Interview with Jim Axelrod on CBS News\' ""Face the Nation""'","b'AXELROD: Yesterday in Ames, Iowa, Republican voters there took part in the first critical test in the race for the White House--the Iowa straw poll. Rudy Giuliani and John McCain chose not to participate, though their names were on the ballot. More than 14,000 Iowans paid or let a campaign pay 35 bucks a pop for them to vote for a Republican presidential candidate. While the results of this straw poll are nonbinding, it is the first indicator of whether candidates can translate money and message into votes. And here\'s how they ran. As expected, Mitt Romney won with 32 percent of the vote. Mike Huckabee came in second with 18 percent, and Kansas Senator Sam Brownback third with 15 percent. Joining us now from Little Rock, Arkansas, former Governor Mike Huckabee. Good morning, Governor. Thanks for being with us. HUCKABEE: Well, thank you, Jim. It was a great day for us in Iowa yesterday. AXELROD: You know, in the run-up to the straw poll, I saw you quoted a couple different times saying if you were still a second-tier candidate after the straw poll, then you had a problem. So from where you\'re sitting this morning, you got a problem? HUCKABEE: No, we\'re, we\'re in fact in the first tier, I think, by anybody\'s estimation. And here\'s why. It wasn\'t just that we surprised people with a second showing, it\'s that we did it with so few resources. I mean, this really was feeding the 5,000 with two fish and five loaves, an amazing kind of day for us. Because if you look at how much money some of the candidates spent to get the kind of votes they got, it\'s staggering. And we spent less than $100,000 on the straw poll. If we add everything we did over the course of the last seven weeks in Iowa, that includes paper clips and gasoline for the vehicles to get us from place to place, our total expenses were 150,000. So when you look at what we were able to achieve, it was because people came to Ames to vote for us. And we had remarkable stories of people who came literally from all over America to work for us, and then people from Ames--one girl drove from Ames to Des Moines to get her driver license, because she forgot it, just so she could vote for me. I mean, it was that kind of--it was a movement, it wasn\'t just a, ""Hey, we\'re giving out T-shirts.\' I mean, we gave out watermelon from my hometown of Hope, Arkansas, which, of course, is worth driving to Ames for. AXELROD: All right. On one--on one hand, you do this on a shoestring. HUCKABEE: Yeah. AXELROD: I get that. On the other hand, no Rudy Giuliani, no John McCain, no Fred Thompson. So let\'s put this in some kind of perspective in terms of moving yourself from the second tier to the first tier. HUCKABEE: Well, it still matters that even though they say they didn\'t play, they were on the ballot. More importantly, what they did was forfeit the game, and if you forfeit, it\'s a loss. They knew they weren\'t going to do well with Iowa voters because Iowa voters tend to be far more conservative. I think they looked at the clear situation and the landscape in Iowa and decided, you know, if we go and play and do what we probably will do, it\'ll be embarrassing, so we\'ll just forfeit the game. I don\'t think it diminishes what the rest of us did. I think it only enhances it and shows that we play in middle America and they know they didn\'t. AXELROD: I\'m looking at something from yesterday that strikes me as the big takeaway that eight years ago this time there were 24,000 voters who participated in the straw poll. Yesterday, 14,000. That\'s 10,000 fewer Republican voters playing at this. What does that tell us about the state of the Republican Party? HUCKABEE: It tells us more about how hot it was in Ames, Iowa. It was about 150 degrees, and I think that had a lot to do with it, the state fair going on. AXELROD: Ten thousand fewer voters hot? HUCKABEE: Well, I think so. I mean, it was--there were two things that were working. First of all, there was the state fair of Iowa, which is like most state fairs on steroids. I call it the Barry Bonds of state fairs. It\'s just unbelievable because we went to it on Friday. And then you do have a situation where the weather and, you know, right now this campaign has been dragging on much longer. So most people have sort of had a chance to take a look at some of the candidates. What we\'re still dealing with, though, is the universe of people who are willing to drive anywhere from an hour to four and a half hours away to come to Ames and spend all day in a hot sunshine--unless they\'re in one of the air-conditioned tents of the other candidates--you know, to vote in a--in a straw poll. AXELROD: All right.l HUCKABEE: I think it goes mean something. AXELROD: Governor, let me ask you about the man who won yesterday\'s straw poll, Governor Romney. You said before he might be a risky standard bearer for the Republican Party because of his flip-flips. Is Mitt Romney a reliable conservative? HUCKABEE: Well, you know, that\'s going to be for the voters to decide. And I want to be very clear. I didn\'t say that he was a flip-flopper. I never said that. What I said when asked did I believe his positions on abortion now which have changed? And I said, ""I\'m going to give him benefit of the doubt and accept him at his word.\' Mitt is a good guy. He\'s got a wonderful family, and I said I\'m not going to criticize him for where he stands now. But if we think that the Democrats won\'t come and use that against him, should he be the nominee, we\'re kidding ourselves. And so it was reported that I took a shot at him, and actually I thought I was being rather generously charitable to him. AXELROD: You know, a lot of people, I\'m sure, waking up this morning and looking at you and looking at the results and saying, ""Who is this guy?\' So an ordained Baptist minister, solid conservative credentials, a great personal story. You shed a ton of weight in this battle with diabetes. HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm. AXELROD: Did you ever look at the national Republican front-runner, Rudy Giuliani, the pro-choice, pro-gun control, pro-gay rights Rudy Giuliani and say to yourself, ""How come I haven\'t been able to get any traction?"" HUCKABEE: Well, I think yesterday showed that we are getting traction. And I\'ve said a long time if we had just even a little bit of the resources some of these other guys have been able to accumulate, we\'d be at the top of the field because of the message. You know, I\'m one of the few Republican candidates that\'s having the courage to talk about how we need to really separate ourselves from being the Wall Street Republican crowd. We need to be the Main Street Republican crowd. We need to quit being a wholly-owned subsidiary of the major fund managers on Wall Street and start being more concerned about people out there in places like Iowa. AXELROD: But let me give you a chance while we\'re sort of in this process of maybe introducing you to the American public in a way they haven\'t seen prior to the, to the debate--to the straw poll. Let me ask you this question, draw some contrasts between you, Mayor Giuliani, Senator McCain, Governor Romney. What makes Mike Huckabee different? HUCKABEE: There are several things. First of all, experience. And I don\'t mean just governmental experience. That\'s important, 10 1/2 years as a governor in a state that\'s overwhelmingly Democrat. I became governor with a 90 percent Democrat legislature, the most lopsided in the country, and was able to get things done in the way of tax cuts and transportation to rebuild roads, some of the most significant education improvements and some innovative things, frankly, that many people wouldn\'t expect out of a Republican--a focus on music and art in education, health care renovations that have really, I think, driven national attention to Arkansas for being the only state in the country to reverse trends of childhood obesity. But in addition to that, I think a lot of it, Jim, is personal experience. You know, I didn\'t grow up a child of privilege. I grew up in a working class family and first male in my entire family lineage to even graduate high school. I think I know something of the American dream and not only understand it but can communicate it and articulate it because I\'ve lived it. And I can relate to a lot of people out there who just want to know that people who are elected, whether it\'s to the presidency or to the office of city council, understand what struggle is like, because a lot of Americans every day get up and they don\'t face the decision between are they going to vacation in the Caribbean or the Riviera. They face whether they can squeeze the handle on the gas pump and put enough fuel in the tank to get to work. AXELROD: But I\'m trying to figure out what your road from here might look like so that a year from now you are not only still in the race but accepting a nomination in Minneapolis. I\'m having trouble this morning, despite your finish yesterday, seeing what it is that makes you different so that you vault ahead of some of the front-runners as the party has them right now. HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, I think that Republicans look for a conservative who has had consistency in his principles, and there\'s not going to be any YouTube moments of me saying something substantially different on the sanctity of life or on the Second Amendment or on the role of traditional marriage. AXELROD: And are Giuliani and Romney both open to that possibility? HUCKABEE: Well, you know, do a Google search, and I\'ll let you find the YouTube moments. But I think people are looking for consistency. They\'re also looking for somebody who can communicate those views that won\'t come across as confrontational. This country is very polarized right now, no one can deny that, and I think Americans are looking for what I like to call vertical leadership rather than horizontal. The average person doesn\'t care whether we\'re left, right, liberal, conservative, Republican, Democrat as much as they care as to whether we would lead this country up rather than down. And that\'s vertical leadership, and I think that\'s what Republicans are going to have to have or we\'re going to get our heads handed to us next year in the elections. AXELROD: We\'ve got about just 30 seconds left. You\'re a strong supporter of the troop surge as well. Can you win as a strong supporter of the troop surge? HUCKABEE: You know, I know that I can because the American people are going to see that the surge is beginning to have an impact. I mean, even The New York Times had to admit that things are beginning to improve. General Petraeus was given until September. We ought to give him that time frame. And certainly it\'s not pretty, it\'s not something we want to be there forever in, but we also know we\'ve got a responsibility to do it right, so we don\'t have to do it over. AXELROD: And we\'re going to leave it right there. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, congratulations on your finish in the straw poll yesterday. Thank you for being with us. HUCKABEE: Thank you, Jim.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"December 30, 2007","b'Interview with Tim Russert on NBC News\' ""Meet the Press""'","b'RUSSERT: Governor Mike Huckabee, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.HUCKABEE: Thank you very much, Tim. Pleasure to be back.RUSSERT: You\'ve dropped nine points in less than a month. What happened?HUCKABEE: Well, I think the polls are all over the place. We have some that show us up eight points. This one that came out today shows us down nine. I don\'t think anybody has a clue. We\'ll find out Thursday night how they\'re doing.RUSSERT: Do you think some of the commercials that have been on the air talking about your record have hurt?HUCKABEE: Well, they may have. I mean, people in Iowa have been bombarded. I mean, bombarded. Not only on commercials, but in the mail, at a time when most people were kind of looking forward to going out to the mailbox and picking up some nice Christmas cards, instead they were finding out what a bum Mike Huckabee is. And I don\'t know what kind of effect it has. People of Iowa, I think, like a positive campaign. But the relentless attacks--and they have been relentless. And when you\'re outspent 20-to-1, as I have been here in Iowa, you know, I think it\'s pretty amazing that I\'m where I am.RUSSERT: But has Mitt Romney said anything that\'s untrue about you?HUCKABEE: How long do we have on the program today? He\'s said many things that are untrue. He said that I reduced methamphetamine sentences in Arkansas. Truth is I signed a bill in 1999 that doubled those sentences. We did not reduce them. Our sentences were four times harsher than they were in Massachusetts. He said that I supported special breaks for illegal aliens. That\'s not true, Tim. We supported simply giving children who had earned a scholarship the same--it never happened, it didn\'t make the legislature. He made allegations that our increased spending by ridiculous amounts, and The New York Times came back and defended that, and said that\'s just simply not true. And they took him apart and showed that the increases in spending were, frankly, the same if not a little better than his if you took into consideration the accounting methods we changed in Arkansas, very modest gains in spending.He made claims about things like tax increases, but he failed to mention that some of those were either court ordered or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for things as roads. And I left my roads in great shape, took them from the worst in the country to what Truckers magazine said were the most improved. He left his roads in a mess in Massachusetts, with huge problems in the infrastructure. He claimed that he didn\'t raise taxes, but, in fact, he did raise taxes by half a billion dollars.RUSSERT: Fees.HUCKABEE: Fees. It\'s a tax. If you\'re a small business person and you pay more money than you paid last year to the government, you can call it a fee, call it a tax, it\'s a three letter word that means the same.RUSSERT: But you raised taxes, and the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, gave you a D and an F for your tenureship as governor. So there have been some legitimate criticisms of you as a Republican for raising taxes and for spending money.HUCKABEE: Well, I don\'t think they\'re legitimate criticisms when you improve education for the children of your state or when you build highways that give you economic incentives and capacities that, frankly, created the lowest unemployment numbers that our state had over had over a sustained period of time. We saw more new jobs created. That\'s what being a governor is about. It\'s about creating opportunities for the people of your state.RUSSERT: Even if it means raising taxes?HUCKABEE: Well, in some cases, you know, I cut 94 taxes. People forget what we did do on a positive nature: eliminated the marriage penalty, indexed the income tax for inflation so low-income people weren\'t paying high tax rates. So what we tried to do in tax policy by doubling the child care tax credit and by raising the threshold at which people paid, we untaxed a lot of the poor people and gave them a shot at actually making it up the economic ladder.Now, when we raised taxes, it was one of two things, either to meet an educational demand--our schools were deemed by the courts to be unconstitutional. In Arkansas, we\'ve been down the road of a governor defying the courts and saying, \'I\'m not going to follow the court order.\' Didn\'t turn out real well. I wasn\'t going to be the second Arkansas governor to do that. In fact, I\'m proud of the fact that we raised teacher pay, proud of the fact that, in every year we tested kids, we saw vast improvements in their test scores, things were--got better, not worse. And education was my ticket out of the, out of the bottom of the economic spectrum. Education is a key for every child. And I want to make sure that if we\'re going to spend more money--and the court said we have to--then the next thing is, let\'s make sure we spend it well and we spend it wisely.RUSSERT: Let me turn to foreign policy, specifically Pakistan. Do you believe that the government of Pakistan should postpone the elections in light of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto?HUCKABEE: I think that\'s their decision to make. Clearly, January 8th coming so soon and--after the assassination, it may be problematic for President Musharraf to, to carry out the elections. Sharif has said that he\'s going to boycott the elections, so there is some question how much meaning and significance they will have. But I don\'t think it would be appropriate for me to try to weigh in on whether or not they ought to have the elections in their own country.RUSSERT: Now, the Council on Foreign Relations published an article that you had written.HUCKABEE: Mm.RUSSERT: And this is what you advocated for Pakistan: ""Rather than wait for the next strike, I prefer to cut to the chase by going after al-Qaeda\'s safe havens in Pakistan. The threat of an attack on us is far graver than the risk"" than ""a quick and limited strike against al-Qaeda would bring extremists to power in Pakistan."" How soon in your presidency would you launch such a strike?HUCKABEE: Well, it would depend on how soon we had fixed a target. Back in 2005, Tim, we had soldiers in a C-130, parachutes strapped on their backs, ready to go in and take out Osama bin Laden. They believed that they had found him. And the strike was called back at the last minute, apparently fearing that if they didn\'t have the permission of the Pakistani government it would create huge problems. I think leaving key al-Qaeda leaders is the most important problem we face today. Taking those targets out is critical.One of the things I want to point out about that article, I spoke about Pakistan extensively back in September, and a lot of people criticized the article, saying \'You talk so much about Pakistan, and you didn\'t speak as much about Iran.\' You know, a lot of people have criticized my foreign policy views, but the fact is, in light of what\'s happened in the last week, some of my comments on Pakistan seem almost prophetic.RUSSERT: But if, in fact, you went into Pakistan in order to take out al-Qaeda, couldn\'t you very well destabilize the Musharraf regime and help the Taliban take over Pakistan?HUCKABEE: Oh, I, I don\'t think it would be an effort to destabilize the Musharraf government. I think what we do have to recognize is we\'ve spent over $10 billion in aid, and the purpose of that aid in Pakistan was to fight terrorism. Now, as we kind of look at where that money\'s spent, we realize that not that much of it has likely gone to fight terrorism in Pakistan. A lot of it has gone to their military for reasons that didn\'t have to do with, with terrorism. One of the things that will happen, I believe, as a result of the week\'s activities is a greater accountability for the money. It is in our best interest for there to be some stability. Right now Musharraf, despite some of the concerns we have about him, represents at least some level of security, more so than if he were ousted immediately. And I don\'t think it\'s in the United States\' best interest to try to get rid of him. I think Kayani now being in charge of the military is a good thing because, clearly, he\'s stable, he has a sterling reputation both as a military commander and as a person who is not so political, but I think will give an even hand to the military, which is something Pakistan has needed.RUSSERT: But, Governor, you know how the man and woman on the street in Pakistan would react to a U.S. intervention into their country. Is it worth destabilizing General Musharraf in order to capture Osama bin Laden?HUCKABEE: Well, I think the question is, would it destabilize him if we simply went in...RUSSERT: Is it worth the risk?HUCKABEE: If it saves American lives, if it potentially takes out al-Qaeda\'s number one operative, that\'s a decision that a president would have to make. And if I were sitting there as president, I would weigh all that information. But let me make sure that everybody understands the number one job for the American president is to protect this country, to do every and anything that it can do to make sure that we don\'t see skyscrapers tumble to the ground in major cities like we did on September 11th. Whatever we must do to protect our sovereignty against those whose ideologies are so extreme that they would do something so cowardly and so dastardly as to take thousands of innocent lives in that kind of terrorist action, yes sir, you better believe that I\'ll do anything necessary. I don\'t want to do it with disregard to what it might do in stabilization of a nation. But sometimes you have to look at all the risk and weigh heavily, but remember that your most single critical job is that of protecting and preserving the American people.RUSSERT: After the assassination, you made several comments about Pakistan, used some inartful words, you got your geography wrong. The Washington Post wrote this editorial. ""The assassination of Benzair Bhutto presented U.S. presidential candidates with a test: Could they respond cogently and clearly to a sudden foreign policy crisis? Republican Mike Huckabee, flunked abysmally.""His first statement seemed really uninformed: He appeared not to know that Mr. Musharraf had ended \'martial law\' two weeks ago. That was better than his next effort, when he said an appropriate U.S. response would include \'very clear monitoring of our borders to make sure if there\'s any unusual activity of Pakistanis coming into our country.\' The cynicism of this attempt to connect Pakistan\'s crisis with anti-immigrant sentiment was compounded by its astonishing senselessness.""Clearly, some of your words were in...HUCKABEE: What do they really think, Tim? What did they really think in the editorial?RUSSERT: Pretty specific. But let me ask you about it...HUCKABEE: Yeah.RUSSERT: ...because people your...HUCKABEE: I do want to respond to the specifics of that.RUSSERT: In this context. You were governor of Arkansas, you have no real foreign policy experience. Give us a sense of, of Pakistan. How would you describe that country to me?HUCKABEE: It\'s 164 million people, 97 percent of them are Muslim. It\'s a country that does not have a long history of democracy. It\'s been a relatively unstable country, alternating between military coup. But, but let me go back to some of these issues.RUSSERT: Primarily Shiite or Sunni?HUCKABEE: It, it--it\'s primarily Sunni, and I think we need to recognize that what we have in, in the events that have been described in that editorial, first of all, when they say that about the border, that was taken completely out of, out of context. What I was speaking was how does this event in Pakistan affect people in Iowa? And my point was that a lot of people say, ""Well, this is a terrible tragedy to have this terrible act against an outstanding and, and very charismatic leader."" But it does affect us. Everything in the world affects us here in the United States. And what I was trying to point out was that our lack of control of our borders--and I quoted the Denver Post article that had 660 Pakistanis arrested, we don\'t know how many came, that\'s how many we were, we were catching. I said it was in a one-year period, it was in a four-year period.RUSSERT: And there were several more other countries that had much larger numbers, according to our State Department.HUCKABEE: But my point wasn\'t lost. My point is that if you don\'t control your borders, then it\'s not about people coming across from Mexico to pluck chickens and pick lettuce. We\'re talking about the potential of a person who can come across this border with a dirty bomb in his suitcase, somebody who can come across our borders who might be bringing a shoulder-fired missile. And if we don\'t have better control of our borders, it does affect the people in Iowa and the rest of America.RUSSERT: I want to get to immigration in a second. But I want to go back to--stay on foreign policy for a second. And, again, your article in Foreign Affairs journal, you wrote this: ""American foreign policy needs to change its tone and attitude, open up, and reach out. The Bush administration\'s arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad."" Give me an example of President Bush\'s arrogant bunker mentality.HUCKABEE: When Donald Rumsfeld, despite all the military advice that said we needed 400,000 boots on the ground to be effective in bringing stability and order, arbitrarily said we\'re going to have 180,000 people there. I think Secretary Gates has done a much better job in, in listening to members of Congress and listening to...RUSSERT: But that was the president.HUCKABEE: ...the chief of staff.RUSSERT: That\'s not the secretary of defense, that\'s the president.HUCKABEE: But it\'s--but I\'m--well, you asked me for a specific, and I\'m giving you one. Our administration, led by Secretary Rumsfeld, was very specific in prescribing that we were going to have a light footprint, we were going to put a limited number of troops on the ground. And despite what the military experts were giving as advice, and all the Department of Defense models that spoke about what it would take to bring stability, we ignored those pieces of military advice. We didn\'t take the advice from the people, I like to say, with blood on their boots and medals on their chest. We made decisions that turned out to be the wrong ones.RUSSERT: That\'s it? Arrogant bunker mentality?HUCKABEE: I think in times we have also given the world the impression that you\'re either with us 100 percent or you\'re against us 100 percent. And, and you can\'t quite deal with foreign governments any more than you can deal with anybody, in that sense, in politics. Politics is about getting as much as you can as often as you can, but recognizing that while you may be against me on an issue today, you may be with me on an issue tomorrow. Try to keep the bridges going. Try to keep roads open as much as possible. And I do think that there have been times in which we have drawn a proverbial line in the sand and made it very clear that it\'s all or it\'s nothing. And I think that\'s what I\'m speaking of.And it\'s interesting to me that while a few weeks ago on this program Mitt Romney was very critical of me for making that statement, a few months earlier on MEET THE--rather, on ""60 Minutes,"" he himself had talked about the major mistakes that had been made by the administration. He demanded of me an apology, but he did not demand of himself an apology for also being critical, as have most Republicans. Now, I think Republicans are big enough and maybe wise enough that we can be in disagreement with certain policies and still be behind our president and behind this administration in many of the things which they have done right. And I\'ve been very complimentary of the president on the issues where I think he\'s been right. I stood by him in the war, I stood by him in the surge. I wasn\'t a latecomer like Mitt Romney was to believing that the surge was effective. And we\'ve seen 76 percent decline in civilian deaths, 62 percent decline in military casualties since the surge began. It is working. We are finally beginning to see those signs of victory in Iraq.RUSSERT: You\'re suggesting that Mitt Romney\'s not running an honorable campaign.HUCKABEE: I\'ve been very clear about it. Mitt Romney is running a very desperate and, frankly, a dishonest campaign. He\'s attacked me, and, and yesterday--or Friday, I guess it was, he launched then just a broadside attack against Senator McCain. Now, Senator McCain and I are rivals for the presidency, but I\'ve said on many occasions, I\'ll say it again here today, Senator McCain is an honorable man, and I believe he\'s an honest man. I believe he\'s a man of conviction. And I felt like that, when Mitt Romney went after the integrity of John McCain, he stepped across a line. John McCain\'s a hero in this country. He\'s a hero to me.And I just felt like that when Mitt Romney gets on your show and says that he had the NRA endorsement when he didn\'t; when he comes on and says he\'s pro-life and yet he signed a bill that gives a $50 co-pay for an elective abortion in his state\'s health care plan; when he claims that he\'s really for the Second Amendment, but he--on this show he talked about how he supported limitations and restrictions on lawful, law-abiding citizens having gun ownership rights, those are not the marks of a person who\'s pro-life and pro-Second Amendment. And then the things where he\'s made up these visions that he\'s had of marching with Martin Luther King and his dad marching with him. You know, Tim, what I\'ve said, and I\'ve been pretty blunt about it, if you aren\'t being honest in obtaining a job, can we trust you to be honest if you get the job?RUSSERT: Let me ask you about immigration because it is your consistency on that issue, I think, that is going to be talked about. The debate in November, you were active--talked about shipping, sending illegal immigrants home, and you made this impassioned plea. Let\'s watch.(Videotape)HUCKABEE: In all due respect, we\'re a better country than to punish children for what their parents did. We\'re a better country than that.(End videotape)RUSSERT: ""We\'re a better country than punishing children for what their""...HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: ...""parents did.""HUCKABEE: I still believe that, yeah.RUSSERT: But a week later, after that comment, you came out with this: ""The Secure America Plan.""HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: ""Propose to provide all illegal immigrants a 120-day window to register with the Bureau of Citizenship"" ""Immigration Services and leave the country. Those who register"" ""return to their home country will face no penalty if they later apply,"" ""those who do not return home will be, when caught, barred from future re-entry for a period of 10 years."" Children born here are American citizens.HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: And you were saying that.HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: ""Don\'t punish those kids."" A week later, you said, ""No, no, no, send the parents home,"" and what happens to the kids?HUCKABEE: They go with their parents. I mean, I can\'t imagine a parent not taking their children...RUSSERT: But they\'re American citizens. Why do they have to leave the country?HUCKABEE: Because they\'re--first, before they\'re American citizens, they\'re the children of their parents.RUSSERT: But aren\'t we a ""better country,"" to quote someone, than that?HUCKABEE: Let me be very clear. I stand beside my statement, but here\'s what we have to do to fix the immigration problem. We\'ve got to seal our border, something our government has been dysfunctional and failed to do. It\'s also very clear the American people are not going to tolerate people who have gotten here illegally to get in the front of the line. The only way they can get into the back of the line is to go back to the point of origin, to get behind that line, and then modernize that line so it shouldn\'t take eight years to process a piece of paper to get people the necessary paperwork to be able to do that.RUSSERT: But, Governor, this is, this is important, because this is what you said back in 2005. ""Responding to a question about illegal aliens, Huckabee said \'our economy would collapse\' without them.""HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: Do you believe that?HUCKABEE: I think it would be very, very difficult to do construction and agriculture without them. That\'s why we need a policy that puts everyone in this country in a legal position. And, Tim, let me, let me go further.RUSSERT: But, this, this is...HUCKABEE: Let me explain why.RUSSERT: ...important, because your plan says send them all home.HUCKABEE: No, I did not send them home. They will go home within 120-day window, and then they have the process of starting to return.RUSSERT: But that\'s 15 million people. You\'re saying to do that would collapse the American economy, and now that\'s exactly what you\'re proposing.HUCKABEE: No, I don\'t think it would collapse the American economy if people went back and did their process of becoming legal. And all of them aren\'t going to go back on the same day. There\'s going to be a window of time. How long it\'s going to take for them to come back, I don\'t know. But part of the process, the first process, if you read my entire plan, is seal the border. Seal the border. If you don\'t do that, then you don\'t have any control of who\'s here, why they\'re here and what they\'re doing. This process has to be modernized. It\'s our government that\'s been dysfunctional.Tim, I stand by many of the state--all of the statements I\'ve made, and one of them has been, let\'s thank God we live in a country people are trying to break into, not one they\'re trying to break out of. But let\'s have a rule of law. Let\'s make everyone live by it. And let me tell you why I believe my plan is not only a plan that respects the rule of law, but I think it\'s the most humane plan. Because nobody living in this country ought to live with his head down, ought to live in the shadows, ought to live in fear, ought to live every day looking if there\'s a police car or a border patrol, running and hiding. I want people to live in this country with their heads up. I want them to be able to, if they\'re going to work here, to work legally. I want them to be able to pay the same taxes, live under the same laws, and also to be able to have the kind of sense of liberty that this country is bound by. That\'s what we\'re trying to achieve. Let\'s not forget that our federal government has made a mess of this. As a governor, I had to deal with their mess, and I believe, as president, one of the highest priorities is to fix the problem.RUSSERT: I want to talk about your past as a Baptist minister and your faith. You\'ve talked about your faith being your life.HUCKABEE: Mm-hmm.RUSSERT: You went to the late Jerry Falwell\'s Liberty University, and were asked about your political success, and you said, ""There\'s only one explanation for it. It\'s not a human one,"" suggesting divine intervention. Then, here in Iowa, you have two ads are on the air. Let\'s just watch excerpts of both of those.(Videotape)HUCKABEE: (From ad) Faith doesn\'t just influence me, it really defines me. I don\'t have to wake up every day wondering, ""What do I need to believe?""(From ad) At this time of year, sometimes it\'s nice to pull aside from all of that and just remember that what really matters is the celebration and the birth of Christ.(End videotape)RUSSERT: And you, you cut--you take that speech, Governor, suggesting divine intervention on your half in a political campaign, an ad where you describe yourself as a Christian leader, an ad where many thought a cross was imposed, superimposed behind your...HUCKABEE: Which it is was not, it was a bookshelf. I wish we were so smart. I really do.RUSSERT: And then, and then this comment. ""I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ."" Where does...HUCKABEE: Which was, by the way, that phrase was one I think was 1998, is that when it was? The 1998 speech?RUSSERT: Yeah.HUCKABEE: To the Southern Baptist Convention. So it was a speech made to a Christian gathering, and, and certainly that would be appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists.RUSSERT: But where does this leave non-Christians?HUCKABEE: Oh, it leaves them right in the middle of America. I think the Judeo-Christian background of this country is one that respects people not only of faith, but it respects people who don\'t have faith. The, the key issue of real faith is that it never can be forced on someone. And never would I want to use the government institutions to impose mine or anybody else\'s faith or to restrict. I think the First Amendment, Tim, is explicitly clear. Government should be restricted, not faith, government. And government\'s restriction is on two fronts: one, it\'s not to prefer one faith over another; and the second, it\'s not to prohibit the practice of somebody\'s religion, period.RUSSERT: So you\'d have no problem appointing atheists to your Cabinet?HUCKABEE: No, I wouldn\'t have any problem at all appointing atheists. I probably had some working for me as governor. You know, I think you got to realize if people want--say, ""Well, you were a pastor,"" but I was a governor 10 1/2 years. I have more executive experience running a government. I was actually in a government position longer than I was a pastor. And if people want to know how I would blend these issues, the best way to look at it is how I served as a governor. I didn\'t ever propose a bill that we would remove the capitol dome of Arkansas and replace it with a steeple. You know, we didn\'t do tent revivals on the grounds of the capitol. But my faith is important to me. I try to be more descriptive of it. I just don\'t want to run from it and act like it\'s not important. It drives my views on everything from the environment to poverty to disease to hunger. Issues, frankly, I think the Republicans need to take a greater leadership role in. And as a Republican, but as a Christian, I would want to make sure that we\'re speaking out on some of these issues that I think we\'ve been lacking in as a party and as, as a nation.RUSSERT: Peggy Noonan, a woman of faith who writes for The Wall Street Journal, said that sometimes it appears your philosophy is ""This is what God wants,"" and that doesn\'t encourage discussion, it squelches it. And, and this is what you wrote in your book, ""Kids Who Kill,"" in 1998: ""It is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of publicly endorsed and institutionally supported aberrations--from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and necrophilia."" Why would you link homosexuality with sadomasochism, pedophilia and necrophilia?HUCKABEE: Well, what I was pointing out is all of these are deviations from what has been the traditional concept of sexual behavior and men and women having children, raising those children in the context of a, of a traditional marriage and family. And, again, taken out of the larger context of that book, speaking about how so many of our social institutions have been broken down.RUSSERT: But do you think homosexuality is equivalent to pedophilia...HUCKABEE: Oh, of course not.RUSSERT: ...or sadomasochism?HUCKABEE: No, of course not. I didn\'t say...RUSSERT: But this is what concerns people. This, this is what you did say about homosexuality: ""I feel homosexuality is an aberrant, unnatural and sinful lifestyle."" That\'s millions of Americans.HUCKABEE: Tim, understand, when a Christian speaks of sin, a Christian says all of us are sinners. I\'m a sinner, everybody\'s a sinner. What one\'s sin is, means it\'s missing the mark. It\'s missing the bull\'s eye, the perfect point. I miss it every day; we all do. The perfection of God is seen in a marriage in which one man, one woman live together as a couple committed to each other as life partners. Now, even married couples don\'t do that perfectly, so sin is not some act of equating people with being murderers or rapists...RUSSERT: But when you say aberrant or unnatural, do you believe you\'re born gay or you choose to be gay?HUCKABEE: I don\'t know whether people are born that way. People who are gay say that they\'re born that way. But one thing I know, that the behavior one practices is a choice. We may have certain tendencies, but how we behave and how we carry out our behavior--but the important issue that I want to address, because I think when you bring up the faith question, Tim, I\'ve been asked more about my faith than any person running for president. I\'m OK with that. I hope I\'ve answered these questions very candidly and very honestly. I think it\'s important for us to talk about it. But the most important thing is to find out, does our faith influence our public policy and how? I\'ve never tried to rewrite science textbooks. I\'ve never tried to come out with some way of imposing a doctrinaire Christian perspective in a way that is really against the Constitution. I\'ve never done that.RUSSERT: But you said you would ban all abortions.HUCKABEE: Well, that\'s not just because I\'m a Christian, that\'s because I\'m an American. Our founding fathers said that we\'re all created equal. I think every person has intrinsic worth and value...RUSSERT: But many Americans believe that that would be, that would be you imposing your faith belief...HUCKABEE: But, no. It\'s not a faith belief. It\'s deeper than that. It\'s a human belief. It goes to the heart of who we are as a civilization. If I believe that your intrinsic worth is not changed by your ancestry, your last name, by your IQ, by your abilities or disabilities, if I value your life and respect it with dignity and worth because it is human, then that\'s what draws me to the inescapable conclusion that I should be for the sanctity of every and each human life. That\'s why we go after that 12-year-old boy in the woods of North Carolina when he\'s lost, not because he has greater worth than someone else, but because we believe he has equal worth as everyone else. I like it that in this country we treat each other--at least we should--with that sense of equality. Our founding fathers penned that in the Declaration of Independence when they declared...RUSSERT: Some Americans believe that life does not begin at conception, and that it\'s...HUCKABEE: Well, scientifically I think that\'s almost...RUSSERT: But...HUCKABEE: ...a point that you couldn\'t argue. How, how could you say that life doesn\'t begin at conception...RUSSERT: Right. Do you respect that view?HUCKABEE: ...biologically?RUSSERT: Do you respect that view?HUCKABEE: I respect it as a view, but I don\'t think it has biological credibility.RUSSERT: And what would happen to doctors or women who participated in abortion?HUCKABEE: It\'s always the, the point of trying to say, ""Are you going to criminalize it?"" That\'s not the issue.RUSSERT: Well, if it, if it\'s illegal, it would be.HUCKABEE: It would be. And I think you don\'t punish the woman, first of all, because it\'s not about--I consider her a victim, not a, not a criminal. You would...RUSSERT: But you would punish the doctor.HUCKABEE: I think if a doctor knowingly took the life of an unborn child for money, and that\'s why he was doing it, yeah, I think you would, you would find some way to sanction that doctor. I don\'t know that you\'d put him in prison, but there\'s something to me untoward about a person who has committed himself to healing people and to making people alive who would take money to take an innocent life and to make that life dead. There\'s something that just doesn\'t ring true about the purpose of medical practice when the first rule of the Hippocratic Oath is ""First, do no harm."" Well, if you take the life and suction out the pieces of an unborn child for no reason than its inconvenience to the mother, I don\'t think you\'ve lived up to your Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm.RUSSERT: October you told me you\'re going to win Iowa caucuses. Are you?HUCKABEE: Oh I hope so, Tim, I really do.RUSSERT: No, you said you were.HUCKABEE: Well, Thursday night I\'ll let you know. But let me tell you this, we\'re being outspent 20-to-1 here. If we do, you\'re going to have a political story like you\'ve never had coming out of Iowa on Friday morning.RUSSERT: Would it be a miracle?HUCKABEE: By my definition?RUSSERT: No, I\'m just teasing.HUCKABEE: Yes, it would.RUSSERT: Governor Huckabee, thank...HUCKABEE: I\'m on record. Yes, it would.RUSSERT: Thanks for joining us.HUCKABEE: Thank you, Tim.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 3, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Iowa Caucuses',"b'You know, I wasn\'t sure that I would ever be able to love a state as much as I love my home state of Arkansas. (LAUGHTER) But tonight, I love Iowa a whole lot. (APPLAUSE) Over the past several months, my family and I have had the marvelous joy and privilege of getting to know many of you. And it\'s been an incredible honor. I was thinking last night that some of the friendships that we\'ve forged here in the last several months are friendships that will last a lifetime. And we didn\'t know how this was going to turn out tonight. But I knew one thing: I would be forever grateful to the people that I met, the ones who voted for me, even the ones who didn\'t, who still treated me with respect and who gave me their attention, who have allowed me to come often, not just into their communities, but into their homes, not once, but time and time again. And a few of them, I even convinced to vote for me tonight and that\'s really remarkable. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I want to say how much I appreciate my wife, Janet. (APPLAUSE) She was a wonderful first lady of Arkansas. (APPLAUSE) And I think she\'ll be a wonderful first lady for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) We also want to say thanks. Our three children are with us tonight. I would like them to come and just be a part of this tonight. They have all been so much involved. Our oldest son, John Mark, our son, David, his wife, Lauren, our daughter, Sarah, who has literally lived in Iowa for the past two and a half months. And I told her if she stayed much longer, she\'ll have to get her an Iowa driver\'s license and probably start paying even more taxes up here. (LAUGHTER) And I say thanks to all of them for joining with us in this effort, because a family goes through it, not just the candidate. But tonight is a celebration for everybody on our team, so many of you who have traveled from all across America to be here. I\'m amazed, but I\'m encouraged, because tonight what we have seen is a new day in American politics. A new day is needed in American politics, just like a new day is needed in American government. And tonight it starts here in Iowa. But it doesn\'t end here. It goes all the way through the other states and ends at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue one year from now. (APPLAUSE) I think we\'ve learned three very important things through this victory tonight. The first thing we\'ve learned is that people really are more important than the purse, and what a great lesson for America to learn. Most of the pundits believe that when you\'re outspent at least 15 to 1, it\'s simply impossible to overcome that mountain of money and somehow garner the level of support that\'s necessary to win an election. Well, tonight we proved that American politics still is in the hands of ordinary folks like you and across this country who believe that it wasn\'t about who raised the most money but who raised the greatest hopes, dreams and aspirations for our children and their future. And tonight I hope we will forever change the way Americans look at their political system and how we elect presidents and elected officials. (APPLAUSE) Tonight, the people of Iowa made a choice, and their choice was clear. Their choice was for a change. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right! But that choice for a change doesn\'t end just saying, ""Let\'s change things."" Change can be for the better. It could be for the worse. Americans are looking for a change. But what they want is a change that starts with a challenge to those of us who were given this sacred trust of office so that we recognize that what our challenge is to bring this country back together, to make Americans, once again, more proud to be Americans than just to be Democrats or Republicans. (APPLAUSE) To be more concerned about being going up instead of just going to the left or to the right. And while we have deep convictions that we\'ll stand by and not waiver on, or compromise -- those convictions are what brought us to this room tonight. But we carry those convictions not so that we can somehow push back the others, but so we can bring along the others and bring this country to its greatest days ever. Because I\'m still one who believes that the greatest generation doesn\'t have to be the ones behind us. The greatest generation can be those who have yet to even be born. (APPLAUSE) And that\'s what we are going to... (APPLAUSE) And, ladies and gentlemen, we\'ve learned something else tonight, and that is that this election is not about me. It\'s about we. And I don\'t say that lightly. I\'m the person whose name gets on the signs, who occasionally gets the attention in some... (LAUGHTER) ... of the few ads that came out here and there. (LAUGHTER) But the election is not about me. And the country is not just about me. What is happening tonight in Iowa is going to start really a prairie fire of new hope and zeal. And it\'s already happening across this nation because it is about we; we the people. We saw it tonight. We\'ve seen it in other states. And we\'re going to continue to see it because this country yearns and is hungry for leadership that recognizes that when one is elected to public office, one is not elected to be a part of the ruling class; he\'s elected to be a part of the serving class. (APPLAUSE) Because we the people are the ruling class of America. (APPLAUSE) G.K. Chesterton once said that a true soldier fights not because he hates those who are in front of him, but because he loves those who are behind him. Ladies and gentlemen, I recognize that running for office, it\'s not hating those who are in front of us. It\'s loving those who are behind us. (APPLAUSE) It\'s recognizing that behind us are great patriots dating back to the beginning of this wonderful country, when 56 brave men put their signatures on a document that started forth the greatest experiment in government in the history of mankind, and gave birth to the idea that all of us are created equal, and we have been given by our creator inalienable rights: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And these who signed that document, who gave birth to this dream, were the beginnings of those throughout our history who have continued, with great sacrifice, extraordinary valor, to pass on to us that liberty and the quest for something better than the generation before them had. I stand here tonight the result of parents who made incredible sacrifices as part of a great generation, who went through a Depression and a world war and said our kids won\'t have to go through these things. And every sacrifice they made were to lift us on their shoulders and give us a better America than they ever could have envisioned. And they were successful in doing that. Now, ladies and gentlemen, for the same reason that our founding fathers and those before us saw what was behind us and gave it their best, I ask you to join me across Iowa and the rest of America to look out there in front of us and not to hate those, but to look behind us and to love them so much that we will do whatever it takes to make America a better country, to give our kids a better future, to give this world a better leader. And we join together tonight for that purpose. God help you and thank you for all you\'ve done. I\'m so grateful for the support, the incredible work that you\'ve done. And now we\'ve got a long journey ahead of us. I wish it were all over tonight, and we could just celebrate the whole thing. But unfortunately, if this were a marathon, we\'ve only run half of it. But we\'ve run it well. And now it\'s on from here to New Hampshire, and then to the rest of the country. But I\'ll always be wanting to come back to this place and say, wherever it ends -- and we know where that\'s going to be -- it started here in Iowa. (APPLAUSE) Thank you and God bless you, every one of you. Thank you tonight. Thank you.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 8, 2008",b'Remarks Following the New Hampshire Primary',"b'Thank you very much. Well, you may like me, but I want to tell you something: I love you guys. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) I have a great, great friend, who is a highly decorated Marine from Vietnam, and he made a statement once. He said, I\'ve never lost at anything I\'ve done. Sometimes the game ended before I got finished playing. Tonight, I was able to call Governor Romney, Senator McCain, and congratulate them on finishing ahead of us, but, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, we were way back in not-so-even sixth place, and nobody thought that we would even be one of the contenders in New Hampshire. (APPLAUSE) But because so many people in this state just worked their hearts out -- and it wasn\'t like we had a whole lot of money to help you with, so you made up for it with hard work, phone calls, e-mails. Frankly, I\'m not sure what all some of you did. I don\'t even want to know. But thank you for getting it done, because tonight we\'re going to come out here with the continued momentum, and I want to just tell you from the depths of my heart that we thought that if we could finish in the top -- we kept saying four or five, we\'d feel pretty good about that, knowing just how tough it\'s been to try to break through. But, tonight, you\'ve given us so much more than we could have imagined just a few days or weeks ago, and over the last few days, we\'ve seen that momentum build and the excitement at our rallies and the enthusiasm of our people and the size of the crowds. And we just sensed that we were going to do better than a lot of people thought that this old unknown Southern boy could possibly do up here in New England. (APPLAUSE) Janet and I want to just pay special tribute to our leaders here. Fred Bramante and Cliff Hurst, our co-chairmen here, have been magnificent, and from the very first day they signed on. My heartfelt thanks to them for a great job of leading our campaign here. Thank you, guys. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) And Fred does want me to remind everybody that today is Elvis\'s birthday, so I just wanted to throw that in. (APPLAUSE) To all these wonderful people on the stage with me from New Hampshire, who have given not just their time, but really they put their reputations on the line for us. And when they came onboard, you have to understand, people were saying, ""You\'re going to endorse who?"" And I want to say how much I appreciate the people in New Hampshire for standing with us. And it wasn\'t because that they could see a few weeks ago some obvious victory. It was because they saw in this country the opportunity to really bring the kind of leadership you and I all know we really need to take America up and not down, and that\'s what we\'re going to continue to do. (APPLAUSE) So many others. Senator Bob Clegg has headed up our legislative effort, and I hope Bob is up on this stage. Thank you, Bob, for a great job. Where were... (APPLAUSE) But all over this state, people like you and others who couldn\'t even be here with us in Manchester tonight certainly recognize the incredible hard work that\'s been put forth. Ladies and gentlemen, we\'ve had the time of our lives. If there\'s any sadness tonight, it\'s not where we finished, because, frankly, we\'re pretty happy about that. (APPLAUSE) But there is some sadness, and let me share with you what it is. Over the past year or so, I\'ve had the incredible joy of making regular visits in and out of New Hampshire, and it got to be where I just knew I was going to be up here two or three times a month and I\'d get to see what has become really not just some casual acquaintances and some friends, but people how have grown as close as family. And I\'m going to tell you something, I always had thought that Southern hospitality was extraordinary and special, and I thought that it was unique to those of us who lived in the deep South. You guys have proven to me that love, friendship, kindness, hospitality and family is not geographical. And tonight I want to express to you, from the depths of my heart, the appreciation that Janet and I feel for all that you have done to make us feel like we\'re part of you and you\'re part of us. And we\'re going to miss coming back over and over every month. (APPLAUSE) But let me tell you something. We\'re going to be back in New Hampshire, because after we secure the nomination, we\'ve got to come up here and make sure we carry New Hampshire. (CROSSTALK) HUCKABEE: And I promise, we keep coming, I\'ll even learn how to say ""chowder."" One final word. Deb Vanderbeek has been our campaign manager here in New Hampshire and has been more than magnificent. She put together a great staff and they did more work with fewer people than anybody\'s campaign could ever have imagined and hoped for. I told her tonight before we came out, I said, ""Deb, if I had it all to do over, I\'d want you to make sure you know that I wouldn\'t ask anybody to manage this campaign in this state, other than you."" And I thank you so much, Deb, for a great job. (APPLAUSE) We may even get a halfway-decent night\'s sleep tonight. We sure are feeling better about you guys. And then from here, we\'re going to head to South Carolina. We\'ll be down there at Greenville, a big rally to kick off. In Michigan and South Carolina and Florida in the next three days, what you helped us continue will be carried right on through, and it won\'t be long, we\'re going to be able to secure this nomination and on to the White House and on to leading America. Thank you, folks. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 13, 2008","b'Interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News\' ""Face the Nation""'","b'SCHIEFFER: And joining us now from Spartanburg, South Carolina, former Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor, good morning. Let\'s go right to the economy because there is, with no question about it, a recession out there in Michigan where this next primary is going to be held. John McCain says some of the jobs have been in--lost in Michigan are simply not coming back. Governor Romney says he\'s going to try to get them back. Where do you come down on this? Isn\'t McCain really right about that? Some of these manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas, it\'s going to be impossible to bring them back. HUCKABEE: Well, when we talk about manufacturing, you need to understand why manufacturing is important to America. It\'s not just about the jobs--though that\'s critical--and we want to be able to be--have the capacity to manufacture because those are the jobs that provide stability for the middle class. It\'s always been a critical part. But there\'s another reason manufacturing is critical for the United States. If we can\'t really produce our own weapons of self defense and we outsource our manufacturing, we\'ve outsourced our freedom. And one of the things that I\'ve said, there\'re three things we have to have for freedom: feed ourselves, fuel ourselves and fight for ourselves. The arsenal to democracy was what Franklin Roosevelt called America, and the heartland of that arsenal has been Michigan, where they really helped us to understand how to produce our airplanes, our tanks, our bullets, our bombs and to build things that provided for us the capacity to be free. If we lose that, we lose more than just jobs. We lose our very basis of freedom. SCHIEFFER: Well, governor, I think everybody would agree with that, but what are you planning to do to get Michigan back on its feet? HUCKABEE: Well, one thing we\'ve done, Bob, we\'ve had free trade agreements that we haven\'t enforced on both sides of the border. I\'m a free trade guy, but I\'m a fair trade guy and that\'s not what\'s happened. When you have one side that cheats by sending in products that are contaminated with lead paint or that makes our pets sick; when you have production methods that pollute the environment and mistreat and violate the human rights of workers, that\'s not a really free trade agreement that\'s being enforced. So a lot of Americans are finding that their government is not trying to help them keep their job, their government is working against them. The United States government ought to work to make sure that, if we\'re going to have free trade agreements, that these are being enforced both sides. Otherwise, it\'s as if the United States government is working for the jobs to go to someplace else. And when you look into the face of a Michigan worker, you look into the face of anxiety, of a person who\'s not sure that he\'s going to be able to get a paycheck, put food on his table and send his kids to college. SCHIEFFER: Governor, do you have any plans for any kind of a cutting taxes to get the economy just, say, on a--on a national--on the national level? Do you have any kind of a plan to bring the country out of a recession? Maybe it\'s not in a recession nationwide, but a lot of people think it\'s very close to that. What do you plan to do about that? HUCKABEE: Well, our tax system is part of the problem, Bob. It penalizes productivity. If you create a graduated tax system that graduates the tax rate on the level of productivity and the level of earning, it\'s counterintuitive to the economy. The reason that I support the fair tax is that it doesn\'t penalize productivity, it simply taxes people at the point of consumption. There\'s $10 trillion of US capital that\'s been moved offshore, marked off in Cayman Island bank accounts... SCHIEFFER: Governor, may I just interrupt you? HUCKABEE: But I just want to make the point that that money is not... SCHIEFFER: Well... HUCKABEE: ...in the United States economy, and it could be. SCHIEFFER: Yes, sir. But that\'s down the road. Let\'s talk about the problem right now. Is immediate action needed? The way you seem to be talking this morning is we can, you know, take these steps down the road. But is there an immediate problem here? HUCKABEE: There\'s several things I\'d do immediately as president. First thing, I\'d make sure we didn\'t raise taxes. In fact, we tried to cut the marginal tax rates to stimulate the economy. Secondly, I\'d make sure that we targeted particularly high unemployment states like Michigan with job retraining programs, and we\'d use the Commerce Department and we\'d use every resource that we had to try to make sure that we bring business and industry with incentives to some of these hard-hit areas so that we can keep the jobs. The final thing I\'d do is I\'d insist that we enforce both sides of the trade agreements that we have, and that we\'d take a much harder look at the way that they\'re being carried out on the other side. The American worker going to his job today needs to know that his government is working for him, not against him. SCHIEFFER: Governor, Governor Romney ripped you pretty good this morning on your ads that you\'re running about how you cut taxes down in Arkansas. He said, quote, ""it is disingenuous"" that you raised taxes. HUCKABEE: You know, he\'s been throwing that at me for all this time. Here\'s what I know: He raised the fees in Massachusetts by over half a billion dollars. I took Arkansas, with the firstever broad-based tax cuts in its 160-year history. We were one of 27 states that were under a state Supreme Court order to fix our schools, which we did. And by the way, this past week, Bob, got some good news. Arkansas schools are now rated the eighth best in the nation. That\'s a long way from 49th. And that\'s how you build jobs, you educate kids, you make sure people have access to health care. We took a $200 million deficit, I left the state with an $850 million surplus. The business community supported what we did, they were supportive of the road-building program. I did not leave my roads and bridges falling apart when I was governor. I took one of the worst road systems, turned it into what Truckers magazine said was the most improved road system. Ronald Reagan would have been criticized by Mitt Romney today, just like Mitt Romney criticized Ronald Reagan a few years ago when he said he wasn\'t part of that Reagan-Bush thing. SCHIEFFER: Well... HUCKABEE: But I was a part of that Reagan thing, and I just want to conclude: Ronald Reagan raised taxes when he was governor because governors balance budgets and act responsibly. But he also believed that lower taxes are better than higher taxes, and I believe that. And I believe less government is better than more government. And I govern that way. But you balance the budget, you don\'t leave debts for the next generation. And that\'s what people in America are looking for is competence, not political judgment, but principled judgment. SCHIEFFER: But you did raise taxes, didn\'t you, governor? I mean, in addition to cutting taxes, you did raise some taxes. HUCKABEE: Bob, when you\'re under a supreme court order, you do what you need to improve your schools, I worked with our legislature and we got major, really improvements done in our school system that, without, our kids would still be languishing in last place. I don\'t apologize for raising the expectations and the hopes and the opportunities for the kids of my state. SCHIEFFER: All right. HUCKABEE: I don\'t apologize for building roads, either. I\'d apologize for leaving my roads in a mess, is what I\'d be apologizing for if I hadn\'t have done it. SCHIEFFER: All right. Governor, we\'re going to take a quick break. We\'ll come back and talk about this some more. (Announcements) SCHIEFFER: And we\'re back now with Mike Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, talking about the state the--of the economy out there in Michigan, you know, you\'ve been a governor, you were a Baptist preacher. While you were doing all that, Mitt Romney was a businessman and he was a very successful businessman, and he took over a lot of companies and he put them back to making money and made them successful. Why would you argue that you\'re better qualified to get Michigan back on its feet than, say, Governor Romney? HUCKABEE: Because as a governor, I got Arkansas back on its feet. We had the largest number of job creations in the history of our state. We had the lowest unemployment numbers consistently in the history of our state. You know, what Mitt Romney did is admirable in some quarters, but in some ways, there are a lot of people who lost their jobs when his company would take over, restructure a company, lay a lot of people off. Lot of times the CEOs and the people at the top got some pretty huge bonuses and made a lot of money. A lot of people went home without a pension and a paycheck. I\'m not sure that\'s what Michigan\'s looking for. I think what America\'s looking for--not just Michigan, but the rest of the country--is somebody that understands how to lead in a way that, when he\'s completed his leading, he can get re-elected. And I didn\'t just get elected one time and say that\'s it, but I continually went back to the voters of my state, and my leadership was affirmed by them. And that\'s pretty remarkable when you are a Republican in a state that\'s been dominated by Democrats for all those years. And even when I became governor, 90 percent of elected officials were of the Democratic Party. SCHIEFFER: Let\'s just talk about a little bit about the politics of all this now. What do you have to do out in Michigan? Do you think you can win that state? Or would you be satisfied with second? HUCKABEE: Well, I mean, we\'re going to be satisfied with being in the mix. Because John McCain won there eight years ago; he\'s got a good organization, is a known quantity, but I think people are beginning to say ""maybe we need someone from a new generation, someone who\'s not a Washingtonian, somebody who comes from the practicality of actually leading a state.\' Mitt Romney grew up there, graduated high school there. His dad was governor there. His last name opens doors. I assure you, my last name hadn\'t opened a single door in Michigan. But I think people in Michigan are looking for somebody who relates to the way that they\'ve struggled, and that\'s one of the reasons our campaign is even in play. Without a staff, without a big organization, it\'s about heart, message and soul. And if we can recapture the soul of the Republican Party, we can recapture the soul of America. I\'m not going to predict a win in Michigan, but I\'m going to predict that we\'ll surprise people by even being a contender. SCHIEFFER: You know, you and Senator McCain have been very nice to each other. You\'ve had some harsh words, though, for Governor Huckabee. Are you and Senator McCain in some way in cahoots? HUCKABEE: Well, you said harsh words for Governor Huckabee. I assure you, I\'ve never said a harsh about Governor Huckabee. SCHIEFFER: I mean Governor Romney. I beg your pardon. HUCKABEE: I\'ll say very nice things about Governor Huckabee. I think Senator McCain and I have a mutual respect for each other. We\'re both going after the same job, but I hope we\'ve proved that you don\'t have to be angry and hostile and tear someone else down, you just ought to share what you have, what you bring to the job and let the voters make the choice. John McCain and I have tried to operate with a level of civil discourse that I am convinced a lot of Americans are hungry for in politics. SCHIEFFER: Governor Huckabee--and you are Governor Huckabee--thank you very much. We appreciate it. HUCKABEE: Thanks, Bob. Good to be with you again.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 15, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Michigan Primary',"b'Thank you. Thanks so very much. You guys have been waiting -- I hear we have between 800 and 1,000 people packed in this place. Please don\'t call the fire marshal. (LAUGHTER) First of all, I want to say a special word of thanks to the people in Michigan. They\'ve been wonderful to us over the past few days. You know, we were outspent 50:1, and for us to be able to do as well as we did is a remarkable testament to some incredible volunteers up there. I congratulate Mitt Romney. He won a great race. He worked hard. He, of course, has a great base there, but our hats are off to him for his victory there tonight. So it looks like that I won Iowa; John McCain won New Hampshire; Mitt Romney won Michigan. Ladies and gentlemen, we\'re going to win South Carolina! (APPLAUSE) We put a flag in the ground here Saturday. We\'re going to make it real clear, that the first-in-the-South primary is going to give their support to the first-in-the-South candidate who understands that this nation needs leadership, and leadership that comes right from the earth and right from the heart of the people. Months ago, when none of the other Republicans were talking about the economy, when they all said it was doing great, I said you better keep your eye on it, because if you just not spend your time talking to people, but if you spend some time listening to people, you\'re going to find out that there\'s a world of hurt out there in America. Now, all of them are realizing that what I said months ago is true. And we need the kind of leadership that not only sees it first, but does something about it first, and that\'s what I pledge to the people of America. (APPLAUSE) Give me a chance to lead, and we will lead this country. And we\'ll change the tax system. And we\'ll also make it so that your government doesn\'t work against you in your job, but helps work for you, because good government ought to facilitate the free enterprise system; it ought not to complicate the free enterprise system. That\'s why we need lower, not higher taxes. It\'s why we need a government that understands that mothers and fathers raise better kids than governments do. Get the government off mom and dad\'s back and let them raise their families. It\'s why it\'s also true that over the past few months, people who said, who is this Huckabee guy? Where is he coming from? I\'ll tell you where I\'m coming from. I\'m coming from you, and a lot of people around this country are realizing that it\'s time that the presidency and that the government is not headquartered so much in Washington, D.C., as is headquartered in the small towns across this country, where people do the work and put food on the table for their families and get their kids to school. And they basically just want a government that is as small as it can be, but what government there has to be does two things -- one, protects our borders, protects out security and makes it so we\'re safe in this nation; and the second thing, leaves us alone so that we can live our lives and live in this free enterprise system and give small business a chance to survive and even thrive. That\'s what America\'s really looking for. (APPLAUSE) And that\'s what they\'re going to get when we get elected. (APPLAUSE) I\'m deeply grateful for the kind of support we\'re getting in South Carolina. And today, when we were here in rallies in Sumter and in Rock Hill, huge crowds, enthusiastic crowds. And we told folks, look, between now and Saturday, we don\'t want you to just go and say, ""oh, I\'ll vote for you."" We want you to go and say, ""I\'ll vote for you and I\'ll get folks out there to go with me to vote."" And I\'ve said, if you\'re going to vote for me, don\'t let anything keep you from it. If you\'re not going to vote for me, don\'t even show up. (LAUGHTER) If you know somebody that\'s not going to vote for me, let the air out of their tires Saturday. (LAUGHTER) You know, a lot of these politicians will say, now, it doesn\'t matter who you vote for, as long as you vote. You\'ll never hear me say that, because it matters who you vote for! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) And I want to tell you something. For the past several months, it\'s been our desire, our commitment, and now it is our determination that we\'re not just going to do well in South Carolina. You know, the Campbell (ph) family -- and I\'m so grateful for Mike Campbell and his family -- they\'re kind of the gold standard of South Carolina politics. And every year since 1980, when they picked Ronald Reagan when he was in fourth place and he was the Republican candidate that the establishment didn\'t like and didn\'t want, back even then, the Campbell family said, ""this is who we\'re going to support."" And they picked a winner. And every presidential election since that time, the Campbell family has batted 1000. They haven\'t been wrong yet. And I want to make something absolutely, perfectly clear. We aren\'t about to let the Campbell family down in 2008. (APPLAUSE) They\'re going to still be picking a winner this week. (APPLAUSE) David Beasley\'s been here with me. He and I have been governors together, close friends. Our wives are close friends. And I can tell you that there\'s nobody more fired up for us in all of South Carolina than David Beasley. And folks, over the next few days, I\'m sure you\'re going to hear some things, well, here\'s all the stuff about Mike Huckabee. That\'s fine. Just remember, you know, as my pastor used to tell me as a little kid, when you\'re getting kicked in the behind, it proves you\'re still out front. So we\'ll probably take a little kicking out here. (APPLAUSE) All that does is prove we\'re still out front. And I want you to help us this week. Let me tell you why it\'s so important. Because we need to prove that electing a president is not just about how much money a candidate has. It\'s about whether he can lead this country and reflect the views and the values of the people that really are the heart and the soul of America.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 19, 2008",b'Remarks Following the South Carolina Primary',"b""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you and thank you. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. AUDIENCE: Huckabee! Huckabee! Huckabee! Huckabee! Huckabee! Huckabee! HUCKABEE: Thank you. Thank you. AUDIENCE: Huckabee! Huckabee! HUCKABEE: Thank you. Well, just a few moments ago, I made a phone call to Senator McCain and I offered him my congratulations. I told him that I would much rather prefer that he had called me tonight, but he was very gracious, as we knew he would be, and I was certainly willing to compliment him. I want to thank him for running a civil and a good and a decent campaign to elevate politics. And he is to be congratulated. (APPLAUSE) One of the things I'm proud of, those of us, the two of us who finished at the top, ran a campaign with a level of civility, without attacking each other, and even though I would like for the outcome to be just a little different on the top than in the second place, I had rather be where I am and have done it with honor than to have won with the dishonor of getting there by attacking somebody else. And I'm grateful. (APPLAUSE) I am grateful for the campaign that you have been willing to run with me and grateful for the campaign that he has run as well. Well, obviously tonight we wanted to come here and to declare a South Carolina victory. We got awful close. Unfortunately, in politics, close doesn't count for the first slot, but it does count. And the reason that I want to encourage you tonight is to remind you that politics, and particularly this year more than perhaps any other, this is not an event, it is a process. And the process is far, far from over. (APPLAUSE) Obviously, I'm deeply grateful to our South Carolina team working their hearts out. To Mike Campbell, our state chairman, his wonderful mother, Iris Campbell, I thank you so very much. God bless you. (APPLAUSE) To my friend, former governor David Beasley and his wife Mary Wood, once again stuck his neck out and just was able to campaign with me all over this country, and here in South Carolina, and I just want to thank him also for jumping in. And we'll look forward to having him on the trail in other places as well. (APPLAUSE) For Lieutenant Andre Bauer, and for his willingness to endorse us this week. And in many ways, I believe that we will leave South Carolina not only with incredible numbers of friends, but I believe with a renewed unity in the Republican Party of South Carolina, bringing these two men, Mike Campbell and Andre Bauer, to the same stage. And both of them have an incredibly great future, as does South Carolina, a most wonderful state. And I'm grateful for all you have done. (APPLAUSE) I cannot begin to say thanks enough for our staff. These are the people that, honestly, I don't know how many weeks a person can go without sleep, but they are going to test the absolute outer limits of it before this campaign is over. Most campaigns have three people to one that we have on our staff. And they have just worked not with complaint, but with a commitment that I have never seen ever. And then the volunteers. Many of you have come here from all over America at your own expense. It's incredible. And we've had people that literally have made phone calls for us, some of whom are in Europe, and they've used their free cell phone weekend minutes to make calls back to South Carolina and encourage people to come vote. It's been unbelievable. (APPLAUSE) Let me just say that tonight is not a time to start asking, what if? It's a time to start talking about, what now? And we're not going to sit around and second guess, well, what if we had done -- what if -- no. You know what? I feel like that our effort here, we gave everything we had. We left it all on the field. I don't want anyone who worked in this campaign, from our volunteers to our staff, to feel anything other than an extraordinary sense of pride, and also a sense of just sheer joy that we got as far as we did when nobody thought it was even possible for us to be in contention. (APPLAUSE) Let me tell you and remind you how we got here. It wasn't because we had the most money, the most consultants, the most staff, the most resources, the most polls, the most focus groups. Here is what we had. What we had was we had a message that has connected and continues to connect with people all over this country who have feared that they have been forgotten and have become invisible to many political people. And they fear that maybe they matter just as much, because what they really want is they want a government that will take the heavy burden of taxation off their backs. They want a government that will start thinking about how much money it's spending and stop it. And finally start acting with some level of sanity when it comes to spending the very dollars they have taken from us. People want a government that recognizes that mothers and fathers really do raise better children than governments do. And they want a government that leaves them alone so they can raise their children as they see fit, not with the government telling them how. (APPLAUSE) They want a government who will finally build a fence, secure our borders, and confront the issue not just of illegal immigration, but confront the greater issue that is plaguing so many people in South Carolina and the rest of America, and that is the fear that tomorrow they will lose their jobs and not be able to put food on their table and clothes on their kids' backs. And for every person out there who is serving the food and driving the trucks and who's sitting in the front of the cabs and not the back seat, for the ones who are on the lines of the factories and climbing up and down the ladders, carrying paint buckets in their hands and hammers, we want to be a campaign that says there is room in the Republican Party for you. And, in fact, the Republican Party is all about making sure that everybody in this country has the best kind of future. And that message and that mission is far from over tonight. And that's why I don't want us to leave here saying, well, the game has ended. No, we have just finished one of the quarters of play. My dear friend Clebe McClary, who I love to quote on occasions like this, who is a South Carolinian, I love what he says. He says I have never lost at anything I have ever done. Sometimes the game ends before I get finished playing, but I have never lost at anything I have done. (APPLAUSE) And ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know we don't lose tonight. The game ended a little early for us. But I also want you to know this -- the path to the White House is not ending here tonight. We are resetting the clock. We are resetting all of the gauges. (APPLAUSE) We have learned. And tomorrow, after a little bit of sleep, we wake up to fight the battle yet again and yet again. And I still believe a year from now all of you that have helped us get there will be in Washington for the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Let me say a final word of thanks to my wife Janet and my children. It's tough to run for office. The only thing more difficult than running for office is to be married to the guy who does. And she has been willing and ready and has given her all, and has never flinched in her undying support for what we're about. And I want to say to every one of you how much we love you, how much we thank you. The people of South Carolina have been magnificent to us. Your hospitality, your warmth, your support, your encouragement, the enthusiasm, and everything you have done for us, I just cannot begin to tell you what a deep and wonderful impression you have left with us. Even if we didn't come in first in the results tonight, you have come in first in our hearts by giving us the kind of wonderful experience that everybody in life ought to just once be able to have. I'm even wearing this South Carolina tie tonight. And... (APPLAUSE) And wearing it with an extraordinary sense of gratitude and pride as a symbol and a reminder of how grateful we are to your wonderful, gifts to us, and your love and your support. It's on from here. And tomorrow in Texas. Monday in Georgia and Florida. And then on in Florida again. We have got a lot of miles ahead of us. It's a long process and a long path. But I want to make sure that you know that after you get just a little bit of sleep, we need you back ready, able and willing to take it to the White House. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, every one of you. Thank you."""
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"January 29, 2008",b'Remarks Following the Florida Primary',"b""Well, folks, I wanted to tell you what we're doing. We are rehearsing for the victory speech we'll be able to give about Missouri next week. (APPLAUSE) I was kind of hoping for a warm welcome in Missouri and there's about 50-mile-an-hour winds and snow out here. I wish that I had brought the Florida weather with me today. I think we would have all enjoyed that very much. Well, I think we're all aware that the situation in Florida is that we're going to be in a position looking at either third or fourth. Now, for those of you that think I should be discouraged, let me just remind you that going into tonight, we were second in delegate count and, more importantly, we're playing all nine innings of this ballgame. (APPLAUSE) Even the Cardinals occasionally have a rough inning, but they know how to win championships. What I want to express to you is next week, when we are going to be in Missouri and Oklahoma and Arkansas and Tennessee and Alabama and Georgia and all of these states where we're leading in the polls, and we're still going to be leading next week, we're going to have a great opportunity to start taking it all the way home to the nomination and to the White House, and it's going to happen a lot because of Missouri next week. (APPLAUSE) And we appreciate the great support we're getting. I want to say thanks to the people of Florida. There's going to be probably, before it's over, maybe up to 300,000 people down there who worked their hearts out for us and those people, I can't tell you how proud I am of them, because they had no resources. Others have spent millions and millions of dollars. We knew that we wouldn't have those kind of resources to play there. So we went out there and just worked with people who would come out, put their own signs out, buy their own t-shirts and hats. A lady in Pensacola, she and her daughter put out 700 signs, just the two of them, in one day. Unbelievable. And that's the kind of thing that's happening across this country with our campaign that a lot of people still haven't figured out. And when you look at what we have done with what we have, it's a remarkable story that is not even close to being over. In fact, we like to believe we're just really getting started. (APPLAUSE) There are some great folks down there. Our chairman, Senator Daniel Webster, and our co-chairman, House Speaker Marco Rubio, and a host of great Floridians who have been extremely dedicated to our task. I don't want them to feel discouraged. I want them instead to feel very proud of their effort and be as half as proud of their effort as I am of them and the wonderful work that they've done for us. I know it's a little tight in this room. We really anticipated that we might have 100 people. We thought that about half of this would be enough, and we did not expect the weather to be this bad. And I don't know if you're coming here because you're escaping then cold and the heat is out in your house, but because of the weather, we've got to get to California tonight. So our exit will be a little quicker than we had wanted it to be, and I apologize in advance for that, but I'm sure you understand that we've got to be at the Reagan Library tomorrow night. So we're flying out as soon as we leave here, headed to California, because I'm going to be on that stage tomorrow night. I'm not sure everybody's going to be there, but I will be. (APPLAUSE) And I need you here in Missouri to join with us in being a part of a wonderful volunteer army across this country who believes that it would be a better America if we did not have the IRS making it... (APPLAUSE) ... and that believe that it would be a better America if we did stand up for human life and traditional marriage. (APPLAUSE) And that it would be a better America if we actually sealed our borders and became energy independent within 10 years. (APPLAUSE) And that it would be a better America if we had a country that once again believed in its future and believed that it's not so much just about Democrats versus Republicans and the left versus the right and liberals versus conservatives, it's about Americans building a better future for their kids and their grandkids and taking this country up and not down. And that's why people are with us and across this country, we're finding homemakers and truck drivers and people who wait tables, as well as folks who work in the lines at the factories, and people who run their own business, and I want to be the president who reminds America that that small business owner out there, every day, working hard and taking a risk is the person that ought to believe that his government is going to be out there to under-gird him, not undermine his every move, and we're going to make sure that happens in this country. (APPLAUSE) And you're going to help be a part of that. I wish we had cooked food for all of you. I bet right now you're wishing it, too. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fried chicken. HUCKABEE: Fried chicken. I gave it up a few years ago. But I do know how to eat it if I ever get it, that's right. I want to, again, express my thanks to Ray Wagner (ph) and all of the folks here in Missouri who have been working with us, Jeff Rowe (ph) and so many others who have just helped us have great confidence that between now and seven days from now, there's going to be something that we'll all be shouting about. And it won't just be a Missouri victory, but also, that same night, there'll be one in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee, and there'll be one in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and maybe a few other places that people aren't even expecting it to happen. Thank you folks for being here. God bless every one of you. Pray hard, work hard, get the votes out. Remember this -- if they're going to vote for me, make sure they come. If they're not, don't let them out of their driveway. Thank you, folks. God bless you. Thank you."""
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"February 5, 2008","b'Remarks Following the ""Super Tuesday"" Primaries and Caucuses'","b'Well, thank you. You know, over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two-man race. Well, you know what? It is. And we\'re in it! (APPLAUSE) Tonight, we are making sure America understands that sometimes one small smooth stone is even more effective than a whole lot of armor. (APPLAUSE) And we\'ve also seen that ""The Widow\'s Might"" has more effectiveness than all the gold in the world. (APPLAUSE) Janet and I and our family and team want to begin by saying thanks, first of all, to the wonderful of people of Arkansas, where it all started and where tonight we have a wonderful, wonderful victory here at home. (APPLAUSE) We love this state, always have and always will. And tonight we\'re reminded again why -- because of the incredible people who believed in us early and stayed with us through all of the times when so many people said you can\'t get there. And tonight we\'re proving that we\'re still on our feet, and much to the amazement of many, we\'re getting there, folks. We\'re getting there. (APPLAUSE) We have been standing for small business owners who know that government has for way too long had its foot on their neck, with taxes that were too high, regulations that were too onerous. The threat of litigation made it impossible for many small business owners to survive. And our party once stood to make sure that we helped clear the way so that the free market system really worked. And we\'re going do it again because one of these days when I get to be president -- and it won\'t be very long, about a year from now... (APPLAUSE) ... I really do look forward to nailing the ""going out of business"" sign on the front door of the IRS. (APPLAUSE) And when we have the fair tax, a lot of small business owners and individuals will finally have a fair shot of getting a part of the American dream. (APPLAUSE) We\'re here tonight and winning states across the South because we\'ve stood for the idea that mothers and fathers raise better kids than governments do. And government ought to undergird a family, not undermine a basic family\'s rights to raise their own kids. And that\'s one of the reasons we\'re here tonight. We\'re here tonight because people want to know that the president is going to secure our borders and make it so it\'s not more difficult to get on an airplane in your hometown than it is to cross the international border, and that we\'re going to fix an issue that the federal government has allowed to go unchallenged for a long, long time. We\'re here tonight because a lot of people in the South and across America know that the Second Amendment is to be respected as much as the First Amendment. And they know that there\'s only one candidate who has a consistent record of making sure we do that. (APPLAUSE) And one of the reasons that we\'re here tonight is because there\'s no candidate who has been more consistent and clear about the fact that we should honor the words of our forefathers who said all of us are created equal. And that means that every single person has intrinsic worth and value. And we should uphold the sanctity of human life because it is a cornerstone of our culture of life. And Ladies and Gentlemen, tonight I believe that one of the things you\'re saying across the nation is that people are saying the conservatives do have a choice because the conservatives have a voice. And tonight, they\'re getting a chance to express that. And from here, they\'ll get to continue expressing that choice and that voice. (APPLAUSE) Now, it\'s tough for this old razorback to say things like roll, tide roll, but I\'m doing it tonight. (APPLAUSE) And it\'s tough for this old razorback to look over there to the state just to the east of us and anticipate being able to say that we\'re two (ph) volunteers. I think before the night is over, I\'ll even be singing ""Rocky Top."" (APPLAUSE) This old razorback may even catch some bulldog fever before the night is over. And we\'re going to forget all about the Cotton Bowl and even be grateful for our friends to the north before tonight night is over, I\'m fully believing. But tonight is far more important than contests between the rivalry of some of our states in athletics, starting today with the wonderful people of West Virginia who gave us a surprising, stunning, and wonderful victory. (APPLAUSE) Today has been a day when the people have spoken. And today people across this country are saying that, yes, we heard what the pundits said. But this is our vote, not theirs. This is our election, not theirs. This is our presidency, not theirs. (APPLAUSE) And for all those people who have made sacrifices to help us be here, I want to say thank you. And I also want you to know that as long as there\'s still votes and delegates to be won until that magic number of 1,191, there\'s going be one guy answering the bell every time there\'s a new round. (APPLAUSE) Sometimes -- sometimes elections have a way of tearing us apart even within our own party. But the ultimate purpose, that we\'re all in this, is not to see our party divided, and it most certainly is not to see our country divided. We got in this because we wanted to see our party pull together again, but even more than our party, as important as this is, it\'s far more important that we bring this nation back together where we once again... (APPLAUSE) ... where we realize that our greatest strength is not in the government we elect, but it\'s in the ordinary people who do the choosing. It still is a land of the people. And we\'re going to continue to prove that, even with limited resources but lots of heart, the presidency can belong to the people of this country. When I started out as a little kid, believe me, I never thought I\'d even see a president within eyesight of me physically. And I\'ve often told the story, I\'m 8 year\'s old, and my dad said, ""Son, I\'m going to take you down to hear a speech by the governor. He\'s coming down to our part of the state. And governors didn\'t get here very often."" And boy they didn\'t. And he\'s said, ""I want you to go down and hear the speech because he\'s dedicating a lake. And you needed to hear that because, son, you may live your whole life and you may never actually get to see a governor in person."" Little did he know that that boy would become the 44th governor of the state of Arkansas and serve this wonderful state for 10 and a half years. (APPLAUSE) And I\'m pretty sure that he could have never ever even dreamed that one day I\'d be standing here tonight and I\'d be saying, folks, in a few more months, you\'ll help me become the 44th president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you. AUDIENCE: We love Mike! We love Mike! We love Mike! We love Mike! MR. HUCKABEE: And we love you guys. I want -- I want to say a word of thanks to my family, but especially all these folks who are with us tonight, joining our family to say thanks. But there\'s nobody who has had to put up with more, no one who has paid a higher price to go through all of this for the past 13 months than my partner of almost 34 years, my wife, my friend, your next first lady of America. And I want her to join me in saying thank you. Janet Huckabee. (APPLAUSE)'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"February 9, 2008",b'Remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference',"b'Thank you, first of all, Star Parker, my dear friend and true supporter. And thank all of you for being this alive and this energetic on a Saturday morning, early.It is sometimes asked of me, why is it that I\'m a conservative? After all, I come from a state that doesn\'t have a whole lot of history of conservatism, and certainly not Republicanism.Well, a lot of it is that, as you know, I get asked all these ""God"" questions in the debates. And I guess, in a way, it\'s appropriate, because my conservatism is rooted in my understanding of the Scriptures. [cheers and applause] And here\'s why. Ecclesiastes chapter 10, verse two, says that ""A wise man\'s heart directs him toward the right, but a foolish man\'s heart directs him toward the left."" There you have it. [cheers and applause]Let me explain some things about the way I grew up in south Arkansas, where there were no Republicans native to Hempstead County. I came from the little town of Hope. I know you\'ve heard of it before. And, yes, there was another obscure, unknown governor who couldn\'t win the presidency who came from Hope, Arkansas too. But as I\'ve often said, give us one more chance, folks. [applause]I was in an airplane and a guy sitting next to me several months ago was, I think, just trying to throw up some conversation. So he turned to me and he said, ""Hey, mister, I\'ve got a joke I want to tell you. It\'s about this politician from Hope, Arkansas."" I said, ""Excuse me, sir. I need to let you know something before you embarrass yourself. I am a politician from Hope, Arkansas."" He looked over at me and he said, ""Oh, that\'s all right, son. I\'ll tell it real slow."" (Laughter.)When I grew up, I came from a family where there were three basic heroes in our household: Jesus, Elvis and FDR. Like so many kids of the South, it was sort of just inbred in us that we were all Democrats. Now, it wasn\'t because folks there were so much liberal, but there was just this sort of gravitation toward it. In fact, there were only seven Republicans that I knew of in my entire home county. Every one of them had moved in from either Kentucky, Indiana or Illinois. None of them were native to Hempstead County. There used to be a saying that ""There are no Republicans here except the ones that either moved in or had been messed with.""Well, I was one of those guys that at some point got messed with, and here\'s what happened. As a teenager, I went to work for a gentleman by the name of Haskell Jones. He was the manager of the local radio station, and he gave me a job. I look back and I think what an incredible thing. Here\'s a guy that looked at a 14-year-old kid and saw something in him and said, ""I want you to work for me."" And he was one of those seven Republicans who had moved in from somewhere.He loved this country. He was a great patriot. He understood the blessings of America. And even though I had not grown up in a Republican household, I understood something about the blessings of America. I was raised to love this country. I was not allowed to be unkind toward it.My parents, though, they were not well-educated; just hard- working, blue-collar types that barely could make the rent payments on the little rent house we lived in on 2nd Street in Hope, Arkansas; a father that worked two jobs, one as a fireman, the other as a mechanic, the kind of dad who got grit and grime under his fingernails every single day because he did the work of heavy lifting and hard labor; the kind of household where the only soap we had in our house was Lava soap. That means I was in college before I found out it\'s not supposed to hurt when you take a shower. (Laughter, applause.)My father never graduated high school. In fact, no male upstream from me in my entire family lineage had ever graduated high school. I would be the first, and the first to ever go into college. [applause]My mother was the oldest of seven children and grew up in a household where her early childhood was spent with dirt floors, no electricity, outdoor toilets. I\'m a generation away from the abject poverty that plagued so many people of the Deep South who went through the Great Depression and world war, but a part of what we often call the greatest generation, because they did not live for their own comforts. They lived so their children would have a better life than them. And that\'s why many of us live better today than we ever could have dreamed. [applause]Because of what they and others like them in their generation instilled in me, I grew up believing that no matter where you started in this country, it wasn\'t where you had to stop. And that was the greatness of America is that we had individual freedom, that our freedom was not tied to the group to which we were automatically or arbitrarily connected. Our freedom was tied to our own individual souls. It was a gift from God, not our government. And therefore, no one could take it from us because no one gave it to us. [applause]It was instilled in me that because freedom is individual, personal responsibility is also individual and was upon me and that I could not expect somebody or the government to do for me what I was supposed to do for myself. [cheers and applause]When I went to work for Haskell Jones, this great patriot and Republican, he began to help me crystallize what I understood was part of a greater movement. This was in the 1960s, in 1968 and 1969, and this country was literally burning with riots and dissent. And we remember the Democratic National Convention, when the whole world was watching, and they were.And there was a real definite choice that year, a choice. Would we be a country of law and order or law of mayhem? And that further helped crystallize my view that I believed in law and order, not mayhem. I believed that some things were right and some things were wrong, and when we went with the right, we had strength. And when we saw that there was no moral center and there was nothing that really ever could be defined a moral absolute, then we were lost and confused.I also was handed a book by Haskell Jones when I was a teenager. It was a book that was called ""It\'s a Choice, not an Echo,"" written by Phyllis Schlafly. [applause] And that book had a tremendous impact on me as a teenager. Quite frankly, that book reminded me that in all of our lives, we should not simply be echoing the sentiments of others, but making deep personal choices about what we believe and, most importantly, why we believe it.I realize that it is not politically correct to say what I\'m about to say, but I\'ve believed it since I was a teenager, and I will not recant it now. The reason that America is a great nation is because America is a special nation. And the reason America is a special nation is because it was founded by people who were first on their knees before they were on their feet. We are a nation rooted in our faith. [cheers and applause]I\'ve had the incredible privilege and joy to have visited almost 40 countries across the world. I\'ve seen some magnificent things, experienced some dramatic and exotic cultures, tasted some delicious foods, experienced the hospitality and the warmth of many peoples, of many nations. I\'ve sat and visited with heads of state, with heads of companies, and with ordinary people in virtually every part of this world, whether Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, nine times to Israel, to Russia, to all parts of Asia, Europe, Central America.But in all of my travels and all of the ways in which I\'ve touched other parts of the world, I\'ve yet to find any country, as enchanted as I was with it, for which I would even consider for a moment giving up my citizenship in the United States of America to trade it for residence anywhere else on earth. [applause]We are a special nation. [applause] And we are a special nation because, throughout our history, we have been people who have made choices rather than simply echo the voices of others. I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I want to make sure you understand. Am I quitting? Well, let\'s get that settled right now. No, I\'m not. [cheers and applause]And the reason is simple  because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn\'t easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the ""Me, too"" crowd.But I didn\'t get where I am today and I didn\'t fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it\'s better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd. [cheers and applause]When I was a teenager, there was a phrase that came late in the \'60s and early \'70s that sort of was a mantra for many of us as conservatives. And quite frankly, I remember it on bumper strips. It said, ""My Country, Right or Wrong."" And I guess many of us subscribe to that view that it is my country, right or wrong.But the real history of that statement goes back to the 1800s, when a senator from Missouri named Carl Schurz, who served from 1869 to 1875, a German immigrant who came to this country, later elected to the U.S. Senate, once served in a president\'s Cabinet after that, died in the early 1900s.But the point of context of the statement is this. He said, ""My country, right or wrong. When it\'s right, we will keep it right. And when it\'s wrong, we will make it right."" (Cheers.) And ladies and gentlemen, that ought to be the heart cry of every conservative. [applause] When it is right, we will keep it right. But when it is wrong, we will make it right.I want to say again that freedom does not exist in a vacuum. It has to have moral clarity. We have to believe that murder, lying, stealing are wrong or freedom doesn\'t work. Freedom has to always operate in the context in which responsibility is the other wing of the airplane on our individual freedom and choice.If we, as a nation, ever fail to understand that, then we will disintegrate and become like many of the cultures that we today have to confront and, in fact, fight, who do not believe that it is wrong to murder, even to murder one\'s own child for the sake of the political cause of Islamo-fascism.What separates us from that very culture out to destroy us is that it never would be conceivable to us that we would strap a bomb to the belly of our own children and march our own child into a room full of innocent people to detonate the bomb in order to make a political point, because we believe some things are right and some things are wrong. And we would believe it wrong to kill our own children for a purpose beneath that. [cheers and applause]But we also believe that there are some things that are right. For example, as conservatives, we believe that it is right to protect the sovereignty of the United States and to make sure that we never, ever, for any circumstance, under any purpose, ever yield one ounce of our sovereignty over to some international tribunal. [cheers and applause]That\'s why we have to fight  (continued applause)  that\'s why we need to fight against the Law of the Sea Treaty and make sure that it gets a good burial at sea. That\'s why we should say no to Kyoto, because it\'s not giving over  (applause)  our sovereignty. And it\'s why any time some United States judge who has taken an oath to the Constitution of the United States should invoke some international law as a basis upon which to make a decision, he should be summarily impeached for having done so. [cheers and applause]It is right to have a strong military. In fact, one of the mistakes that we have made is we have allowed ourselves to believe that the peace dividend of the Clinton administration is something that is anything less than has become now the war deficit, because we have failed to keep our military spending up to the level at which we can have the troop strength that we desperately need.That\'s why, in the next election cycle, and hopefully in the next administration, we will return to the kind of at least GDP spending that we had during the Reagan years, because, quite frankly, the quickest path and the surest path to peace is to make sure that we have the kind of military that no one on earth wants to engage in a battle, knowing full well they don\'t stand a chance. [cheers and applause]It is right for us to be on the offense against Islamo-fascism and not wait until they attack us. And on this, we need to salute the president for the fact that he has not been willing to wait until they attack us again on our soil. [cheers and applause]Unlike any war we have ever fought in this nation, this is not a war for soil. This is a war for our soul. We will either win it or we will lose it. And this nation must rally to the point where we recognize there is no compromise. There is no alternative. We must win. They must lose. Islamo-fascism must disappear from the face of the earth or we will. [cheers and applause]It is right for us to believe in a government that gives to us lower taxes and less government and controls spending. And I know that you believe that that is the what. But let me share with you the why  because I think sometimes in the political debates of today we miss the point. This goes not to the heart just of a political argument but to a moral one.When government takes more from us and confiscates more of our earnings than it has a right to confiscate for the basic purpose of government, which is not to provide for us but merely to protect us so that we may provide for ourselves, then it has robbed us of our capacity to raise our own families and to engage in what gives us strength economically, and that is a free-market system. [cheers and applause]The reason that our tax system is irreparably broken is because in this city it is not really run anymore by 535 members of Congress but the 35,000 lobbyists, 70 to one to the members of Congress, who manipulate the tax code and create winners and losers.The reason that I am a strong supporter of the FAIR tax is that it ends 66,000 pages of gobbledy-gook in the name of the IRS tax code. [cheers and applause] And it ends, once and for all, the completely nonsensical concept that we are to penalize productivity while subsidizing irresponsibility. That is counterintuitive to a strengthened economy. [applause]I talked to a man in Manchester, New Hampshire who was a machinist at the machine shop I was touring. He told me of his daughter who was going to Cornell grad school at the cost of $54,000 a year, which my first thought was, ""Thank you, God, my daughter doesn\'t want to go to Cornell grad school."" (Laughter.)But then he told me, he said, ""You know, I\'m working a second shift so I can help my daughter. But the problem is, working the second shift has put me in a whole new tax bracket. Most of what I\'m making in the second shift, the government\'s taking away from me in higher taxes.""I hated to tell him, but the truth is if he gets in that higher tax break, there\'s other issues as well. If he saves the money, we tax it. If he invests it, we tax the dividends from the stock market. If he buys and sells, we\'ll tax the capital gains. And if the poor guy keels over dead from working too hard, we\'ll tax him at his death. No wonder people are frustrated.You know, there\'s one way he can get some federal help for his daughter. He can quit working altogether, sit home and watch ESPN all day, and then she\'ll qualify for assistance. [cheers and applause] Now, can anybody tell me that makes sense? [cheers and applause]I\'ve got a better idea. I\'ve got a better idea than the nonsense  a better idea than the nonsense of that 66,000-page tax code that cost American businesses $250 (billion) to $500 billion a year in compliance costs, that\'s choking the life out of small business. It\'s a shame that the Republican Party used to be the champion of a small business owners. And we need to be again, because the fact is, 50 percent of our jobs come from there, 80 percent of our new jobs, and even big business starts out as small business. Most big businesses depend on the supplies from small business.And today the reason many small business owners find it hard to survive and compete is because the competition that they face the fiercest is not from their competitors. It\'s from their own government, with excessive taxation, regulation, and the threat of litigation. [applause]We can change that. I\'d like to be the president that puts the IRS out of business, nails the ""Going out of business"" sign on their front door, and takes these tax forms like this and says to every American, ""Goodbye."" [cheers and applause](Chants of ""We Like Mike!"")We should demand transparency and accountability from our government. I would propose that every time the federal government makes any expenditure, it posts it on the Internet within 24 hours so you could find out exactly where every dollar of the federal budget goes, down to what it costs to mow the courthouse lawn in your hometown.Wouldn\'t that shock some people to find out exactly how our tax money comes in and how it goes out?I believe that it\'s right to demand that government should facilitate and not complicate the free-market system. I think it\'s right to believe that mothers and fathers raise better kids than governments do, and we don\'t need governments telling us how to raise our kids and grow our families. [cheers and applause]And I believe it\'s right for us to understand something that comes from the very heart of our founding, and that is that life is sacred and should be celebrated and elevated. And ladies and gentlemen, I know that there are some, even in the conservative movement, who think that the issues such as the sanctity of life don\'t belong in the discussion, but let me tell you why they do and why, under no circumstance, will I ever be able to do anything less than not just support but to be willing to lead a human life amendment to the United States Constitution. And hear me out as to why.From the beginning of this country, our Founding Fathers said it in eloquent words when 56 men put their signatures on a document and they said, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""At the heart of that statement is this radical idea for 1776 that flew in the face of everything that had been a part of their culture, in which ancestry, last name and net worth were what made a person have worth or not. They said we\'re all equal.Today I stand here because of their willingness to put their blood on the line to give a kid like me the opportunity to be as equal as the aristocrats. None of us would probably be sitting here talking about our freedom had it not been for their courage in recognizing the equality of all of us.But at the heart of understanding that is that if we are indeed equal, then it means that all of us have intrinsic value and worth, and no one has more than another. And nothing external gives us greater or less worth  not our abilities or disabilities, not our net worth, not our job position, not our last name or ancestry, not our race, not our gender. Not one thing makes us more or less equal.I believe that the sanctity of a human life is rooted in who we are as a culture and a civilization. And should we turn our back on this fundamental truth, we have turned our back on the very essence and foundation of who we are as a people that has always given us that understanding that we leave no man on the battlefield. And even when a Boy Scout is lost in the woods of North Carolina, we go looking for him, because we believe his life has value and meaning, and we care as if it were our own. That\'s what makes us a great, wonderful, God- blessed nation. [cheers and applause]Let me also say that it is right for our country, in believing in our sovereignty, to demand that we have something that every nation on earth accepts and, in fact, assumes would be a part of its nation\'s essentials  a secure border. How we can ever believe that we can be a sovereign nation or a free nation without securing our borders is beyond me.And ladies and gentlemen, our national government has miserably failed to do something that most of us all across this country realize. This is a great nation that welcomes people. We\'re not hostile. We\'ve always been a nation of immigrants. Most of us come from ancestors who immigrated here from somewhere. But we\'re also a nation of law, and we believe that if you knock on our front door and you\'re hungry, chances are we\'ll ask you to sign the guest book and we\'ll try to feed you and help you. But if you break through the window in the middle of the night, God help you. [cheers and applause]The sad thing is when our own government puts the ladder up against the window. It\'s a little hard to blame the person climbing up the ladder as much as it is the government who puts the ladder and says, ""Go ahead and climb."" [cheers and applause] Let\'s fix what\'s wrong.I had a boyhood pastor who used to tell me, ""If you don\'t stand for something, you\'ll fall for anything."" And I believe that that\'s perhaps true now more than ever.You know, I want to just conclude today by sharing with you that sometimes, in the course of elections, a lot of things get said. People question other people\'s motives or maybe their qualifications or their credentials. And mine certainly have been questioned from time to time as to whether I was a true conservative.Let me tell you, the critics who have been saying some of those things weren\'t with me when I was being put in the back of (parades ?) in Arkansas because I had the audacity to be a conservative in a state that didn\'t really welcome it. They weren\'t there when my door was nailed shut upon my election as lieutenant government in 1993  nailed shut by the Democrats in the state capitol, who kept it nailed shut for the first 59 days that I was in office. And I\'d get on an elevator; they\'d get off. I\'d walk down the hall; they\'d turn the other way; or the times when I\'d go into cafes and restaurants to campaign and people refused to shake my hand because I had the audacity to be a Republican in a state where that just wasn\'t acceptable.Believe me, I understand what it is to go into a state capitol where there never been a general broad-based tax cut in 160 years and proposed one, and three months later signed it into law, and 94 times after that signed tax cuts into law in a state that didn\'t know how to handle that before. That\'s a conservative, folks, against the head winds that weren\'t easy. [applause]To reform welfare in a state that believed that it was an entitlement, and to take half the people off and get them into jobs, not just take them off welfare but to get them employed, and to see the lowest unemployment numbers in our state and the highest employment numbers and the largest number of new jobs and a 50 percent increase in per capita income and the cutting capital gains tax and the elimination of the marriage penalty and the doubling of the child care tax credit and the indexing of the income tax for inflation and the freezing of property taxes for elderly people so they did not lose their homes because government made them end up having to move away.I understand something about the necessity of that. I remember when legislators were on the capitol steps having news conferences every day calling for  demanding that we have a special session to raise taxes. And I finally created the Tax Me More fund. I said, ""There\'s nothing in the law that says you can\'t pay more taxes if you feel like you\'re not paying enough."" And I had envelopes printed.Everywhere I made a speech, I\'d hold them up. I\'d say, ""If you feel like you\'re not paying enough, here\'s an envelope. Would you like to fill it up? Here, take one."" Eighteen months later, $1,200 was all the people of Arkansas thought they had been undertaxed. (Laughter.) A thousand of that was given by a liberal senator who started the whole process of (screaming ?) at it.I spent 10 and a half years\' term as governor fighting the corruption of a one-party political machine that I happen to know a little bit about, because I\'m the only person who\'s ever run against the Clinton political machine and beat it four times. (Cheers.) And if you think we\'ve got an easy race this year, let me assure you we don\'t. [cheers and applause]I stand in this race and I stay in this race not to be a fly in the ointment, because I believe, as Phyllis Schlafly\'s book taught me in the 1960s, that our party, that our country, is about a choice, not an echo. If people want an echo, they can get it from somewhere else. If they want a choice, I plan to give it to them.There are only a few states that have voted. Twenty-seven have not. People in those 27 states deserve more than a coronation. They deserve an election. [cheers and applause] They deserve the opportunity to have their voices and their votes heard and counted. [applause]I know the pundits and I know what they say. ""Well, the math doesn\'t work out."" Folks, I didn\'t major in math. I majored in miracles, and I still believe in those too. [cheers and applause]A few nights ago, when the tornadoes tore through the South, one of those tornadoes hit the community of Brandenburg, Kentucky. I got an e-mail yesterday from a lady named Lisa Young in Brandenburg, Kentucky. It\'s a pretty remarkable story, because that tornado didn\'t just hit her town. It hit her house. But she e-mailed to say that despite the damage to her home, she said there was one thing that was pretty remarkable, and she wanted to make sure that I heard about it, and I did.She said she had a yard sign, a Mike Huckabee yard sign, up in her yard. And she said when the tornado had gone through, she said what was amazing to her was, standing pristine, without a hint of damage or even leaning, she said was that yard sign still standing in her yard. She said, ""Mike, I don\'t know what that means, but all I know is that in Brandenburg, Kentucky, you\'re still standing.""And folks, I want you to know, across America, everywhere there\'s still a vote to be cast, I\'m still standing. (Cheers.)Thank you. God bless you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"February 12, 2008","b'Remarks Following the Maryland, Virginia, and District of Columbia Primaries'","b'[joined in progress]So the next several weeks are going to be the very intense weeks when a lot of delegates are at stake. And a lot will be decided, as far as the long-term impact of where this process is going. But one thing that we have continually said -- and I\'m going to reiterate tonight -- that the nomination is not secured until somebody has 1,191 delegates. That has not yet happened. And we\'re still continuing to work and to give voters in these states a choice. I think if anything that we\'re doing is important, it\'s recognizing that the people in the states who have not had their elections have as much right to an election as all of these folks who are frontloaded for either Super Tuesday or prior to that. And if there are these calls to say, ""Let\'s just call it off,"" well, that\'s a disservice to the people in Texas, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, and Nebraska, and other states and territories who have yet to have that opportunity to vote. So we march on. Every time we win, we\'re ecstatic. When we don\'t win, we\'re disappointed, but we\'re not knocked out, and we continue to believe that every day provides a new opportunity for us to keep the message going, show the contrast, and hopefully give people in the Republican Party a cause to be for and also to keep it, though, in a respectful and I think the kind of tone and tenor that has, I would like to think, brought some honor to the process. So let me take a few of your questions, and we\'ll go from there. QUESTION: Governor, tonight Senator McCain\'s camp, Jill Hazelbaker, said that it is mathematically impossible for Governor Huckabee to secure the nomination. You said the other day that you majored in miracles, not math. Has anyone on your campaign staff done any of their own delegate math? Would you be able to comment on that? MR. HUCKABEE: I mean, we understand, in terms of the conventional process, barring, you know, some something that could happen along the way in the campaign for Senator McCain, or if he doesn\'t acquire enough delegates, that\'s really the possibility, that it could go to the convention. So, you know, I hear all the things that are said, but, you know, it\'s still -- I go back to this fact. And I just can\'t say it loudly or maybe emphatically enough. You\'ve got to have 1,191. And while it may be mathematically impossible to see how it could play out right now, I know this: Right now, nobody has the 1,191 delegates. And, therefore, it would be a little premature to quit until the game has actually come to a conclusion. And I\'ll also remind everybody that it was the Republican National Committee who created the rules and the process and said, ""Here\'s what it takes to be the nominee."" Nobody\'s made it to that point yet. And so, you know, I\'ve not been one who believes that you leave the field because it\'s gotten difficult. You stay, and you keep playing until the last second of the clock has sounded.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"March 4, 2008","b'Remarks Conceding the Republican Presidential Nomination Following the Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont Primaries'","b'Thank you very much. Well, George Brett was one of the greatest baseball players of all time. And in his career for the Kansas City Royals, he was asked, when he was nearing the end of his career, how he wanted his last play in the major leagues to go. Well, everyone assumed that he would say that he wanted to hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth to win a game, perhaps even a World Series. He surprised all of the sportswriters, because what he said was, ""I want my last play at bat to be that I hit an easy, just one bounce to the second baseman, and they throw me out at first. But I was running as hard as I could toward the bag when they got me."" And he said, ""Because I want it to be said of George Brett that, no matter what, he played his best game, he gave it his best, all the way to the very end."" And he certainly did just that. Ladies and gentlemen, I called Senator McCain a few moments ago. It looks pretty apparent tonight that he will, in fact, achieve 1,191 delegates to become the Republican nominee for our party. I extended to him not only my congratulations, but my commitment to him and to the party to do everything possible to unite our party, but more importantly to unite our country, so that we can be the best nation we can be, not for ourselves, but for the future generations to whom we owe everything, just as we owe previous generations all that they have done for us. Senator McCain has run an honorable campaign because he\'s an honorable man. One of the things I\'m proudest of is that the two campaigns that I believe have been run in the most civil manner are the two in the Republican Party that have lasted on their feet to the final. And I\'m grateful for the manner in which he has conducted his campaign. And, quite frankly, with your great help, I\'m very proud of the way that you have insisted that we conduct our campaign. And it\'s been one that we will always be able to say was done with honor. It\'s now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been, but what now must be, and that is a united party, but a party that, indeed, comes together on those principles that have brought many of us not just to this race, but to politics in general. I have so many people to thank, starting with this lady here to my right, who I still believe... (APPLAUSE) And, by the way, I think it\'s fitting that she got better applause than me, because she deserves it. She truly does. (LAUGHTER) She\'s been through so much. She is a magnificent first lady of Arkansas for 10 1/2 years, and I always believed she would be a wonderful first lady for the United States, as well. And I\'m grateful for her patience and perseverance through every step of this wonderful journey we\'ve had. I\'m grateful for my family. Some of you may have heard me say this, and it\'s true: My family didn\'t have to be persuaded or begged to give their permission and blessing for me to get involved in this campaign. In fact, they were ready for me to do it before I was. Truth is, I was the holdout; they weren\'t. And what a wonderful, magnificent gift they\'ve given me with their loyalty and their dedication, involving themselves with their sleeves rolled up every single day of this effort, giving 110 percent of themselves. And for that, I will always be grateful. I also want to say I\'ve had the best staff that anybody has ever had running for president. And, by the way, I\'m pretty sure it\'s probably the smallest staff that anybody\'s ever had running for president. Imagine trying to do this with about 30 people. I don\'t think it\'s ever been attempted. No one has ever gotten this far with such limited resources. But the fact is what we\'ve been able to do was to ask of every one of our staff that they work as if they were two or three people, and they worked as if they were four. And I want to say thanks to them, every last one of them. (APPLAUSE) I\'m also mindful that the real story of this campaign is going to be in the faces of those of you who are here and the literally millions of faces across this country of people who never made the headlines, never led the 6 o\'clock news, but who have been the backbone, the heart and the soul of our campaign. The apostle Paul wrote that, ""I fought the good fight; I\'ve finished the race; and I\'ve kept the faith."" And I believe tonight that one of the things that we will be able to say is not only that we fought the good fight and finished the race; we\'d like to have finished it first, but we stayed in until the race was over. But I think, more importantly, we\'ve kept the faith. And that for me has been the most important goal of all. I\'d rather lose an election than lose the principles that got me into politics in the first place. (APPLAUSE) We started this effort with very little recognition and virtually no resources. We ended with slightly more recognition and very few resources. (LAUGHTER) But what a journey. What a journey, a journey of a lifetime. It is not lost on me where I started. The prophet Isaiah said, and I\'ve quoted it often, ""Look to the rock from which you were hewn, the quarry from which you were dug."" I know of the earth from which I have come, the humble circumstances of the son of a firefighter and who worked a second job, barely paying their rent on the rent house in Hope, Arkansas, where we lived, a mother who was oldest of seven kids and grew up in a house, dirt floor, outdoor toilets, no electricity when she was little, parents who, like so many across this country, wanted for their kids to have a better life. I don\'t think they could\'ve ever imagined that that better life would have included running for president and getting this close to getting there. (APPLAUSE) Let me say, while many among the establishment never really believed I belonged, there were a lot of people in this country who did. And most importantly... (APPLAUSE) ... these are the people across this nation who gave me a voice over these past 14 months. It was their sacrifices, the sacrifices of a truck driver in Michigan, of a housewife who sold her wedding ring on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and gave the contribution to the campaign, a janitor in Alabama who has a wife in a wheelchair who gave $20, not out of his abundance, but out of his poverty, so that our campaign could stay on the track. Those are the folks who have given me a voice, and I only pray to God that I\'ve been able to give them a voice, a voice for the unborn children of this country, a voice for life... (APPLAUSE) ... a voice for the hard-working people who lift everything every day for the rest of us and who carry food to our tables, who pick up the bags, who make great sacrifices and often work two jobs, for every soldier and sailor and airman who puts on a uniform and keeps us free, for every small business owner who hopes that one day he\'ll be able to succeed not having to overcome his toughest competition, his own government, and that maybe one day his government would facilitate his business, not complicate it. For all of the conservatives of this country and party who want less government and who want what government they have to be a little more efficient, a little more effective, a little less filled with corruption, and a whole lot filled with the kind of competence that we pay for, I also believe that there are people out there for whom I hope I\'ve given a voice, and that\'s the people who believe that we need to really overhaul our tax system and implement the Fair Tax and get rid of the IRS. (APPLAUSE) And I believe that we\'ve given voice to folks who are single moms and those guys who are out there working two shifts trying to make sure they can just keep the rent paid and put food on the table for their families. All across this country, we\'ve stood at rallies and I have looked into the faces of amazing people who love their country, who cherish their families, who work very hard at their jobs, who worship God, and who give very sacrificially to others, even when it would be very easy for them to keep their time and their money totally to themselves. But they know that\'s not what made America a great country. It\'s giving that did. Well, we\'ll go home tonight and hopefully bring our team together for the transition. We\'ll be working on doing everything we can to help Senator McCain and to help our party, to help those who run for the Senate and the Congress, because there are many battles this year that we need not just to fight; we need to win them, for our country\'s sake and our future\'s sake. (APPLAUSE) It\'s time for us to hit the reset button. Sometimes when the computer stalls, that\'s what you do: You hit the reset button. But in doing so, we also recognize the extraordinary privilege that we\'ve had and the amazing people who have been there for the journey. We aren\'t going away completely. We want to be a part of helping to keep the issues alive that have kept us in this race. And, by the way, I know there were many who thought we wouldn\'t make it to March \'07, much less March \'08. And we\'ve done so because so many of you worked beyond your capacity and gave in ways I can\'t even begin to imagine. Neither Janet nor I have the words to say, ""Thanks."" We can only thank you with hopefully our future actions, that we will work hard for our country, we will work hard for our party and the nominee, because we love this country and that\'s why we got in. And until our country is all that we hope and pray it to be, we won\'t be able to walk away completely. I\'ve said many times here in Texas that I was inspired by the incredible story of that small group of less than 200 volunteers at the Alamo in San Antonio who took refuge in that church mission. And they saw the incredible armies of Santa Ana start massing against them. On February the 23rd of 1836, 172 years ago this past week, those armies began a 24-hour onslaught and bombardment. On the 24th day of February, Colonel William Barret Travis wrote the letter from the Alamo that should reign and live in all of our hearts and memories, not just for Texas, but for all the world, all who love liberty. As he said on the incredible occasion, he said, ""The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion. Otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken."" He said, ""I\'ve answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat."" ""I call upon you in the name of liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving enforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3,000 or 4,000 in four or five days."" ""If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country: victory or death."" These were people who understood that their battle was not about them. It was about the principles of liberty that they deemed even more important than their own lives. Tonight, I hope that our battle was never about us. It was about our country and its liberty. And now we join with Senator McCain and the rest in our party to continue that battle, to continue that fight, not for who gets elected, but for what we do in maintaining liberty and freedom when we get elected and when our country\'s flag still waves proudly on the wall. AUDIENCE MEMBER: You\'re a great American, Mike. MR. HUCKABEE: And you\'re a great American, as well. Thank you, folks. God bless you. We love you. And thank you very, very much for going the journey with us. Thank you.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"September 3, 2008",b'Address at the Republican National Convention in Saint Paul',"b'Thank you. Well, let me say that, as much as I appreciate this magnificent opportunity to speak tonight, I\'ve got to be honest with you. I was originally hoping for the slot on Thursday night called the acceptance speech. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) But I want you to also know that I am genuinely delighted to be here to speak on behalf of my second choice for the Republican nomination for president, John McCain. (APPLAUSE) John McCain is a man with the character and the stubborn kind of integrity that we need in a president. But I want to begin by doing something a little unusual. I\'d like to thank the elite media for doing something that, quite frankly, I wasn\'t sure could be done, and that\'s unifying the Republican Party and all of America in support of Senator McCain and Governor Palin. (APPLAUSE) The reporting of the past few days have proven tackier than a costume change at a Madonna concert. (APPLAUSE) I grew up at a time and in a place where the civil rights movement was fought. And I witnessed firsthand the shameful evil of racism. I saw how ignorance and prejudice caused people to do the unthinkable to people of color, and it wasn\'t so many years ago. I want to say with the utmost of sincerity, not as a Republican, but as an American, that I have great respect for Senator Obama\'s historic achievement to become his party\'s nominee, not because of his color, but with indifference to it. (APPLAUSE) Party or politics aside, as Americans, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country. But the presidency is not a symbolic job, and I fear that his election would elevate our taxes and our risk in a dangerous world. Now, Obama was right when he said that this election is not about him; it is about you. (APPLAUSE) When gasoline costs $4 a gallon, it makes it tough if you\'re a single mom trying to get to work each day in a used car that you drive. You want something to change. If you\'re a flight attendant or a baggage-handler, and you\'re asked to take the pay cut to keep your job, you want something to change. If you\'re a young couple losing your house, your credit rating, and your piece of the American dream, you want something to change HUCKABEE: But John McCain offers specific ideas to respond to a need for change. But let me say there are some things we don\'t want to change: freedom, security, and the opportunity to prosper. Barack Obama\'s excellent adventure to Europe... (LAUGHTER) ... took his campaign for change to hundreds of thousands of people who don\'t even vote or pay taxes here. But let me hasten to say that it\'s not what he took there that concerns me. It\'s what he brought back: European ideas that give the government the chance to grab even more of our liberty and destroy our hard-earned livelihood. The fact is, my friends, most Americans don\'t want more government. They want less government. (APPLAUSE) It was -- it was, in fact, the founder of our party, Abraham Lincoln, who reminded us that a government that can do everything for us is the government that can take everything from us. (APPLAUSE) Now, I get a little tired of hearing how the Democrats care so much for the working guy, as if all Republicans grew up with silk stockings and silver spoons. You know, my hometown of Hope, Arkansas, the three sacred heroes were Jesus, Elvis, and FDR, not necessarily in that order. (LAUGHTER) My own father, for example, held down two jobs, barely affording the little rented house that I grew up in. My dad was one of those guys, like so many of your dads. He worked hard. He lifted heavy things. He got his hands dirty. In fact, the only soap we ever had in my house was Lava. Let me explain that. I was in college before I found out it isn\'t supposed to hurt when you take a shower. (LAUGHTER) Let me make something clear tonight: I\'m not a Republican because I grew up rich. I\'m a Republican because I didn\'t want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me. (APPLAUSE) John McCain doesn\'t want the kind of change that allows the government to reach even deeper into your paycheck and pick your pocket, your doctor, your child\'s school, or even the kind of car you drive, or tell you how much you have to inflate your tires. (LAUGHTER) And he doesn\'t want to change the definition of marriage. And unlike the Democratic ticket, Senator McCain and Governor Palin believe that every human life has intrinsic worth and value from the moment of conception. (APPLAUSE) And speaking of Governor Palin, I am so tired of hearing about her lack of experience. I want to tell you folks something. She got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) John McCain -- John McCain is by far the most prepared, the most experienced, and truly the most tested presidential candidate. He is thoroughly tested. When John McCain received his country\'s call to service, he did not hesitate and he did not choose the easy path. He sat alone in the cockpit, taking off from an aircraft carrier, to fly in the unfriendly skies, knowing that there was a good chance he might not make it back. And one day, he didn\'t make it back. He was shot down and captured, brutally tortured. He could have eased his own pain, even cut short his imprisonment, just by uttering a few simple worlds renouncing his country. But then, as now, John McCain put his country first. And he knew -- he knew... (APPLAUSE) ... that to return with honor later was better than to return without it now. (APPLAUSE) Most of us -- most of us can lift our arms high in the air so that we can signify when we want something. He can\'t even lift his arms to his shoulder, which is a constant reminder that his life is marked not by what he\'s wanting to receive, but rather by what he has already given. (APPLAUSE) Let me tell you about someone I know who understands this type of sacrifice. On the first day of school in 2005, Martha Cothren, a teacher at the Joe T. Robinson High School in Little Rock, was determined that her students would not take their education or their privileges as American for granted. And with the principal of her school\'s permission, she removed all the desks from her classroom on that first day of school, 2005. Now, the students walked into an empty classroom and they said, ""Ms. Cothren, where\'s our desk?"" She said, ""You get a desk in my classroom when you tell me how you earn it."" Well, some of them said, ""Making good grades."" She said, ""Well, you ought to make good grades in my class, but that won\'t earn you a desk."" Another student said, ""I guess we get a desk when we behave."" Martha said, ""You will behave in my classroom."" (LAUGHTER) But that won\'t get you a desk either. No one in first period guessed right. Same for second period. By lunch, the buzz was all over the campus. Ms. Cothren had flipped out, wouldn\'t let her students had a desk. Kids started using their cell phones. They called their parents. And by early afternoon, all four of the local network TV affiliates had camera crews out at the school to report on this teacher who wouldn\'t let her students have a desk unless they could tell her how to earn it. By the final period, no one had guessed correctly, so the students filed in. Martha said, ""Well, I didn\'t think you would figure it out, so I\'m going to tell you."" And with that, she went to the door of her classroom and motioned, and in walked over 20 veterans, some of them still wearing the uniforms from days gone by, every one of them carrying a school desk. And as they carefully and quietly arranged those desks in neat rows, Martha said, ""You don\'t have to earn your desk, because these guys, they already did."" (APPLAUSE) These -- these brave veterans had gone halfway around the world, giving up their education, interrupting their careers and families so that we could have the freedom that we have. Martha told them, ""No one charged you for your desk, but it wasn\'t really free. These guys bought it for you. And I hope you never, ever forget it."" And I wish, ladies and gentlemen... (APPLAUSE) I wish we would all remember that being American is not just about the freedom we have; it is about those who gave it to us. (APPLAUSE) And let me remind you of something. John McCain is one of those people who helped buy the freedom and the school desk that we had. John McCain helped me have a school desk. And I want to tell you: I pledge myself to doing everything I can to help him earn a desk, and I\'m thinking the one that\'s in the Oval Office would fit him very, very well. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) Thank you. God bless you folks. Thank you. Thank you.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,c,"May 5, 2015","b'Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Hope, Arkansas'","b'Thank you. [applause]Thank you. [applause]Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]Thank you. Thank you very much.Wow. Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House. [applause]But here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn\'t mean that\'s where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground. [applause]And like a lot of Americans, I grew up in a small town that was far removed from the power and the money and the influence that runs this country. The power and money and political influence have left a lot of Americans lagging behind. They work hard, they lift heavy things, and they sweat through their clothes grinding out a living. But they can\'t seem to get ahead, or, in some cases, even stay even.My own parents were like that. My dad wasn\'t an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn\'t have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone. And they taught my sister and me the basic lesson of life: that we were to do unto others as we would have others do unto us. [applause]It was here in Hope that I learned how to swim, how to write a bike, how to read, how to work and how to play fair. I learned the difference between right and wrong. And I learned that God loves me as much as he loves anyone, but that he doesn\'t love some more than others. [applause]I learned about America. In Miss Mary\'s kindergarten as well as in Brookwood Elementary School, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the Lord\'s Prayer and the preamble to the Constitution. [applause]We prayed at the start of each day, and we prayed again before lunch. And I learned that this exceptional country could only be explained by the providence of almighty God. [applause]It was here in Hope that I learned how to handle a firearm and a fishing pole. And I spent a lot of hours with both. I got my first BB gun at age five. It was a Daisy, model 25. I\'ve still got it. It\'s in mint condition. I learned the basic rules of gun safety. And I never thought about using a firearm to murder someone. [applause] I ran trout lines all night in Bois d\'Arc Lake with my dad and grandfather, so we could catch catfish that we\'d freeze and we\'d live off for weeks.And it was here that I was baptized in the Garrett Memorial Baptist Church after accepting Jesus in a Vacation Bible School when I was just 10 years old. [applause]I truly went from Hope to higher ground. It was here that I met the girl who would become my wife of 41 years and give me three children and share what will soon be five grandchildren. [applause]Now, we knew each other from elementary school, and we started dating our senior year of high school, as she shared.It was also here that I got a job at KXAR radio at age 14. [applause]And that job would not only pay my way through school, but it would give me the opportunity to be a mentored by Haskell Jones, the station manager, and one of the few Republicans in the entire county. [laughter]And it was here that I became the first male in my entire family lineage to graduate from high school, at the very same campus that stands today, right down on Main Street. [applause]And it was from here that I went on to college at Ouachita Baptist University. And it was also here that I first ran for elected office, when I ran for student council at Hope Junior High School. [applause]So it seems perfectly fitting that it would be here that I announce that I am a candidate for president of the United States of America. [applause]Audience: We want Mike! We want Mike! We want Mike! We want Mike!Huckabee: Thank you. Thank you.Boy, I\'m glad you reacted that way. It would have been a very lonely day had you been quiet. [laughter]You know, it was eight years ago that a young, untested, inexperienced and virtually unknown freshman senator made great speeches about hope and change. But eight years later, our debt\'s more than doubled. America\'s leadership in the world has completely evaporated. And the country is more polarized than ever in my lifetime.Ninety-three million Americans don\'t have jobs. And many of \'em who do have seen their full-time job with benefits they once had become two part-time jobs with no benefits at all. We were promised hope, but it was just talk. And now we need the kind of change that really could get America from hope to higher ground. [applause]Veterans who kept their promises to America and who have kept us free now wait for months for our country to keep its promise to veterans for basic health care and assistance to cope with the scars of the very wars that we sent them to fight. [applause]Our veterans should be getting the first fruits of our treasury, not the leftovers. [applause]And my friend, when I am president, our veterans are not going to be left on the streets and in waiting rooms to rot, but they\'re going to be treated with the dignity that they have earned and deserve. [applause]When I meet men who have an American Legion cap or one that says ""veteran,"" I never try to fail in saying ""thank you for giving me my freedom."" [applause]But friend, we owe them more than a pat on the back. We need to take them from hope to higher ground. [applause] Washington is more dysfunctional than ever, and it\'s become so beholden to the donor class who fills the campaign coffers that it ignores the fact that one in four American families are paying more than half of all of their income just for housing. Home ownership at the lowest level in decades. And a lot of young people with heavy student debt aren\'t likely to afford their first home for a long while.Our federal policies for affordable housing aren\'t designed to protect families, but rather to protect bureaucrats. We\'ve got a record number of people enrolled in government-operated help programs like food stamps, and my friend, it\'s not because people want to be in poverty. It\'s because they are part of the bottom 90 percent of this country of American workers whose wages have been stagnant for the past 40 years. [applause]The war on poverty hasn\'t ended poverty, it\'s prolonged it. I don\'t judge the success of how many people are on government assistance as to the success of government. I judge how many people have good jobs and don\'t need government assistance. [applause]And we don\'t create good jobs for Americans by entering into unbalanced trade deals that forego congressional scrutiny, and then looking the other way as the law is ignored so that we can import low-wage labor, undercut American workers, and drive wages lower than the Dead Sea. That\'s unacceptable. [applause]Now, as the governor mentioned a moment ago, I governed in a state that was the most lopsided and partisan in the country. No Republican governor had more Democrats and fewer Republicans. I challenged the deeply entrenched political machine that ran this state. My friend, it was tough sledding. But I learned how to govern, and I learned how to lead.And even in that environment, we passed 94 tax cuts, rebuilt our road system, saw dramatic improvements in student test scores and fought the corruption of the good old boy system so that working class people would finally be given a fair shake. [applause]And we saw family income increase by 50 percent during my tenure.Now, there are some who propose that to save the safety nets like Medicare and Social Security, we ought to chop off the payments for the people who have faithfully had their paychecks and pockets picked by the politician, promising them that their money would be waiting for them when they were old and sick.My friend, you were forced to pay for Social Security and Medicare. For 50 years, the government grabs the money from our paychecks and says it\'ll be waiting for us when we turn 65.If Congress wants to take away someone\'s retirement, let them end their own congressional pensions, not your Social Security. [applause]As president, I promise you will get what you paid for. Because how can anyone ever trust government again if they steal from us and lie to us? That didn\'t help when Congress took $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. [applause]And instead of helping families find affordable health care, we created a monster that forces us to buy coverage we don\'t want, don\'t need, and can\'t afford. [applause]And imagine members of Congress boasting they will fight to repeal Obamacare, and then turning around and signing up for it.Real health care reform is gonna focus on prevention and cures, rather than costly intervention. Because hope comes from finding cures for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\'s. [applause]The same way that we once lined up at the courthouse in the \'fifties and took our vaccines and eradicated polio. Cures, real cures, could give real hope to families who hear a dreaded diagnosis and are sentenced to a slow and agonizing death. Alzheimer\'s disease alone will cost well over $1 trillion by the year 2050. Focusing on cures instead of treatments saves money, lives and families.I remember President Kennedy telling us that we were gonna send a man to the moon and bring him home within the decade. President Kennedy didn\'t live to see that come true. But I did. And it made me believe that America could do anything it set its mind to. [applause]And, as president  as president, I\'d launch a curative approach to health care and save money and lives, not just save a bunch of government programs. [applause]We face real threats from radical jihadism in the forms of savage groups like ISIS and state terrorists like Iran. But we put more pressure on our ally Israel to cease building bedrooms for their families in Judea and Samaria than we do on Iran for building a bomb. [applause]Dealing with radicals who chant ""death to America,"" and who fund bonds and rockets to murder civilians in Israel is nonsense.So when I hear our current president say he wants Christians to get off their high horse so we can make nice with radical jihadists, I wonder...Audience: Boo.Huckabee: I wonder if he can watch a western from the \'50s and be able to figure out who the good guy and the bad guys really are. [applause]As president, I promise you that we will no longer merely try to contain jihadism, we will conquer it. [applause]We will deal with jihadis just as we would deal with deadly snakes. And let there be no doubt, Israel will know, as will the whole world, that we are their trusted friend. And the ayatollahs of Iran will know that hell will freeze over before they get a nuclear weapon. [applause]And I commit this to you today: I will never, ever apologize for America. Ever. [applause]We face not only the threats from terrorism but also the threat of new kinds of dangers, from a cyber war that could shut down major financial markets to threats of an electromagnetic pulse from an exploded device that could fry the entire electrical grid and take this country back to the Stone Age in a matter of minutes. And waiting until it happens is too late.But we\'ve lost our way, morally. We\'ve witnessed the slaughter of over 55 million babies in the name of choice. And we are now threatening the foundation of religious liberty by criminalizing Christianity and demanding that we abandon biblical principles of natural marriage.Many of our politicians... [applause]Many of our politicians have surrendered to the false god of judicial supremacy, which would allow black-robed and unelected judges the power to make law as well as enforce it, upending the equality of our three branches of government as well as the separation of powers so very central to the Constitution.My friend, the Supreme Court is not the supreme being, and they cannot... [applause] ... overturn the laws of nature or of nature\'s God.Government in Washington is dysfunctional because it\'s the roach motel. People go in, but they never come out. [applause]As president, I\'ll fight for term limits on all three branches of government. [applause] That would help return us to the founders\' dream that serving the public should be a temporary duty, not a lucrative career with generous pensions and paychecks that aren\'t available to the very people who paid for them. [applause]And you know, if someone is elected to an office, then give the taxpayers what they\'re paying for and the job that you said you wanted. If you live off the government payroll and you want to run for an office other than the one you\'ve been elected to, then at least have the integrity and decency to resign the one that you don\'t want anymore and to pursue the one that you decided you\'d rather have. [applause]As president, I would take seriously the 10th amendment. I would actually abide by it.This power was never intended to be so concentrated at the federal level. Our Constitution was explicitly clear about keeping the federal government small so it\'d be able focus on some simple things, like providing a military and securing our borders.There\'re some things being done at the federal level that should\'ve been left in the hands of the states, or even better, the families. There is no constitutional authority to dictate education from the federal government. [applause]Why even have a federal Department of Education? It\'s flunked, and it needs to be expelled. [applause]Education policy ought to be set by states, local school boards and, best of all, by the moms and dads of the children. [applause]And common sense tells us that the best government is the most local and the most limited. We\'ve supersized the federal bureaucracy, but we downsized the military and left our borders open and uncontrolled.Yes, we need to address the immigration issues but not with amnesty. But we need to start by taking control of our own borders. [applause]But as Americans, we oughta get on our knees every night and thank God we still live in a country that people are trying to break into rather than one they\'re trying to break out of. [applause]I\'m running for president because I know there\'s a difference between making a speech and making government accountable to the people who have to pay for it. [applause]You can\'t spend money you don\'t have. You can\'t borrow money you can\'t afford to pay back. And the federal government ought to live by the rules that you have to live by and they should function under a balanced budget law just like I had to every year I was a governor. [applause]And I don\'t want to hear politicians talk about tinkering with the tax code and making little adjustments that still let powerful Washington interests pick the winners and losers. We can never create prosperity for working people, never grow our economy out of the bottomless pit of debt, never be able to move America back to the greatest economy on earth if we continue to punish productivity and subsidize reckless irresponsibility. [applause]There was a man I met at a machine shop in New Hampshire. And he told me how he started working a double shift to help his daughter pay for grad school. Now, he naturally figured that if he worked 16 hours a day rather than eight, he\'d bring home twice the pay. But he found out that the money that he worked for on that second shift put him in a new tax bracket and the government got more of it than he did.It\'s not that our tax system is punishing the richest people in America. They can afford accountants and lawyers who will find a way to protect them. It\'s the people working for wages who can\'t get ahead if the government penalizes them for trying to do better. [applause]As president, I\'ll work to pass the Fair Tax, which would no longer penalize people\'s work. [applause]We wouldn\'t penalize people\'s work or their savings, their investments, or their good stewardship. And by the way, it would be the end of big government bailouts, and most importantly, we would finally rid ourselves of the biggest bully in America, the IRS. [applause]The IRS would disappear and April 15th would be just another beautiful spring day. [applause]Now, the struggle for many families isn\'t helped when the government solution is fighting over what the minimum wage ought to be. It\'s a race to the bottom to figure out what the government determines is the least you can make. We need to be promoting the maximum wage, which is set by the worker who\'s willing to avail himself or herself of training for a job that pays a maximum amount. [applause]We will never break the cycle of poverty by pushing people to their minimum wage, only by empowering them to reach their maximum wage. That\'s how we take people from hope to higher ground. [applause]This country\'s got to do three things to stay free: feed itself, fuel itself, and fight for itself. Our farmers and ranchers provide food and fiber, and we\'ve got to keep them from being regulated out of business. We also have enough energy resources under our own feet that we could bring affordable energy to America and become the largest exporter so that Americans prosper in developing the energy. And we aren\'t impoverished anymore by paying for it when it\'s produced by some Saudi sheik or a Russian robber baron. [applause]And we need to be able to fight for ourselves by bringing manufacturing back to our communities where we make our own planes and tanks, bullets and bombs. [applause]The journey that begins in Hope today can lead this nation to higher ground. But I cannot do it without people being my partners, many who have never been involved in politics before now. I\'m going to let you in on a little secret. I never have been and I\'m not going to be the favored candidate of those in the Washington-to-Wall Street corridor of power. [applause]I will be funded and fueled not by the billionaires, but by working people who will find out that $15 and $25 a month contributions can take us from Hope to higher ground. [applause]Now, rest assured, if you want to give a million dollars, please do it. [laughter]But I know most of you can\'t. I\'m just gonna ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren. I walked away from my own income to do this, so I\'m not asking you for some sacrifice I\'m not willing to make. I don\'t have a global foundation or a taxpayer-funded paycheck to live off of. [applause]I don\'t come from a family dynasty, but a working family. I grew up blue collar, not blue blood.So I ask you to join with me today, not just so I can be president, but so we can preserve this great republic and someday so that your children and grandchildren can still go from Hope to higher ground. [applause]I still remember, I remember it well when my dad took me to the dedication of the newly constructed Bois d\'Arc Lake, just a few miles from here. It\'s now named for Dr. Lester Sitzes, my best friend since third grade, who\'s here today. [applause]I was a  I was eight years old, and my dad said, ""Now, son, the governor is gonna come dedicate this new lake, and I\'m gonna take you down there to hear him make a talk, because, son, you might live your whole life and you may never get to meet a governor in person."" [laughter] [applause] Had my dad lived just four months longer, he would have seen me do more than meet a governor. He would have seen me become the 44th governor of my state. [applause]I always wish he could\'ve been there and maybe spent at least one night in the governor\'s mansion, a place he never thought he\'d get close to. But I always wanted to feel that he did see that moment from the best seat in the house. [applause]And I hope that he\'s able to watch in January of 2017 when that bashful little kid from the orange brick rent house on 2nd Street is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. [applause]And with your help and God\'s, we will make that journey from Hope to higher ground. [applause]God bless you, thank you very much. Thank you. [applause]'"
