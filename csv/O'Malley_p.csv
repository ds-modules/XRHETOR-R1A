Martin O'Malley,D,p,"May 30, 2015","b""Press Release - Immigration as 2016 Issue Upped With Martin O'Malley's Candidacy""","b'http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/immigration-2016-issue-upped-martin-omalleys-candidacy-n366666The heat that immigration has brought to the 2016 presidential campaigns could intensify Saturday with the addition of former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley to the Democratic field.All expectations are that on Saturday in Baltimore, O\'Malley will announce his bid to be the Democrats\' 2016 presidential nominee.When he does, supporters say he\'ll bring with him a record of work on issues of concern to Latinos and immigrants that rivals that of his fiercest Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Though he\'s considered an underdog with a big gap to overcome to win the Democratic primary, several Latino leaders consider him a stronger ally on immigration and support of the Latino community.""Martin O\'Malley, in his history as governor of Maryland, has been a real hero for the immigrant community. He not only supported many groundbreaking reforms in the state, he also became a national spokesperson for immigrant families and their human rights, especially the unaccompanied minors who arrived in droves on the border last year,"" said Kim Propeack, chief of political communication forCASA de Maryland  Maryland\'s largest immigrants services and rights organization  and director of its political arm.That alone won\'t be enough to propel him to frontrunner, but it does serve to add even more attention to the place immigration is taking in the 2016 race, which can also set a tone for races down ballot.""What this does is give our community a real choice,"" said Ben Monterroso, executive director of Mi Familia Vota.""It will help sharpen (Hillary\'s) position and distinguish it from the Republican Party,"" said Stella Rouse, an associate professor in government and politics at the University of Maryland.Maryland\'s Latino population has been booming in recent decades and now is about 9 percent of the state\'s population. About 80 percent of the Latino population is non-Mexican, according to Pew Research Center.As governor, O\'Malley signed a bill allowing young immigrants illegally in the U.S. to pay in-state college tuition and to a bill to get driver\'s licenses.He was the first governor to meet with Latino leaders last year and sign up to push House Republicans to bring immigration reform legislation to a vote, which they never didHe has shown respect that many in the immigrant community say is lacking in debates on immigration by using the term new Americans to refer to immigrants, whether here legally or not. He also established a state council to focus on integrating immigrants.He opposed White House proposals to return young Central American children and families who crossed the U.S-Mexico border last summer, saying they would face ""certain death.""On deportations  an issue that still vexes the current administration  O\'Malley stopped Baltimore\'s City Detention Center from holding immigrants without criminal records for deportation by the federal government. Malley\'s office also has hired former lobbyist and former Obama Hispanic media director of political engagement, Gabriela Domenzain, according to Buzzfeed.""He was very helpful on the immigration question in Maryland and certainly is someone we think of as a friend and more progressive on immigration matters,"" said Brent Wilkes, executive director of League of United Latin American Citizens.But Wilkes added that he didn\'t think his entrance and record would hurt Clinton ""because of the aggressive effort"" she\'s made on immigration in her campaign.In response to questions from immigration activists on unaccompanied children who arrived at the U.S. border last year, Clinton said the children should be sent back, essentially supporting the Obama administration\'s stand on the influx.But she has since said mothers and children should not be held in immigration detention. She has hired an immigrant who lived in the U.S. illegally and became active on immigration reform politics, Lorella Praeli, as part of her campaign staff. Praeli is now a legal resident.She has said she would expand on Obama\'s immigration executive action programs to shield the parents of young immigrants illegally in the country from deportation as well.""I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put Dreamers . . . at risk of deportation,"" she said at a roundtable in Nevada, according to The Associated Press. ""If Congress refuses to act, as president I will do everything possible under the law to go even further.""The high profile and details their campaigns are giving  and will give  to the immigration issue hasn\'t always been the case in presidential campaigns. But the topic has moved more and more to center stage with the help of young immigrants who call themselves Dreamers. They have regularly pressed politicians and the sitting administration to address the effect of U.S. immigration policies on their lives and their families\' lives.Although there are certainly other issues of interest to Latino voters, immigration has been something of a mobilizer. In 2012, 54 percent of Latino voters were naturalized or had at least one immigrant parent.Also in the Democratic field, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, has backed immigration reform. But he withheld support for last year\'s sweeping Senate immigration bill until fixes were made to a guest worker provision that he thought would allow for the hiring of cheap labor in place of U.S. workers. He has supported Obama\'s executive action programs.Republican candidates have worked to engage the Latino community, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, doing a National Press Club interview with Javier Palomarez, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce president last month and expected candidate Jeb Bush making appearances in Puerto Rico and before the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference\'s convention in Houston. O\'Malley is scheduled for an appearance with Palomarez on Wednesday.While GOP presidential hopefuls are largely opposed to Obama\'s executive action, regarding it as overreach, they too have been discussing immigration on the trail.Latinos were about 10 percent of the electorate in 2012. According to Pew Research Center, Obama received 71 percent of Hispanic votes, the highest of any president since former President Bill Clinton won 72 percent of the Latino vote in 1996.'"

Martin O'Malley,D,p,"June 18, 2015",b'Press Release - A Jobs Agenda for Our Renewable Energy Future',"b'Originally published in USA Today, June 18, 2015Today, Pope Francis published his encyclical  an official teaching document to all 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide  on the moral imperative of addressing climate change. He is not alone among leaders of world faiths making such a clarion call for action.We have come a long way as a nation in making ourselves more energy independent. Now is the time to take this progress to the next level  the future of our country and our planet depends on it.New technologies now put an independent clean energy future decidedly within our reach as a nation.But reach for it we must.Clean energy represents the biggest business and job creation opportunity we\'ve seen in a hundred years. Reliance on local, renewable energy sources also means a more secure nation and a more stable world.Given the grave threat that climate change poses to human life on our planet, we have not only a business imperative but a moral obligation to future generations to act immediately and aggressively.This is why protecting the United States from the devastating impact of climate change  while capitalizing on the job creation opportunity of clean energy  is at the center of my campaign for President.All of us can acknowledge that with an ""all of the above strategy,"" President Obama has made the United States more energy independent in every category of fuels, including oil and gas.But America did not land a man on the moon with an ""all of the above strategy."" It was an engineering challenge.Making the transition to a clean energy future is also an engineering challenge. We cannot meet the climate challenge with an all-of-the-above energy strategy, or by drilling off our coasts, or by building pipelines that bring oil from tar sands in Canada.Instead, we must be intentional and committed to one over-arching goal as a people: a full, complete transition to renewable energy  and an end to our reliance on fossil fuels.Saving the world is a goal worthy of a great people. It is also good business for the United States of America.I believe, within 35 years, our country can and should be 100% powered by clean energy, supported by millions of new jobs. To reach this goal we must accelerate that transition starting now.As President, on Day One, I would use my executive power to declare the transition to a clean energy future the number one priority of our Federal Government.I would create a new Clean Energy Jobs Corps to partner with communities to retrofit buildings to be more energy efficient, improve local resiliency, create new green spaces, and restore and expand our forests so they can absorb more greenhouse gases.I would retrofit federal buildings to the highest efficiency standards and require new federal buildings to be net-zero. I would require the federal fleet to be subject to low- or zero-emissions purchasing agreements, and require all federally-funded infrastructure projects to meet climate resiliency standards.As President, I would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to take aggressive action to limit greenhouse gases: expanding rules to other large sources of emissions beyond power plants, adopting a zero-tolerance policy for methane leaks from current oil and gas production, and setting higher energy efficiency standards for new buildings while requiring energy costs to be transparent to building tenants and purchasers.And I would reject projects like Keystone XL, drilling off our coasts and in the Arctic and Alaska. Furthermore, I would keep domestically produced oil and gas in the U.S., instead of selling it abroad  unless there is a clear strategic security rationale.Beyond executive actions, I would make clean energy deployment  and full employment  a first order priority.I would set a national, cross-sector Renewable Electricity Standard so our nation is powered by 100% clean energy by 2050, and a national goal of doubling energy efficiency within 15 years. Many states like California and Maryland are already leading the way forward for the United States.I would fight for federal legislation for a cap on carbon emissions from all sources, with proceeds from permits returned to lower- and middle-class families, job transition assistance, and new jobs with the Clean Energy Corps.As President, I would support a Clean Energy Financing Authority to support projects to increase efficiency and resiliency upgrades in cities, towns, and rural communities nationwide.I would prioritize modernizing our electric grid to support localized renewable energy generation, reduced electricity waste, and increased security from sabotage or attack.And I would increase our investment in basic clean energy research so the U.S. can reclaim the lead on energy innovation, including advancing development, deployment, transmission, and storage for renewable energy and new efficiency technologies.The fact is, there is no either/or choice between our prosperity and protecting our planet  we can create a future where there are more jobs, and a future with a livable climate. And there is no future for humankind without a livable climate.The reality, as we learned in Maryland, is that the two goals of job creation and a livable climate are indivisible. Driven by ambitious targets, we created thousands of new jobs while deploying clean energy technology and reducing greenhouse gas pollution by nearly 10 percent over just seven years.As a Nation, together, we can do far more  with a bold vision for America\'s clean energy future, and the strong leadership needed to get it done.'"

Martin O'Malley,D,p,"July 10, 2015",b'Press Release - An Open Letter to Wall Street Megabanks',"b'Read the complete policy proposal here.As you may have read, I\'ve expressed grave concern about the state of our national economy, especially as it relates to the behavior of a select group of financial institutions on Wall Streetthe institutions that you work for and represent. I have called for significant structural and accountability reforms to prevent another economic crash and protect hard-working families from losing their jobs, homes, and life savings once again.Most of our financial system works quite well. Of the almost 6,500 banks in our country, most of which work hard every day to serve their communities, just 29 have more than $100 billion in assets and only four have more than $1 trillion in assets. The high-risk, reckless, and illegal activities of your megabanks were the primary cause of the 2008 crash, which caused the worst recession since The Great Depression, and cost the American economy an estimated $14 trillion to $22 trillion.I know that many of you have tried to dismiss and undermine my calls for stronger reforms as ""anti-capitalist."" Let me be clear- the ongoing reckless behavior of your megabanks isn\'t capitalismit\'s the antithesis of it. True capitalism requires a level playing field on which everyone plays by the same set of rules. True capitalism requires competition. True capitalism means that just as businesses and banks can succeedthey can also fail.Today, yourtoo-big-to-fail, too-big-to-manage, and too-big-to-jailmegabanks pose an enormous risk to the financial system, the economy, and American families. They are so big and so interconnected with the entire financial system that the failure of one or more of them could cause the collapse of the entire U.S. economy.After several misguided deregulatory measures taken in the 1990\'s, your handful of megabanks went from having assets of approximately 15% of our country\'s GDP to now having assets of nearly 65% of our GDP. As your megabanks grew in size, who gained from it? Credit card fees didn\'t get smaller. Mortgage rates didn\'t go down. The median wages of Americans certainly didn\'t increase. The only tangible gain we\'ve seen from your institutions\' explosion in size is your ability to concentrate unprecedented power and wealth in the hands of your executives and to acquire the guarantee that all of your risky bets will be covered by taxpayers.Now, because your institutions are so large, so leveraged, and pose such a grave threat to our economy, you don\'t face the same rules of the free market that apply to everyone else. If your bets go bad, you don\'t face bankruptcytaxpayers bail you out. When things go well, the upside is all yours and you get to cash in exorbitant bonuses. This violates the very principle of free market capitalism.For similar reasons, both your megabanksand your executiveshave been somehow classified as too big to prosecute and too big to jail. Exacerbating the problem, our financial regulation system is defined by conflicts of interest and a lucrative revolving door. Former financial executives are hired to regulate their former colleagues and, when they leave for government, they\'re given golden parachutes. Then, they turn right around and return to the firms they were supposed to be regulating.All of this explains why, when laws are broken, you and your institutions get off with nothing more than a slap on the wristfines paid by shareholders that you can write off as nothing more than business expenses. No admission of guilt, no one faces jail time, everybody keeps their jobs  back to bonuses as usual.As President, I would end this double standard of justice. It is bad for our economy, and it is bad for our country.A strong American economy depends on a strong, financial industry that plays by the rules. And among the greatest victims of your megabanks have been the thousands of community banks that are the backbone of our economy. These banks provide the financing for the American Dream of homes, businesses, educations, and secure retirements. Yet they\'re forced to compete on an un-level playing fieldone where they bear the brunt of declining credit and wagesand where megabanks are rewarded with subsidies and bailouts.So here\'s the bad newsfor you: As President, I have no plans to let up on you. I\'ll work tirelessly to eliminate the unique danger posed by the handful of too-big-to-fail banks. And while I\'m doing that, I\'ll finally bring real enforcement and oversight to the federal governmentto agencies and departments like the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Commodity Futures Trading Commissionso that they start doing the job the American people expect them to do and stop sitting on their hands.If youand your megabankswhich we, the American taxpayer, saved want to begin to restore the confidence in your leadership, you need to start by saying two things: ""we\'re sorry"" and ""thank you.""Then, you have to do the right things: stop your war on financial reform, start following the law, and end your highest-risk, most dangerous activities so that your megabanks are in fact no longer too-big-to-fail.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"July 25, 2015",b'Press Release - Congress Needs to Act on Gun Reform',"b'THIS WEEK, we again watched in horror as more images of gun violence flashed across our TV and computer screens.On Thursday, two people were killed at a movie theater in Lafayette, La. Last week, five service members were killed in Chattanooga, Tenn. And last month, nine parishioners were killed in Charleston, S.C.  solely because of their skin color.During the first 204 days of 2015, there have been 204 mass shootings: a mass shooting for every day of the year.These tragedies aren\'t isolated incidents or even ""accidents"" as some have called them  they\'re part of a full-blown epidemic.We cannot let this become the new normal. As we mourn for the lives cut short  for the victims and the loved ones they leave behind  we can\'t just sit by and wait for another tragedy to happen again.We need comprehensive gun safety laws to save lives.This is where we should start: The federal government should limit the sale of firearms to tightly regulated, licensed dealers. That means closing the ""gun show loophole"" once and for all, and banning unlicensed private individuals from selling guns.We should also impose greater restrictions on what, to whom, and where dealers can sell guns. That means banning the sale of assault weapons, increasing inspections, and establishing a national gun registry to help law enforcement track down dangerous criminals. It also means requiring gun owners to secure and safely store all firearms in their homes.In Maryland, we implemented some of the toughest measures in the nation to crack down on gun violence. The reforms we put in place included required licensing, fingerprinting, background checks, and safety training. We ensured that these requirements applied to all buyers, whether they were acquiring a gun from a dealer, a secondary sale, or as a private gift.We took action to keep guns off the street and make them less deadly. We banned the sale of assault weapons and limited the size of magazines. And, if a firearm was lost or stolen, we required it to be reported immediately to law enforcement.Our goal in Maryland, as it should be for the nation, was to reduce mass shootings and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.This wasn\'t easy, and we didn\'t get it done on the first try. It took six years  from 2007, when I first supported an assault weapons ban, until 2013  for us to get this done. I faced strong opposition even from members of my own party. Legislators faced threats from the NRA and saw 2,000 gun-rights advocates flood the halls of the Maryland General Assembly.The same debate is playing out in Congress today. While the public strongly backs common-sense gun safety reforms, Congress has refused to act on them.It\'s no surprise: With millions of dollars from the gun industry and an astronomical number of lobbyists, the National Rifle Association has been able to silence members of Congress who privately support these reforms. Their fear of retribution has led them to block even the most basic gun safety reforms.Stopping the preventable deaths of American citizens should not be a partisan issue, or the purview of special interests. These members of Congress need to find the courage to do the right thing, without fear of the NRA\'s clout, come next election.It\'s not enough just to ""have the conversation."" It\'s time for actual leadership and action.Martin O\'Malley, former governor of Maryland, is a Democratic candidate for president.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"July 27, 2015",b'Press Release - A Jobs Agenda for our Renewable Energy Future',"b'1. A Complete Transition to Renewable Energyand an End to our Reliance on Fossil Fuels by 2050We can\'t address our climate challenge without ending our reliance onfossil fuels  full stop. I would take aggressive executive actionand fight for legislation to slash emissions and put our nation ontrack to be powered by 100% renewable energy within 35 years.As President, I would fight for federal legislation for a cap oncarbon emissions from all sources, with proceeds from permits returnedto lower- and middle-class families, and invested in job transitionassistance and the new Clean Energy Jobs Corps.On Day One, I would reject projects like Keystone XL, deny new permitsfor drilling in Alaska, Antarctica, and off our coasts, and increaseroyalties and emissions fees for fossil fuel companies currentlydrilling on federal lands, investing the proceeds in jobs and skillstraining.I would also make sure we keep domestically produced oil and gas inthe U.S., instead of selling it abroad  unless there is a clearstrategic security rationale.I would increase royalties and emissions fees for fossil fuelcompanies currently drilling on federal lands, and invest the proceedsin jobs and skills training.I would root out subsidies for fossil fuels, while extendingproduction and investment tax credits for renewable energy for thelong term. Taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuel companies total $4billion a year, even as the biggest oil companies reap $90 billion inannual profits.And I would make sure federal agencies do all they can to protectpublic health and the environment by:Requiring the federal fleet to be subject to low- or zero-emissionspurchasing agreements. Our federal fleet of 250,000 vehicles consumesmore than $450 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel every year.Fuel costs saved should be reinvested in clean energy deployment andjobs.Directing the Environmental Protection Agency to take aggressiveaction to limit greenhouse gases, expanding rules to other largesources of emissions beyond power plants.Directing the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt azero-tolerance policy for methane leaks from current oil and gasproduction, which waste $1.8 billion annually, while exacerbatinggreenhouse gas pollution.2. An Aggressive Agenda to Double Energy Efficiency Within 15 Years To Waste Less Energy and Create More JobsIf we waste less energy, we can create more jobs  while savingAmericans real money on energy costs and protecting our environment.Maximizing energy efficiency in buildings alone could eliminate theneed to increase our national electricity generation capacity.That\'s why I would set a national goal of doubling our energyefficiency within 15 years.On Day One, I would direct the EPA and Departments of Defense andTransportation to set strong efficiency standards, including settingstrict ""MPG"" standards for new buildings. And I would require energycosts to be up-front and transparent to tenants and purchasers.And I would retrofit federal buildings to the highest efficiencystandards and require new federal buildings to be net-zero. Thefederal government owns and manages nearly 900,000 buildings, morethan any other entity. And building retrofits out-perform investmentsin new gas and oil exploration as a form of jobcreation or economicstimulus by 3 to 1.3.Renewed Investment in the Physicaland IntellectualInfrastructure to Power a Clean Energy EconomyNew technologies have put a clean energy, energy independent futurewithin reach. It is up to us to develop and deploy the technologieswe\'ll need to get there.First, I would support a Clean Energy Financing Authority tofacilitate clean energy infrastructure projects, efforts to increaseefficiency, and resiliency upgrades in communities nationwide. I wouldalso require all federally funded infrastructure projects to meetclimate resiliency standards.As part of my agenda, modernizing our electric grid would be afirst-order priority. Our electric grid must evolve to supportlocalized, renewable energy generation, reduce electricity waste, and increase security from sabotage or attack. Power outages are up 285%over the last 30 years, costing businesses as much as $150 billioneach year, and renewable energy sources remain unconnected.I would also increase our investment in basic clean energy research sothe U.S. can reclaim the lead on energy innovation, includingadvancing development, deployment, transmission, storage for renewableenergy, and managing demand more effectively.4. A New Clean Energy Job Corps To Rebuild, Retrofit, and Restore our Communities and EnvironmentClean, renewable energy is the biggest business and job creationopportunity we\'ve seen in the last hundred years. Compared with thefossil fuel industry, the renewable energy industry creates more jobsfor each unit of electricity generated. And clean energy jobs arelong-term, good-paying opportunities.That\'s why I would create a new Clean Energy Jobs Corps to helprealize our transition to a clean energy economy. The Clean EnergyCorps would partner with communities to retrofit buildings to be moreenergy efficient, improve local resiliency, create new green spaces,and restore and expand our forests so they can absorb more greenhousegases.In addition, I would also work with industry to help meet currentskills and employment needs that the current labor market isn\'tsufficiently supplying, like new utility workers and cybersecurityexperts.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"August 4, 2015",b'Press Release - Why We Need a Constitutional Amendment to Secure the Right to Vote',"b""Many Americans believe they have a constitutional right to vote, but the U.S. Constitution guarantees no such right explicitly. While the 14th Amendment provides some protection, it is not comprehensive and has left many Americans vulnerable to Republican efforts to restrict the right to vote:In 2014, Republican legislators in 29 states introduced more than 80 bills to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.As a result, a 2014 report found that voter ID laws in 32 states stood to keep as many as 23 million Americans from successfully voting.Millions of Americans who voted in the last election are at risk of being turned away from the polls because of restrictive voting laws that require a photo ID, eliminate early voting, and make it harder to register.To address this voter suppression, progressive leaders in Congress introduced legislation that would amend the U.S. Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to vote. The legislation's text is simple and straightforward:SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.Governor O'Malley believes that nothing is more important in our sacred democracy than the right to vote. As governor, he made it easier  not harder  for Marylanders to vote. He signed a bill restoring voting rights to more than 50,000 people with felony records, expanded early voting and allowed same-day registration. He even revolutionized Maryland's voter registration process by creating an online system.Passing a constitutional amendment that enshrines this fundamental right will give U.S. courts the clarity and authority they need to strike down Republican efforts to suppress the vote. The proposed amendment would set a high legal bar to defend against attempts to disenfranchise eligible voters, and empower Congress to enact strong electoral standards nationwide.Amending the Constitution is hard, but voting shouldn't be. Our current laws have failed to protect this fundamental right for too many people.That's why on the week of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act...GOVERNOR O'MALLEY IS CALLING FOR A RIGHT-TO-VOTE AMENDMENT."""

I won because we fought for progressive changeand guess what: we passed marriage equality, passed the DREAM act, and raised the minimum wage. We made progress where it counts, and I'm happy to see Secretary Clinton thought so, too.Democrats are not going to win THIS election by acclamation either. We need more debates to get our positions on the issues in front of voters.

Martin O'Malley,D,p,"September 14, 2015",b'Press Release - America Succeeds When Women and Families Succeed',"b'I am lucky to have spent my life surrounded by strong women.My mother, Barbara O\'Malley  or ""Mrs. O"" as generations of congressmen and Hill staffers know her  has been U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski\'s receptionist and gatekeeper for more than 30 years. At 87 she still keeps the Senate office in line, which is no surprise: her first job was at the age of 17, flying in the Civil Air Patrol during the Second World War.She raised her six children to believe that every generation of Americans has the ability  and the sacred responsibility  to become great.These are the lessons that my wife Katie and I have passed on to our own kids. And we are so proud of my daughters Tara and Grace O\'Malley for their hard work and service to their country, at the United Nations Foundation and as a first-grade public school teacher at Baltimore City\'s Walter P. Carter Elementary.So there is no doubt in my mind that my daughters will continue to strive to better this nation and follow their dreams. And I want both of them  and all the other young women of their generation  to have equal rights and opportunities at work, and to be paid every penny in wages of what they deserve.That\'s why, under an O\'Malley Administration, closing the gender pay gap would be one of the most important goals of the federal government  one that I\'ve included in my 15 Goals to Rebuild the American dream. These national goals would guide my administration, day in and day out, as we build an economy that works for all of our children.To get there, we need a clear, measurable road map for action. And because today in America women can be paid less than men essentially without penalty, the first step must be taking pay discrimination head on.We can do this in several ways: by holding employers who do discriminate accountable, preventing retaliation against women who speak up, and empowering women to find out whether they are paid unfairly and to do something about it. This includes making pay data publicly available by sex, race, and ethnicity, so that all employees can see that they\'re making a fair wage for their job.But curbing pay discrimination alone is not enough. Part of the reason women are paid less than men for doing the same work is that many are forced to leave the workforce in order to raise their families, or penalized for doing so. Only 12 percent of American workers have access to paid leave, and 40 percent can lose their jobs for taking even unpaid leave to care for a newborn child. What\'s more, child care costs more than public university tuition in a majority of states  putting quality care out of reach for many families, and forcing some parents who\'d like to work to stay home.If women decide to have families, they shouldn\'t have to choose between their career and taking care of their children. All parents  both men and women, gay or straight, married or single  should be able to take at least 12 weeks of leave, with pay, in order to care for newborn children or other loved ones. And no family  especially low- and middle-income families  should have to pay more than 10 percent of their income on safe, affordable child care in a given year.Finally, we must lift wages for all workers, starting with increasing the minimum wage, to $15 an hour. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers today are women, and each and every one of them deserves a raise.The good news is that solutions are on the table. Congress has brought the Paycheck Fairness Act to a vote, four times. Democrats have proposed the FAMILY Act, to give all workers access to family and medical leave. President Barack Obama has called for expanding child care subsidies, and we should go even farther so that every family that needs assistance receives it. Fast food workers and others are winning critical victories in the Fight for 15.But it\'s long past for time for action  not just words.In Maryland, we didn\'t just talk about creating economic opportunity for women. When I was Governor, we actually got things done. We expanded access to parental leave, and to quality pre-K education. We raised our state\'s minimum wage, and passed the nation\'s first living wage. We put our own Lilly Ledbetter Act in place to help protect women from pay discrimination. And we set, met, and exceeded one of the most ambitious goals in the country for directing state contract dollars to minority and women-owned businesses.As a result of our better choices and investments, we made Maryland the best state in the nation for women\'s economic opportunity and security  with a higher concentration of women-owned businesses than any other state, and the lowest gender pay gap in the country.And as a nation, we can do the same. Progress is a choice. For our daughters and all of our children, we must choose a future of more opportunity  including the full and equal compensation their hard work deserves.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"September 15, 2015",b'Press Release - Syria Humanitarian Crisis Letter',"b""Dear Mr. President:Thank you for your administration's commitment to addressing the Syrian humanitarian crisis. Due to your leadership, the United States has led the international community as the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance. The American people should be proud that this policy reflects their generosity and compassion.The images from Europe this month reminded the world that more than four million Syrians have been made refugees. Many governments are responding admirably by significantly increasing their refugee quotas to match the depth of the crisis. I appreciate your administration's attention to this issue, but I was disappointed to learn that the United States would accept only 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. We can do more than a token increase.I have called for the United States to accept at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by 2017  a number that is consistent with past U.S. policy and requests from humanitarian organizations. Welcoming 65,000 refugees would be the rough equivalent of accommodating just six more people in a baseball stadium that holds 32,000. Germany has one-fourth our population and is accepting 800,000 refugees this year, and 500,000 in subsequent years.Certainly we can do more. Our credibility as a leader of nations requires that we do more. And the principles of our country demand that we do more.As a former governor, I am aware of the precautions that must be taken to protect our homeland.But our country is large enough and compassionate enough to welcome 65,000 Syrian refugees by 2017, and I encourage you to do everything in your power to respond appropriately to this moral imperative.Sincerely,Martin O'MalleyFormer Governor of Maryland"""

He opposes state laws prohibiting high-capacity magazines and assault weapons. And he proposes federalizing concealed carry permit programs.This is, quite honestly, reckless and irresponsible.His proposal is just shameless pandering to the National Rifle Associationone of the most powerful special interest lobbies in the country. The only thing on which we agree is that our country has a problem with gun violence. But, unlike Donald Trump, I know that the only way to combat gun violence is by standing up to the NRA and implementing comprehensive gun safety laws.That's exactly what I've done throughout my career, and will do as President. Will you stand with me today?As President, I will pass a national assault weapons ban, implement stricter background checks, and increase efforts to reduce straw-buying, like fingerprint requirements.Sign up today to stand with me against gun violence, and read my full policy paper on how I'd address this issue.https://martinomalley.com/act-on-gun-violenceThanks,Martin O'Malley"""
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"September 22, 2015",b'Press Release - National Catholic Reporter Op-Ed',"b'This week, our country has the historic honor of welcoming Pope Francis to the United States for the first time. While millions of Americans are expected to welcome Pope Francis with fanfare, his visit also calls for a time of deep reflection on our nation\'s obligations and priorities.As an American and a Catholic, I believe, fundamentally, in our individual and shared responsibility to create a better and more just society and world. ""Any seeker of a higher truth or of God,"" Thomas Aquinas wrote, ""must eventually and inevitably come back to the idea of community."" Each and every one of us is endowed with a sacred responsibility to advance the common good we share.This, I believe, is why so many people  not only Catholics, but people of so many creeds and faiths, and those who profess to not have religious faith  are energized by Pope Francis\' message. He is a reformer, but one who creates change by ""letting the light in"" so all of us can see the truth and act upon that truth. As he works to heal wounds and divisions within his own church, he inspires millions of others: to embrace those who have been marginalized by poverty or discrimination; to act now to head off the devastation of climate change for the sake of our ""common home,"" this one earth; and to reach out and help those most in need.What does the call of his message hold for us as citizens of the United States?Pope Francis will undoubtedly challenge America with a question: At a time of growing inequality, entrenched poverty, and widespread uncertainty and unrest in the world, will we be a force for healing and reconciliation? Or, out of fear for ourselves and distrust of the unknown, will we turn our backs on the work of waging peace, as a moral leader among nations?Pope Francis calls us to act on this question, guided by the principles of faith. For many Americans, we also find our motivation to take action in the principles of our founding ideals.Today, Europe shoulders an unprecedented surge of refugees from war-torn Syria. Pope Francis asks us to house and feed families fleeing crisis, saying, ""the Gospel calls us to be neighbors to the smallest and most abandoned, to give them concrete hope.""As a generous and compassionate nation of immigrants, the United States has a long, proud tradition of providing comfort to the weak and weary. The United States should heed Pope Francis\' call by welcoming no fewer than 65,000 Syrian refugees next year. We cannot forget what it means to struggle and toil and yearn for a better life beyond the next horizon; we have a moral responsibility to act.The world\'s poor will first bear the brunt of climate change, as Pope Francis wrote this summer. But there is no independent salvation on this planet. Our survival depends upon our meeting this challenge. Fortunately for the United States, leading the transition to a 100 percent clean, renewable electric future is also the greatest job creation opportunity we have had in a century.We must seize this opportunity to build a cleaner and more humane economy that lifts up all of us, while protecting our ""common home.""And with 11 million aspiring citizens living in the shadows of our nation, it is imperative that we remember our fundamental character: e pluribus unum, that out of many, we are one. For, as the Holy Father says, ""Humans have a dignity that is priceless.""We must bring undocumented families into the full light of life and our nation by passing comprehensive immigration reform  while using every ounce of executive authority to keep families together, end detention, safeguard the rights of New Americans, and otherwise restore greatness and justice to America\'s immigration system.How we respond to these and to so many other challenges  from education to healthcare  will speak to the type of country we are. It is not enough to reflect or have faith  we must have the courage to risk action on that faith.Over the past two years, I have been fortunate to travel all across this great country. Everywhere I go, I meet people who are eager to forge a new consensus, to fight injustice and suffering, and to provide greater hope and opportunity to their neighbors. They are hungry for new leadership, to harness our inclusiveness and compassion to work towards a brighter future.So as we welcome Pope Francis, I look forward to our country taking up his challenge: remembering our country\'s founding values, reaffirming our commitment to upholding them, and looking beyond ourselves to welcome the stranger, protect our earth, and let compassion guide all our doings.

Martin O'Malley,D,p,"October 1, 2015",b'Press Release - Campaign Finance Reform',"b'Truly fixing our economy requires fixing our democracy. Today in America, big-money special interests have taken over our elections. In the five years since the Supreme Court\'s disastrous Citizens United ruling, super PACs, corporations and dark money groups have spent almost $2 billion trying to sway the outcome of federal elections2.5 times what they spent, in total, between 1990 and 2008. As a result, special interests have drowned out our voices, while relentlessly lobbying for policies that improve their bottom lines at the expense of the American middle class. This corrupt systemwhile technically ""legal""forces candidates into a race to the bottom, embracing the muscle of their super PACs even as they espouse democratic principles and lukewarm promises of change.It\'s time for actions, not just words, on campaign finance reformand Americans of all political stripes agree. That\'s why Governor O\'Malley has committed to establishing publicly financed congressional elections within five years as part of his 15 Goals to Rebuild the American Dream. Meeting this ambitious goal will require a new campaign finance system, a tougher regulatory system, and stronger disclosure rulesin addition to an unrelenting effort to overturn Citizens United once and for all.We The People Are Not CorporationsToday in America, due to a deeply flawed reading of our Constitution, a handful of wealthy special interests and corporations are able to buy candidates and electionson both sides of the aisleensuring that the voices of the vast majority of Americans are not heard.As president, Governor O\'Malley will:Fight to Overturn Citizens United. As president, O\'Malley will fight to ratify the Democracy for All amendment, which will allow the American people to once again place reasonable limits on the money that flows into our elections. This will give Congress and the states the authority to do what they always did before wealthy donors and corporations bought our courts and our elections: enact meaningful campaign finance rules that cap candidate spending, establish contribution limits, and bar corporations from meddling in our democratic process. The vast majority of Americansincluding both Democrats and Republicans alikeoverwhelmingly agree that Citizens United should be overturned.Push to Establish a Constitutional Right to Vote. Our democracy depends on greater participation, yet in recent years Republicans have sharply limited access to our most fundamental right. O\'Malley has called for amending the Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to votegiving U.S. courts the authority to strike down efforts that disenfranchise voters, while empowering Congress to enact strong electoral standards nationwide.Support Bipartisan Redistricting Commissions. O\'Malley applauded the Supreme Court\'s ruling in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission this spring, which upheld voters\' right to draw their electoral districts fairly and independently. O\'Malley will support states that are seeking to overcome gridlock by turning to bipartisan redistricting commissions to draw their Congressional districts.Citizen Funded ElectionsRunaway election spending by special interests forces candidates to listen to big money donors over the voters they claim to represent. As races are inundated with more and more outside spending, members of Congress now devote more than half of their time to fundraising, not governing. At the same time, the total number of small donors has begun to fall. In 2014, the top 100 donors to super PACs spent almost as much money as every single small-dollar donor combined.It\'s time for a new campaign finance system that gives candidates the opportunity to raise a larger number of smaller contributions from people back homeencouraging every citizen to participate in the democratic process and making candidates truly work for every vote.Build a New Campaign Finance SystemGovernor O\'Malley has set a national goal of implementing public financing of congressional elections within five years. To meet that goal, he supports the Government By the People Act introduced by Congressman John Sarbanes (D-MD). As president, Governor O\'Malley will work aggressively with Congress to pass and implement the Act.Through the Government By the People Act, Governor O\'Malley will:Empower Americans to Participate in Elections. To counter the decline in small donors, O\'Malley will provide Americans with a $25 refundable My Voice tax credit for contributing to candidates for Congressional office. By encouraging many more Americans to participate in giving, O\'Malley will give candidates needed incentive to engage voters instead of special interests.Amplify the Voices of American Voters. To make the contributions of small-dollar donors go even further, O\'Malley will establish a national Freedom From Influence Fund. Americans who give $150 or less to a candidate who forgoes PAC money will have their contributions matched at a rate of $6 to $1. And if voters donate to candidates who agree to take exclusively small-dollar donations, they will see their contributions matched at an even higher $9 to $1 rate. As a result, congressional candidates will be able to spend far less time dialing for dollars and more time listening to the interests and concerns of voters.Fight Against Special Interest Influence. Outside groups have monopolized our airwaves in the years since Citizens United, especially as campaigns enter their final stretch. In order to help citizen-funded candidates compete on more equal terms, O\'Malley will provide additional public financing to congressional candidates who raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar donations in the 60 days before an election.Real Accountability Under The LawOne of the biggest problems with our campaign finance laws is that we don\'t enforce the laws we already have. Candidates, their political action committees, and even our party leadership are complicit in openly defying the letter and spirit of the law as they vie for larger and larger campaign contributions from Wall Street, fossil fuel companies and other special interests. And they do so without penalty, because the Federal Election Commission is now so gridlocked and broken that its commissioners have given up on enforcing election laws altogether. This is an unbelievable and unacceptable outcome. But as the chairwoman of the FEC says herself, ""There is not going to be any real enforcement"" of campaign finance regulations in 2016.We need a new, nonpartisan system that actually works, both to hold candidates and PACs accountable under existing rulesand to enforce the next generation of stronger, citizen-driven election laws.Overhaul the Federal Election CommissionThe Federal Election Commission was designed and weakened by those it regulatesmembers of Congressin order to be as ineffectual as possible. With three appointed members from each party, the commission is inherently partisan and perpetually deadlocked. As a result, its members cannot complete basic orders of business without resorting to extraordinary measures and hostile debates; their case backlog is now unprecedented. The FEC is imposing record-low fines even as political spending soars, failing to hold lawbreakers accountable and failing to respond to Citizens United.It\'s time to fix the FECwhile making its mission and work a real national priority.As president, Governor O\'Malley will:Fight for a New FEC. The FEC\'s partisan design is the root of the agency\'s dysfunction. O\'Malley will urge Congress to fundamentally restructure and strengthen the FEC by establishing a single administrator position to oversee the agency. This administrator would lead the FEC and enforce its laws, serving a term independent from the president who appoints them. O\'Malley will also fight for real enforcement authority for the new FEC, including replacing the FEC\'s toothless settlement process with a comprehensive schedule of strong, mandatory fines.Strengthen Existing Disclosure Requirements. The FEC has broad authority to bring ""dark money"" spendingwhich accounted for a third of the $2 billion spent by outside groups on elections since Citizens Unitedinto the light. But the FEC has allowed loopholes in disclosure rules to proliferate, leaving doors open to corruption. O\'Malley will pressure the FEC to update its regulations: mandating that political action committees register and disclose the full extent of their campaign spending, preventing non-political committees from skirting disclosure requirements, and requiring all groups that engage in ""electioneering communications"" to disclose all of their underlying donors under the law.Restrict Coordinated Campaign Activity. Despite unprecedented coordination between candidates and their super PACs, the FEC has stepped aside: allowing candidates to functionally evade contribution limits via coordination without imposing any significant penalties on campaigns that do so. O\'Malley will call on the FEC to enforce laws restricting coordination, while using its existing authority to strengthen them. This includes treating candidate fundraising for outside groups as direct, prohibited coordination; and ending the ""internet exemption"" that allows some outside groups that engage in political activity online to coordinate directly with campaigns.Strengthen Enforcement of Campaign Finance Laws. O\'Malley will make real enforcement of campaign finance laws a federal priority. O\'Malley will appoint FEC Commissioners and an Attorney General committed to assertively enforcing our nation\'s existing laws even as we forge a new consensus for broader reforms to restore our democracy.Transparency In Our DemocracyOur laws are riddled with loopholes that allow corporations and other special interests to pump undisclosed and unaccountable money into our elections. The biggest loophole is that ""social welfare groups"" face no requirements that they disclose their donors at all. Two such groups put more money into the presidential campaign in 2012 than all super PACs combined.It\'s time to bring ""dark money"" political spending into the lightthrough extensive executive action, and by passing strong and comprehensive disclosure laws.Enforce and Strengthen Financial Disclosure RulesThe federal government already has significant authority to establish strong, comprehensive financial disclosure requirements. However, political pressure and partisan dysfunction have prevented agencies from putting forward commonsense and long-overdue transparency rules.As president, Governor O\'Malley will:Use Executive Authority to Increase Transparency. In addition to the FEC rules described above, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service, and Federal Communications Commission each have the authority to strengthen campaign finance disclosure laws. O\'Malley will direct each agency to act, completing regulations that require publicly traded companies to disclose political spending to their shareholders, restrict political spending by dark money groups, and enforce laws requiring broadcasters to disclose the real identities of sponsors who run political ads.Pass Expanded Disclosure Laws. O\'Malley will endorse, prioritize, and fight to pass and implement the DISCLOSE Act, which would require that all groups that engage in more than $10,000 in political spendingincluding social welfare non-profitsdisclose their donors. The Act would also require disclosures by organizations that transfer or receive more than $50,000 for political spending, preventing special interests from setting up shell organizations to avoid disclosing their political contributions. Finally, the DISCLOSE Act would expand reporting requirements for organizations and donors who place and pay for television and radio ads in the months before an election.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"October 6, 2015",b'Press Release - Addiction Treatment',"b""The epidemic of untreated substance use disorder is a crisis that claims tens of thousands of American lives each year. With deaths from prescription drug overdoses quadrupling since 1999, overdose-related deaths now exceed the number of traffic fatalities, suicides, or homicides. Yet our response has not matched the scale of the emergency. Proven prevention and treatment strategies are underutilized. Funding for treatment programs is insufficient. Outdated stigmas make too many people reluctant to seek care, and make too many communities unwilling to provide it. Millions of families are needlessly torn apart.As Mayor of Baltimore and Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley brought all resources to bear to stop the epidemic of drug addiction and overdose. In Baltimore, Martin O'Malley expanded access to drug treatment to thousands of people while more than doubling funding for the city's treatment system. His innovative efforts drove a 60 percent reduction in overdose deaths from heroin over 10 yearsa program still cited as a successful national model.In Maryland, Governor O'Malley made addressing addiction one of his Administration's top goals. The centerpiece of this agenda includes forming an Overdose Prevention Council, which coordinates state agencies and local governments to collaborate on reducing overdose deaths. Under Governor O'Malley's leadership, Maryland increased addiction treatment services by 45 percent, helped doctors identify and treat substance use disorder, and empowered pharmacies and first responders to stock and safely administer overdose-reversing drugs. Maryland also developed the nation's first local overdose review teams, which review the circumstances of each overdose death to find lessons for prevention.As president, Governor O'Malley will hold this same commitment to saving lives and addressing addiction. Drawing on his 15 years of executive experience, he will expand and improve addiction treatment, invest in recovery, improve coverage, and prevent substance use disorders before they start.GOAL: REDUCE DEATHS FROM DRUG OVERDOSE BY 25 PERCENT BY 2020As a nation, we have looked past people imprisoned by drug addiction for too longdespite having the tools to save them. They are our husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, and children. By focusing coordinated public health efforts on outcomes and holding ourselves accountable for results, we can save lives, spare families anguish, and rebuild our communities.An O'Malley Administration will provide a new level of support and accountability for efforts to address addiction and overdose in the United States. Governor O'Malley's ultimate goal as president is to reduce deaths from drug overdoses by 25 percent by 2020an objective he first laid out in his 15 National Goals to Rebuild the American Dream.As president, Governor O'Malley will take a public health approach to substance use disorders: developing and implementing a coordinated national strategy to reduce risky prescribing of pain medications, expanding access to effective addiction treatment, and investing in community resources for recovery.Launch a National Dashboard on OverdoseTo manage this strategy, Governor O'Malley will establish a national dashboard on overdose and addiction to monitor the problem, track our response nationwide, and target resources so that all Americans have access to critical services that support prevention, treatment, and recovery. This includes improving data collection and sharing information more quicklywith law enforcement, first responders and physicians, and other local leadersso communities can respond effectively as soon as addiction and overdose challenges arise. This dashboard will guide $12 billion in federal investments and partnerships over the next decade, while providing a clear and transparent way for O'Malley to hold the federal government accountable.The dashboard's first use will be to reduce addiction to fentanyla highly potent and deadly narcotic increasingly laced into heroinwhich was responsible for an unprecedented number of overdose deaths last year. The problem is especially acute in New Hampshire, where fentanyl took more lives than heroin in 2014. Within 100 days of taking office, O'Malley will direct his Administration to create and adopt a national fentanyl strategyone that includes expanded prevention education, greater coordination with law enforcement, increased use of naloxone to reverse overdose, and robust treatment.Stop the Over-Prescription of Pain MedicationsThe rapid rise in prescribing drugs to manage pain has contributed to the epidemic of opioid addiction. Physicians have an important role to play in reducing the inappropriate use of prescription drugs and helping individuals suffering from addiction reach treatment. As president, Governor O'Malley will:Require Physician Training on Pain Prescribing. O'Malley will require all physicians seeking authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe pain medications to first demonstrate that they have taken courses in appropriate prescribing. In Maryland, all physicians must complete required continuing medical education on prescribing controlled substances in order to maintain their license.Strengthen Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. O'Malley will reward states that implement effective prescription drug monitoring programs, and demonstrate that they canreduce addiction and overdose. These programs can help doctors and other health care providers access information that allows them to identify patients who are at risk of addiction, and connect them to the treatment they need. In Maryland, O'Malley did just thatlaunching a prescription drug management system that is linked to the state's web- based health information exchange.Support Patient Education on Pain. O'Malley will develop an effective public campaign on pain drug addiction, modeled on previously successful efforts to reduce patient requests for unneeded antibiotics. By increasing public awareness around this quiet tragedy, O'Malley help patients understand that there are many other ways to manage chronic pain, beyond risky opioid medications.Expand Access to TreatmentAs the Mayor of Baltimore, Governor O'Malley led an effort that reduced heroin-related deaths by more than 60 percentby expanding the resources for treatment, and focusing on therapies that worked. As president, he will ensure that states and local governments have the funding, support, and information they need to save lives:Expand Access to Naloxone. Naloxone is an effective reversal drug used to treat overdoses from both prescription opioids and heroin; its increased use may already be saving hundreds of lives in New Hampshire. O'Malley will set a national goal of training and equipping all first responders to administer naloxone in areas with significant numbers of overdose fatalities. O'Malley will also bring together the FDA, industry, and others to make sure a readily-available and inexpensive supply of naloxone is available. In particular, that means focusing on those who need the most supportsuch as the friends and family of people with substance use disorders. In Maryland, O'Malley worked to ensure that pharmacies stocked naloxone, developed training programs for family and community members, and signed legislation and an executive order to expand use of the medication.Equip All First Responders. Ensuring that first responders can carry and safely administer naloxone is an important first step, but not a sustainable solution. That's why O'Malley will work to ensure thatwhenever hospitals or first responders treat overdosethey can quickly direct patients to effective addiction treatment options. Emergency rooms are our first line of intervention, and must be empowered them to provide access to lasting care.Increasing Funding for Effective Therapies. Existing federal investments to support comprehensive drug treatment systems pale in comparison to the need. O'Malley will work to greatly expand federal grant programs, increasing the number of grants and incentives for innovation in each state. This includes providing resources and technical assistance to states willing to overcome barriers to expanding care, like New Hampshire.Expanding Coverage of Proven Treatments Under Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare pays for pain medications that can lead to addiction, yet many states do not reliably cover treatment medications as part of comprehensive treatment programs. In Maryland, O'Malley ensured that Medicaid covered medications to reverse overdose and treat addiction. As president, he will support regulations and legislation to expand coverage of evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence under Medicare and Medicaid, helping tens of thousands of people afford the treatments they need to recover.Assuring Every Veteran Access to Treatment Within 12 Hours. The demands of military life, combat, and the return home can be complicated dramatically by addiction and related disorders. Mental and substance use disorders caused more hospitalizations among U.S. troops in 2009 than any other cause. O'Malley would set a new national goal for helping veterans access proven therapies for treating addictionin every community.Improving Data Collection and Access. Federal, state, and local partners need accurate and timely data in order to address addiction spikes as they occur. Yet currently, federal overdose death data is only available a year or more later. O'Malley will launch a new national emergency surveillance program on addiction and overdose deaths, as he also did in Maryland. This effort will feed into his new national dashboard.Investing in Community Resources for RecoveryIn Maryland, Governor O'Malley supported innovative services for individuals in recovery to help them gain employment, as well as contribute to their families and their communities. As president, O'Malley would:Implement a Public Health Response to Addiction. Incarceration is an inadequateand in most cases inappropriateresponse for people in need of treatment for substance use disorders. O'Malley will provide individuals with the care and support they require outside of the justice system, as detailed in his criminal justice reform plan. He will also establish federal guidelines for law enforcement on how to best serve people in crisis, support state Crisis Intervention Training for police officers, and ensure that people leaving prison or jail have the support they needincluding substance use disorder treatmentto successfully reenter their communities.Support Community Recovery Services. Recovery from addiction is holistic, involving not only clinical treatment but also resilience, support, and longer term care. O'Malley will provide a new level of support for community-based recovery for individuals suffering from mental illness and addiction, making urgent new investments across the country in housing, supported employment, and outpatient treatment.Fight the Stigma of Addiction. We have long understood addiction to be chronic brain disease, yet negative associations persistpreventing too many of our neighbors from seeking care, and leading some communities to avoid providing treatment altogether. O'Malley will launch a national campaign to reduce the stigma associated with drug addiction, opening up a path for all Americans to seek treatment and recovery."""

Martin O'Malley,D,p,"November 3, 2015",b'Press Release - 7 Executive Actions to Reduce and Prevent Gun Violence',"b'Governor O\'Malley put forward the boldest plan to reduce gun violence as president. His progressive platform builds on his record getting results in Maryland, where he put in place the most comprehensive gun safety legislation in the nationand brought people together from both urban and rural areas, in the face of enormous opposition from the National Rife Association, to get the job done. He will do the same as president, working day in and day out and refusing to take no for an answer when it comes to saving lives.While working toward a comprehensive legislative solution, Governor O\'Malley will also use the full extent of his executive authority to prevent gun violence. He will take strong executive actions to advance gun safety, stand up to the special interest gun lobby, hold law- breaking firearms dealers accountable, and keep women and children safe from gun violence. Each of these actions is constitutional and enforceable under existing laws.As president, Governor O\'Malley will:1. Use procurement contracts to advance gun safety. Because the federal government is the largest purchaser of firearms, adjusting federal procurement policies can drive innovation that advances gun safety. O\'Malley will require manufacturers that seek federal contracts to make simple design changes that advance gun safety and improve law enforcement\'s ability to trace firearms. These include hidden serial numbers that cannot be defaced, microstamping, magazine disconnect mechanisms, and other next-generation safety improvements.2. Stop defendingand work to overturngun dealer immunity. O\'Malley will stop enforcing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, which protects irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits, effectively giving blanket immunity to merchants of death. This outrageous law is nearly without precedentyet when families who have lost loved ones to gun violence challenge the law, the federal government intervenes to defend it. O\'Malley will not intervene on behalf of the gun industry immunity law as president. Instead, he will argue that the immunity law is unconstitutional, and work to ensure that victims of gun violence can have their day in court.3. Disarm and prosecute domestic abusers who break the law. America is the most dangerous country in the developed world for women when it comes to gun violencein part because existing bans on gun ownership for domestic abusers and stalkers are too rarely enforced. O\'Malley will make it a priority to disarm those convicted of committing domestic violence, and to prosecute those who fail to comply with the law.4. Ban ""cop-killer"" ammunition. Although armor-piercing ammunition is banned from manufacture and sale, broad exemptions have made hundreds of kinds of dangerous cartridges available for sale. Efforts to close these loopholes were defeated by the NRA earlier this year. O\'Malley will stand up to the gun lobby, overhauling broken regulations to greatly restrict access ""cop-killer"" ammunition under federal law.5. Alert law enforcement of failed gun sales. Background checks have effectively prevented more than 2.4 million prohibited people from acquiring gunsbut little is done to investigate or follow up on these failed sales. O\'Malley will launch an electronic alert system to inform local law enforcement when prohibited individuals attempt to buy firearms, modeled on the FBI alert system used when fugitives purchase guns. Then, by analyzing past failed sales, he will develop a system to help law enforcement identify which attempted sales to prosecute.6. Require the responsible storage of guns at home. Guns are the second leading cause of death among children and teens, and the first cause among African American children. And at least once a week, a toddler finds a gun, points it at himself or someone else, and pulls the trigger. While licensed dealers are already required to make sure that gun purchasers have safety devices, there are no federal standards for locking devices. O\'Malley will issue and enforce federal rules clearly defining safety standards for gun locks and safes.7. Strengthen enforcement and audits of licensed dealers. The gun lobby has amended federal laws to restrict law enforcement\'s ability to hold law-breaking firearms dealers accountable. O\'Malley will use every remaining lever to ensure that licensed dealers are in full compliance with the law: conducting background checks of gun dealer employees; ensuring that dealers who have their licenses revoked do not become unlicensed sellers without first liquidating their inventories; and using audit inspections to check dealer inventories for stolen guns.'"
Martin O'Malley,D,p,"November 6, 2015",b'Press Release - Additional Protections for New Americans',"b'BALTIMORE MD  In advance of his visit to Nevada on Sunday to address immigration leaders and as we approach the anniversary of the President\'s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents and expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Governor O\'Malley released the following statement and new proposals:""Given the hateful and nativist rhetoric dominating the Republican Party, it\'s incumbent upon Democratic candidates for President to show what exactly they would do to fix our inhumane immigration system. It\'s all too easy to critique Republican\'s rhetoric, but what is squarely in our national interest and what New American immigrants need and demand is a clear vision of how we will stand with them.""This week, Senator Marco Rubio stated unequivocally that he would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and deport DREAMers. The new Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, also promised not to hold a vote on comprehensive immigration reform despite broad bipartisan support. As Democrats, we are right to decry their wordsbut we cannot let their race to the bottom impede us from putting forth a detailed and progressive roadmap to make our immigration system more humane and our nation more welcoming to New American immigrants. ""As we approach the November 20th anniversary of the President announcing his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents and expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, I urge my fellow Democratic candidates for President to join me in committing to aggressively fight for these reforms in the courts. ""I want to turn the page on the the failed, cautious, poll tested policies of the past and fight to include more people, more fully into the social, political and economic fabric of our country. I will do that by using the full power of the presidency to reaffirm that we\'re a nation who is made stronger by New American immigrants and that we must keep families and communities together.""Governor O\'Malley is the only candidate who has gotten results on immigration reform. His plan to fix our inhumane immigration system has been praised as the most comprehensive and most progressive  setting the standard in the Democratic field. His expanded proposals to fix our inhumane immigration system follow:1. Protect New Americans who stand up for their rights. Undocumented workers are too often afraid to report health, safety, or labor violationsor join a unionout of fear of retaliation and deportation. This fear makes it easier for employers to economically exploit them, driving down wages for everyone. As President, I will establish an affirmative process for individuals engaged in workplace or civil rights disputes to request deferred action and work authorization.2. Guarantee farmworker rights and protections. Our nation must provide Farmworkers the opportunity earn lawful permanent resident status, so they can fully exercise their rights and measurably improve their working conditions. As President, I will include farmworkers in my executive actions and work to ensure their equal rights under our labor laws.3. Immediately release women and children being held in detention. This week we learned that the Central American Minors program has, due to administrative and logistical failings, not reunited a single child residing in violence-plagued Central America with their parents here in the United States. Meanwhile, the immigrant women and children who successfully fled violence remain locked up in detention facilities. I urge the Obama Administration to immediately comply with the federal court order to release these families and as President I will end our nation\'s failed experiment with family detention. 4. Encourage states to expand in-state tuition, access to driver\'s licenses and health care to New American immigrants. Many states affirmatively expanded access to in-state tuition, drivers licenses, and health care to immigrants. As President, I will work with Congress to repeal laws that deny access to federal financial aid based on immigration status and establish federal incentives for states to continue to move in the right direction. Moreover, I strongly and without reservation support national in-state tuition for all immigrants, regardless of status.5. Promote family unity by reducing unnecessary barriers to lawful status. Many immigrants who are entitled to lawful permanent resident status (or ""green cards"") must first return to their home countries if they previously lived in the United States while undocumented. Yet, when they depart, they are then barred from re-entering the United States for three to ten years. This 1990\'s policy creates a Catch 22 that needlessly hurts American families, punishing individuals even if they are now eligible to legally remain in the United States. While waivers to these punitive bars to re-entry exist, families often struggle to meet confusing eligibility requirements. As President, I will work to keep families together by improving access to these important waivers and creating a rebuttable presumption of extreme hardship in cases involving immigrant families who are the most vulnerable and meet certain criteria.'"
