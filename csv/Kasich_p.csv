John Kasich,R,p,"July 23, 2015",Press Release - Another View  Peter Thomson: Why John Kasich is the Choice for Republicans for 2016,"By Peter Thomson: Union LeaderI RECENTLY retired from the State of New Hampshire, where I served nearly 23 years as the coordinator of the Highway Safety Agency. On the morning of my final trip from Orford to Concord, I was speaking to a good friend of mine who was asking me what I was going to do with all my free time. I explained that I was looking forward to traveling, working to expand my maple syrup business, spending time with my nine grandkids and politicking!Over the last two decades, I have kept a relatively low profile when it came to campaigning on behalf of my favorite candidates, choosing to do more behind-the-scenes work. That is all going to change in this upcoming presidential election, where I plan to do all I can to make sure a Republican is elected to the White House on Nov. 8, 2016. To that end, I am asking my independent friends and fellow Republicans to join me in supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the upcoming Republican presidential primary.No Republican has ever moved into the White House without having first won the state of Ohio in the general election. Gov. Kasich by far gives us the best chance of winning Ohio, having just been re-elected by a landslide in 2014. When the polls closed that day, he had won 86 of 88 counties, 60 percent of women voters, 26 percent of African-American voters and 57 percent of voters aged 18-29. In fact, very recent polling shows the governor easily beating Hillary Clinton in the Buckeye State; no other Republican candidate can boast that key point.Beyond the governor's electability, I am choosing to support him because of his impressive track record in Ohio. Many of you know that I served as my father's chief of staff during his time as governor. During that time, I got a firsthand look at the difficulties a chief executive has in running a fiscally responsible state. That is why I am impressed with John's record as a fiscal conservative in Ohio. He quickly eliminated a huge budget shortfall without raising any taxes; in fact he cut taxes, most notably he eliminated the dreaded death tax and cut the income tax and small business tax.I know how difficult it is to balance the need to cut taxes to spur economic growth with the need to provide basic government services such as education and a safe transportation infrastructure system. The safety of our highways is near and dear to me, having spent most of my career trying to keep New Hampshire drivers safe, but I know safe highways go beyond driver's education and DUI checkpoints: Our roads and bridges need to be maintained. Gov. Kasich embraced an innovative and tax-free approach to generate $3 billion to upgrade Ohio's vital highway and bridge network. When it comes to education, John enacted a comprehensive education reform agenda that set higher standards for student achievement with a new Third Grade Reading Guarantee and improved school accountability.It was during a brief water break one hot summer day when we were planting corn that my father told me he was going to run for governor. I thought perhaps the sun had gotten to him, but he was serious. That evening he called some of the family together and announced that he was going to run, taking a hiatus from his successful law book publishing company and his beloved farm to do what he referred to as his duty.I find Gov. Kasich's decision to run for President similar to my Dad's decision: not something to do to cap off an impressive career, but instead answering the call from above. He is already the most qualified and experienced candidate in the Republican field, having served 18 years as a member of congress, 10 years in the private financial sector, and now more than four years as the very successful governor of the country's seventh-largest state. He doesn't need to be President, but he feels that the country is in need of strong, principled leadership. I, for one, feel that he is the candidate best suited to restore the American dream for us all and would ask you to join me in supporting Gov. Kasich for President.Peter Thomson is owner of Mt. Cube Farm in Orford. He is the son and former chief of staff to former New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim Thomson."

John Kasich,R,p,"July 29, 2015",Press Release - Fox Business: Opinion: Can John Kasich Fix Washington?,"By: Steve TobakJuly 28, 2015When you've worked with as many top executives as I have, you can't help but notice certain behavioral attributes that separate the extraordinary ones from the pack. Some qualities are probably fundamental to all great leaders, while others are surprisingly difficult to characterize.Take Ohio Governor John Kasich, for example. I wasn't the least bit surprised to see him enter the crowded field of GOP hopefuls for the 2016 presidential nomination. Fund-raising ability aside (not exactly my thing), as I see it, he's got an interesting balance of foundational and intangible qualities that make a great leader ... of a company or a nation.While he comes across as a regular guy with a sort of endearing folksy quality, when it comes to his position on key issues, he never wavers. He's always clear on what he stands for and why it makes sense to him. He's not an idealist, mind you, but a clear thinking pragmatist focused on his priorities. And while he's known for setting aggressive fiscal goals, he has an extraordinary track record of achieving them.As chairman of the House Budget Committee during the late 90s, he championed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and, during his tenure, the federal budget shifted from a deficit of $163 billion to a rare surplus of $236 billion. Likewise, as governor of Ohio, his priorities were to balance the budget, create jobs and slash unemployment without raising taxes. And that's exactly what he did.What I think few people understand about remarkably successful executives is how important it is for them to remain focused on critical priorities and not get distracted by all the noise.Read more"

John Kasich,R,p,"August 19, 2015",Press Release - CNN Guest Column: John Kasich: How to Make America Secure,"CNN  August 17, 2015No realistic look at the world today will leave us feeling good about America's security.Terrorism is increasingly striking here at home. Regional powers are challenging the postwar security order. Nuclear weapons are proliferating. Cyberspace has become a battlefield. The U.S. has neglected both our military and our alliances and has apparently decided, instead, to try to lead from behind.America urgently needs vision, stronger policies and the means to implement them to restore our nation's international standing and leadership.The economy is the forgotten starting point for this discussion.In my 18 years as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I never met a president who understood the link between a strong economy and strong national security better than Ronald Reagan. He was relentless in pursuing economic growth because he knew it would allow us to rebuild our military and win the Cold War. Putting Reagan's wisdom to work today means taking on America's $18 trillion debt and $463 billion deficit  the two greatest barriers to the economic growth it takes to keep us safe.That is why I support a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. When Washington takes up less space in the economy, job creators have more room to thrive. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, I led the last successful effort to balance the federal budget, and as governor of Ohio, I closed an $8 billion budget shortfall without increasing taxes. The next president must know how to balance budgets and keep them balanced, because it is the first thing we must do to keep America safe.Our second priority must be renewing our Navy. Other services have legitimate needs too, but reinvigorating the Navy's ability to project power globally is critical to defending and advancing American interests, including ensuring the free flow of global commerce.Those who mistakenly think they can deny access to a corner of the world  particularly in the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf  need another visit from a carrier battle group to remind them that the global commons are, in fact, just that: the world's shared real estate.The other global commons in need of defense are cyberspace. We need new tools and strategies to make cyberspace safe for commerce and the peaceful exchange of news and information.Even with a stronger military, there is always greater safety in numbers. America's relationships with our allies are the backbone of our security because they are political and military force-multipliers. They have been neglected, and America and the world have become less safe as a result.Renewing our alliances takes respectful engagement, integrating allied needs as we strengthen our military  ensuring that all parties pull their own weight  and candor and discretion. Such alliance cohesion is key: Airing our differences in public  as the Obama administration has done recently in its well-publicized tensions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  only emboldens our enemies.Any action that America takes, or suggests, is more effective if it is reinforced by a stronger military and renewed alliances. With these shored-up alliances, a stronger presence in the Western Pacific, a more aggressive allied stance toward Russia, and decisive allied action to eradicate ISIS would all produce better outcomes, as well as give potential future disruptive actors more pause for thought.Making the policy changes that secure our country cannot and should not be done by one party alone. If we want a safer country, we first need the courage to cooperate in our own Capitol and with those who share our fundamental values.In my nearly two decades on the House Armed Services Committee, my Democratic and Republican colleagues repeatedly worked together on tough issues like reforming military procurement and streamlining the defense bureaucracy so our troops would have the resources to defend our country. We can and must find a way to come together again so America can be safe.The changes I am proposing are admittedly big  unleashing the economy, strengthening our military and alliances, engaging our adversaries and, if all else fails, being more willing to project force decisively  but I am confident we can do it, because America's national security transcends partisanship.America's power has always been its people, so we should use that power to keep our people safe. Our willingness to strive together, sacrifice together, and serve one another are our essential strengths. To keep us safe and restore American standing and leadership, we must come together again and forge a new consensus around a realistic and sustainable vision for our future national security and the tools with which to implement it.Read the original column here."

John Kasich,"Today, the former Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives and 18-year legislative veteran Brent Siegrist endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President. Siegrist will serve as an advisor to the governor's campaign effort in Iowa and as part of his leadership team.""As the governor of a very important state, Gov. Kasich understands how to effectively run large operations,"" said Speaker Siegrist, ""And that experience is, in part, what makes him the right person to lead our nation as President. Under his watch, Ohio has been remarkably transformed, as he has turned budget deficits into surpluses, cut taxes more than any sitting governor, reduced the size of state government, and presided over an economy that put more than 350,000 Ohioans back to work. Combined with his 18 years in Congress where he led the effort to balance the federal budget and his decade in the private sector working with job creators across the country, John Kasich is the candidate who is most ready and capable of getting America back on track, and making certain that as our nation does better, every American will benefit.""A former high school teacher, Speaker Siegrist was first elected from Council Bluffs to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1984 and served for 18 years, including seven years as Republican Majority Leader and three years as Speaker.Said Gov.

His entrance in the race shook things up in New Hampshire, where a month after his late announcement he went to No. 3 in the polls.What distinguishes him in my mind is that everyone who writes about politics gets phonecalls from presidential candidates, and they're always about big thingsimmigration, spending, regulation, national security. But whenever Mr. Kasich has called, the conversation has gone to the mentally ill young, the drug-addicted and what's happeningon the ground in America. What is he hearing about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire, where admissions to state-run rehab facilities are dramatically up? ""I talk about it a lot because I know this stuff,"" he said in an interview last week. ""I got involved five years ago, when a group of ladies in southern Ohio came to me with pictures of their sons, athletes, who died of drug overdoses.""He spoke of ""an entire generation that is vulnerable to this because of the casual way we treated prescription drugsthen on to heroin.""His answer? Flood the zone with education, treatment, law enforcement, more programs in the schools"" Nancy Reagan was right, talk about it, air it."" He adds: ""Revive a sense of citizenship. If you see a kid you don't know, walk up to him, say, Please don't ever do drugs.' People say, Why would anyone do that?' I say, To help save your country.'""I don't gather Mr. Kasich is talking about ""compassionate conservatism,"" a generalized increase in various forms of spending, but something else: being alive and responsive to actual crises in American society. ""There's an arithmetic side of this but there's a moral side,"" he said. It costs more to keep drug addicts in prison than to get them ""on their feet and paying taxes."" And ""you don't throw people away. At least I don't.""""Why did conservatives allow themselves to be put in a trap,"" he asks, in which they're afraid to talk about these things? ""I balanced the budget in Ohio, I spent 10 years trying to balance the U.S. budget, I've cut taxes more than any living governor, we have a rocksolid credit rating. And because I care about the mentally ill and drug addicted and those in prison, that's not conservative? I believe that helping people have opportunity is all about conservatism. My mother used to say it's a sin not to help people who need help but equally a sin to continue to help people who need to learn how to help themselves.""Mr. Kasich has an unembarrassed heart.Read more here."

It was Kasich who forced himself into the foreign policy debate from the edge of the stage a few minutes later, refusing to be silenced. It was Kasich who dared to make a spirited defense of globalism, vowing to rebuild foreign alliances.Fiorina had the flashier moments and the best night. But Kasich did exactly what he had to do: He came off as a strong, capable alternative for party loyalists considering a change of direction.Washington Republicans remember Kasich well from his years in Congress. They remember him, in a lot of cases, as impetuous and immature.But now he's the most successful sitting governor in the field, and he has already surged into double digits in New Hampshire. So far, at least, he has managed to project Midwestern sobriety and a comfort with himself.And establishment Republicans are already whispering not so quietly about the potential of a Kasich-Rubio ticket, if that's what it takes to dispatch both Trump and Clinton...""""By the end of the year, someone will have emerged as the anti-Trump or anti-Carson in the field, the candidate who makes the establishment case that experience and electability are assets, rather than evils, when it comes to wining back the White House.That candidate could still be Jeb Bush. He's got time to steady himself, and plenty of cash.But opportunity knocks for Ohio's governor. And last night, once again, Bush left the door wide open.""Read more here."

John Kasich took a turn in the same chair. Kasich hadn't even announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination when we, like much of America, first engaged Trump. To the essay question that begins Compare-and-contrast:If you want a rocking-good time on Saturday night, hop aboard Trump's helicopter or yacht or limo or jet. Bring your own quick wit or you'll soon fall behind. But if you're shopping for, say, a new president for your divided nation, a grown-up who has spent decades proving how capable he is at working the levers of government to deliver solutions, then skip Trump's entertaining show and pay serious attention to Kasich. If enough Americans do, you might see his name atop your election ballot on Nov. 8, 2016.Even if he had a weak record in office, Kasich would wake up every day as a serious potential nominee. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio  something Kasich has done twice, most recently with 64 percent of the vote. GOP strategists get giddy at the prospect of pairing Kasich on a ticket with Marco Rubio (ascendant) or Jeb Bush (not really) of Florida, another gotta-have swing state.But Kasich, even with his Ohio State diploma, is more than a dutiful Buckeye. His nine terms in the U.S. House gave him 18 years on the Armed Services Committee and six years as chair of the Budget Committee. An Associated Press synopsis of his career notes that in the latter capacity he was ""the chief architect of a deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969.""As governor Kasich eliminated an Illinois-scale budget deficit and grew Ohio's rainy-day fund from 89 cents (true) to more than $2 billion. Ohio's economy is in growth mode and his state government is less bureaucratic than when he took office in 2011.You can read the full editorial here."

I greatly admired and liked him then, and my admiration has only grown during his highly acclaimed five years as Governor of our nation's seventh-largest state. I can sum up John Kasich in three Cs. Character. Conservative principles. Competence and experience I completely trust. Impressive as the other candidates may be, no other candidate can match John Kasich. I recommend him enthusiastically to Granite Staters,"" said Humphrey.""Governor Kasich is a proven reformer and a conservative fiscal leader without parallel. As someone who has worked extensively in state government, I know how hard it can be to make big changes while still bringing people together, which is why John Kasich's record of results stands apart so much. He is the leader our country needs and I'm proud to be part of his team to make that happen,"" said Thomson.Humphrey was a grassroots conservative leader who won election to the U.S. Senate from New Hampshire in 1978 and served two terms. Despite his popularity he did not run again as he pledged to only serve 12 years. In the Senate he was a member of the Senate Armed Services and the Foreign Relations committees and was a strong fiscal conservative.

Not only is he a strong advocate for the sanctity of life but he is also a strong fiscal conservative and an expert on national security and foreign policy. As Americans we need to rededicate ourselves to the truth that strength leads to peace and that a strong America contributes to global stability. That is the leadership that Gordon Humphrey championed in Washington and, with his help, it's the leadership I will bring to the White House.

Kasich also repeated his call for the U.S. to contribute to a regional coalition of ground troops to defeat ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.""Russia's recent military build-up and intervention in Syria are neither intended to defeat ISIS nor to relieve the suffering of Syrian refugees. Mr. Putin's real goals are quite different: to take military action to rescue Assad's criminal government from its death and to strengthen Russia's strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean. This is unacceptable and must stop.""The Syrian opposition and three of Syria's regional neighbors, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, insist that the violent actions of Bashar al-Assad's government against its own people, described by the UN as crimes against humanity, disqualify Assad from any further legitimate claim to rule the country. All that Mr. Putin's attempts to keep the Assad government alive will therefore achieve is to extend the Syrian people's suffering. Saudi Arabia has stated that Mr. Putin's actions in Syria may cause it to intervene militarily in Syria. To prevent further escalation and suffering by civilians and refugees, the U.S. and its regional and West European allies need to establish sanctuary areas in Syria that are protected by 'no fly zones.'""With hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from clandestine oil exports and other illegal activity, increasingly sophisticated arms and equipment and an international network of supporters far superior to any enjoyed by al-Qaeda on 9/11, ISIS poses a serious threat to the U.S. and its allies. This leaves little choice but to act against ISIS immediately, or potentially pay a much higher price later.""The United States, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, and the Arab League should deploy a regional coalition of ground troops to defeat al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The coalition should be regionally led. It should remain deployed until a transitional council can achieve a regional commitment to a sustainable political solution that will restore peace and security to Syria and Iraq.""No one should be deluded into thinking that Russian military intervention is a solution to Syria's problems. Putin seeks to advance Russian interests in the region. Nor should we allow Mr. Putin to use the Syrian crisis to distract attention from his ongoing aggression in Ukraine.""Now is the time for the United States to provide the moral leadership that it has so far failed to provide. We must act decisively, rally our allies and contribute troops to a regional military coalition in order to put an end to the years of suffering caused by this conflict."""

In all, eighteen officeholders and party officials announced their endorsement of Kasich today, including seven current state legislators, the former Chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, three county party chairmen, and current and former public officials from across the state.Republican Leader Christine Radogno is the first female Caucus Leader of either party in Illinois General Assembly history. Leader Radogno has served in the Illinois Senate since 1997, represents the 41st District in DuPage, Will and Cook Counties, and is a sitting member on the Senate Executive Committee. She is considered a top expert on the Illinois state budget, providing leadership across an array of budgetary challenges to help put the state on solid financial ground.Said Leader Radogno, ""As governor, John Kasich took over a state that was dying. Before he took office, Ohio had lost more than 350,000 private sector jobs, faced an $8 billion projected budget hole, and businesses were fleeing to other states. In four short years, he helped turn his state around, and under his watch, Ohio has created 347,000 private sector jobs, amassed a $2 billion surplus, and by cutting taxes by more than $5 billion, Ohio became business-friendly again. As a leader in a state very similar to Ohio, I understand the significance of his accomplishments.

John Kasich,R,p,"October 15, 2015",Press Release - Washington Post: John Kasich: Washington is Obsolete #ResultsNow,"John Kasich: Washington is obsoleteBy John Kasich October 15John Kasich is governor of Ohio and a Republican candidate for president.The biggest problem with America's economy is called Washington. The anemic growth we have today isn't because the federal government failed to do enough but because it succeeded in doing too much.Take the so-called stimulus package designed to pull us out of the Great Recession. Its gift was underwhelming growth, stratospheric deficits and an $18 trillion debt. If our long, slow recovery stalls or turns south, is more government ""help"" the answer? No. It would deepen our problem, further balloon Washington and leave less economic oxygen available for Americans and businesses.If we want to get serious about economic growth, we need less government and more ""us."" We need to take our money, power and influence from Washington and bring it back to the states and communities where we live. That is the federalism the Founding Fathers intended for us, and in the first 100 days of my administration, I will seek votes in Congress to restore it.It starts with restraining spending and balancing the budget in eight years, cutting personal and corporate taxes to spark growth, and re-engineering the entitlement programs that are bankrupting us and failing those who need them. It also means reining in regulations so we can, among other things, produce more energy from all sources and become energy-independent. But at the center of this renewal is transferring major pieces of Washington's responsibilities back to the states to reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase innovation.Let's start with infrastructure. The interstate system is longfinished, and states already oversee their own highway design and construction. Americans don't need a costly federal highway bureaucracy. I will return the federal gas taxes to the states, leaving only a sliver with the federal government for truly national needs. Then, I will downsize the Transportation Department and reassign it a smaller role, supporting states with research and safety standards. Federal spending would go down, resources available for highways and transit could go up, and states could work faster.The Education Department will receive a similar approach. Washington isn't America's principal or its teacher. Education is a local issue, and decisions should be made by parents, our communities and our local educators. We need high standards, but they are not Washington's business. I will bundle the department's funds and send them back to the states with fewer strings attached. The department will be a research center and a local school booster, not a micromanager.The same goes for the dozens of jobtraining programs Washington runs. With little room for state innovations or real business input, workers basically can't get help until after they've lost their jobs. I will let states align training with the skills that employers want and help workers with jobs upgrade their skills so their employers can stay in business and compete.And nowhere has Washington's one-size-fits-all approach done more harm to innovation and those it should be serving than with Medicaid. In Ohio we reined in Medicaid costs and are improving health outcomes by using private-sector health insurance and coordinated chronic-disease care and by paying for health-care value instead of just volume. If Washington eased its grip, there would be even more innovation to improve quality and constrain Medicaid's unsustainable costs.There may have been a time when our nation's size and complexity required a strong, centralized government, but today's technology gives states access to the same ideas and capabilities as Washington  and they can execute faster and more efficiently. Downsizing Washington and pulling back our money effectively leverage those advantages to drive higher productivity and rates of growth.Like our founders, I have never trusted big, centralized power. It is hard to hold in check, abuses are inevitable, and over time it becomes wasteful, insular and arrogant. I enjoy taking it on and beating it, however, as when I chaired the House Budget Committee and led the effort to balance the federal budget, or in Ohio, where we've turned an $8 billion projected shortfall to a $2 billion surplus.Reclaiming federalism will take the same guts, because those who live off Washington's bloat won't go quietly. If we want results now, however, it's worth the fight  to revive our economy and restore the intended hierarchy of power in our nation: first our communities and states and then the federal government.No solution to our economic paralysis  or Washington's gridlock  better reflects our founders' vision than federalism. It will be hard, but with the courage to put our country and each other first, we can attain the security and opportunity we want, for those we care about and for the future. They're within our reach.Read the original column on the Washington Post (here).Read more about the Kasich Action Plan: JohnKasich.com/ResultsNow"

No, we are not. In its annual ranking, the Cato Institute shows that 15 other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, are less burdened by regulations, bureaucracy and counterproductive taxes than the U.S. Alarmingly, America fell from 2nd to 16th place since 2000. No wonder most Americans have had no real growth in family income for years.The problem with America's economy is called Washington. Stagnant growth isn't from the federal government doing too little; it's from too much regulating, taxing and stubbornly standing in our way. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, Washington is not the solution; it's the problem.As John Kasich has said, ""We need less government and more us.'"" That is a message that would have gotten our Founding Fathers' heads nodding.

John Kasich,R,p,"October 23, 2015",Press Release - Union Leader Op-Ed (John Kasich): Balancing the Budget is a Moral Imperative,"Balancing the Budget is a Moral ImperativeThe Union Leader  10/23/15This month, I introduced a comprehensive and real plan to balance the federal budget; shift money, power and influence out of Washington; and grow our economy. Under my plan, America would have a balanced budget for the first time in 15 years.Balancing the federal budget is a moral imperative that politicians in both political parties have ignored for decades because they are unwilling to make the hard decisions. As a result of politicians' unwillingness to control spending, every child born in America today is saddled with $57,000 in debt. It is fundamentally wrong to burden our children and grandchildren with our debts because we are unable to say no to more spending.I know we can balance the budget because I've done it before  in Ohio and in Congress. In the '90s, I was Budget Chairman of the House Budget Committee and served as the chief architect of the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. When I left Washington we had a projected $5 trillion surplus. I could not fathom Washington blowing through that money, but they did. In a rare instance of bipartisanship, Republican and Democrats worked together to spend the surplus and create record debt.When I became governor of Ohio our state faced an $8 billion budget hole  nearly 20 percent of our revenue. Many said we could not solve the deficit without raising taxes, but we found a better way. We transformed government and made the hard decisions necessary to balance our budget. Today, the $8 billion budget hole is a $2 billion surplus  and we have cut taxes by $5 billion the most of any sitting governor.Ohio now has the fewest government employees in 30 years. We've controlled the growth of Medicaid. According to media reports after adjusting for inflation and population growth, we actually shrunk the size of Ohio's government.We can and must balance the federal budget again. I'm the only candidate with a plan to make it happen. My proposal freezes non-defense discretionary spending and sends money, power and influence back to the states. Education, transportation, Medicaid, welfare, and job training will be transferred back to the states because I believe that New Hampshire can make better decisions on those issues than unelected bureaucrats in Washington.We will also reform entitlements. Our reforms will curb the growth of Medicare and Medicaid  major cost drivers for the federal government.As we balance the budget for the first time in a generation we will also invest more in defense. It is vital that we rebuild our military to meet the threats of the 21st century. The world needs a strong America and my budgets will make sure our military is strengthened.We will also cut taxes for individuals and businesses to boost our economy. We will kill the death tax. We will restore America's global competitiveness so we grow jobs here at home and businesses don't ship them overseas. We will encourage innovation and risk-taking by job creators and we will rein in the IRS so it treats all taxpayers fairly.By making the hard decisions, sending power back to the states, and growing our economy, we will balance America's budget within eight years. I have a plan to balance the budget. It will take leadership, vision and courage. But, we know it can be done because we've done it before.Read the original op-ed here."

John Kasich,R,p,"November 2, 2015","Press Release - Bloomberg Politics: Kasich Would Eliminate U.S. Commerce Department, Cabinet Post","Bloomberg Politics  Monday, November 2, 2015Kasich Would Eliminate U.S. Commerce Department, Cabinet PostBy Margaret NewkirkRepublican John Kasich would eliminate the U.S. Commerce Department and its White House cabinet post if he were elected president, calling the agency a ""cluttered attic.""Kasich would transfer many of the department's duties to other agencies, according to a proposal released by his campaign. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which accounts for about half the department's budget and includes the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center, would move to the Department of Interior.The department is a repository for ""hiding political pet projects, outdated programs, and agencies without a logical home,"" the campaign said in a statement. ""The resulting Franken-agency simply no longer makes sense.""The Ohio governor was the last to enter the crowded Republican primary and has tried to position himself as the most experienced and practical candidate in the field. He was tied for fifth place with Carly Fiorina in New Hampshire according to an Oct. 21 Bloomberg Politics/St. Anselm poll; 7 percent of those polled identified them as their first choice.Kasich's proposal provides additional detail about a broader plan he announced Oct. 15 to balance the federal budget within eight years, including by downsizing and shifting power and responsibility to states. Eliminating the Commerce Department would be a template, his campaign said.While the idea of consolidating or closing federal agencies isn't new and was even proposed in 2012 by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, such ideas haven't been accomplished in a gridlocked Washington, Kasich has said.Under Kasich's plan, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would become a standalone agency.The Commerce Department's international trade functions would be split between the State Department and the International Trade Commission and an economic development grant program would be folded into the Housing and Urban Development agency.Kasich would combine the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, merge the Minority Business Development Agency into the Small Business Administration and reduce duplication between the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunication and Information Administration.The changes would cost more initially because of closing and relocating offices, Kasich said, but would more than recoup those costs over time."

John Kasich,R,p,"November 2, 2015",Press Release - Kasich Unveils Further Details of Strategy to Dismantle the Washington Bureaucracy,"KASICH UNVEILS FURTHER DETAILS OF STRATEGY TO DISMANTLE THE WASHINGTON BUREAUCRACYPlan for Long-Overdue Closure of Commerce Department Would Be Template for Other AgenciesToday Ohio Gov. John Kasich unveiled further details of his plan for dismantling the Washington bureaucracy with a proposal for shutting down the U.S. Department of Commerce, an agency that has been marked for elimination by both Republicans and Democrats for 30 years yet still exists due to Washington gridlock.Kasich's plan for eliminating the Commerce Departmenta ""Franken-agency"" comprised of a mishmash of unrelated functionsis a template for how he would shrink, consolidate and improve other federal agencies in order to balance the budget in eight years and take our power, money and influence back to our states and communities.""Commerce is a case study in Washington dysfunction. It's like a basement that politicians keep stuffing pet projects into and it never gets cleaned out. As a result, needed efforts suffer and costs and efficiency are ignored. I will break it up, put the pieces we need in the right places, send other pieces back to the states and simply stop doing those things that aren't needed. Americans would save money and it would send a huge signal to Washington that business as usual is over. My plan for Commerce is a template I would take to all federal agenciesshrink, consolidate, shutdown and send responsibilities back to us in our states and communities,"" said Kasich.Some of the highlights of Kasich's plan include: Consolidating Natural Resources Agencies: Almost half of the Commerce Department's budget goes to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center. These and related efforts would be consolidated at the Department of the Interior, which has a similar mission to study the natural world and preserve and safeguard America's natural resources. Improving Trade Promotion & Trade Violation Enforcement: Trade promotion and monitoring of sensitive exports would go to the State Department, while trade deal enforcement would be consolidated at the International Trade Commission to speed responses to violations. Returning Economic Power to States and Communities: Commerce's economic development grant programs are similar to those in state governments and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. They would be reviewed for duplication and then transferred to HUD where they would be returned to states and communities in large flexible block grants. Trade adjustment efforts could be transferred to the Department of Labor, where similar efforts exist. Improving Economic and Population Statistical Analysis: The Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis would be consolidated with the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, a natural move given their similar cultures, regular coordination and shared constituencies.Savings would vary based on how and where offices are moved, but overall savings would be significant: for every 1 percentage point of reduced spending, approximately $1 billion would be saved over 10 years.Other details of Kasich's outline for eliminating the Commerce Department can be found here.Kasich's outline for eliminating the Commerce Department is additional, promised detail of his recently-released economic growth strategy, the Kasich Action Plan. This multi-faceted plan for getting America's economy moving again calls for a balanced budget in eight years and a balanced budget constitutional amendment, tax cuts for families and businesses, increasing energy supplies and security, cutting federal regulations and shrinking the federal bureaucracy's cost and interference by streamlining agencies and, whenever appropriate, sending responsibilities back to states and communities."

John Kasich,R,p,"November 17, 2015","Press Release - John Kasich - National Security Speech, Washington, D.C.","Read the TranscriptA COMPREHENSIVE OUTLINE FOR AMERICAN SECURITY IN A CHAOTIC WORLDOverdue Leadership Against Terrorism & Resurgent Powers Requires A New Commitment to Military Strength, Allied Relationships and Our Fundamental ValuesThe November 13, 2015 attacks on Paris illuminated the enormous chasm between the worldview of civilized people and the worldview of the terrorists who committed these acts of terror. There is no negotiating with this kind of darknesswe must overcome it. Unless we get serious about defeating the evil we witnessed in Paris, we leave the door open to similar attacks in our own cities.Gov. Kasich has proposed a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS, strengthen our military, and work with our allies to confront ongoing threats to our mutual security. Bullets may win battles, but ideas win wars. It is not enough to defeat terrorists and stand-down regional bullies. We must reassert our Western values of democracy, human rights, and individual freedom if we hope to secure the long-term stability of America and preserve our way of life.Defeat ISIS: Wiping ISIS off the map requires a complex, collaborative strategy involving mutual defense action by NATOas well as regional alliesin the wake of the attack on France, intensifying international intelligence cooperation, increasing support to the highly-effective Kurdish military, creating safe havens and no-fly zones, combating human trafficking in refugees, a NATO & regional coalition with ground troops, and more aggressively fighting the war of ideas to discredit ISIS.CHALLENGE REGIONAL AGGRESSION: America's unwillingness to lead in the fight against terrorism has wrongly signaled to opponents with expansionist agendas, such as Russia and China, that belligerent actions will be tolerated. U.S. must reassert its strength to reverse these losses in leadership and security. Stand Up to Russia:The U.S. must work together with our European allies to strengthen new NATO member states on the front lines with Russia, such as Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, by supplying them, repositioning existing U.S. forces onto their eastern borders supported by a new, strong integrated air defense system there, and jointly committing to higher defense spending targets. We must also help ensure a free Ukraine by training and arming Ukrainian forces with the weapons they have requested and which Congress has approved. Counter China: In order to stand by our allies who feel threatened by China's aggressive actions in the South China Sea, the U.S. must work with regional allies to significantly increase our military presence in region and ensure freedom of navigation for the $5.3 trillion in annual trade that passes through the Western Pacific. We must help Japan defend its territorial waters with advanced seabed acoustic sensors, anti-ship missiles and other defensive equipment. We must also forward deploy our Pacific combat commander to Guam and station additional Air Force and Marines Corps units in the Western Pacific where they can conduct regular joint regional amphibious landing exercises.RENEW OUR MILITARY: As America's commitment to security leadership has withered, our military has been neglected. John Kasich has called for $102 billion in increased defense spending over the next eight years to improve our conventional capabilities and create new cyber defense resources to better safeguard our security. IT STARTS WITH THE ECONOMY: Military strength requires economic strength, and Gov. Kasich has crafted a realistic plan to revive the economy by cutting taxes, balancing the budget in eight years, and cutting regulations that kills jobs. REBUILD THE U.S. MILITARY FROM THE GROUND UP: We must rebuild our defenses while leveraging the strengths of our allies in order to effectively challenge the capabilities of our enemies. We can ensure that scarce resources reach the troops who need them most by streamlining Pentagon bureaucracy and transforming procurement processes to get new weapons systems into the field on time and on budget. Strengthen cyber defenses: We must defend against cyber attacks on our government and businesses, as well as counter the online activities of jihadis and other opponents. We must work with our allies to identify sources of attack and develop a coordinated response to anyone that attacks the resources of our government and the private sector.RENEW OUR ALLIANCES: There is strength in numbers and consensus, but our allies feel neglected and abused. We must rebuild these critical relationships in order to better advance our national interests the leadership that produces much-needed global stability. Among other actions, this includes standing by Israelour strongest ally in the Middle East, supporting Ukraine in its challenges from Russia, standing by Egypt as it fights terrorist insurgencies from Sinai and Libya, supporting our Pacific allies in the face of Chinese belligerence and supporting Israeli efforts defend itself and oppose Iranian-backed terrorism in the region.RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES: By using public diplomacy to spread the ideas that are foundational to our own freedom and prosperity, the U.S. can play a critical role in making the world more stable. We must rededicate ourselves to the values that underpin and unite the Western world: democracy, a respect for individual and civil liberties, a respect for human rights, a belief in the equality of men and women, and a tolerance of different worldviews and religious beliefs. We must develop new strategies for fighting the war of ideas over the Internet, social media, and video, as well as the traditional tools of television, radio, and satellite. At the same time we must also develop stronger measures to combat jihadist efforts to recruit and spread their message via the Internet.BOTTOM LINE: America has wavered in its resolve to stand up for what it believes. Into this vacuum extremism has spread and our nation-state opponents have pursued their own interests at the expense of ours and our allies. We must choose to lead once again, which requires us to rebuild the tools of leadershipour military and the force-multiplying relationships with the allies who share our basic values. Then, we must act decisively to advance our national interests and proclaim our fundamental values in order to sustainably secure global stability by winning the war of ideas."

We can and must defeat them tactically and strategically. We can't wait any longer to build a military coalition that wipes them out, degrades and destroys them.ISIS, with their brutal attacks on women, their beheadings and their attacks on people of faith is at war with civilization. ISIS represents more than a national security threat. It is deeper. They want to destroy our way of life and bring an end to the West.Unless we want to see the blood spilled in Paris flow here in America and in the streets of our allies' capitals, we need to get serious about wiping ISIS off the map. Negotiation, ambivalence and delay are unacceptable. There can be no negotiating or delay with this darkness; we simply must defeat it.We must join a coalition with our European and Middle Eastern allies to defeat and destroy ISIS on the ground. Bombings are not enough. We must root them out and destroy them. By attacking Paris, ISIS declared war not just on France but on the West.

We are defending our very way of life.In addition to destroying ISIS with a coalition of boots on the ground, we must arm moderates, we must arm the Kurdis in both Syria and Iraq in order to help them defend their homelands and take the fight to ISIS as we prepare our collective response. With a coalition we must create and enforce no-fly zones in Syria where refugees can find shelter. Our allies in the region must provide sanctuary for those displaced by war.For too long we have shown an unwillingness to lead. One administration official said we should lead from behind. This is unacceptable. If America does not lead, we will leave the world a much more dangerous place. There is no doubt we can win the battle with bullets and weapons, and we must do so now. But, more important, we must win the battle of ideas. If we defeat ISIS without also defeating its twisted ideology, similar organizations will take its place.The West must remember its root values. While ISIS seeks to shed the blood of anyone who believes differently, the West recommit itself to what it believes and make it heard around the world. That means improving public diplomacy and using the Internet, social media and video to proclaim our ideas and counter the extremists' lies. ISIS uses every medium possible to spread their message of hate. We must attack them where they are working to gather new recruits and spreading their propagandathe arena of ideas.Throughout history Americans have always defended our values and ideas. We are once again at a tipping point. We must gather ourselves and rally our allies for this fight that must be won. I am confident we can do it. Each time our nation has faced a challenge we have risen to meet it. This is no different, but the stakes could not be higher. Our way of life depends on it.Read the original op-ed (here).You can also learn more about John Kasich's National Security Plan at: JohnKasich.com/NationalSecurity"
John Kasich,R,p,"November 22, 2015",Press Release - Ohio Political Leaders to Trump: This is Kasich Country,"On the eve of Donald Trump's speech in Columbus, three veteran Ohio political leaders reaffirmed Ohio Gov. John Kasich's popularity and political dominance in the must-win state for Republicans seeking the White House, citing Kasich's record of level-headed leadership that Ohioans value, in contrast to Trump's ""divisive"" and ""inflammatory"" approach. From former U.S. Senator George Voinovich (R-Ohio):""The next President needs to unify Americans, not divide them. We should be asking candidates what they are for, not what are they against. Donald Trump's rhetoric has been egomaniacal, inflammatory, and divisive. It is not what America needs. We need a leader that talks about what 'we,' not 'I' can do; a leader that will bring us together and that will re-establish America's faith in their government and be respected, again, as the world's leader. We need a leader that treats everyone with dignity and respect, and understands that you can't achieve anything unless you work with the legislature on the national scene and with other world leaders on the international scene. We need a leader that knows we have a symbiotic relationship with others and the more we work together, the better off we all will be. ""That is why I am supporting John Kasich. He is the only candidate that has demonstrated this kind of leadership on the state and national levels. As governor, he worked with the legislature to move Ohio ahead and it earned him a 62 percent approval rating. In Congress he worked with both sides to balance the budget in 1997 and the following four years. We also should be impressed that former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is supporting John Kasich. He is the leader we need to hit the ground running on Day One to lead our nation.""From former Ohio Attorney General and Auditor of State Betty D. Montgomery:""Ohio is a richly diverse state that seeks balance in its politics. Ohioans are inherently mistrustful of extremes on either end of the political spectrum and we respect and celebrate the diverse backgrounds, traditions and views that make our great state. No presidential candidate should be divisive, bigoted, or sexist. Our candidates are not characters on some coarse reality show seeking ratings at the expense of truth and civility. Our candidates are running to be leader of the free world at a time of great world turmoil and grave danger. As an American, Donald Trump embarrasses me; as an Ohioan, I do not believe he cannor shouldwin an election in the must-win state of Ohio against Hillary Clinton.""From Dave Johnson, Ohio Republican Party Central Committeeman, Columbiana County Republican Party Chairman, Northeast Ohio business leader""If Republicans want to win Ohio and the White House next year, we're going to need a serious candidate that can beat the Clinton machine. John Kasich is that candidate. He has turned Ohio around by balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reducing regulatory burdens on Ohio businesses, embracing new oil and gas development and by being a positive, consensus building leader. Not only did he win 86 of 88 counties in his reelection last year, but his job approval rating is sky-high. Ohio Republicans are smart enough to pick a candidate that can actually win our state and take back the White House and they trust John Kasich's ability to apply conservative ideas to problems and produce the results we need."""

John Kasich,R,p,"December 2, 2015",Press Release - Montana Entrepreneurs Greg Franks and Greg Trangmoe Think John Kasich Should Be President,"Today two Montana businessmen and entrepreneurs, Greg Franks and Greg Trangmoe, endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for President. Franks and Trangmoe will serve as Montana State Co-Chairs for Kasich for America.Greg Franks is the owner of Digital Video Systems in Billings, Montana. He first met John Kasich as a volunteer during a field House Budget Committee hearing held in Billings in February of 1995. Said Franks, ""I quickly realized that John Kasich was not the typical politician who just offered lip service  he actually said what he was going to do and got it done. Those initial hearings led to the first balanced budget in my lifetime, and it hasn't been done since Kasich left Congress. If our nation is going to get our economy back on track, then we must restore fiscal discipline to Washington, and who better to do that than the last person who got that done.""Greg Trangmoe is a computer engineer and attorney in Stevensville, Montana, providing consulting services to entrepreneurs and start-up businesses. He did not follow politics until he happened upon a 1990s Meet the Press interview with Kasich that thrust him into politics, and led him to becoming a technology advisor for Kasich's 2000 presidential bid. Said Trangmoe, ""Kasich's straight-forward message of fiscal responsibility and personal accountability struck a chord and inspired me, and I immediately became a believer in him. Now, two decades later, I know that John Kasich's experience and independence make him the right person to lead our country to renewed prosperity while upholding the values important to Montanans.""Said Kasich, ""Franks and Trangmoe are trusted friends and advisors, and I am grateful for the confidence they continue to place in me.

John Kasich,R,p,"December 9, 2015",Press Release - International Business Times: John Kasich Foreign Policy Speech: Anti-Islamic State War On Terror Urged By Republican Presidential Candidate,"John Kasich Foreign Policy Speech: Anti-Islamic State War On Terror Urged By Republican Presidential CandidateBy Jess McHughInternational Business Times: Ahead of the highly anticipated GOP presidential debate next week, Ohio Gov. and candidate John Kasich condemned President Barack Obama's foreign policy efforts in Syria while laying out his own proposal for fighting Islamic extremism. The White House hopeful, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City Wednesday, cautioned against divisive political rhetoric while pushing for a stronger military response to the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, as well as expanded intelligence-gathering to fight radicalization both in the U.S. and online.""The challenge posed by ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a symptom of a broader weakness in America's national security policy: failing to advance what we believe and our basic national interests,"" Kasich said, criticizing the Obama administration's course of action against the terrorist organization, commonly called the Islamic State but also known as ISIS and Daesh.Kasich has garnered modest voter support and touted his track record of successful economic policies at the state and national level, but he's also been overshadowed by other candidates when it comes to foreign policy debates. He has repeatedly called for voters and journalists alike to focus on substantive campaign issues rather than outlandish, attention-grabbing, hyperbolic statements from candidates like real estate mogul Donald Trump. ""I have been attacking not Donald Trump but Donald Trump's ideas that divide this country, and I'm glad to provide a little cover for those who are beginning to wake up,"" Kasich said Wednesday when asked what he thought of Trump's plan to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. as a means to prevent terrorism.Ohio's governor since 2010, Kasich is perhaps best known on a national level for chairing the House Budget Committee for several years in the 1990s and balancing the federal budget in 1997, a feat that hadn't been achieved since the 1960s. He was also a prominent legislator on foreign policy, serving on the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years.To establish peace in Syria, Kasich said, a broader international coalition, as well as a possible ground invasion, was necessary. The U.S. has been leading an air coalition in Syria, in cooperation with France, Turkey and several other international allies, conducting anti-ISIS bombing campaigns. ""An air campaign on its own is simply not enough,"" he said, before adding: ""We will all be on the ground sooner or later. Sooner is better than later.""Obama has been reluctant to send U.S. forces to the region, fearing a long and expensive ground war similar to the invasion of Iraq. He announced the deployment of the first ground soldiers, a few dozen special forces, in October. Kasich said Obama should be spending more money and effort on arming international forces that are already on the ground fighting ISIS, such as the Kurdish military forces, while aiming to create safe havens and no-fly zones for civilians in the region.Kasich's speech highlighted what he said was the need to not only fight terrorism abroad but also defend the nation against domestic attacks, particularly from a growing cyberthreat. ""There's new dimensions that have been added to the threat on our security,"" he said, making reference to the fear of malicious hacking from China, as the U.S. saw in September, and to the ability of groups like ISIS to recruit online.""The actual scope and industrial scale of this problem now poses a significant threat to individual privacy and security, to our international competitiveness, and to our national security,"" he said, urging heightened surveillance of individuals on terror watch lists as well as advanced decryption technology to pinpoint terrorists before they strike.Click here for the full article."

""And Kasich knows the federal budget better than all the other candidates.""As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Kasich helped reach across party aisles in 1997, working with Congressional Democrats and President Bill Clinton's administration to create a fiscal plan that balanced the budget for the first time since 1969, according to Edwards.If the role of president is somewhat akin to that of a corporate CEO, Kasich's aptitude in controlling costs may be the most important of the skills he could bring to the job. While he has never been a corporate CEO, along with his work in finance, he has served as Ohio's chief executive since 2011.In that role, he reduced the state income tax by 16% and eliminated the so-called ""death tax"" under which the state collected a portion of household and small-business assets when they were included in inheritances.Click here for the full article:"

John Kasich has moved into third place in the state holding America's first presidential primary in less than seven weeks.Kasich gets 13 percent in an American Research Group poll of likely primary voters, behind only Donald Trump (21 percent) and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (15).Right behind the Ohio governor are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (12 percent) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (10 percent).A third-place finish undoubtedly would be celebrated by the Kasich campaign  especially if they topped fellow ""establishment lane"" stalwarts Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who receives only 7 percent. Kasich was sixth in two other recently released polls of the Granite State, although several of the contenders are jumbled in the middle of the pack.Among only Republican voters in today's poll, Kasich ties Trump for second, a single point behind Rubio.Kasich also is tied for second, with Rubio four points behind Trump, among voters say they are most likely to actually vote.Just 16 percent of New Hampshire voters say they never would vote for Kasich, while 57 rule Trump out.The survey of a random sample of 600 likely Republican primary voters (329 Republicans and 271 independents) via landline and cell phone Sunday through Tuesday has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points."

He typically points to an economic revival in Ohio and before that, a balanced budget in Washington while he was in Congress.And while he understands money is part of the game, he's says he's not selling anything.""I think you think that the whole thing is a rip-off.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so,"" Kasich said.Kasich is also convinced he's the candidate who Democrats would least like to see in the general election, as a candidate who has managed to earn support by putting problem-solving over party affiliation.""As president, I can see him saying, What are the issues of my country that I need to help for everybody to benefit?'"" said Dan Moriarty, Nashua alderman.Kasich will wrap up a two-day trip to New Hampshire with town hall meeting No. 48 in Keene Tuesday night.He will return to the Granite State early next week."
John Kasich,R,p,"January 4, 2016",Press Release - Portsmouth Herald Op-Ed: Kasich is Best Candidate for President,"Op-Ed: Kasich is best candidate for presidentBy Doug ScammanPortsmouth Herald: Balancing Government budgets is a matter of making government more efficient and making sure the needed services are funded.Balancing budgets in public office involves much more than math. The act of budget balancing is an acknowledgement that government can't and should not do everything, and that choices must be made and priorities set.Most important  only by balancing the budget will we create the certainty our economy needs to truly begin growing at the pace we need.Only one candidate seeking the GOP nomination even talks about balancing the federal budget. And he talks with authority, because he was the last one to do it.John Kasich is this disciple of discipline. For 35 years, he has talked the talk and walked the walk. With this one candidate, there is no concern that he's just spouting election year rhetoric. Kasich has been a budget hawk for decades.Consider this: as a young congressman from Central Ohio, Kasich, on his own and with only the support of his small staff, wrote his own federal budget. It was balanced, but it didn't get very far other than to draw snickers and wisecracks.Like an outmanned fighter, Kasich got back on his feet, and did the same thing two years later. And two years after that, in 1997, as a part of the Gingrich revolution, John Kasich was the chief architect of the balanced budget when Bill Clinton signed it. It was the first time it had happened since the year man first walked on the moon.Read more here."

John Kasich,R,p,"January 9, 2016",Press Release - Endorsement: U.S. Senator Rob Portman Endorses John Kasich for President,"ENDORSEMENT: U.S. SENATOR ROB PORTMAN ENDORSES JOHN KASICH FOR PRESIDENTToday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich to be the next President of the United States. Portman will serve as a National and Ohio Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign.Portman and Kasich served in the U.S. House of Representatives together and were both elected to statewide office in Ohio in 2010. They have worked together for more than two decades on behalf of Ohio and share a commitment to the conservative policies that create opportunities for all Americans to rise.Portman issued the following statement:""I have decided to endorse Governor John Kasich for President because he is a leader who has a proven record of delivering results. John turned Ohio around at a tough time and I believe he can do the same for our country. I have known John for over 20 years and consider him a good friend. John inherited a mess from former Governor Ted Strickland. Under Governor Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation, as companies left Ohio for other states. Applying Ohio commonsense and conservative values, Governor Kasich worked with the Republican team to turn a record $8 billion shortfall into a $2 billion surplus, cut taxes by $5 billion, and added over 385,000 new jobs. Governor Kasich has done a great job leading Ohio's comeback, and I believe he is needed now to do the same for our country as the next President of the United States.""Kasich said: ""Rob is a tremendous asset for Ohio in the Senate and has played an important role in the recovery of jobs for our state. We worked together as I helped Ohioans recover from the mess left behind by my predecessor and Rob's opponent, Ted Strickland, and I'm very proud to have his endorsement. Rob is a rare voice for common sense in Washington and someone who delivers real results. I look forward to him returning to the Senate and working with him as President to advance the strategies that keep our economy strong and our country safe.""During his career Portman has earned the respect of colleagues on both sides of the political aisle for his work on IRS reform, balanced budgets, drug prevention, land conservation, welfare reform and to tear down trade barriers to U.S. exports.As a National Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign, Portman will join former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), former U.S. Senator John E. Sununu (R-NH), conservative stalwart Gay Gaines and influential entrepreneur Larry Paul in helping guide the Kasich campaign's nationwide efforts.

As a U.S. congressman, Kasich said, he once fought against the Pentagon's request for 132 B-2 bombers to be built at a $1 billion apiece. He pushed for 13, and Congress ultimately agreed on 20.""The Pentagon is inherently bureaucratic and wasteful. We build things we don't need, and it takes too long to get anything built,"" Kasich said. ""The dollars we have to put in the military are precious. If we blow it on red-tape bureaucracy, then we're cheating the men and women in the military, but we definitely need to spend the money.""""The Republican Party is my vehicle and not my master,"" Kasich said to one of the biggest applauses of the afternoon.

Want your nation, your community, your home to be safer? Vote for a governor for president.Senators are talkers. They're philosophers and poets, dwelling in the abstract, dealing in words. The Republican talkers are Sens. Rubio and Cruz.Rubio has his poetic lines down pat. But, as the Conway Sun said after a recent interview, Rubio is like ""a computer algorithm designed to cover talking points... It was like someone wound him up, pointed him towards the door and pushed 'play.' ""Ted Cruz, is another whiz-kid on the soapbox. But that hasn't impressed his Senate colleagues. Of 53 fellow Republican senators, zero have endorsed him.Talkers make poor presidents, Barack Obama being a painful example. When Sen. Obama ran for president in 2008, his dazzling speeches  like those of Rubio and Cruz today  got rave reviews. Did glibness translate into greatness as president? No. Obama is not alone. Name the last great president who was a senator. Tough assignment, right?Governors are doers by nature and necessity and make great presidents  or at least capable presidents. Ronald Reagan, a former governor, was a great president. Bill Clinton, a former governor, was certainly a capable president, though Republicans disagreed with his policies.The Republican doers are Kasich, Christie and Bush.What about candidates lacking experience in government? Managing business is not the same as managing government.If government and business were the same, the Founders would have founded America as a business, not a government.With a CEO, it's my way or the highway. But the president of the United States works with a tough co-equal branch of government called the Congress  535 individualists whom the president can't fire, bully or ridicule. With no experience in government, Donald, Carly and Dr. Carson would require training wheels for a couple of years.Our nation and families face great dangers. Has there ever been a more worrisome time in your memory? Bad news cascades upon us daily, much of it the result of poor leadership in the White House. To produce jobs and make our families economically strong again, we need a president who knows how to make government work. And to make our nation, our communities and our homes safe once again, we need a president with expertise in national defense, who has proven executive ability and can hit the ground running on Inauguration Day.By this analysis, we're down to Gov. John Kasich and Gov. Chris Christie, as the only two currently serving governors. Which is better qualified?John Kasich, while chair of the House Budget Committee, balanced the budget four years running, paying down $560 billion of the national debt. You read that right. In your lifetime, the budget was b-a-l-a-n-c-e-d from 1998 through 2001.Scout's honor. Kasich produced four surpluses, paying down 10 percent of the national debt. Christie never served in Congress, much less balanced the federal budget.Kasich turned Ohio's $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus, cutting taxes $5 billion along the way. Ohio has produced new jobs faster than the national average, with wages growing faster than the national average; its bond rating is strong and its pensions sound. That's called success.Under Christie, New Jersey's bond rating has been downgraded nine times collectively by the three rating agencies, the state ranks dead last in the nation in funding its pensions, and it ranks 49th in private-sector job growth. Christier is not a successful governor.Kasich served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee. He's a national security expert. Christie has no experience in defense, except riding around with Barack Obama in a military helicopter. He would require several years of on the job training.To read the full article, click here.Gordon Humphrey is a former U.S. Senator from New Hampshire and served during the Reagan administration."

Issues have become the center of campaigns across the country, as voters everywhere try to find the candidates who they agree with most. While I tend to look at the issues, I also consider the experience necessary to be the next commander in chief of the United States, and John Kasich is the candidate who has that experience.Governor Kasich's resume is unmatched by any candidate in either party. He represented Ohio in the House of Representatives for eighteen years, serving on the Armed Services Committee throughout that time. He also chaired the House Budget Committee in 1997 and was a chief architect of the deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969.Serving as Governor of Ohio since 2010, he has helped turn around a state in a recession, creating well over 300,000 private sector jobs, and closing an eight million dollar budget shortfall without raising taxes. Governor Kasich won re-election in Ohio in 2014 winning 64 percent of the vote. Ohioans have continued to be pleased with him as an October poll showed he has a 62 percent job approval rating. Shouldn't we elect a president who is well liked in his own state?Anyone can discuss the issues, but only one candidate in either party has both the experience in Congress and as an executive needed to be the next president of the United States. Our nation is too important to have a president receiving on the job training. Support a candidate who has proven he can lead and join me in caucusing for Governor Kasich on February 1st."

""I just wanted to give the people that were coming to them some perspective.""The perspective came in the form of flyers that detailed Kasich's record on jobs and the economy in Ohio, and highlighted Christie's shortcomings on both areas in New Jersey.""In my humble opinion, this guy Kasich is the most genuine guy in the field,"" said Turkavage, arguing Kasich is ""the most experienced"" candidate in the GOP race.""And more importantly, the guy has done what he said he would do,"" he said. ""We need to start holding public officials accountable.""Kasich has pulled ahead of Christie in the latest New Hampshire polls, ranking third in the early-voting state behind businessman Donald Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to a Real Clear Politics average. Christie, who made big gains in New Hampshire since trailing the GOP pack over the summer, ranks fifth.

John Kasich,R,p,"January 13, 2016",Press Release - Reno Gazette-Journal: John Kasich Visits Reno,"Gov. John Kasich was in Reno, Nevada this week for a Meet & Greet event and to ask for support of his candidacy for President. Read an excerpt below from a Reno Gazette-Journal story:About 75 people showed up to the Washoe County Republican Headquarters to hear Kasich and ask him questions. The Ohio governor spent most of his speech sharing his story about coming from a low-income family, eventually rising to the rank of congressman.""I decided to get in this thing late,"" he said. ""Most people here have no clue who I am, but I'm now running second in New Hampshire according to three of the last four polls.""He heavily referenced his time in Congress during the late 1990s spent balancing a budget  the last time a surplus happened.Kasich spent the earlier part of Tuesday at a fundraiser at the Eldorado before meeting with Gov. Brian Sandoval.After his short speech at Republican headquarters, Kasich took questions from the crowd about issues like Social Security, balancing the budget and federal land ownership.""I want to tell you as I learn more and more, clearly the West, we have to begin to look at the issue of the federal government owning 86 percent of the land in this state and then not using common sense whenever they carry out the regulations,"" he said.The crowd was combative with Kasich at times, including a debate about Social Security and his stated support of Congress' repeal of Glass-Steagall, but were generally receptive and often applauded.Jerry Murray, 82, of Reno, said he enjoyed hearing the governor, but wasn't sure he could have a good showing in Nevada.""I thought the man put a very good picture of what he's going to do and I like it a lot.

Our nation faces serious issues and we need a serious leader in the White House who doesn't require on-the-job training and who has proven he is not afraid to make tough decisions. During my time in the Ohio House, Governor Kasich has demonstrated time and again that he will never back down from a challenge and is not intimidated by the call to lead.""Kasich said: ""As someone who has worked with the Speaker closely, I have enormous respect for his work ethic and commitment to the people of Ohio. Last year we worked together to pass a budget with record tax cuts and a record investment in education, all while maintaining a budget surplus. That takes teamwork and trust. Cliff is doing a fantastic job as Speaker of the House, and he will be a major asset to our team in Ohio.""As an Ohio Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign, Rosenberger will join U.S. Senator Rob Portman, Lieutenant Mary Taylor, Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, Auditor of State David Yost and Senate President Keith Faber in leading the Kasich campaign's Ohio efforts.Nationally, Governor Kasich continues to build momentum.

Our national debt must be dealt with. ISIS is an evil that must be destroyed; otherwise thousands will continue to be murdered. Adversaries such as Russia will continue to bully America to advance policies that harm us. The federal government is a bureaucratic embarrassment with no accountability. Millions of our citizens feel they have no chance and are trapped in generational poverty.Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out as the most capable candidate to deal with these enormous challenges. He was one of the architects of balancing federal budget in the 1990s, and led Ohio from an $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus. Gov. Kasich is passionate about helping the most vulnerable Americans; his record of welfare reform, tax cuts for low-income Ohioans, and expanding treatment and housing to individuals with mental illness, show he is a man of compassion. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years, Kasich made sure the military was prepared to defend the U.S. Throughout the 1980s, Kasich was a strong ally of President Reagan and his national security agenda, and understands ""Peace through Strength.""I encourage all Iowans to thoroughly research each candidate and not base their vote on Twitter, political pundits or the media. In comparison to the other candidates, Kasich provides the most comprehensive record of fiscal discipline and plan to destroy ISIS.

In the last few months, I've become convinced that Ohio Gov. John Kasic is one of the few presidential candidates who can point to a record of results behind the rhetoric.Several weeks ago, Gov. Kasich and his wife, Karen, launched a new coalition called Women for Kasich, where they highlighted his record of producing real results for women, especially in the area of job creation. Since 2011, Kasich has helped Ohioans create more than 380,000 new private-sector jobs. These jobs represent thousands of new opportunities for women to advance their careers and support their families. Kasich also understands that an absence of childcare options is a major barrier for working mothers, so he expanded childcare access to struggling mothers so that they can better achieve financial independence.Female voters want what everyone wants: The opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their family. The stakes in this election are too high to vote for a candidate without experience and the know-how to deliver results. My vote is with John Kasich.MICHELE HOLTONNew London, New Hampshire"

So what happens if he does nab second  or better  after spending almost the entire campaign season in single digits in the polls?

The point being: Then anything would be possible for him.""Why John Kasich really could beat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz for the Republican nominationBy Douglas PerryThe OregonianOhio Gov. John Kasich has faith. In the Almighty, yes  he's a committed Christian. But also in Republican primary voters.""People will settle down and start looking for someone who is a reformer and who has accomplished things,"" he told Time magazine this week. ""I believe that, at the end, they will want someone who can land the plane.""The long-shot presidential candidate is convinced, of course, that he can land the plane. And that front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would crash that sucker into the side of a mountain.To the surprise of many observers, voters just might be coming around to his point of view. Kasich believes climate change is a very real problem and that law-abiding undocumented workers should be allowed to stay in the country  views that contradict the message that has fueled Trump and Cruz. And yet Kasich is now fighting for second place in the ""first in the nation"" New Hampshire primary, which takes place Feb. 9.So what happens if he does nab second  or better  after spending almost the entire campaign season in single digits in the polls?""It would be all of the sudden the whole media would be talking about John Kasich,"" he said.The point being: Then anything would be possible for him. The 63-year-old governor, the son of a mailman and the grandson of coal miners, believes his secret weapon is that he's not an angry man. The working-class side of the Republican base is very angry and has been pushing its presidential candidates to show them their matching rage  about disappearing jobs, about illegal immigrants, about Muslims, about President Obama, about anything and everything. As a result, a lot of candidates are going for that very vocal angry vote  and there's only so much of it to go around. Trump, Cruz, Chris Christie and now a newly mad Marco Rubio could all end up knocking each other out.Kasich, pundits are beginning to believe, could then step over them into the lead. His approach is a folksy form of straightforward retail politics that he's convinced will serve him well as the primary-election calendar moves south and west: ""Meet people. Tell the truth. Talk to them. Have fun.""Read the full article here.Note: ""His poll numbers here are moving in the right direction. The airwaves, now so cluttered and so noxious, have become so much white noise.

John Kasich Sees An Opening in New HampshireBy Thomas FarragherThe Boston GlobeHILLSBOROUGH, N.H.,  You've seen him there on the edge of the stage, in the far corner of your TV screen as the Republican presidential field take turns talking about building big walls, dropping bombs, and  like crazed fast-food joint workers  asking whether you'd like some guns with that burger. In some of those split-screen reaction shots, as the front-running demagogue Donald Trump blends hate speech with paper-thin policy, I've wondered: What is it exactly that Ohio Governor John Kasich is thinking?""Generally, what I'm thinking is: God, I wish they'd ask me the same question so I could answer it,'' Kasich told me aboard his campaign bus here Tuesday. ""But I'd rather have people see that I'm positive and happy than get this extra time. These debates are not a great way to pick a president, to tell you the truth.''Kasich brought his happy-face tour to Morse Sporting Goods on Tuesday, a place where you can get a fishing license for $45, a Buck knife for $54.99, and a bottle of doe urine that will run you $5.50. You can also find proprietor-emeritus Walt Morse, a former New Hampshire state trooper who for 10 years was the elected Hillsborough County sheriff.""He's a good person and he's got a good plan,'' Morse, 81, told me before he showed Kasich around the place. ""I just want the country to be safe and prosperous.''That's what Kasich wants, too. And, he told a small group of voters here, it's not that difficult to deliver. ""Can you believe I said that?'' he said. ""It's very easy. You know what gets in the way? Politics.''Of course, that's like saying the only problem with flight is gravity.Kasich is embarking on a bit of gravity defying business himself these days. He's in second place in some New Hampshire primary polls. He has virtually moved here full-time until the state votes on Feb. 9.Kasich is a serious guy. He's a former nine-term congressman and House Budget Committee chairman. He left Washington in 2001 and returned to politics in 2010 when he was elected Ohio's governor.He's a staunch abortion opponent, but in a field where there's not a yardstick big enough to measure how far right the far right has drifted, Kasich is a voice of relative moderation.""You can go into the room as the prince of darkness and you can get everybody depressed and down,'' he said. ""Or you can go in as the prince of light and tell people: Yeah, we have problems but they're not that hard because I don't really believe they're that hard. Everything doesn't have to be a trip to get a root canal.''If presidential politics is all about timing, Kasich is hoping that the ground game he's built here will help prove his timing fortuitous. He has dismissed suggestions that he's the 2016 version of Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor who also bet the house on New Hampshire and bowed out four years ago after finishing third.And if he's taking anything for granted, the voters are happy to bring him up short. ""I was really excited, this lady told me: You're in my top six,'""he said.His poll numbers here are moving in the right direction.

John Kasich,R,p,"January 20, 2016",Press Release - New Hampshire AG Tom Rath Says John Kasich Will Make Us Proud as President,"My Turn: Kasich will make us proudBy Tom RathConcord MonitorI write in support of John Kasich in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.Although I have been involved in these contests since 1964, this is the first time I have written a piece like this. I do this now because I believe without reservation that John Kasich offers New Hampshire and the nation an extraordinary candidacy that has the capacity to overcome the petty politics of the day and to provide leadership formed by real experience, a collaborative style, a unique grasp of America's challenges and opportunities. But, to me, most importantly, what stands out is this man's genuineness, his decency, fairness and inclusiveness.John Kasich runs for the presidency not because he needs to complete his political resume. His resume, his credentials outstrip all others in this campaign.His nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives were distinguished by his ability, in a highly polarized body, to build consensus and to use that consensus to produce results that made this country safer, more secure and standing on the strongest economic footing we had seen for years and have not experienced since his departure. He was the chief congressional architect of the last balanced budget this country has seen and he did so with Bill Clinton in the White House. Now in his second term as governor of Ohio (our seventh largest state, with over 11 million citizens), he has led an unprecedented economic revival. When he took office, Ohio's state government was running a $5 billion deficit; today it enjoys a $2 billion surplus. When he took office, Ohio had lost more than 350,000 private-sector jobs; today, during his administration, Ohio has seen more than 385,000 new jobs. Today, Ohio has 210,000 job openings in the private sector. Not surprisingly, Kasich won re-election by a better than 2-1 margin, carrying 86 of Ohio's 88 counties in the race.Both in Congress and as governor, John Kasich has been a unifier, someone who works with people who are from a different party than him, who have different concerns from him, who think differently than he does but who share a common concern to make Ohio a better state and the United States a better country.As a Republican, I have been particularly impressed by Kasich's insistence that improved economic conditions must mean not leaving folks behind. Using a surplus not just for lowering and cutting taxes, Kasich has concentrated on getting more help for folks with mental illnesses, addiction issues and for the so-called working poor, those folks who played by the rules but have not found success. In particular, he has concentrated on expanded vocational education and occupational retraining, much like we are now concentrating on in New Hampshire.For all these political strengths, what stands out for me is this man's character.In many ways, who a president is matters as much as what a president does. A president must be smart and strong and tough and determined. But a president must also know who we are as a people, know our dreams, our hopes, our concerns. John Kasich gets us. He has lived a life grounded in the realties of the lives of everyday Americans. His ability to talk about these things  good and bad  is unique. It comes from not just his political experience but his life experience. John Kasich gets it.It is Kasich's optimism that makes him want those serious complicated discussions, that impels him to want to continue to serve. He sees the chance to better the lot of all the highest calling. In private, when you might think he would be the most tired or worn down, is when this optimism comes through most clearly. His determination is powerful and unrelenting.Read the full article here."

John Kasich,R,p,"January 20, 2016",Press Release - The Associated Press Says John Kasich is Calm & Optimistic in New Hampshire,"Zeroing in on New Hampshire, John Kasich campaigns with optimismBy Kathleen RonayneThe Associated Press HILLSBORO, N.H. (AP)  With three weeks until the primary in New Hampshire, where John Kasich's White House hopes probably will live or die, he's approaching his campaign with a sense of calm.Touring the state Tuesday on his campaign bus, the Ohio governor seemed fortified by a serene outlook at odds with the stakes and the pace of the Republican contest in the state, admitting in the process that this unsettles some of his advisers.""I'm doing the best I can, nobody's working harder than I am, and I'm very much at peace,"" the Ohio governor told The Associated Press.As Kasich fights for a strong finish in the state, he's strayed little from a strategy centered on the idea that voters want a candidate with a record of getting things done. And in a race where Republican voters are gravitating toward political outsiders like Donald Trump, Kasich openly talks about his 18 years as a member of Congress, pointing to his work balancing the federal budget in the 1990s. He shies away from the doom and gloom that some of his rivals project, suggesting the country's problems are easy to fix if only people work together.As the Feb. 9 primary approaches, Kasich is seeing progress in polling, which suggests he is in a contest behind Trump with Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. Kasich is betting that his support will grow as people take a more serious look at their choices in the final weeks before voting.He's not specifying what he'll consider a success on primary night, saying only that he'll calculate how to move forward once the results are in. Kasich says New Hampshire's style of close-up campaigning, where the town hall meeting reigns, offers him a chance to show depth on a variety of subjects. It's altogether easier than Iowa, he says.""It's more compact, and it's 1.2 million (people) and you can stand in Manchester and hit the whole state with a pebble; it's manageable,"" Kasich said. ""It's like running in a community.""His campaign has five offices open in the state and 15 full-time staff members, and he's backed by notable Republicans such as former Sens. Gordon Humphrey and John E. Sununu. Three New Hampshire newspapers recently endorsed him. Voters who see him speak often are impressed by his substantive answers and his positive outlook on bringing change to Washington.""There's so much animosity in Washington these days,"" said Steve Burritt of Henniker, New Hampshire, and ""we need someone to bring this crowd together and get some things done."" Burritt said Kasich ""certainly sounds like someone who could do that.""To read the full story, click here."
John Kasich,R,p,"January 20, 2016",Press Release - Wall Street Journal Says John Kasich's Positive Approach Is Paying Off,"Note: ""Mr. Kasich is second to front-runner Donald Trump in each of five public polls of New Hampshire voters in the past month. An American Research Group survey released Tuesday showed him at 20%, up six percentage points from earlier in the month.""The Wall Street JournalBy Reid J. EpsteinLEBANON, N. H.While the rest of the Republican presidential field is betting on an electorate furious with President Barack Obama and angry with career politicians, John Kasich is making the opposite wager.The Ohio governor is stumping across New Hampshire highlighting his experience in Congress, backing such issues as the Iran nuclear deal and campaign-finance reform that are usually supported by Democrats and painting himself as an uplifting alternative to the doom-and-gloom tone dominating the GOP primary.There is some evidence this approach is working. Mr. Kasich is second to front-runner Donald Trump in each of five public polls of New Hampshire voters in the past month. An American Research Group survey released Tuesday showed him at 20%, up six percentage points from earlier in the month. Mr. Trump leads at 27%, the poll found.""I'm not sugarcoating anything, but I'm not walking in there as the prince of darkness,"" Mr. Kasich said during an interview on his campaign bus. ""I'd rather be the prince of light, the prince of hope.""This weekend he received endorsements from newspapers in Nashua, Portsmouth and Dover. His town-hall events Monday and Tuesday drew standing-room-only crowds. And the super PAC backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently targeted him, stuffing mailboxes with a flier detailing Mr. Kasich's violations of Republican orthodoxy, which include accepting the Obamacare Medicaid expansion for Ohio and voting in Congress for a 1994 ban of certain semiautomatic firearms.A strong showing by Mr. Kasich in the first GOP primary eight days after the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses would increase the odds he would still be around as a favorite-son candidate March 15 in Ohio, a winner-take-all state unlike those before it where delegates are awarded proportionally.Still, Mr. Kasich's campaign is essentially a one-state operation for now. He has written off Iowa and his campaign has a minimal footprint in South Carolina and Nevada, which vote in the weeks following New Hampshire. He has less money than his competitors, whose ads appear far more often on New Hampshire's lone broadcast TV network.The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of GOP primary voters nationwide showed Mr. Kasich with just 3% support and he remains unknown by 18%the largest percentage in the GOP presidential field.And his unorthodox stands don't sit well with plenty of voters. Bill Gamache, a retired salesman, pressed Mr. Kasich on his relatively lenient immigration position at a Concord town hall Tuesday.""We have millions of people here illegally. What is your plan to deport them?"" Mr. Gamache asked. Mr. Kasich dug in. ""I wouldn't, OK? It's not practical and we're not going to do that.""The Kasich message is aimed at independent voters who make up 44% of the New Hampshire electorate rather than bedrock Republicans being pursued by candidates such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Kasich New Hampshire strategist Tom Rath said he needs at least one-third of his primary votes to come from independents to meet his turnout targets. To that end, his goal is to present himself as an alternative to conservative candidates while remaining outside of the squabbling between Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Chris Christie and Mr. Bush.To read the full story, click here."

""If he comes in second in New Hampshire he could be the big comeback story. He might be the establishment guy.""The other three establishment-friendly RepublicansRubio, Bush, and Chris Christieare all competitive for second place in the Granite State but have formed a circular firing squad. Rubio and his super-PAC are simultaneous slinging arrows at Christie (for being too liberal) and Cruz (for being an inconsistent conservative), while fending off a wave of attacks from Bush (for changing his position on ""amnesty"") and Christie (for being too young and unprepared).""If you avoid the circular firing squad, you're the only one left standing,"" Feehery said. ""I think there's a bunch of different gun battles going on, and right now no one's shooting at Kasich because they thought he was already dead.""Staying off attack mode has been a conscious decision, Kasich's top strategist said.""When the other candidates are offering criticisms and darkness and gloomno optimism about the future, no real solutions to the problems that real people care abouthe's doing the exact opposite, and he's connecting with voters,"" John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist, told Bloomberg Politics.

John Kasich,R,p,"January 21, 2016",Press Release - Boston Globe: Kasich is Finally Getting His Moment,"Kasich is finally getting his momentBy Scot LehighBoston GlobeI've long thought that John Kasich was a New Hampshire kind of guy  and now the Granite State seems to be deciding the same.Since the turn of the year, Kasich has generated real traction here with his folksy, optimistic, mild-mannered approach. And you can see it now in the interest voters are showing in a candidate whose brand of politics is unlike anything his Republican rivals are offering.The tonal difference that separates Kasich from his more rancorous, to-the-ramparts Republican rivals was on display in the dueling speeches he and Marco Rubio gave to the New Hampshire House of Representatives on Wednesday morning.Kasich was upbeat, low-key, and funny, telling stories about his own days as a legislator, such as one about a senior Republican who was annoyed when he failed to offer a second for an amendment he didn't understand.""Young man, you'd better learn to fly by the seat of your pants,'' the man said. ""And I've been doing that ever since,"" Kasich joked.He also stressed the accomplishments that can come when elected officials think of themselves as Americans first and Republicans and Democrats second.Speaking in a language legislators appreciate, he talked of the way he would push power and funding away from Washington and back to the states.States shouldn't have to ask for federal permission to let welfare recipients count training programs as part of their work requirement, he said. Federal education money shouldn't come with so many encumbrances, he asserted, but rather be consolidated into four basic buckets.The way it works now, he noted, federal gas tax revenues flow to Congress, where it is doled back to the states according to schemes settled on by Congress's transportation committees. As he sees it, the states should retain most of those funds, sending the federal government only the amount needed to maintain the interstate highway system.Who, really, would be against that, he said, before adding, drolly, ""the committee and the lobbyists.""Read the rest of the story here."

That candidate is John Kasich. Kasich is the only one who knows the importance of the job of President and the responsibility that comes with it. He has decades of experience as a reformer who gets results. He realizes that toughness, character and conviction, as well as cooperation, is necessary to impart change. While other candidates seem interested only in controversy and inflammatory statements which will drive the wedge between parties deeper than ever; making gridlock even worse and making progress impossible, Kasich has proven that he can reach across the aisle to actually pass conservative legislation. And he does this without compromising his core beliefs.Kasich has won election and reelection to become and remain the Governor of Ohio, a notorious swing state. In 2014, he beat the Democrat opponent by over 30 points. If anyone can beat the Democratic nominee and unite this country in the pursuit of national safety, financial stability, and American values, it is John Kasich. On matters of values, Kasich recognizes the importance of family and education in this country and has never been afraid to stand by his beliefs.Read the full column here."

In Congress he led the effort to balance the federal budget and succeeded where everyone else had failed for decades. With 18 years on the Armed Services Committee he understands what it will take to defeat ISIS. And he has campaigned the traditional John McCain way we expect with over 50 town halls, and counting, answering unscripted questions.A President is under daily scrutiny by the press and public, so what kind of role model he or she presents affects us all  as well as our children and grandchildren. Whether it is the style and polish of a JFK or the gravitas, charm and resolve of a Ronald Reagan it will set a tone for us in the world and for our impressionable young people.[F]or someone who can carry us forward with a clear vision for growing the economy and conducting world affairs, we recommend Ohio Governor John Kasich.In Ohio, Governor Kasich inherited an $8 billion budget shortfall and just 89 cents in the state's rainy day fund! By putting conservative principles into practice he balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes by $3 billion, improved education, reduced state government employment and created over 350,000 private sector jobs. In his reelection he carried 86 of Ohio's 88 counties in this must win state for the electoral college if Republicans want to return to the Presidency.I had the honor of serving in Congress with John and can personally attest that he is a man of ideas, integrity, and enthusiasm. If he says he'll do something he keeps his word, which is very, very rare in the Potomac swamp. I am pleased to join former U.S. Senators Gordon Humphrey and John E. Sununu in supporting John Kasich. With so many choices, voters need to choose Governor Kasich, a candidate they can be proud of and who can unite the party to defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.

John Kasich,R,p,"January 22, 2016",Press Release - The Washington Post Highlights John Kasich's Dominant Ground Game in New Hampshire,"By Ed O'KeefeThe Washington PostBOW, N.H.  It was a very good week for John Kasich in New Hampshire.Largely forgotten in the nationwide presidential race, the Ohio governor almost got kicked off the main stage at the most recent GOP debate. But a series of recent polls now rank Kasich second or third behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump in the Granite State, a feat he achieved after months of quiet methodical campaigning here.The sudden uptick drew the attention of a multimillion dollar super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, which unloaded a new attack ad on Thursday that faults Kasich for expanding Medicare in Ohio and for voting as a congressman to cut military spending that forced the closure of a New Hampshire military base.In response, a super PAC backing Kasich produced an ad that literally slings mud on to a likeness of Bush and calls the former Florida governor unpresidential. The Kasich campaign also released a web video Friday mocking Bush's record as Florida governor, claiming he raised fees on doctors' visits for poor children, increased college tuition and hiked the cost of owning a pet snake.Amid the sniping, though, Kasich has mostly been striving to keep it clean and nonpartisan in a state that demands intimate retail campaigning  and where voters like to hear lines like the ones he delivered this week.""I happen to be a Republican, but so what?"" he said during an appearance at a logistics company here in Bow. ""The Republican Party is my vehicle, not my master.""Earlier, at a town hall in Concord, N.H., he told a crowd of about 80 people, ""We don't get energy by being negative. I am so tired of my colleagues out here on the stage spending all their time talking about Barack Obama. His term is over!""That message stands in stark contrast with his GOP establishment-friendly rivals  Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)  all of whom are statistically tied with Kasich in recent surveys here but deliver a more partisan message overall on the trail. Taking note of that contrast, four New Hampshire newspapers bucked the better-known candidates and endorsed Kasich this week.Read the full article here."
John Kasich,R,p,"January 23, 2016","Press Release - The New York Times: With Calm and Experience, John Kasich Connects in New Hampshire","By Thomas Kaplan The New York TimesWOLFEBORO, N.H.  At a Rotary Club meeting in Laconia, N.H., on Thursday, a woman confided that she feared whether the United States would be safe for her children and grandchildren, citing dangers like the Islamic State.""First of all, we have to stay very calm about this,"" Gov. John Kasich of Ohio replied, before laying out his plans in measured terms and wrapping up, ""Now, do I sound panicked? I'm not.""In a Republican primary filled with bleak assessments of the country's problems and dire predictions about its future, Mr. Kasich has largely been overshadowed by more fiery competitors. But the conspicuously nonangry candidate is now enjoying a wave of attention in New Hampshire, with some polls showing him gaining strength here, several newspapers in the state endorsing him and, in a sure sign that he is no longer an idle threat, a new attack ad directed at him.By talking of balancing budgets and working with Democrats, Mr. Kasich is appealing to New Hampshire's large proportion of independent voters, who can participate in either party's primary, and the state's centrist tradition of embracing moderate candidates. Mr. Kasich, who was a congressman and the chairman of the House Budget Committee before he was governor, leans hard on his fiscal experience, displaying a national debt clock at town hall-style meetings.But what seems to be stirring support is his strikingly different tone; he even described himself as ""the prince of light and hope.""""He's not an alarmist,"" said Sharon Norby, a retired teacher who came to a campaign event Mr. Kasich hosted on Thursday night in the lakeside town of Wolfeboro. An independent, she left the meeting having decided to vote for Mr. Kasich.""Yeah, there are big problems,"" she said. ""But he's not saying, And therefore we have to carpet bomb these people.' No. You have to be calm. I like that.""Some of the other candidates, she added, were ""making people more nervous than they need to be.""Mr. Kasich's presidential ambitions depend on New Hampshire because he remains far behind the front-runners in national polls, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. There are also questions about the reliability of some polls in New Hampshire that have Mr. Kasich as high as second.He is hoping that a strong showing in the Feb. 9 primary here would give him the kind of national attention that has so far been elusive. Asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable impression of Mr. Kasich in a Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday, half of Republican voters nationally had no opinion.When a woman at one of his events on Thursday described the primary season as ""particularly entertaining,"" Mr. Kasich, who has sometimes seemed to be a spectator in his own race, playfully responded, ""I may have a little different view.""Mr. Kasich has largely avoided being bloodied in recent weeks by attacks from other candidates, unlike some of his rivals for the so-called establishment vote, such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.But in a sign of the competition to attract these voters, Mr. Kasich is now being targeted with a negative television ad from a ""super PAC"" supporting former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, which shows him with President Obama and asserts that he is ""wrong on New Hampshire issues."" (A super PAC supporting Mr. Kasich has its own ad going after Mr. Bush, accusing him of ""desperately slinging mud on fellow Republicans."")Compared with some of his rivals, Mr. Kasich has a markedly different view of how voters are feeling  and what they are looking for, and not looking for, in the country's next president.""If you turn on the television or if you read, people say that the voters are all angry,"" he said at the Rotary Club meeting, addressing a small crowd gathered inside a 19th-century textile mill. ""I must be going to the wrong meetings because I don't really pick that up.""Instead, Mr. Kasich said, ""I find that people want to have answers and they want to be hopeful."" People, he added, ""don't want to be angry about things.""""We never enjoy our lives when we're mad about things all the time,"" he said.Read the full article here."

But he's got his hand on everybody in this room if you let him."" Then he wondered, ""What do you think? Am I out of my mind here telling you this stuff?""His style is folksy and meandering, bordering at times on goofy.

His state's economy is on the march. He has built a big budget surplus, with a rock-solid credit rating that is stable. He has stuck with his core convictions in this race, even when he's going against the grain, as with his endorsement of bipartisan immigration reform and Common Core education standards.Christie's flip on Common Core was an obvious sop to the GOP base that reflects a character flaw: Excess ambition.As a bonus, he served for 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee, and never threatens to shoot down Russian warplanes.To read the full article, click here."

John Kasich is also the only candidate with a realistic plan to balance the federal budget. Skeptical? In Congress he led the effort to balance the budget for the first time in a generation as chair of the Budget Committee in 1997.As a U.S. congressman he spent 18 years on the Armed Services Committee, where he was a strong proponent of President Ronald Reagan's security agenda. Today we face a myriad of threats to our security, and we need a leader with the resolve and experience to stand up to our enemies. Gov. Kasich has a detailed plan for strengthening our military, renewing our alliances and standing up to bullies like China and Russia.Finally, Gov. Kasich is the most electable candidate in the presidential race. Time and again, Hillary Clinton's advisors have publicly admitted that John Kasich is the candidate they are most afraid of facing in a general election.

John Kasich,R,p,"January 26, 2016",Press Release - Endorsement: The Concord Monitor Supports John Kasich for President,"The Concord MonitorFor months, each Republican candidate for president has told New Hampshire voters why he or she belongs in the White House. The one with the best record to support his case is John Kasich.The Ohio governor began his career in public service in 1978, when he became a state senator at age 26. Four years later, he was elected to the first of his nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chairman of the Budget Committee. In 2010, he was elected governor of Ohio and was re-elected four years later in a landslide.The economic turnaround Ohio has experienced since Kasich took the reins should appeal to fiscal conservatives. The multi-billion-dollar budget hole he inherited is now a $2 billion surplus; his administration oversaw $5 billion in tax cuts; and his record on helping to create and retain jobs in Ohio  including 385,000 new private-sector jobs since 2011  is impressive. He has also consistently shown his dedication to helping his state's most vulnerable citizens through actions such as expanding Medicaid.Kasich's plan for his first 100 days in the White House is ambitious and should resonate with Republican voters who embrace conservative economic principles.He vows to put the nation on a path to a balanced budget and slash the size of the federal government by transferring resources back to the states ""with fewer strings attached."" He promises to cut individual and business taxes, reform the tax code and launch a thorough review of the Internal Revenue Service.On national security, Kasich is more alliance-builder than hawk. He believes that wiping out ISIS will require a NATO and regional coalition of ground troops, no-fly zones and support for the Kurdish military. He also believes, however, that the United States must reassert itself as a world power by standing up to the ""expansionist agendas"" of China and Russia.Throughout his political career, Kasich has committed himself to many of the values that Republicans hold dear. But what really separates him from his New Hampshire primary opponents, other than his solid record as governor of Ohio, is his desire and ability to find common ground with politicians and voters of all stripes.Read the entire endorsement here.The Monitor's endorsement follows yesterday's Boston Globe endorsement and comes only a week after four other New Hampshire newspapers' endorsements, including the Nashua Telegraph, Valley News, Portsmouth Herald, Foster's Daily Democrat and Bow Times."

That candidate is Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Among Republicans hoping to champion the party's chances in November, Kasich's resume is unusually impressive. During his nine terms in Congress representing Ohio, he was a key figure in constructing federal budgets and reducing the national deficit, chairing the House Budget Committee for six years. He also demonstrated considerable knowledge in the areas of defense and foreign policy as an 18-year member of the House Armed Services Committee. After leaving Washington, he eventually returned to Ohio, where he's in his second term as governor of a large and politically diverse state. There, he turned a projected $6 billion state budget deficit into a $2 billion Rainy Day fund.In both roles, Kasich has distinguished himself as a pragmatist, willing to make tough choices even when they go against conventional party wisdom. In Washington, his effort to balance the budget included strong advocacy for reassessing the nation's military bases, closing some and realigning others, and fought to end the expensive B-2 bomber program. While in Congress, he voted for an assault weapons ban and favored background checks at gun shows.In Ohio, he stood out as a Republican governor willing to implement the expansion of Medicaid services through the Affordable Care Act. Criticized by his former tea party supporters for the move, Kasich said two things that are indicative of his leadership style. He noted the program would be paid for mainly by the federal government, including with money Ohioans had sent to Washington and deserved to see return to the state. More to the point, he noted it was simply the right thing to do to help those most in need in his state. While opposing the ACA, he acknowledges that any reworking or replacing of that law needs to include continuing to care for those Americans who have gained coverage through the program.Read the entire endorsement here.The Sentinel's endorsement follows closely after five other New Hampshire newspapers' endorsements, including the Concord Monitor, Nashua Telegraph,Valley News, Portsmouth Herald, Foster's Daily Democrat and Bow Times."

Indeed, his tone has become an important part of his message: America needs an experienced, positive, optimistic, collegial problem-solver.""By Scot LehighLOUDON, N.H.: In a normal political year, John Kasich would be on a remarkable roll.He has won the editorial-endorsement primary by a knockout. The newspapers recommending him include the Portsmouth Herald and Foster's Daily Democrat (a joint nod), the Concord Monitor, The Telegraph of Nashua, The Keene Sentinel, and the Valley News, in Lebanon. The Boston Globe and The New York Times have also nodded his way.Those endorsements are all based on the same basic notion: Kasich, the former congressman from, and now governor of, Ohio, is an experienced leader with a record of accomplishment that reflects his penchant for working across the partisan aisle. Meanwhile, his team of New Hampshire backers, which incudes former US senators John Sununu and Gordon Humphrey, former US House member Chuck Douglas, and former attorney general Tom Rath, is more impressive than anything anyone else has assembled.Here, however, is the question: In this year of antiestablishment acrimony, do those traditional political cues matter? After all, in Iowa, Ted Cruz, bte noire to the establishment, carried the day, followed by Donald Trump, whom Republican regulars see as almost anathematic. The only establishment-acceptable candidate to post a respectable Iowa showing was third-place winner Marco Rubio.The Kasich camp thinks they do. Certainly they certify the central notion of his candidacy. And for the last week or so, while the other candidates were trying to corral Iowa caucus-goers, he's had the Granite State stage virtually to himself.On Monday, yet another New Hampshire poll put him in second place behind Trump, and with some separation from the rest of the field.His crowds are getting steadily better, his media contingent bigger. And yet, at around 200 for a midmorning town meeting in Greenland, and 90 or so at similar evening event in Loudon, they're more indicative of a mild current flowing his way than a wave about to break.In a campaign when most of the Republican hopefuls are as grim as a team of overworked morticians, Kasich remains positive and upbeat. Indeed, his tone has become an important part of his message: America needs an experienced, positive, optimistic, collegial problem-solver.Read the full story here."

John Kasich is best suited, by temperament, knowledge and experience, to carry the Republican standard. There's a reason seven of the eight New Hampshire newspapers endorsed him. He answers questions with facts and past accomplishments, not bluster. He can get things done.""The Concord MonitorTuesday's vote will mark the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire presidential primary, which did not achieve its first-in-the-nation status until 1952. The election goes a long way toward deciding who the next president of the world's most powerful nation will be. But this time, also at stake are the future of the fragmented Republican Party and, perhaps, the fate of the primary itself. Your participation is crucial.So far, this election has been like no other, a test of whether, with anger loosed upon the nation, the center can hold. Or will the state, with its vote, send forth candidates from each extreme  candidates who probably could not win if nominated or may not be able to govern if elected.Iowa is even less like the sum of America than New Hampshire, and its odd and only somewhat democratic caucus process is a poor measure of prospective presidents.On Monday, its Republican voters chose Sen. Ted Cruz, the most hated man in Congress, as its nominee. Not one of Cruz's Senate colleagues support him. He is a mean-spirited conservative zealot who has earned the enmity of fellow Republicans like Sen. John McCain, twice the winner of New Hampshire's primary. Cruz is uncompromising and so intractable that, against the wishes of his party, he caused the government to shut down for 16 days in order to make a personal statement about his loathing for the Affordable Care Act. His argument on the Senate floor famously mocked that chamber by including a reading of Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.Democrats chose former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, but only narrowly over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who would represent the left wing of his party were he really a Democrat.The self-described democratic socialist has spent most of his Senate career as an independent whose proposals for radical change earned more smiles than votes. As we said in an earlier editorial, we largely agree with Sanders's pursuit of greater economic equality and universal health care, but he would fare no better in achieving them as president than he has as a senator.It's time for New Hampshire voters to put the path to the presidency back on course.Ohio Gov.

John Kasich,R,p,"February 4, 2016","Press Release - Associated Press: ""Kasich Keeps it Positive in Final Days Before New Hampshire""","Associated PressBY KATHLEEN RONAYNEDURHAM, N.H. (AP)  John Kasich is betting big on positivity.Unlike Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, who are turning their fire on Marco Rubio with a renewed sense of urgency, Kasich is refusing to go negative against his rivals, even bragging about how he asked the super PAC backing him not to run an ad hitting the Florida senator. Instead, a calm Kasich is pinning his White House hopes on the idea that voters want a candidate who says what he or she is for, not what others are against.""You know why I'm happy and relaxed and having a ball?"" Kasich told voters Tuesday morning in Newbury. ""Because it's good to spread good.""A strong performance in New Hampshire's primary next Tuesday is critical for Kasich, who all but skipped Iowa's caucuses to continue grinding out town halls in New Hampshire.Christie, meanwhile, calls Rubio a ""boy in the bubble"" and even after Rubio's third-place finish in Iowa insists that the contest in New Hampshire is now a race between the two. Bush says Rubio and Ted Cruz, the winner in Iowa, are ""backbenchers"" in the U.S. Senate and repeatedly ridicules Donald Trump, Iowa's No. 2, as a ""blowhard.""On the whole, the campaign grew nastier Wednesday, with Trump and Cruz trading increasingly sharp barbs. Trump alleged that Cruz ""stole"" the Iowa caucuses, and Cruz claimed that Trump is ""losing it."" Christie pledged to ""beat (Hillary Clinton's) rear end"" if he has the chance to debate her.But Kasich doesn't bite when given repeated chances by reporters and even some voters to draw contrasts with his rivals.""I'm not here to attack other candidates today,"" Kasich told reportersWednesday at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast. ""I'm sorry, I'm just not doing it.""Asked specifically whether Rubio and other Republicans need to explain more about what they would do as president, Kasich responded, ""Pass.""Kasich instead focuses on his time as governor of Ohio and as a member of the U.S. House, telling voters to look at what candidates have done rather than what they say they'll do.His work to balance the federal budget in the 1990s and economic track record in Ohio sit at the center of his pitch, and he says voters can expect a whirlwind first 100 days of a Kasich presidency, during which he'll pursue regulatory, immigration and Social Security reform, among other things. But, he also tells them, he believes conservatism is about making sure society's most vulnerable members aren't left behind.""(Politics) has to be about something real,"" he said in Portsmouth. ""It has to be about lifting people. If it's not that, get out, go do something else.""The message seems to be resonating with voters who come out to see him.""You hear all the negativity and people vilifying one another, even in their own party, and Gov. Kasich's been above the fray,"" said Dave Luchsinger, an independent voter from Greenland, New Hampshire.Kasich occasionally weaves in subtle digs at his rivals' positions, but he never draws an overt contrast by using their names. Recently, he's taken to telling crowds that abolishing the IRS, a centerpiece of Cruz's campaign, is ""never gonna happen,"" and he warns voters against electing someone who isn't ""ready to roll"" on Day One. To win his home state of Ohio, a critical general election battleground, Kasich says the GOP can't nominate someone without experience or someone who is a ""divider.""The only time Kasich mentions other candidates is when he calls on them to join his positive-vibes-only approach. He says Bush and Christie should tell the super PACs backing them to take down negative television ads, several of which slam Kasich.Campaigns usually tiptoe around mentions of the outside groups backing them, which they are barred from coordinating with, but Kasich proudly tells voters that the group backing him decided not to air an anti-Rubio spot after his campaign spoke out against it.Kasich hasn't always approached politics with such a sunny disposition. In the early days of his governorship, he called a police officer who pulled him over an ""idiot."" The statement came back to hurt him in a November 2011 faceoff against public employee unions over attempted collective bargaining restrictions.Kasich later called losing that union fight a wake-up call, and political observers saw his politics soften after the defeat. He recounts a story of his wife, Karen, telling him he's the dad of Ohio and should act like it.In New Hampshire, the friendlier tone is what he plans to project right up until the end.""Look, we've got only five days to go,"" Kasich told reporters. ""I'm not changing anything. No Hail Mary passes. No manic behavior. I'm just going to finish it."""

John Kasich, who had 16 years in the Congress, including on the Armed Forces Committee, and worked with President Reagan on balancing the budget. He was such a successful governor that he was easily re-elected in a swing state.We do not need another president who will learn on the job. The future of our country needs to be in the hands of an experienced person such as John Kasich. Why my friends cannot see that baffles me.SEN. RAYMOND E. CLEARY IIIMURRELLS INLET"
John Kasich,R,p,"February 5, 2016",Press Release - Montel Williams Supports John Kasich for President,"Today retired Naval Intelligence Officer and Emmy-award winning TV personality Montel Williams endorsed Governor John Kasich for president. Said Williams, ""Now more than ever, Americans need a leader with the vision and experience to unite the country and lead with a steady hand. In a sea of negativity and bluster, John Kasich is a much-needed dose of sanity. There's simply no other GOP candidate in the race with the wide appeal to bring people together.As a veteran, it's clear to me that he is the most well-suited candidate to serve as Commander-in-Chief.""Montel Williams earned worldwide recognition as the host of the long-running Montel Williams Show and as a prominent advocate for the military and veterans who led an aggressive campaign to institute drastic reform at the VA. A graduate of the Naval Academy, Williams served in both the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy for 22 years before being honorably discharged.Said Kasich, ""People know Montel Williams as a gifted entertainer, but not as many know that he spent several decades serving his country in the armed forces, or that he is a tireless advocate for veterans and people with debilitating illness. We may not agree on every issue, but we share a common vision for a stronger, more unified America. I am truly grateful for his support."""
John Kasich,R,p,"February 5, 2016",Press Release - USA TodayMontel Williams Op-Ed: Kasich Has Been a Voice of Sanity,"Note: ""He's the one nominee who can beat Hillary Clinton.""By Montel WilliamsIn a campaign season of bigotry and puffery, John Kasich has been a voice of sanity.I left the Republican Party in the early 1990s to become an independent. But I'm now excited about the GOP for the first time since then  and it's because Ohio Gov. John Kasich is running for president.If there's one thing 22 years in the military taught me, it's that we need an adult in the White House. Someone who'll stand up to our enemies abroad. Someone who is responsible enough to command the world's most powerful military. Someone who'll rise above the din of toxicity infecting our national dialogue and unite our bitterly divided public. Someone who can work with both parties while remaining true to his core beliefs. That adult is Kasich.The party is in trouble. Without reaching out to a wider and more diverse pool of voters, the GOP will likely lose in November. That's not speculation. It's a fact  one that played out in the 2012 election, and one the GOP acknowledged afterward in a report on how to fix the problem.So much for that. Instead of a new message of unity and inclusion, we've gotten division and antagonism. We've gotten Donald Trump's bigoted rhetoric against Latinos and patriotic Muslim Americans. We've had little focus on issues important to African Americans, like lifting communities out of poverty, or criminal justice reform, which everyone from the Koch brothers to Bernie Sanders agrees must be addressed. This Republican primary campaign, in my view, has been an embarrassment. It's led me to wonder if America's best days are behind it. It's time for the GOP base to have a reckoning with reality. Bigotry in the form of scapegoating and puffery are not a platform.Fortunately, Kasich has been a voice of sanity. He's focused on his record in Congress and as governor, and it's an impressive one. Back in the 1990's, Kasich and his Republican colleagues in the House made smart policy compromises with President Clinton. Compromise. I know that word is anathema to Ted Cruz, but it led to prosperity, massive surpluses and a balanced budget. Last time I checked, those are in line with conservative principles.Read the rest of the op-ed here. Montel Williams is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who served in the Marine Corps and the Navy. He hosted the Emmy Award winning Montel Williams Show from 1991 to 2008."

Instead, voters should choose Ohio Gov. John Kasich and his actual record of improving federal and state governments.""The StateColumbia, SCThis election cycle has certainly proven that millions of Americans are frustrated with their federal government.That's understandable, given the gridlock and hyper-partisanship that blanket nearly every issue connected to Washington. The good news is that South Carolinians this week have a special opportunity to help fix the problem.In Saturday's Republican presidential primary, voters committed to changing how their federal government functions should ignore the blather of candidates without real credentials to lead the country. Instead, voters should choose Ohio Gov. John Kasich and his actual record of improving federal and state governments.Mr. Kasich is a pragmatic leader with experience as a congressman and governor. He was mostly successful in both jobs, playing a key role in balancing the federal budget and in turning Ohio's state budget to a surplus from a deficit.He understands the fundamental lesson we all learned as children and that we teach our children now: Accomplishments only come from working with others.Mr. Kasich, 63, is in his second term as Ohio governor. Under his leadership, the state budget's projected $8 billion deficit was transformed into a $2 billion surplus. The unemployment rate has fallen to less than 5 percent (4.6 in December) from more than 9 percent. Taxes have been cut, and new industry has moved into the state.That record alone is impressive. But Gov. Kasich stands out even more because of his leadership approach.In a meeting with The State's editorial board, he said the country's welfare is more important than adhering to Republican Party ideology. ""The party is my vehicle,"" he said, ""not my master.""That view is important because the public has too often been hurt by partisanship that paralyzes government, wastes time or blocks meaningful improvements.A president's leadership skills can't begin and end with insults, bullying and firing people. His or her skills must include diplomacy, toughness, listening and convincing.On Saturday, South Carolinians can vote for candidates who are angry and scream for change. Or voters can choose John Kasich, a candidate whose leadership approach has delivered results.To read the full article, click here."

John Kasich,R,p,"February 18, 2016",Press Release - Manchester Journal Op-Ed Urges Voters to Consider John Kasich,"The Manchester JournalBy Hayden DubloisOhio Republican Governor John Kasich has demonstrated that he is someone who could unite us. Throughout this Presidential election cycle, we've all watched candidates on both sides of the aisle air millions worth of negative ads, make hateful statements about large portions of the population, or take political positions that are so far outside the bounds of what is pragmatic and prudent. The presidential debates have become a poor excuse for political discourse. In quite the contrast, Governor Kasich has consistently aired positive ads, stressed his ability to work across the aisle, and preached a hopeful message of lifting up the most vulnerable Americans who have fallen in the shadows.In New Hampshire, he had Republicans, Independents, and Democrats alike lead him to a second place victory because they recognized this inspirational message. They saw a uniter, someone who has a respect for all individuals, wherever they fall on the political spectrum.Kasich doesn't pander to the political extremes on the left, or the right. Instead, he is both a pragmatist and an optimist. He seeks out the inherent good in people. As President, John Kasich would be focused on getting things done through working together rather than dividing us through promoting policies that are the furthest to the right or the left. His record speaks to that, both as Governor of a swing state, and as a Republican leader who worked with a Democratic President in the 1990s.Many Democrats and Independents in Vermont may feel skeptical about asking for a Republican ballot when its time to vote. But when you have the opportunity to vote for someone who cares more about working together and unifying our country than spewing divisive rhetoric, it's well worth it. That's why on Tuesday March 1, I hope you'll join me by voting for Governor John Kasich in the Vermont presidential primary.To read the full article, click here."

Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign Saturday night. Kasich rises above Bush and the entire field in presidential demeanor. Only he and Dr. Ben Carson have consistently rejected the schoolyard behavior that has turned the Republican race into an embarrassment.As Ohio's governor and previously as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Kasich has achieved what his opponents only talk about  successful reduction or elimination of budget deficits. And he has done it with buy-in from both parties. Bill Clinton is remembered as the last president to balance a budget. That's credit usurped from Kasich.To read the full article, click here.Note: Last week, both USA Today/Suffolk and Quinnipiac released polls showing John Kasich as the Republican in the best position to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election.Other Texas Paper Endorsements: The Dallas Morning News: We recommend John Kasich for GOP presidential nomination (February 12, 2016).

For the sake of this nation and future generations, we recommend Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich as the GOP nominee for president.Listening to Kasich's remarks at a town-hall meeting in Columbia, South Carolina, last week, Wacoans must have been astonished at how neatly Kasich's priorities matched local challenges, including fighting human trafficking (subject of an engrossing public forum at Antioch Community Church a week ago) and sexual assault on college campuses (something Baylor University leadership has experienced significant problems in addressing).In a campaign season characterized by red-hot rhetoric from candidates with highly questionable records of governance, Kasich draws upon many years of policy experience to offer some nuanced approaches on everything from immigration reform to assembling a grand alliance to battle Islamic terrorism. He has not fallen into the trap Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney did in 2012 of embracing far-right stances in the primary elections that made him impossible to the general electorate in November  a very real danger for the Republican Party in fall 2016.Many Texans will rally around Texas Sen.

And no states are more important to making that happen than Florida and Ohio. Just ask Marco Rubio.""By the time you get to March 15, now you're in some big states like Ohio and Florida that award all their delegates at once. That's where you have to start winning states..."" Marco Rubio, Feb. 24, PoliticoBut for Senator Rubio there's a big problem. Polls in Florida show that, at the very best, Rubio is losing to Trump by double digits. The two most recent polls average Trump at 34 percent and Rubio 15 points back. Even if the senator gains every single Bush supporter, Rubio still loses Florida to Trump by double digits.There's a much different story going on in Ohio where John Kasich is in a very good position to defeat Trump. In fact, a poll just released today asked if the race was consolidated down to Trump versus Kasich, Kasich would win Ohio by 17 points. At the same time, Sens. Rubio and Cruz lose to Trump in one-on-one races. Even when all candidates are considered, Kasich is in a statistical tie with Trump  again, a far better position than Rubio can claim in Florida.Again, even Marco Rubio agrees this race comes down to Florida and Ohio, but only John Kasich is in a position to win.

A Quinnipiac University poll out Tuesdaymorning shows Trump at 31 percent in the state with Kasich close behind at 26 percent. It's not clear whether Kasich can beat Trump in the Buckeye State or if he will be able to stay in the race all the way until March 15 when Ohio voters go to the polls. But, if Kasich could beat Trump in Ohio, you subtract 66 delegates from Trump's 1,246  leaving him at 1,180, and just short of the nomination."""

John Kasich,R,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - Former U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette Endorses John Kasich for President,"Today former U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette (R-OH) released the following statement in support of Gov. John Kasich:""I have always believed that our Party and Country should be governed by someone who has actually governed something. The Presidency isn't a place for on the job training. My friend John Kasich is the only person in the race for the nomination of our Party with the requisite experience to be President. He is the only candidate who understands what it is like to actually govern  not just talk about it. Mr. Trump is a successful businessman  but running a company simply isn't the same thing as being the leader of the free world. Senators Rubio and Cruz are fine first-term Senators  but we have seen how unprepared a one-term Senator is for the job of President during the last seven years.I served with John Kasich in the House and watched as he became the architect of the first balanced federal budget since World War II. Not only was the budget balanced, the country was actually able to pay down some of the national debt  rather than simply passing it on to future generations. He accomplished that goal, which was and is a priority for Republicans, while a Democrat  Bill Clinton  was in the White House. He did it by recognizing that negotiation is not surrender. He showed that you can compromise without compromising core values. I have also watched his six years as Governor of my home state of Ohio and seen the job creation and economic recovery that have taken place on his watch. Just like he did when he balanced the budget, Governor Kasich has put the best interest of the citizens he serves above petty partisanship. That's the kind of leader John Kasich is and that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the White House.It is for those reasons that I am proud to announce that John Kasich has my full endorsement for President of the United States. I proudly look forward to his nomination in my hometown of Cleveland this summer."""
John Kasich,R,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - Quinnipiac FL Poll Make Clear Kasich GOP's Only Hope,"It's now clear. John Kasich is the only Republican who can stop Donald Trump.""  Trent Duffy, national spokesman Kasich for America.A new Quinnipiac University poll published this morning shows Senator Marco Rubio losing to Donald Trump by a whopping 16 points in Florida, previewing a certain death knell for his campaign.Senator Rubio's stunning weakness in Florida makes it clear that John Kasich is the only Republican who can stop Donald Trump and win the White House in November.An independent analysis published yesterday by The Washington Post shows that John Kasich defeating Trump in Ohio is likely the only way to stop him. Recent polls show Governor Kasich in a statistical tie with Donald Trump in Ohio and defeating him by a wide-margin in a head-to-head matchup in Ohio.Just yesterday, Senator Rubio said, ""[b]y the time you get to March 15, now you're in some big states like Ohio and Florida that award all their delegates at once.

John Kasich,R,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - RealClearPolitics Analysis & Rubio Poll Both Elevate Kasich,"From RealClearPolitics:Imagine we wake up on Wednesday morning, March 16, to find that Sen. Rubio has lost Florida to Trump, while Gov. Kasich has beaten Trump in Ohio. If that happens, how do Rubio's supporters, which include much of the existing GOP officialdom, make the case that Kasich should defer to Rubio? Why wouldn't the logical argument be the other way around?Kasich bolsters his argument by pointing to the fact that he runs far better against Hillary Clinton in general election match-ups than either Cruz or Rubio. So why wouldn't establishment Republicans rally behind the most ""electable"" candidate who carries his home state in the primary?As we all saw this morning, this is very easy to imagine. In a Quinnipiac Poll released earlier today, Senator Rubio loses his home state of Florida by 17 points to Donald Trump. Rubio himself has stated he must win Florida or Ohio to put him on the path to winning the nomination. But it's John Kasich who is in position to carry Ohio on March 15th and making the RCP scenario a reality. If Rubio does what he should and drops out, Kasich easily defeats Trump in Ohio and is in the driver's seat for securing the nomination and winning back the White House."

John Kasich,R,p,"February 26, 2016",Press Release - Did the Establishment Make a Mistake in Anointing Marco Rubio?,"NOTE: If Mr. Kasich wins the state he governs, and Mr. Rubio loses the state he represents in Congress, GOP power brokers will have gambled and lost with the 44-year-old freshman senator.""We are gonna win Ohio,"" John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's top strategist, told the Observer. ""Here's the thing: the Rubio campaign, and really his whole political career, is like a movie set. There's nothing real there.""By Ross BarkanObserverNew YorkIf Republicans expect to stop Donald Trump from barreling his way to the nomination and upending the GOP as they know it, they will need to keep the billionaire real estate developer from winning Ohio and Florida on March 15.Both states promise significant delegate hauls. The winner will take home all of them, no matter their margin of victory.For the Republican establishment to derail Mr. Trump, winner of three of the first four states to vote, they need to winnow the field as quickly as possible, and two candidates believe wholeheartedly they can win their home states: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Until then, neither will likely drop out.The Republican establishment has clearly decided on Mr. Rubio, with numerous governors, senators and members of Congress hopping on board his campaign.But Mr. Rubio is polling badly behind Mr. Trump in Florida, while Mr. Kasich slightly trails the New York billionaire in Ohio. Thanks to absentee balloting, Florida voting has already begun.If Mr. Kasich wins the state he governs, and Mr. Rubio loses the state he represents in Congress, GOP power brokers will have gambled and lost with the 44-year-old freshman senator.""We are gonna win Ohio,"" John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's top strategist, told the Observer. ""Here's the thing: the Rubio campaign, and really his whole political career, is like a movie set. There's nothing real there.""""If you can't win your home state,"" he added, ""you can't move forward. If we couldn't win Ohio, I wouldn't try to spin the press on our chances.""Real or not, Mr. Rubio finished ahead of Mr. Kasich in three out of four states, though the Ohio governor came in second in New Hampshire, allowing him to continue onward. For a long time, Mr. Rubio looked like a safe bet to contest Mr. Trump all the way: he is conservative enough to appeal to primary voters and could compete in bigger, more liberal states in a way another rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, may not. He is articulate, handsome and, with the exception of one major stumble, strong in televised debates.Mr. Kasich, on the other hand, is a soft-spoken conservative seemingly unfit for the furious, populist mood of 2016. Tea Party voters hate him for expanding Medicaid in Ohio. Most political observers expect him to get crushed on March 1when a host of Southern states go to the polls.But Mr. Kasich has kept plodding along, and is hoping to carve a path to victory with a strong showing in Michigan on March 8. Other states like Massachusetts and Vermont, Mississippi are in the Kasich camp's sights. An Ohio win would be critical, and set Mr. Kasich up to fight Mr. Trump in other delegate-rich states where his moderate brand could sell. New York, which votes April 19, would be on that list.Suddenly, as RealClearPolitics recently pointed out, Mr. Kasich would become a viable alternative to Mr. Trump.Mr. Weaver argued that Mr. Rubio being ""crowned"" the ""insider"" candidate would be bad for him, anyway, given the volatile political climate.""If we win Ohio and he can't dramatically reverse what happens in Florida, it'll be a two-horse race,"" he predicted. ""I don't know why you'd want to be the insider candidate in this cycle.""Mr. Rubio has mostly refrained from attacking Mr. Kasich, saving his fire for Mr. Cruz and occasionally Mr. Trump. That could potentially change when the candidates debate tonight in Houston, though Mr. Trump is expected to be targeted.A spokesman for Mr. Rubio declined to comment.Read the full article here."

Remember that it was Kasich who talked Congress and Bill Clinton into not only balancing the federal budget, but into ending welfare as it had existed for decades.Kasich is as upset and angry as other Republicans about what's happening to our nation, and our failure to solve our major problems. But Kasich does not give in to the temptation to use vicious rhetoric, because he has the seasoning and the wisdom to know that once you're elected, campaigning that way makes progress after the election far more difficult.In the end it is constructive and optimistic leadership that makes the difference. For evidence, we need only to look to our nation's greatest modern president, Ronald Reagan. Gov. Kasich is in that mold, and that's why polls show he is the Republican most likely to win the general election.To read the full article, click here."
John Kasich,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - Detroit Free Press Endorses John Kasich,"Detroit Free PressThe GOP race is very fluid. It began with more than a dozen candidates, and has been dwindling, slowly, as candidates other than Trump find great difficulty in establishing formidable delegate support. Without question, the field could narrow again after Super Tuesday. From our standpoint, there's but one reasonable choice remaining in the field.We urge Michigan Republicans voting in the March 8 party primary to choose Ohio Gov. JOHN KASICH as their presidential nominee......Kasich has made much hay of his ability to enlist bipartisan support for his policy objectives. And, for the most part, this is true during his time in Congress, where he was instrumental in the passage of a bipartisan budget deal, and in Ohio's statehouse. His unpretentious policy wonk persona allows him to begin conversations his more combative competitors wouldn't indulge the necessity of; his willingness to absorb other information and viewpoints mean his counterparts are likely to find engaging in such conversations worthwhile.To read the full editorial, click here."

Bruce Tarr Op-Ed: Kasich Is Ready to Lead,"Mass LIVEKasich is the dark horse success that emerged from the pack once the votes started coming in. The theatrical, sound bite world of the debate stage may be a poor fit for a positive, reasonable candidate like Kasich. But anyone who has attended one of his town hall gatherings in New Hampshire or South Carolina has had the opportunity to see Ohio's governor in his element, and they invariably leave with a better impression of him than they had when they walked through the door.Why, Because John Kasich is a leader who knows what he's doing. Not only is he the only candidate to have ever balanced the federal budget, but he's the only one to even propose a plan to balance it again as president.With Kasich we can point to a record that reflects a sincere desire to serve people. Rather than yield to the will of lobbyists, he insists on considering policy decisions through the lens of the average person, who experiences the effects of his decisions most acutely.Because John Kasich is the only remaining Republican candidate to have both legislative and executive leadership experience, he is ready like no other to get the nation out of the ditch and back onto the road. He is the steady hand we need on the tiller as we navigate the greatest challenges that confront our nation.

Ohio's economy has grown at twice the Midwest average, as has household income. America could use those kind of numbers.Kasich is continuing in Ohio what he began as a congressman. In 1997, he was a key player in the deal that led to a rare balanced federal budget, and was also a driver of sensible welfare reform.

John Kasich,R,p,"March 5, 2016",Press Release - Op-Ed: Speaker Gingrich Says That John Kasich's Moment Has Arrived,"The Washington TimesThursday night's debate in Detroit became Ohio Gov. John Kasich's moment.In Frank Luntz's focus group, 18 of 24 picked Mr. Kasich as the winner.Even the news media, which has ignored Mr. Kasich's calm, positive, policy-focused campaign while lavishing attention on childish attacks, conceded that Mr. Kasich had a good night.Mr. Kasich's long, persistent, and at times quiet campaign has begun to pay off.Early in the campaign, the governor did not seem to be building any momentum, clogged somewhere in the muddle of 17 candidates.Donald Trump's sheer energy and noise dominated.Media coverage became a function of fighting the Donald. Mr. Kasich refused to be petty and negative. The news media refused to cover substance or positive ideas.But Mr. Kasich calmly continued to hold town hall meetings where he listened to people, answered their questions and learned from them.Then other candidates began dropping out.Jeb Bush spent more than $100 million, to almost no effect, and disappeared.Chris Christie brilliantly challenged Marco Rubio in a debate, but his campaign failed to catch on.Mr. Kasich skipped Iowa and focused on New Hampshire. He held more than 100 town hall meetings in the state, and came in second to Mr. Trump (better than almost anyone in the news media expected).On Super Tuesday, Mr. Kasich split Vermont's delegates in a tie with Donald Trump. He then finished second in Massachusetts.Callista and I went to see a John Kasich town hall meeting near our office in Virginia on Super Tuesday.There was a nice but not overwhelming crowd. John's wife, Karen, introduced him. I was at their wedding 19 years ago and she is lovelier than ever. Their twin daughters, Emma and Reese, were there, too.John was his old self. Engaging, funny, eager to listen, very willing to have people disagree with him or bring him new ideas and new information.Callista noted how deeply emotional John was in listening to people who had experienced pain in their lives. The small-town boy from Western Pennsylvania whose father was a mailmancomes through in these conversations with citizens from all walks of life.In terms of experience, Mr. Kasich is by far the best prepared of the final four candidates for the Republican nomination.He was elected to the Ohio State Senate in Ohio in 1978 as its youngest member ever. As a freshman, he wrote his own budget. Then he became the only Republican to defeat a Democratic incumbent for Congress in 1982.In his 18 years in Congress, John became a genuine expert on national security. He served on the House Armed Services Committee for all 18 years.When I became House Speaker in 1994, Mr. Kasich became chairman of the Budget Committee. Thanks to his intelligence, energy, drive and persistence, we balanced the federal budget for four straight years  the only time that has happened in our lifetimes.Mr. Kasich then spent a decade in business and learned the principles of free enterprise firsthand.He was drawn back to Ohio by a state government that was out of control. It was running up huge deficits, killing jobs and raising taxes. John decided to run for governor, and defeated the Democrat incumbent governor in a remarkable upset.In four years, he balanced the budget, cut taxes, led to job growth, developed a surplus and launched a wave of reforms that helped the poor, the mentally ill, and Ohioans with disabilities.In 2010, running for re-election, Mr. Kasich carried 86 of 88 counties  an unheard of majority in what is always a swing state in presidential elections.Thursday night, for the first time, Americans began to hear John Kasich's ideas.He won the debate and took a solid step toward winning Ohio in two weeks.He has earned it.To read the full article, click here."

[...]Whereas poll and delegate leader Trump touts his leadership skills in business and swore to be ""flexible"" during the GOP's latest debate, the brash New Yorker more often leads with threats and counterproductive ultimatums. That's not governing. That is dictating and ruling.As bright, slick and polished as Cruz and Rubio are at times, they lack the track record and executive skills that Kasich has honed over decades. Where all the others talk, the only remaining governor in the field, Kasich, has produced results amid the challenging circumstances of a huge, changing and complicated state. During his tenure as Ohio governor he turned around an $8 billion deficit to a $2 billion surplus.The one candidate who has managed to stay above the fray of vindictive personal attacks on his presidential opponents, Kasich has a career that has been successful by mixing pragmatism with conservatism. More than any of the rest, his stints as House budget chairman and on the Armed Services Committee point to a man who knows how to collaborate when others default to gridlock.To read the full editorial, click here."

If they want to cast an affirmative vote for a GOP candidate, one who has a record of results that represent their party's historic values, we recommend John Kasich.The Ohio governor's campaign has been largely positive thus far, which of course has resulted in it getting lost in the slapfight that the GOP primary has become. But Kasich's message  and his record as governor and congressman  is both clear and refreshing: It's possible to lead with conservative principles, work across the aisle, balance budgets and be attentive to all citizens.He is a fiscal hawk who helped close a budget shortfall in Ohio, but he also allowed for the expansion of Medicaid in his state and has shown an openness to offering undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. N.C. voters might recognize that kind of conservative; Kasich is the Eisenhower Republican we thought we were getting as governor four years ago.[...][If] you want a candidate whose pragmatic conservatism echoes the GOP in its better days, we recommend John Kasich.

John Kasich finally did well enough to boost his claim of being a potential Trump stopper.The race now goes Ohio, which votes Tuesday, along with another large Midwestern state, Illinois. Any momentum Kasich picked up in Michigan must be coupled with a victory in Ohio and perhaps Illinois to keep his campaign alive.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's performance casts doubt on his ability to appeal to voters outside the South. As Trump said in his lengthy prime-time victory speech, Cruz keeps claiming to be the only candidate who can beat Trump, but he rarely does.Trump picked up Mississippi on Tuesday night as well, a state with a large evangelical electorate that might have belonged to Cruz.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who looked to be well out of the race in Michigan, returns home as well. Florida votes Tuesday, and Rubio, like Kasich, has to win his home state.

Hillary Clinton leads Marco Rubio 44/41, and both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump 45/40- leads that are pretty well in line with how much Barack Obama won the state by in 2008 and 2012. Bernie Sanders does comparably well, leading Rubio 42/38, Trump 44/40, and Cruz 44/38. It's a whole different ballgame with Kasich though.

Kasich has received the least fanfare of the four Republicans still actively campaigning, he is by far the most able.In fact, this is a public servant who's had a hand in some of the most significant achievements of his time.As a member of Congress, he led efforts as chairman of the House Budget Committee to balance the budget during the administration of President Bill Clinton  a remarkable feat that today seems herculean given the wild-spending ways of our federal government.Kasich also was prominent in the landmark welfare reform measure passed in that era.In addition, he became an expert in national security as a member for 18 years of the House Armed Services Committee, where he played a role in setting the stage for the stunning end of the Cold War.As governor, he was instrumental in eliminating Ohio's $8 billion budget deficit and turning it into a $2 billion surplus, all while cutting taxes and creating jobs.His record of accomplishments is impressive. As impressive is the spirit of collaboration he brings to his work. In an era of paralyzing intransigence between our two political parties, he has been a breath of fresh air.

John Kasich is an experienced leader who understands the art of compromise  not just across the aisle but also within his own Republican Party when there is a moral or fiscal imperative to do so.Like other Republican candidates, Kasich talks about jobs. But he understands that reigniting economic growth regionally and nationally involves innovation, research and, most critically, investments in education. He's a fiscal conservative who nonetheless sees the imperative of spending on safety-net issues, including mental health, drug treatments and food aid.Kasich is, to use the language of many who've watched the recent GOP presidential debates deteriorate into name-calling and anatomical comparisons, the adult in the room. In other words, Kasich, 63, has all the ingredients to become president of the United States.[K]asich is head and shoulders the best candidate in the GOP race. He deserves to win March 15.

He has stayed away from the crude, the bullying, the childish and the desperate. He has been the adult, as many have noted.The governor has echoed the party of Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp, conservative yet sunnier and elevating. Kasich now has come home, the Ohio primary on Tuesday, and he must win to have any case for continuing his candidacy.Give the 66 winner-take-all delegates to John Kasich, and a chance remains for the best candidate now in the mix to emerge in July at the national party convention in Cleveland.

The most recent poll shows John Kasich slightly ahead of Donald Trump in Ohio.It's called ""delegate math."" Ohio and Florida are different from most other primaries in that they are ""winner-take-all"" states. When John Kasich wins Ohio it virtually assures Donald Trump will fail to secure the majority of delegates needed for the GOP nomination. It also propels Kasich forward to states where he will perform well, enabling him to secure a surge of both delegates and momentum as we head to the convention."

That's why Ohio has added more than 400,000 jobs since John Kasich became governor.As Gov. Kasich continues to climb in the polls thanks to his positive vision for America, we expect the attacks to get more and more desperate, but we are going to stay positive and focused on solutions because that's what the American people need.""The Script:I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message. After John Kasich helped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy he decided to run for Governor of Ohio. John Kasich has been an absentee Governor, spending most of time everywhere but Ohio. Especially Michigan, the latest disaster in his failing presidential bid. Kasich gave Ohio ObamaCare and increased our budget more than any other Governor in the U.S. We don't need him in Ohio and we certainly don't need him in Washington. John Kasich just another all talk, no action politician.CLAIM: After John Kasich helped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy.FACT: The people of Ohio first heard this attack six years ago. It failed then, and it will fail now. John Kasich ran a two-man office in Columbus, was one of approximately 800 people at his level in the company and did not have an executive or strategic role in the company. In fact, John Kasich's time in the private sector gave him first-hand knowledge of how job creators make decisions to grow and expand. As governor, John Kasich has applied his experiences to successfully turn around Ohio, create more than 400,000 private sector jobs, grow wages faster than the nation and reduce Ohio's unemployment rate from 9.2 when he took office to 4.9 percent today. Meanwhile the number of failed Trump business ventures and lost jobs is too numerous to list here. Instead, click the hyperlink for an overview: New York Daily News: A brief history of Donald Trump's many, many business failures.CLAIM: He decided to run for Governor of Ohio.FACT: He didn't just run. He won. Twice. His defeat of Ted Strickland in 2010 was the first time an incumbent Governor lost to someone who had never run statewide in any capacity since 1914. His re-election in 2014 came with him winning 86 of 88 counties, 25 percent of the African American vote and 60 percent of women voters.CLAIM: John Kasich has been an absentee Governor, spending most of his time everywhere but Ohio.FACT: John Kasich's list of accomplishments in Ohio stretches 31 pages long. With his level of success in Ohio, it's no wonder Quinnipiac Polling says John Kasich holds the highest approval rating of any governor that they've polled.CLAIM: Especially Michigan, the latest disaster in his failing presidential bid.FACT: Despite Gov. Kasich's late surge in Michigan, the truth is Ohioans don't typically look to Michigan for advice. Governor Kasich is tied for the lead with voters in states yet to vote, and he is the only candidate to lead Hillary Clinton in Ohio. If the campaign is ""failing"" it's unclear why the Trump campaign is attacking Gov. Kasich.CLAIM: Kasich gave Ohio ObamaCare.FACT: John Kasich opposes Obamacare. He sued the federal government to block it, rejected a state exchange, rejected a federal takeover of Ohio's insurance regulations and rejected a federal takeover of Ohio's Medicaid eligibility process. He wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with market-based solutions that empower the states He also wasn't going to leave Ohioans' tax money in Washington so Congress could spend it on another state. Instead, after first fixing Ohio's Medicaid program to reduce its growth rate from 10.6 percent to 2.5 percent, he put the system to work to treat more Ohioans with mental illness, drug addiction and other problems so they can join the workforce.Meanwhile, Donald Trump believes in single-payer health care.CLAIM: and increased our budget more than any other Governor in the U.S.FACT: The Washington Post giving similar claims three Pinocchios and FactCheck completely obliterated these accusations, too.Here's the reality. According to the Ohio Office of Budget and Management total spending in Ohio under Gov. Kasich's leadership increased by an average of just 2.2 percent per fiscal year, less than the rate of inflation and less than half the average rate of growth from 1999-2011.CLAIM: We don't need him in Ohio and we certainly don't need him in Washington.FACT: Gov. Kasich's job approval rating is 62% and for good reason.When John Kasich came into office, Ohioans had just lost 350,000 jobs, unemployment was at 9.2%, the state's credit outlook had been downgraded, the rainy-day fund was just $0.89 and the state was facing its largest projected budget shortfall in history.Today, Ohioans are up over 417,000 private sector jobs, unemployment is at 4.9%, the state's credit outlook has been upgraded, the rainy-day fund is over $2 billion, the budget is structurally balanced and Ohioans have received a total tax cut of $5 billion dollars.John Kasich shook things up and turned around Ohio. He can turn do the same for America.CLAIM: John Kasich just another all talk, no action politician.FACT: We'll let Gov. Schwarzenegger handle this one."

John Kasich in Tuesday's Republican Primary.While The Dispatch typically does not endorse candidates in a primary, this one is unique, given the alarming ascent of Trump, whose demeanor and reckless policy prescriptions make him unsuitable as a presidential nominee, much less president. If implemented, Trump's policies would lead to a devastating international trade war; create a human-rights crisis in the attempt to deport millions of people living in the country illegally; alienate nations otherwise friendly to the United States, such as Mexico; aggravate religious intolerance domestically and globally; and empower thugs such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump admires. (The Democratic primary is a more conventional race and the newspaper has no reason to change its customary hands-off approach to it.)Of those remaining in the GOP race, Kasich is unrivaled for his pragmatism and track record. He has refused to get into the mud with his rivals and consistently has taken the high road by trying to focus the race on the ability to make government work, a skill he has demonstrated as a member of Congress and governor of Ohio.

As governor, he enjoys strong support in the Buckeye State, according to poll numbers. He won nearly every county in Ohio during his bid for re-election in 2014. He has created more than 400,000 private-sector jobs and cut taxes by $5 billion.Throughout his campaign, Kasich has shown his compassionate side, often talking about the people ""in the shadows""  the poor, the drug-addicted and those suffering from mental illness. He has urged supporters to ""slow down in life"" and be better neighbors. In one of the darkest presidential campaigns in recent memory, when his opponents have resorted to name-calling and gutter politics, Kasich has stayed above the fray. His markedly positive campaign stands in sharp contrast to the campaigns of his three Republican primary rivals. Kasich's refusal to waver from this upbeat approach, even when it has cost him the spotlight, is refreshing, yet unfortunately too rare in American politics.Read the full editorial by clicking here."
John Kasich,R,p,"March 13, 2016","Press Release - In Peoria, the Journal Star Endorses John Kasich","The Peoria Journal StarThere is but one adult left in the room among the Republicans chasing the White House. John Kasich gets and deserves this newspaper's endorsement. [...]As his state's CEO, he's won lower income taxes, increased education spending and balanced budgets. As congressman, he worked across the aisle to help write the nation's welfare reform law and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The latter, with arguably an assist from tax policies previously implemented and a growing economy, was followed by Uncle Sam's last budget surplus from 1998 through 2001. ""More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget,"" then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich said.They'd get a Kasich who alone among the remaining Republicans doesn't hate the institution he hopes to lead, who believes in limited but not non-existent government. They'd get a social conservative who's not a fire breather, who doesn't resort to decidedly unChristian behavior to prove how religious he is. They'd get an intelligent man who doesn't deny the science behind climate change, though he'd prefer private-sector solutions to government ones. They'd get a pragmatic leader who's not a partisan demagogue, who while not a fan of ObamaCare accepted its Medicaid expansion in his state because it helped his most vulnerable.They'd get someone who has championed criminal justice reforms in an Ohio that reportedly has among the lowest recidivism rates in the country. They'd get someone who, as thoughtful and mature people do, has evolved in his thinking on immigration reform, who believes in the rule of law but speaks the truth to people who don't want to hear it  ""The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous, and everybody knows it""  and takes a common-sense, compassionate approach. They'd get someone who supported the war in Iraq but is now honest enough to concede that was a mistake, who is not eager for conflict but understands that the ISIS that grew out of that quagmire is a real threat that must be confronted and defeated with a true coalition.[...]This is not a hard call.

John Kasich,R,p,"March 15, 2016",Press Release - A Plea to Ohio  Please Help Stop Donald Trump,"Matthew TullyIndianapolis Star Political ColumnistThe Indianapolis Star Dear Ohio:Hi, it's your friend Indiana here. Well, I should acknowledge that I don't speak for all of Indiana. But I'm certain I am speaking for a majority of your neighbors to the west when I say: Help! Please, help.So much about the direction of this country, so much about its future, is up to you on primary day. We've given up on Florida, and I don't know what to make of Illinois after last weekend's mess in Chicago. So I'm turning to you, a calm and reasonable Midwestern state, and asking you to do what you can to stop a national travesty that has been steamrolling ahead on an endless supply of hate and anger.So what do we need you to do? Simply vote for your sensible and accomplished governor, John Kasich, and against a candidate, Donald Trump, who has been accurately called a bigot, a bully, a con man and a fearmonger.It's up to you, Ohio.[...]Kasich is not Trump. And that by itself is enough. The fact he has a solid record as governor, and that he has elevated the discourse at every debate he's been in, is gravy.Ohio, we need you.We need you to send a message about what cannot be tolerated even in these horribly divisive times. We need you to be as strong as the Ohio State defense and stop the Trump disaster from gaining too much ground. To paraphrase that great Ohioan, Neil Armstrong, we need you to take one small step for the Republican Party  one step that could lead to a giant leap for the country.Let me end with two quotes. Ulysses S. Grant, a native of Ohio who led the Union Army in the Civil War and later became president, wrote in his memoirs: ""Things are seen plainer after the events have occurred.""My guess is, the Trump candidacy and everything that drove it will seem even plainer years from now than it does Tuesday. Time will show a clearer picture of the nastiness and hatred that propelled a candidate who didn't deserve a reality TV show, much less a chance at running the most important country on earth. I suspect many people will someday regret supporting him.But we can't wait for history to play out. The stakes are too great. Tuesday is what matters.The second quote comes from a modern-day son of your state. ""I make impact plays,"" LeBron James once explained. ""I make game-changing plays."" That's what we need from you on Tuesday, Ohio. We need a game-changing play. We need an impact play. We need a smart Midwestern state to say, no, we can do better than Donald J. Trump.Read the full letter by clicking here."

Trump's nomination would prove ruinous to the GOP's electoral hopes  and indeed, might even split the GOP into not so grand parts. No wonder, then, that he's the candidate so many Democrats want Republicans to nominate.[...]As a well-liked and respected purple-state governor, Kasich is a better party-unifying prospect than the abrasive hard-right Texan.And in contrast with Cruz's phony filibusters and pointless budgetary brinksmanship, Kasich actually has a record of conservative accomplishment. As former House Budget Committee chairman, he takes  and deserves  real credit for helping engineer the last balanced federal budget. He's also been a successful governor of Ohio, a state without which no Republican has ever won the White House.[...]Kasich also runs strongest against Clinton in the key swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. And in small but possibly critical New Hampshire.So the logic is clearly there. That said, it's also true that logic and the long view haven't exactly been holding the reins this primary season.But despite the unpredictable twists and turns, the case for Kasich has steadily improved, moving from complicated to conceivable to credible.Expect it to become more persuasive post-Rubio, as Republicans wake up to the fact that the Ohio governor is the only one of the remaining hopefuls who doesn't have ""November Disaster"" emblazoned on his forehead.Read the full article here."
John Kasich,R,p,"March 16, 2016",Press Release - ASSOCIATED PRESS: Cruz has no realistic path,"With things as they currently stand, Ted Cruz will not secure the Republican nomination before the Republican National Convention. Even one-on-one against Trump, the odds for Cruz are insurmountable.ASSOCIATED PRESS: ""[Ted Cruz] has no realistic path to win a majority during the primaries.""WASHINGTON POST: ""Cruz would likely need about 90 percent of the remaining delegates to win the nomination, which, barring Trump's abduction by extraterrestrials, is unlikely.""Meanwhile, Donald Trump needs to secure 57 percent of the remaining delegates to obtain a simple majority, something he's yet to be able to accomplish.With that in mind, a contested convention in Cleveland is looking more and more likely.FORTUNE: ""Governor John Kasich's big primary win in his home state of Ohio on Tuesday night has increased the likelihood that none of the remaining Republican presidential candidates will have the votes necessary to win the nomination going into the Republican National Convention this summer. So, it is looking likely that the delegates at the convention will end up picking the nominee themselves.In considering a candidate, the delegates will need to choose the person who best represents the views and values of the GOP, as well as someone who could take on and actually stands a chance at beating the Democratic nominee in the general election. While the delegates could technically nominate anyone they want, if they were to focus solely on the remaining candidates, they would be wise to choose Governor John Kasich.While Governor Kasich will probably enter the convention with the least amount of delegates among the two remaining Republican candidates, Donald Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, he stands head and shoulders above both in terms of experience and electability. Despite his lackluster showing in the primaries, Kasich is the only Republican candidate left in the race who has consistently shown in poll after poll that he can beat Hillary Clinton in the general electionand do it by a healthy margin.""Historically, contested conventions have focused more on electability than delegate counts.THE FEDERALIST: Six of the GOP's ten brokered conventions have produced a nominee who went on to become president, with five of them winning the popular vote. By contrast, in the ten elections since 1960 in which the GOP was not nominating an incumbent, the Republican nominee has won four times. Whatever one may think of the GOP brokering conventions, their track record in producing winning candidates has been slightly better than the modern system of choosing nominees."

Ohioans were unconvinced, probably because of Kasich's sky-high approvals in the Buckeye State.So Trump is still trying to find the quirk or supposed defect of character he can use to taunt Kasich, and that may prove to be a problem for Trump moving forward.A string of strong finishes by Kasich in these states won't preclude Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.But if Kasich can capitalize on his Ohio win, Rubio's exit, and a rather favorable map going forward, he may, with Cruz, be able to slow Trump's momentum enough that he limps into the convention looking like anything but a consensus pick.[W]ith Kasich's win in Ohio on Tuesday, the path to a contested convention looks a little easier to navigate.To read the full article, click here."

Roeder gave $25,000 to that group and donated to Rubio and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who dropped out of the race shortly before Christmas.Kilberg was one of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's most steadfast financial supporters. After Christie gave up his presidential bid, she and her husband, Bill, became co-chairs of Bush's finance committee. She heads a Virginia technology trade association.Caruso, who has flirted with running for mayor of Los Angeles, has been unaffiliated with any GOP presidential campaign this cycle, but he helped raise money for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. More recently, Caruso's son, Greg, gained attention among political types during a Republican presidential debate broadcast by CNN.

John Kasich,R,p,"March 22, 2016",Press Release - Op-Ed: Can Kasich Save the GOP?,"The Baltimore SunJules WitcoverMarch 21, 2016As establishment Republicans look to an elusive stop-Trump effort to salvage their party from self-destruction, circumstances have suddenly handed them their best and perhaps only viable vehicle in Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.The twice-elected governor and former 18-year congressman, after months of obscurity among the pack of 17 GOP presidential candidates, has emerged after beating Mr. Trump in the Ohio primary as one of only two barriers to the New Yorker's nomination.With Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, an unvarnished tea party conservative deeply despised in the Senate as the alternative, Mr. Kasich as a more moderate conservative is the establishment's more acceptable hope to avoid the Trump takeover.His impressive legislative record as a budget-balancer and deficit hawk in Congress, replicated in Columbus, offers a sharp contrast to Mr. Trump's total inexperience in government at any level, and he offers the additional virtue of being a positive and unifying campaigner.While many of the other GOP contenders for the White House have joined the mud-slinging and name-calling of Mr. Trump, Mr. Kasich has conspicuously abstained. The worst he has said so far has been to observe the front runner has created ""a toxic environment"" in the campaign that has not served the party well.In assuring fellow Republicans that he will ""not take the low road to seek the highest office in the land,"" Mr. Kasich has intentionally pushed back against the Trump phenomenon, and is offering a sharp stylistic and temperamental contrast to the reckless and demagogic New York business tycoon and snake-oil salesman.Known in Congress as a sharp-tongued and argumentative partisan, the former House Budget Committee chairman as governor has adopted a much more personable and conciliatory manner, touting party unity and willingness to work across the partisan aisle. All this makes Mr. Kasich potentially an effective vehicle for persuading fellow Republicans to reflect on their party's long engagement in the two-party system, which functioned reasonably well before its recent engagement in blind obstruction in Washington.Read the full column here."

John Kasich,R,p,"March 23, 2016","Press Release - Quinnipiac Poll: Cruz Would Hand Nomination to Trump, White House to Clinton","A new Quinnipiac poll released this morning shows that in a head-to-head matchup Ted Cruz would lose to Donald Trump by 9 points, 46%-37%.The poll also shows that both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump would lose a general election race against Hillary Clinton while John Kasich would win 47%-39%.The Quinnipiac poll confirms that Gov. Kasich is the key to stopping Donald Trump in the remaining states, and Gov. Kasich is the only candidate who can win the White House and help sweep in Republican candidates up and down the ballot.Kasich Now Key to Stopping TrumpMoving forward, Gov. Kasich is the key to our Party's hope of stopping Donald Trump and the potential disastrous consequences of his nomination.Assertions to the contrary are inaccurate. They are disingenuous attempts to mislead Republicans and hand the nomination to Donald Trump.As we enter April, John Kasich and Donald Trump will be the main competitors for delegates. John Kasich will play the primary role of blocking Donald Trump from reaching a majority of delegates.The Northeast, Pacific Coast and Midwest: Cruz Would Hand Nomination to TrumpNortheast: In the Northeast states that have already voted, Ted Cruz has had disastrous results, winning just 12% in New Hampshire, 10% in Massachusetts and 10% in Vermont. (His showing in Maine was due to a closed and arcane caucus system. None of the remaining Northeastern states have such a system.) In the Northeastern states Trump beat Cruz by anywhere from 3-1 to 5-1. That pattern will continue in states like Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Delaware. If Trump wins those states, he will reach 1,237.Pacific Coast: The traditional voting patterns of California, Washington and Oregon  all three of which have yet to vote  closely resemble those of the Northeast.Midwest: Exit polling in Ohio showed definitively that without John Kasich in the race, Donald Trump would have beaten Ted Cruz head-to-head. The majority of Midwestern states remaining more closely resemble Ohio than the earlier states and there are certain Congressional districts in those states in which only John Kasich can defeat Donald Trump.Bottom LineJohn Kasich must continue to fight Donald Trump for delegates in order to prevent Trump's reaching 1,237, and despite his protestations, Ted Cruz is not going to achieve that magic number either.To reach 1237 delegates, Cruz would have to win more than 80% of remaining available delegates  an impossible task regardless of whether or not John Kasich is in the race.Only John Kasich will defeat Hillary Clinton in an Electoral College landslide, sweeping in Republicans from the courthouse to the Senate. The other candidates would lose to Hillary Clinton in dramatic fashion, cost the GOP seats in down-ballot races from California to Maine and put control of Congress in jeopardy. For example, a new poll of North Carolina found ""voters are less likely to vote for [Sen. Richard] Burr by a 26 point spread if he supports Trump for President"" while John Kasich leads Clinton 49%-41%.Without question, John Kasich is the best Presidential candidate to have at the top of the ballot for Republican Senators who are up for re-election like Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Richard Burr, Pat Toomey, Ron Johnson, Mark Kirk.Governor Kasich is ready to be President, can unite the Party and win the White House. He will be the clear best choice at the Convention."

John Kasich,R,p,"March 24, 2016",Press Release - INJO  4 Reasons #NeverTrump Conservatives Should Stop Telling John Kasich to Drop Out of the 2016 Race,"Independent JournalJustin GreenMarch 24, 2016There's a new theory going around that John Kasich should drop out of the race to help Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump.While it sounds nice for the #NeverTrump crowd, it's wrong for four reasons.1) No One Can ""Beat"" TrumpTo win the Republican nomination outright requires a majority of delegates to the national convention, making the magic number 1,237.After Tuesday's primaries in Utah and Arizona, the math is formidably in Trump's favor.[...]Kasich's ability to win the nomination outright has been mathematically eliminated, with Cruz teetering on the same result.The Texas Republican needs more than 80% of the remaining delegates to lock up the nomination. [...]The mission is for Cruz and Kasich to deny Trump a majority of delegates, forcing an open convention in July. To stop that, Trump needs to unify more of the party around his campaign.But if Cruz or Kasich pick up steam, Trump will end up just shy of a majority of delegates by convention time, according to FiveThirtyEight.2) Trump Benefits Most if Anyone Else Drops OutThere's a idea running through conservative politics that one candidate will be able to consolidate the anti-Trump votes and defeat The Donald.In reality, the math does not support that premise. A poll released Wednesday showed that Trump would gain support if either Cruz or Kasich dropped out.Rather than building the anti-Trump coalition, a two-man race would put Trump closer to the 50% mark that would effectively end the race.[...]3) Kasich is Far More Competitive Than Cruz in Many Remaining States[...]Cruz's chances, as Weaver told Independent Journal Review, aren't as rosy on the West Coast and in New England:""Are you gonna tell me that Ted Cruz is going to do well in Rhode Island, or Delaware, or Manhattan, or Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington?""[...]Cruz trails Trump badly in polls conducted in New York and New Jersey, and can be expected to struggle in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Kasich is far more competitive with Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the latest poll from the Keystone State.Those five states account for 264 delegates, and a Cruz-v-Trump race would likely sacrifice the lion's share of those delegates to The Donald.While there is a chance that Kasich remaining in the race would make Cruz wins more difficult in states like Montana, Nebraska and New Mexico, the delegate math suggests it's worth the risk. Kasich's victories would reduce the margin of Trump wins in the Northeast.4) It's Got to Be a Team Effort[...]Now that Trump is within sight of the nomination, Cruz and Kasich face a choice. They can keep going after each other, as they did before the March 15th primaries, or they can train all their firepower on turning out voters.Stevens, who is not affiliated with a campaign this cycle, promotes the latter approach, particularly when it comes to states like California.To stop Trump from running away with a clean nomination, the best option is for Cruz and Kasich to stay in the race all the way through July.Read the full column here."

John Kasich,R,p,"March 29, 2016","Press Release - Bloomberg View: Cruz, Not Kasich, Is the Trump Enabler","Bloomberg ViewStep right up, folks, to the Ted Cruz-John Kasich game. The aim is to push out the candidate who could win in November in favor of the one who can't. Everything else has failed to stop Donald Trump, but the Republicans' strategy of putting their few remaining eggs in Senator Cruz's basket and insulting Governor Kasich back to the Ohio statehouse is delusional  as is their assertion that a vote for Kasich is a vote for Trump......Although Kasich is being hammered for continuing to exist, he has a good case for staying in: He governs Ohio, which no Republican has won the White House without, was re-elected there with record numbers, and has high approval ratings for turning the deficit into a surplus and bringing 400,000 jobs to the state. He's pro-life and a fiscal conservative. He over-hugs but has kept out of the mud pit. He wins in every matchup with Clinton, while Trump and Cruz lose by double digits......And in Ohio, with Cruz and Rubio still in, Kasich won decisively, keeping 66 delegates from Trump. Looking forward to northeastern states, Cruz is not going to win moderate conservatives, see the polls above. In Pennsylvania, a Franklin and Marshall survey showed Kasich statistically even with Trump, and Cruz a distant third. To stop Trump, Cruz has to stay out.What Republicans want  other than the 30 percent voting for Trump  is not a Cruz win but a brokered convention. There are fewer winner-take-all states left and there's no saying Cruz could win those in a one-on-one matchup against Trump. In moderate states coming up and where delegates are allocated  to deny Trump his 1,237 delegates, the party has to reverse its mantra: A vote for Cruz is a vote for Trump."
John Kasich,R,p,"March 29, 2016",Press Release - Why Only John Kasich Can Win in November,"I'd be for the most right, viable candidate who could win."" William F. Buckley, The Buckley RuleA quick refresher.John Kasich balanced Ohio's budget while improving the state's rainy-day fund from 89 cents to more than $2 billion, all while cutting taxes by more than any active governor in the nation. He eliminated the estate tax and is completely phasing out income taxes for small businesses. He approved more pro-life measures than any other Ohio governor in history and signed every pro-2nd amendment bill that has crossed his desk. In congress, he was the chief architect of the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon, he reformed welfare and spent 18 years on the House Armed Services committee.Not only is John Kasich conservative, he is ready. Not only is John Kasich an accomplished leader, he is the one candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton.Going back to the beginning of 2016, 15 national polls have been released showing Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump. Polling also shows Cruz losing in the most recent data from RealClearPolitics polling averages. At the same time, Kasich consistently defeats Hillary Clinton in each and every poll.As is commonplace every four years, winning the presidency comes down to the swing states. While the path for Republicans has narrowed over time, the White House is still in reach for the GOP as long as a number of key swing states are won.Polling shows that not only do Trump and Cruz fail to win any of these states, John Kasich wins every state where he's been polled.Losing these key swing states makes it impossible for Ted Cruz or Donald Trump to secure victory over Hillary Clinton in November. In fact, the absolute worst-case scenario for Democrats versus Cruz or Trump has Clinton winning more than 300 electoral votes, well over the threshold of the 270 votes necessary to win. That scenario can be seen below where 37 electoral votes over five toss-up states are left up for grabs. Meanwhile, Kasich winning swing states where he is polling ahead of Clinton puts Republicans on the cusp of victory, with a win in just one of Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa or Wisconsin securing the White House.The reason behind a Cruz or Trump electoral disaster becomes far more transparent In the three most recent polls that utilized break outs of Women and Independents in their findings. These key voting blocs show both Cruz and Trump have similarly massive unfavorable ratings among Independents and Women. Meanwhile, John Kasich does far better, putting him in position to carry crucial portions of the electorate in November.The impact of a Cruz or Trump nomination would be devastating for down-ticket races as well. In a rare step, the Cook Political Report downgraded 13 legislative races in one month as the chances for a Trump or Cruz candidacy increased in March.Remember...""I'd be for the most right, viable candidate who could win."" William F. Buckley, The Buckley RuleThat's John Kasich."

Madison is home to the University of Wisconsin, and Kasich has done well in liberal college areas such as around Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan......The other troubling result for Trump is that Kasich really does seem to have an appeal with a certain type of self-described moderate Republican that Cruz doesn't. Kasich holds a statistically insignificant 35 percent to 34 percent to 23 percent lead over Trump and Cruz with moderates in the Marquette poll. He has a slightly larger 37 percent to 31 percent edge over Trump with that group in the Basswood Research survey. That's why Kasich is winning in the Madison media market. This type of well-educated moderate voter can be found by the barrel in the northern mid-Atlantic and southern New England states that vote in late April.

John Kasich,R,p,"April 2, 2016",Press Release - NYT: Why Never Trump Should Mean Maybe Kasich,"New York Times EditorialWith more than half of the 2016 presidential primary races in the history books, Republicans desperate to deny Donald Trump their party's nomination now say Wisconsin, where Ted Cruz is leading, will show that their effort has turned the tide. They shouldn't start bragging yet.At a televised Republican town hall on Tuesday, it was painful to watch farmers, students and a man whose son died of a drug overdose pose earnest questions to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, who were more interested in attacking each other. Only John Kasich connected with these voters.Despite its noble aim and big budget, ""Never Trump"" has become a panicky reaction in search of a strategy. In Wisconsin, ""Never Trump"" means ""How About Cruz?"" as self-interested leaders like Gov. Scott Walker try to sell Republicans on a dangerously reactionary senator as an improvement over a dangerously ignorant businessman. But for the state's  and the nation's  moderate conservatives, ""Never Trump"" should more logically mean ""Maybe Kasich...""...In some coming states and districts, voter data indicates that Mr. Kasich, not the ultraconservative, evangelical Mr. Cruz, could be more competitive. Yet there's been no real effort by ""Never Trump"" leaders on Mr. Kasich's behalf. Indeed, some Republicans are pressuring the Ohio governor to quit and coalescing around Mr. Cruz, a candidate who was once almost as unthinkable to them as Mr. Trump and should still be.This is happening even though the numbers are there to deprive Mr. Trump of the nomination without delivering it to Mr. Cruz on a platter, says Henry Olsen, of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Washington. ""If your goal is Never Trump,' you should put your bets on the best candidate depending on the delegate allocation rules and the demographics of the state,"" he says. This means ""Never Trump"" backers... would work to deliver Delaware, the San Francisco Bay area, the Philadelphia suburbs, and urban areas in New York State to Mr. Kasich...... [I]n a year when cruelty and exclusion stand as hallmarks of conservatism, ""It would be courageous to stand up and say that Kasich is a different kind of conservative,"" who doesn't see government, or foreigners, as enemies, Mr. Olsen says. ""These voters exist, and there's a lot of them.""Mr. Cruz has been trying to bully Mr. Kasich from the race by billing himself as the only viable alternative to Mr. Trump. It would be ironic if Mr. Cruz became the candidate of a party whose leaders hate him. But if those leaders can't find it in themselves to take a more courageous path, they deserve whatever they get."
John Kasich,R,p,"April 3, 2016",Press Release - Barron's Editorial: Kasich is the Best Pick for Markets and the Economy,"Barron's Editorial BoardApril 2, 2016It's time for Republicans to take a closer look at John Kasich.For much of this presidential race, the popular Ohio governor with the common touch and a blue-chip political pedigree has been running at the back of the pack, although to his credit he has outlasted well-funded early favorites such as Florida's Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.Now, some leaders in the Republican Party are pressing him to drop out of the race, in an effort to boost rival Ted Cruz and block Donald Trump from earning enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. But having stood down more than a dozen challengers, it is unlikely that Kasich, 63, will stop now.For investors, that looks like a good thing. Kasich's policy prescriptions, experience, and temperament make him the GOP's best bet to reassure a nervous marketplace.Kasich wins high marks against Hillary Clinton, as well. [...]And in the event of a contested convention, he has a powerful advantage: He's the only GOP candidate who beats Clinton in a head-to-head contest in the polls. ""With John Kasich, you have a candidate who lines up almost perfectly with many investors,"" says Chris Krueger, a Washington strategist with Guggenheim Securities. ""He has a track record as a pragmatist from his time as governor, and he knows the markets from his stint as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers.""Unlike Clinton, Kasich has a sensible across-the-board tax-cutting agenda for corporations, individuals, and investors. And as a Republican president working with a presumably GOP-controlled Congress, he would be a more effective leader. After all, he spent six years as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, so he knows how to broker a deal.""It would be marvelous if Kasich were in the White House and Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House,"" says David Kotok, a Kasich fan who is chairman of Cumberland Advisors, a $2.4-billion-in-assets money-management firm in Sarasota, Fla. ""You'd have two people who are bright and skillful compromisers who would get things done, as opposed to the obstructionist politics we've had for many years.""Kasich, who spent 18 years in the House, appears to be sincere about reforming entitlements and other government spending. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has studied the numbers provided by each candidate and concluded that Kasich is the only one in the race who can lower total federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product over the next decade[...]A big part of Kasich's appeal in the financial community is his record as a fiscal hawk both in Congress and in the Ohio statehouse. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he is credited with being a leader in the fight to pass legislation in 1997 setting out guidelines to balance the budget by 2002. No doubt, that effort to eliminate the federal deficit for the first time in three decades was helped by a surging tech-fueled economy, but observers give Kasich his due for his grit and deal-making during the process.Since becoming Ohio's governor in 2011, he has helped turn an $8 billion budget shortfall into a surplus through lots of unpopular spending cuts and a highly controversial decision to shift costs from the state to local governments. And he pulled it off while also cutting Ohio's income-tax rate.During Kasich's governorship, Ohio's unemployment rate fell from 9.2% to 4.9% as of February. And the state has added about 400,000 new jobs. ""Anyone can promise anything for investors,"" says Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols. ""Whose taxes have Ted Cruz or Donald Trump ever cut? Gov. Kasich is the only candidate that can point to a record of accomplishment.""[...]Tim Pagliara, CEO of CapWealth Advisors, an investment advisory firm in Franklin, Tenn., attended a Kasich gathering last summer and came away impressed.

John Kasich say that he was determined to prevent Republican frontrunner Donald Trump from becoming the party's presidential nominee.Owen Marsh, 18, had driven from Scarsdale to see Kasich...""This is the first election I get to vote in, and this is the candidate I wanted to see,"" he said. ""He's a very common-sense candidate. He has a proven record and more experience than anyone else running for president.""Marsh said he liked Kasich because the Ohio governor wouldn't continue the partisanship that has divided Congress.""He's definitely someone who can compromise and get his ideas done as well as work both sides of the aisle,"" said Marsh, adding that he would not support Trump if the billionaire were to get the nomination.Earlier in the day, Kasich had appeared at Hofstra University's David S. Mack Student Center and visited Sagamore Hill, home of Theodore Roosevelt. At the town hall he told the audience he drew strength from TR's example of ""perseverance"" in the face of opposition. He also recounted that when he was a teenager he'd wrangled a chance to ask President Richard Nixon a question at a public event, but he never got around to telling the Paramount crowd what he had said.Timing was tight because Kasich was going live at 7 p.m. with Greta Van Susteren, host of Fox News' On the Record.""I'm not dropping out,"" Kasich said in Huntington, because ""nobody is going to have enough delegates to go to the convention and win on the first ballot.""To read the full article, click here."
John Kasich,R,p,"April 5, 2016",Press Release - Wall Street Journal: The Real Kasich Threat,"The Real Kasich Threat: Trump and Cruz fear GOP convention delegates might prefer a winner.Mr. Trump's understanding of democracy is unusualcandidates don't own voters, and the party committee doesn't dictate nominees. But he and Mr. Cruz do share a self-interest in trying to drive Mr. Kasich to the sidelines. Mr. Trump is the only candidate left with a limited mathematical path to the 1,237-delegate majority to win the nomination before the July convention, and if he loses in Wisconsin on Tuesday Mr. Trump must win about two-thirds of the remaining bound delegates in 17 states. Mr. Kasich has more political appeal than Mr. Cruz in the southern New England and mid-Atlantic states that are more suburban and moderate. If Mr. Trump can threaten his way to a two-man race, he could get to 1,237. As for Mr. Cruz, he'd have to sweep nearly every remaining primary to get to 1,237. He also knows Mr. Kasich has a better chance than the Texan does of denying Mr. Trump delegates in states like Pennsylvania and Maryland that vote on April 26. But Mr. Cruz wants to drive Mr. Kasich out of the race before the convention even if it means running a greater risk that Mr. Trump can get closer to 1,237. Mr. Cruz wants Mr. Kasich out now because he figures the delegates in Cleveland will choose Mr. Cruz if the choice is down to him and Mr. Trump. But if Mr. Kasich is still an option, the delegates might favor him as a better November candidate.....Mr. Kasich did the public service of winning Ohio's delegateswith which Mr. Trump might have locked up the nominationand he deserves a chance to see if he can win Pennsylvania or pick up delegates in the East and California. He has no hope of reaching 1,237 delegates before the convention, but what Messrs. Trump and Cruz really fear is that the convention might want to nominate a potential winner.Read the full article here."

John Kasich,R,p,"April 8, 2016",Press Release - U.S. News & World Report: The Case for Kasich,"Note: ""Those moneyball political operatives might want to take another look before they write Kasich off. My gut says that things in this race are shifting quickly, and if I you ask me, I'd say the Ohio governor would be crazy to leave the race.""The Case for KasichBy Mary Kate CaryApril 8, 2016 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's big win in Wisconsin was the shot in the arm that he needed, allowing him to say that Wisconsin was a ""turning point  it is a rallying cry""  which I'm not sure is truly the case.And yet what's been surprising to me this week is the mounting pressure for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to leave the race.So let's consider the case for John Kasich. He's outlasted early favorites like Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Scott Walker. As of this week, Kasich is the only Republican in the race who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup, winning by a six-point average margin on Real Clear Politics. He's also the only Republican with higher favorables than unfavorables, by 43 to 30, a 13-point positive margin.As a former three-term chairman of the House budget committee, Kasich knows how to broker a compromise; having him in the White House with Paul Ryan as speaker figures to work well  especially in comparison to Cruz, who has a record of obstructionism in the Senate. And as governor of Ohio since 2011, Kasich has turned a near $8 billion state budget deficit into a $2 billion surplus while cutting taxes and funding K-12 schools at an all-time high; unemployment has fallen from 9.2 percent to 4.9 percent; and Ohio has become one of the top job-creating states in the country. No wonder he was re-elected by a 30-point margin in 2014.Read the full article here."
John Kasich,R,p,"April 8, 2016",Press Release - Detroit News: Kasich Is Still the Best Choice,"Note: ""He is the only candidate left on either ballot with the combination of integrity, temperament, experience and maturity to honorably lead America."" The Detroit NewsApril 7, 2016 Pressure is mounting on John Kasich to get out of the Republican presidential primary race. And while it is true the Ohio governor statistically can not win the nomination outright by capturing a majority of the delegates, he should stay in the contest.[...]This newspaper endorsed him for the Michigan primary, in which he and Cruz finished virtually tied for second, for the same reasons we urge him not to abandon the fight now. He is the only candidate left on either ballot with the combination of integrity, temperament, experience and maturity to honorably lead America.If Trump doesn't reach Cleveland in July with the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first ballot, the campaign for all practical purposes starts anew.[...]Kasich is the best choice for a number of reasons. First, he starts with a base of delegates already, about 10 percent of those that have been awarded. That's a small number, for sure, but every delegate will be priceless once the bargaining starts.He's also had the benefit of being in the campaign from the beginning. He's competed in every primary, and has a nationwide organization. He would not be starting from scratch coming out of Cleveland.Perhaps most important is Kasich's strength in Ohio, a state Republicans must win if they hope to prevail in a presidential election.And then there's the fact that Kasich can actually beat Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. Of the three remaining candidates, Kasich is the only one who polls ahead of Clinton in a head-to-head battle, and by solid margins. (He splits the polls in a match-up with the other Democrat, Bernie Sanders.)The sudden faltering of Trump, evidenced by Cruz's win in Wisconsin Tuesday, makes the likelihood of a contested convention much greater. If it continues to be a three-man race, it's difficult to see a path for Trump to arrive in Cleveland with the required delegates.Republicans will need broader choices, and someone who committed to the race should get preference. John Kasich should stay in the race till the end and make himself available should the Republican Party come to its senses at the convention.Read the full editorial here."

Both will make judgments about the value of experience and the reliability of stirring promises. Both will determine whether calm competence in the White House serves the nation better than excited emotionalism.For Republicans, the best candidate is Ohio Gov. John Kasich.[...]Kasich has endured the long campaign without descending into the gutter with Trump. On crowded debate stages, Kasich distinguished himself by remaining polite and focused on the issues. As the field narrowed, Kasich was absent from the demeaning rounds of invective involving the size of the candidates' hands and the attractiveness of their spouses. For that alone, Kasich deserves to be rewarded.And while Cruz offers a plausible reason for casting a strategic vote, so does Kasich: Of all the Republican candidates, Kasich stacks up best against Hillary Clinton in the general election.Kasich's appeal has the potential to extend beyond the Republican Party not only because of the elevated tone of his campaign, but because of a solid record of practical governance. As governor, he extended Medicaid to poor Ohioans rather than taking a punitively purist position against Obamacare. Instead of talking about tax cuts one moment and condemning deficits the next, Kasich reminds voters that he was chairman of the House Budget Committee the last time the federal budget was balanced.Kasich has the maturity, the experience and the dignity the GOP should expect of its presidential nominee.

John Kasich is highly suited to carry the GOP banner into the general election.Kasich's qualifications are all the clearer  screamingly so  when matched against those of competitors Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.[...]As a mature, grounded politician, Kasich competes well against them both.Although he was largely overtalked in debates that were staged like gladiatorial contests, Kasich has nonetheless drawn the favorable attention of voters across the country. He alone runs ahead of Clinton in polls and is neck and neck with Sanders.Kasich's support is well deserved, starting with deep and successful governmental experience.Nine terms of congressional service included crafting the first U.S. balanced budget in nearly four decades. In 2010, he narrowly won election as Ohio governor and he was reelected in a landslide four years later. While meeting with the Daily News Editorial Board, he was both ebulliently folksy and fully versed on the innards of policy.On the ideological spectrum, Kasich meets the tests of Republican conservatism.He believes in reducing taxes to stimulate economic growth. He tried, and failed, to limit public employee collective bargaining rights in Ohio. He staunchly opposes abortion and stands up for Second Amendment rights. (He did support the 1994 assault weapons ban, but he would not reinstate the law.)In the presidential campaign, he calls for cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 28%, and rules out any increase in government spending, aside from the military and programs like Medicaid, for nine years. Although Ohio voters have indexed the state minimum wage (now $8.10) to inflation, he stands against hiking the federal minimum of $7.25.Although far out of sync with the Daily News' philosophy, all of that says Kasich's presidential plans should please the GOP conservative faithful. At the same time, in an era frozen by dogma, he stands out for understanding that progress in a democracy can demand compromise.[...]In the strongest possible terms, the Daily News endorses John Kasich in the April 19 Republican primary, first because he would well represent the Republican Party in November (when a contest with Clinton would be welcome) and second because every vote for Kasich is a vote against a recklessly arrogant man who would demean the highest office in the land.Read the full editorial here."

That person should project integrity, policy acumen and compassion.The Republican candidate we think models those traits is Ohio Gov. John Kasich.[...]Kasich argues that he's the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in the November general election, and he's banking on the party coming to its senses at the national convention to be held in his home state in July.Kasich a nine-term congressman, onetime investment banker and two-term governor has a real track record and meaningful political experience. That puts him out of step with Republican Party voters in thrall to Donald Trump's nativism and demagoguery, but positions Kasich well for the general election.Kasich is a policy and social conservative with experience in balancing budgets and making political compromises. He would cut taxes for individuals and businesses; repeal Obamacare and expand Medicaid in its stead; and offer a path to legalization (but not citizenship) for 11.5 million illegal immigrants. He is not ready to write the obituary for American manufacturing and thinks retraining people for jobs that are in demand is the answer to unemployment.[...]Kasich sees two paths forward one dark, one light.

A field that started with 17 hopefuls is down to three, including, fortunately, the most solid candidate in the pack: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Governor Kasich has consistently been the grown-up in the room, taking sober, thoughtful positions while other candidates seemed intent on demonstrating how combative, hawkish, and anti-government they could be, and how far to the extreme right they could go without going completely over the edge.While we disagree with his positions on issues like abortion rights, we see in Governor Kasich a candidate who strives to adhere to his values without being divisive. He's the only one of the three with executive experience in government, and on his watch Ohio's shaky finances have stabilized and the state has seen modest job growth. Though he opposes Obamacare, he was practical enough to take advantage of the program's expansion of Medicaid for the benefit of his constituents' health.[...]Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Cruz is suited to be president, and either would likely lead the party to a crushing defeat this fall. The one hope for Republicans is to deny Mr. Trump the majority of delegates he needs, opening the way for a contested convention at which a more credible, sensible and broadly appealing candidate can emerge. In casting a ballot for Governor Kasich on Tuesday, New York Republicans could lead the party back from the brink.Read the full editorial here."

He balanced Ohio's budget as well, turning a big shortfall into a nice surplus.He's fluent on foreign policy, having served all of his 18 congressional years on the House Armed Services Committee.He also appears to have a heart, at least when it comes to some things: As governor, he broke with his party to accept additional Medicaid funding from Obamacare for the uninsured in his state.[...]Nevertheless, he does see government more as a force for good than an instrument to smite his enemies.

John Kasich,R,p,"April 20, 2016","Press Release - MEMO: The #NeverTrump Strategy for MD, CT, RI, DE and PA","View the PDF (here)To: Interested PartiesFrom: John Weaver, Chief Strategist, Kasich For AmericaRe: The #NeverTrump Strategy for MD, CT, RI, DE and PAThe #NeverTrump movement missed opportunities to take delegates away from Donald Trump in more than half a dozen New York congressional districts last night by not engaging in any serious ways.A repeat effort by #NeverTrump forces on April 26 would put Donald Trump on track to win the nomination on the first ballot.Here's how Trump can still be stopped:MarylandMaryland allocates delegates on a winner-take-all basis statewide and by congressional district. Recent public polling shows Trump leading statewide, but Gov. Kasich is sitting in a strong second place, far ahead of Ted Cruz.Our data show that Trump could lose to Kasich in almost any district but MD-1. He is particularly vulnerable in MD-4 and MD-8 as well as MD-2, MD-3, MD-5, MD-6 and MD-7.A serious effort in Maryland could cut the number of delegates Trump can win by almost half. ConnecticutConnecticut is winner-take-all by congressional district and proportional over 20% statewide if no candidate reaches 50%. Current public polling has Trump at 49% statewide with John Kasich showing a strong second place. Internal data show Kasich can top Trump in CT-1, CT-2, CT-4 and CT-5.Keeping Trump under 50% statewide is critical. A serious #NeverTrump effort in Connecticut could cost Trump close to half the delegates here too. Rhode IslandRhode Island is proportional with a 10% threshold both statewide and by congressional district. Keeping Trump's margins down could cost him at least half a dozen delegates. DelawareDelaware will award all 16 of its delegates if a candidate receives a plurality of the vote. We expect Trump to have a strong chance of finishing above 50% and would recommend spending resources on the other April 26th states. PennsylvaniaSeventeen of Pennsylvania's delegates are bound to the winner, who we expect to again be Donald Trump. The remaining 54 are unbound but assigned by congressional districts. We expect to be competitive, but more importantly, we're focused on supporting delegate candidates who will work at the convention to nominate the most electable candidate in the fall.Bottom-line: Donald Trump's win in New York got him closer to 1,237 delegates and if the #StopTrump movement is serious about stopping him, they should follow this roadmap leading up to the Tuesday, April 26th primaries."

It's been both a humbling and awe-inspiring experience.I've seen this truth lived out again and again in the Jewish community, and in this time around Passover, I'm reminded that God uses ordinary people to show mercy and justice to those who live in the shadows.I recently visited Shema Kolainu, a school in Brooklyn where children know they're cared about and respected. This unique school offers an environment that nurtures young Orthodox boys and girls who have autism and other special learning challenges.The Jewish tradition, which brings such great strength to America, teaches from an early age to live life dedicated to helping others. You learn to be the hands and feet of a God who hears the cries of those who suffer like he heard the cries of His people when they suffered in Egypt. Passover commemorates when the Jewish people escaped slavery in Egypt and celebrates the exodus of God's people to a life of freedom in the Promised Land.In New York and in my home state of Ohio, I've met so many Jewish people who choose to live their lives in pursuit of helping the hungry, the poor, the sick, and other souls who are suffering.To read the full op-ed, click here."

They can send a message. And if the message is, We want a shot at putting Pennsylvania in the red column in November, their choice is clear: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Start with experience. As governor since 2011, the 63-year-old Western Pennsylvania native has more time as an executive than his two GOP opponents combined  the kind in which you can't fire someone because you didn't get your way. He was also a state senator and served 18 years in Congress. On the House Armed Services Committee, he was a strong supporter of President Ronald Reagan's foreign policy. As chairman of the House Budget Committee in the '90s, he was part of the leadership team that helped produce balanced budgets. The lesson? A divided government need not be a gridlocked one.He brought that sense of fiscal responsibility and emphasis on collaboration to the executive mansion in Ohio, turning budget deficits into surpluses and holding the line on taxes  but not at the expense of those who rely on a government safety net to get by.Read the full editorial here."

John Kasich,R,p,"April 24, 2016","Press Release - In Pennsylvania, the Lewistown Sentinel Endorses John Kasich","Lewistown SentinelApril 23, 2016Looking at the current field of Republican presidential candidates, it's pretty clear that only one man has the desired background, both as an executive and as a legislator, to uniquely qualify him to be the leader of our nation and that man is John Kasich.Kasich spent 18 years as a member of Congress, serving on the Armed Forces Committee that entire time. He also chaired the House Budget Committee for six years during which time the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was passed with his input and support.Kasich then decided to get out of politics for a while, venturing into business and political commentary on TV before the urge to serve his fellow citizens came calling again.He successfully ran for governor of Ohio, defeating an incumbent Democrat. Kasich wasted little time and even less money, eventually turning a deficit of anywhere between $6 billion and $8 billion into a $2 billion surplus for the Buckeye State, all while cutting income taxes.Kasich has proven himself to be a problem-solver at a time our country needs one most. He's not afraid to buck the Republican leadership if he thinks doing so puts America first. He has the experience as both a legislator and an executive to help bridge the ever-widening canyon between the White House and the Capitol and make the federal government work for the American people once again.And he is the only candidate in either party who has consistently shown a temperament befitting a president, not to mention the fact that polls consistently show Kasich has the best chance of keeping Hillary Clinton from winning this fall, thereby preventing a de facto third term for Obama.Our country needs a uniter, not a divider. We need an experienced leader, not another freshman senator nor someone who has never before held public office.John Kasich is simply the best man to bring this country together and lead us forward. For that reason, we endorse him as the Republican nominee for president.Read the full editorial here."
John Kasich,R,p,"April 25, 2016",Press Release - Kasich Campaign Statement on Upcoming Primaries,"Tonight, Kasich for America chief strategist John Weaver issued the following statement:""Donald Trump doesn't have the support of a majority of Republicans  not even close, but he currently does have almost half the delegates because he's benefited from the existing primary system.Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the Party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.We believe that will be John Kasich, who is the only candidate who can defeat Secretary Clinton and preserve our GOP majority in the Congress.Due to the fact that the Indiana primary is winner-take-all statewide and by congressional district, keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1237 bound delegates before Cleveland. We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign's resources West and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.In turn, we will focus our time and resources in New Mexico and Oregon, both areas that are structurally similar to the Northeast politically, where Gov. Kasich is performing well. We would expect independent third-party groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns.We expect to compete with both the Trump and Cruz campaigns in the remaining primary states."""
John Kasich,R,p,"April 25, 2016",Press Release - The Baltimore Sun Endorses John Kasich,"Baltimore Sun[C]ompared to Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, neither of whom has come close to demonstrating the skills or the temperament to serve as leader of the free world, Mr. Kasich has offered genuine statesmanship  if only by refusing to wallow in the trough of name-calling and extremism that has so captured his opponents. It should come as no surprise that polls have consistently shown that Mr. Kasich has a better chance of winning in November than the vulgarian New York developer with a frighteningly poor grasp of foreign policy or the Princeton debater and preposterous Ronald Reagan poseur with a demonstrated inability to work with others, Democratic or Republican, and who promises more of the same if elected.Maryland GOP voters who believe supporting Mr. Trump is a clear and loud refutation of the Republican establishment ought to think again. Suffering such a potential embarrassment of a national candidate at the top of the ticket could not only doom the party's Senate majority, it might even tip the balance in the House, not to mention hand the White House to Hillary Clinton, who has all but wrapped up the Democratic nomination. If conservatives think Congressional Republicans failed to block President Barack Obama, imagine what happens after the party so foolishly sacrifices most of its potential influence.That Governor Hogan has stayed out of the presidential racesince the departure of his friend and mentor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, speaks volumes. He knows what it takes to cross party lines and that the top two vote-getters are fundamentally ill-equipped to get the job done. Mr. Kasich comes closest, and he gets our endorsement.Read the full editorial here."

He was re-elected to a second term in 2014 in a landslide vote, winning with a lead of 30 percentage points.On the top issues in the 2016 debates, Kasich, the grandson of an immigrant, is the sole Republican candidate to be open to a path for immigrants to stay legally in the country. The other two remaining Republican candidates, Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Ted Cruz, are extremists on the important topic of immigration.

He is a unique threat to the Republican Party and to the country. The party should reject him as a nominee, using any and all legitimate means to do so. Principled Republicans must make a concerted stand in Indiana and California, the two states left to vote that could keep Mr. Trump short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination. As long as there is opportunity to resist his rise, those who recognize what he is must take it. This is not because beating Mr. Trump is a likely outcome. It is because, morally, there is no other option. New math does not change the ethical calculation.Mr. Trump degrades people, serially insulting women, Latinos, Muslims, immigrants, Jews and others. He erodes the discourse, frequently and flagrantly lying about things such as whether ""scores"" of terrorists have recently entered the United States as migrants  one of numerous false claims he made in a speech on foreign policy Wednesday. He proposes undermining foundational civic institutions such as the free press. He shows contempt for the separation of powers by threatening the speaker of the House. Where his policy agenda is not thin, it is scary, such as his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In short, he should inspire fear that someone so lacking in judgment and restraint could acquire the powers of the presidency.Read the full editorial here."

John Kasich,R,p,"May 3, 2016",Press Release - What's Next,"Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich's campaign plans. Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention. The comments from Trump, on the verge of winning in Indiana, heighten the differences between Governor Kasich and his positive, inclusive approach and the disrespectful ramblings from Donald Trump.Prior to tonight's primary, the Kasich campaign had already secured a large plurality of Indiana delegates committed to Governor Kasich at a multi-ballot convention as part of the pre-primary delegate selection process.The Indianapolis Star wrote about our success two weeks ago. You can read about it (here).Gov. Kasich will remain in the race unless a candidate reaches 1,237 bound delegates before the Convention.Here's why:I. Gov. Kasich remains the candidate best positioned to win a contested convention.A plurality of Trump delegates will support him after the first ballot.He can unite the Party better than anyone else. Trump's cynical sowing of division will render the GOP into angry, irrelevant status for decades.II. Gov. Kasich is the only Republican who can win in November.Delegates want to win in November, and only Gov. Kasich can defeat Hillary Clinton. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average Clinton leads Trump by more than 6 points on average. Meanwhile, Gov. Kasich leads Clinton by over 7 points. A Trump nomination means the end of a Republican Congress and scores of local, legislative and state constitutional offices will be lost for a generation.III. Gov. Kasich offers Republicans and Americans a refreshing choice of hope, inclusion and conservative reform.Nearly 60 percent of GOP voters have voted for a candidate other than Donald Trump. Republican primary voters deserve to have a choice in the remaining contests and we intend to forcefully give them one. Americans overwhelmingly want to vote for Governor Kasich in a general election. A detailed analysis of the Electoral College confirms Governor Kasich is the only one who can win. Both Trump and Cruz would lose to Clinton by considerable margins in a head-to-head race, winning just 210 and 206 Electoral College votes, respectively. By contrast, Kasich comfortably defeats Clinton, racking up 304 Electoral College votes to her 234. Read the full analysis (here).IV. The future of the Republican Party and America is at stake. Gov. Kasich will not simply give up.The Mad Hatter Gibberish pushed by Trump during the primary would weaken America. His proposals would divide us, put American workers in the unemployment line and put our national security at risk. And a Clinton presidency would be at least four more years of international drift, a liberal Supreme Court, and more big government at the expense of job creators, entrepreneurs and families.V. Gov. Kasich has the experience, vision and leadership abilities needed in our next President.A Kasich Presidency means a conservative Supreme Court; the return of money, power and influence to the states; a balanced budget and tax reduction, unleashing job creators; faith that our nation's challenges can be solved by families and local communities; and a White House that prioritizes doing what's right over what's political expedient.This is the stark choice that confronts Republicans between now and when a nominee is chosen in Cleveland. Gov. Kasich looks forward to continuing to compete with Donald Trump in the upcoming primaries through California on June 7th."
