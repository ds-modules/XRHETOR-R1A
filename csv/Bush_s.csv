Jeb Bush,R,s,"June 17, 2015",b'Statement by Jeb Bush on the Tragic Charleston Shootings',"b'Miami, FL - Governor Jeb Bush released the following statement in response to the tragic shootings in Charleston, South Carolina.""Columba and I mourn today with the Emanuel AME Church and the families of the victims of this terrible crime. Our hearts are broken at the senseless loss of life. Our prayers are for the community that has lost its pastor and a brave leader. May the families and the city of Charleston be lifted up by the prayers of our entire nation.""'"
Jeb Bush,R,s,"June 26, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on Today's Supreme Court Decision on Same-Sex Marriage""","b'""Guided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage. I believe the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision. I also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments. In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate.""'"
Jeb Bush,R,s,"July 1, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on President Obama's Decision to Re-Open U.S. Embassy in Cuba""","b'Governor Jeb Bush released the following statement in response to President Obama\'s decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.""As Americans prepare to celebrate the anniversary of our freedom from tyranny and commit anew to the democratic principles on which our nation was founded, it is no small irony that President Obama prepares to open an Embassy in Havana, further legitimizing the brutal Castro regime.""I oppose the decision to further embrace the Castro regime by opening an embassy in Havana. The real test of the Obama Administration\'s rapprochement with the Castro regime in Cuba is not whether President Obama\'s legacy is burnished with dubious diplomatic achievements and photo-ops, but whether improved relations between Havana and Washington advance the cause of human rights and freedom for the Cuban people. The ongoing detention of dissidents and continued human rights abuses suggest the Administration\'s policy is failing this test.""I hope the U.S. Congress will scrutinize the concessions made to Havana prior to considering any ambassador.""'"
Jeb Bush,R,s,"July 14, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on the Obama Administration's Nuclear Deal with Iran""","b'The nuclear agreement announced by the Obama Administration today is a dangerous, deeply flawed, and short sighted deal.A comprehensive agreement should require Iran to verifiably abandon  not simply delay  its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.Based on initial reports and analysis, it appears this agreement does not ""cut off all of Iran\'s pathways to a nuclear weapon""  in fact, over time it paves Iran\'s path to a bomb. Most of the key restrictions last for only 10 to 15 years. Even before the deal expires, it could allow Iran to develop an industrial-scale enrichment program and continue its R&D; on advanced centrifuges and development of an ICBM.The deal does not require Iran to come completely clean up front about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program or include true anytime/anywhere inspections necessary for a nuclear program shrouded in deception and lies.President Obama has acknowledged the agreement would end the United Nations\' conventional arms embargo, a critical tool to combat Iran\'s support for terrorism and destabilizing activities in the region.The deal would provide more than $100 billion in sanctions relief that will breathe new life into Iran\'s malevolent and corrupt regime, enabling its projection of terror and power as well as its repression of the Iranian people  who aspire for, and deserve, a more democratic future.The clerical leaders in Tehran routinely preach ""death to America"" and ""death to Israel""  and through their acts of terror, they mean it. We must take these threats seriously and should not base any agreements on the hope their behavior will moderate over time.The people of Iran, the region, Israel, America, and the world deserve better than a deal that consolidates the grip on power of the violent revolutionary clerics who rule Tehran with an iron fist.This isn\'t diplomacy  it is appeasement.'"
Jeb Bush,R,s,"July 31, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on Hillary Clinton's Endorsement of Ending Cuban Embargo""","b""It's insulting to many residents of Miami for Hillary Clinton to come here to endorse a retreat in the struggle for democracy in Cuba. This city has become a home and a refuge to thousands and thousands of Castro's victims. Secretary Clinton's call to abandon the embargo  and the principles of democracy and freedom for the Cuban people  in exchange for nothing in return from the regime in Havana adds insult to the pain they and their families feel.The American people deserve principled leaders who will stand up to our adversaries and stand up for our values. Secretary Clinton's politically expedient embrace of President Obama's unilateral concessions to Cuba makes clear she will do neither.The Obama-Clinton policy is rooted in a false narrative that paints the embargo as a relic of the Cold War. They claim to want to free Cuba from the past, but they misunderstand the present. The Cuban people are not imprisoned by the past, they are imprisoned by the Castro regime.Americans, especially our government officials, should listen to the stifled voices of Cuban dissidents who languish in prison or are harassed by Castro's security services, rather than mouthpieces of the Castro regime.Hillary Clinton had it right when she once said  consistent with the law of the land  that removing the embargo should come only when Cuba is on the path to democracy. She has abandoned that principled position, and with it she has abandoned the people of Cuba who aspire at long last to experience a free and democratic society.I long for the day when the Cuban people are free from oppression and free to choose their own leaders, and, if elected President, I will be committed to helping them achieve that long-denied liberty."""
Jeb Bush,R,s,"August 2, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on Obama's Clean Power Plan""","b""President Obama's Carbon Rule is irresponsible and overreaching. The rule runs over state governments, will throw countless people out of work, and increases everyone's energy prices.The fact is, U.S. emissions of greenhouse gasses are down to the same levels emitted in the mid-1990s, even though we have 50 million more people. A chief reason for this success is the energy revolution which was created by American ingenuity  not federal regulations.Climate change will not be solved by grabbing power from states or slowly hollowing out our economy. The real challenge is how do we grow and prosper in order to foster more game-changing innovations and give us the resources we need to solve problems like this one. Jeb talked about the carbon rule with Politico's Mike Allen at the Freedom Partners Policy Leaders Forum:"""
Jeb Bush,R,s,"August 4, 2015",b'Statement by Jeb Bush on Federal Funding for Planned Parenthood',"b'""With regards to women\'s health funding broadly, I misspoke, as there are countless community health centers, rural clinics, and other women\'s health organizations that need to be fully funded. They provide critical services to all, but particularly low-income women who don\'t have the access they need.""I was referring to the hard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood  an organization that was callously participating in the unthinkable practice of selling fetal organs. Democrats and Republicans agree we absolutely must defund them and redirect those funds to other women\'s health organizations.""Dr. Rhonda Medows issued the following statement regarding Gov. Bush\'s record on women\'s health. She was the Secretary of AHCA for Gov. Bush in Florida. She is currently a Executive Vice President of Population Health and Providence Health Services and practiced medicine at the Mayo Clinic and is board certified in family medicine.""As a former Secretary of AHCA for Governor Bush, I watched his dedication to women\'s health issues and services first hand. He created and championed the Mary Brogan Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Act to provide screening, diagnosis, and treatment for breast and cervical cancer, he was intent on improving the quality of care offered to women under our state health programs, and he enhanced access to vital services to women through new access points.""BackgroundBush Proposed Millions On Crisis Pregnancy Centers Which Received A $4 Million Launch And $2 Million A Year For The Rest Of His Tenure.

Jeb Bush,R,s,"August 10, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush on Hillary Clinton's Fiscally Irresponsible Higher Education Proposal""","b""This irresponsible proposal would raise taxes, increase government debt, and double-down on the failed Obama economic policies that have led to a 'new normal' of sluggish economic growth, rising college costs spurred by Washington, and limited opportunities for all Americans  including recent college graduates.We don't need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers. We need to change the incentives for colleges with fresh policies that result in more individualization and choices, drive down overall costs, and improve the value of a college degree, which will help lead to real, sustained four-percent economic growth.We also need additional pro-growth economic policies that will give more college graduates the opportunity to achieve earned success rather than continuing down the path of declining workforce participation and access to jobs."""
Jeb Bush,R,s,"August 14, 2015","b""Statement by Jeb Bush Secretary Kerry's Visit to Havana, Cuba""","b'Governor Jeb Bush released the following statement, regarding Secretary Kerry\'s visit to Havana, Cuba.""Secretary of State John Kerry\'s visit to Havana is a birthday present for Fidel Castro  a symbol of the Obama Administration\'s acquiescence to his ruthless legacy. U.S. policy has changed, but Cuba has not. It remains an unyielding dictatorship, a tragic example of the folly of communism, and an affront to the conscience of the free nations of the Western Hemisphere.""The accommodation of the Castro regime comes at the expense of the freedom and democracy that all Cubans deserve, but Secretary Kerry\'s visit is especially insulting for Cuba\'s dissidents. That courageous Cubans whose only crime is to speak out for freedom and democracy will be kept away from the official ceremony opening the U.S. Embassy is yet another concession to the Castros.""We need an American president who will work in solidarity with a free Cuban people, if I am elected President, I will reverse Obama\'s strategy of accommodation and appeasement and commit to helping the Cuban people claim their freedom and determine their future, free from tyranny. Standing up for fundamental human rights and democratic values should not be an afterthought to America\'s Cuba policy, it should be its guiding principle.""'"

This afternoon at Mass, Columba and I prayed for Justice Scalia, who was devout infaith and has been brought home to God in heaven. Our prayers are alsowith his wife, Maureen, his children and his 28 grandchildren.Justice Scalia was a brilliant defender of the rule of lawhis logic andwit were unparalleled, and his decisions were models of clarity and goodsense. I often said he was my favorite justice, because he took theConstitution, and the responsibility of judges to interpret it correctly,with the utmost seriousness. Now it is up to all of us to fight for the principlesJustice Scalia espoused and carry forth his legacy.""'"
