Mike Huckabee,R,s,"November 28, 2007",b'Statement by Mike Huckabee on Latest Polls - New Rasmussen Poll Shows Huckabee Ahead of Romney in Iowa',"b'Little Rock, AR -- Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee issued the following comment today in response to recent polls showing growing momentum in Iowa and nationally:""The numbers show we are climbing, especially in Iowa, but also nationally. The latest Florida poll indicates this is more than a one-state play.The more we get attacked, the more our numbers soar. This just proves that when you get kicked in the rear, you\'re really the one out front.Despite what the pundits have said, there\'s no substitute for message --and the voters know it.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 4, 2007",b'Statement By Mike Huckabee On National Security And Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility',"b'""The men and women of our Armed Forces have served and acted honorably in their duties at Guantanamo Bay and we greatly appreciate their service in keeping our nation free, safe and secure. I have visited Guantanamo Bay and know that the detainees are more than adequately cared for. My concern is that the facility has become a distraction from our Global War on Terror. Other facilities, like Fort Leavenworth, can serve the same purpose without the controversy. As for specific procedures concerning detainee adjudication, like all Americans, I await the Supreme Court\'s ruling in the Boumediene case, which will determine if detainees have habeas corpus rights. As President, my overriding concern in dealing with the suspected terrorists will always be our national security interests. As I stated in June, my first priority will be the protection of the American people and ensuring that all suspected terrorists remain in our custody.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 10, 2007",b'Statement By Gov. Huckabee On The Colorado Shootings',"b'Dallas, Texas -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee issued the following statement today: ""The shootings in Colorado were horrific. Janet and I want to extend our thoughts and prayers -- first and foremost, to the victims and their families, as well as to all of those whose lives were touched by this needless tragedy. I want to also commend Security Guard Jeanne Assam for her bravery and act of heroism. Ms. Assam\'s statements that she was guided by the Holy Spirit, in the face of great danger, are inspiring and remind us of what we mere mortals can achieve when we allow ourselves to be instruments of our Creator. Now is the time for healing. May God bless those who were affected by this tragedy, and our great nation.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"February 19, 2008","b""Statement by Mike Huckabee on Fidel Castro's Resignation""","b'Little Rock, AR -- Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has issued the following statement in response to the resignation of Cuban President Fidel Castro:""The Cuban people deserve nothing less than free and fair elections which would provide the only hope for a prosperous and democratic Cuba. Until Fidel Castro is dead there can be no significant movement towards reform in Cuba. Raul Castro has proven that he\'s as much a tyrant and dictator as his brother Fidel. Simply providing more power to another dictator does nothing to promote freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 18, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee on the Congressional Budget Deal',"b""This 2000-page, $1.1 trillion budget deal is a disgusting mess and Republicans got nothing. It's a handout to potential terrorists, illegal immigrants, Planned Parenthood, ObamaCare beneficiaries, lobbyists and liberals. Congress is stabbing the American people in the back, yet some Republicans have the nerve to call it a back massage.Why would Republicans vote to fund amnesty, Obama's refugee program and the nuclear deal with Iran? Why would Republicans support a $1.6 billion earmark to resettle illegal immigrants and increase funding for the IRS by $250 million? Why would Republicans increase the foreign worker visa program by 400 percent, steal blue collar jobs from Americans, and drive American wages lower than the Dead Sea?You'd think our government would put Americans first, but Washington is putting Americans last."""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 19, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee on the Democratic Candidates Debate',"b'As Americans went to theaters to see the newest installment of ""Star Wars"", many turned on their TVs tonight and saw the newest installment of the Democrat Party\'s ""Socialist Wars"". The Democrat debate was nothing but a battle to see who could get the farthest left first.From free college and government gun control, to healthcare handouts, higher taxes and free rides for everyone, it is like they came up with these ideas in a galaxy far, far away. It does not take the mind of a Jedi to figure out the dollars and cents on these proposals don\'t add up for a country almost 20 trillion dollars in debt.Our country needs a fresh start - not another sequel to the last eight years of Barack Obama. It is time we put Americans first - American workers, American jobs, and American families - not the same failed liberal ideology that got us here in the first place.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 23, 2015","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""The Issues of Faith and Family Are Non-Negotiable""'","b""Conservatives are being asked to 'coalesce' around yet another corporately-funded candidate that says something very different at a big donor fundraiser in Manhattan than at a church in Marshalltown. Shouldn't a candidate be expected to have authenticity and consistency, instead of having to look at a map to decide what to believe and what to say?One reason I do respect Trump is that whether you agree with him or not, he doesn't pretend with his principles or change his message depending on his location or audience. If issues like marriage and the sanctity of life are truly issues of principle and not just politics, then there should not be geographical boundaries to what is right and wrong.As the campaign continues you're going to continue to see reports of candidates who say one thing in private and another to the public -- all in an effort to win at all costs. However I will remain steadfast in my positions, particularly on the non-negotiable issues of faith and family."""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 28, 2015","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""They Asked Me To Shut Up""'","b""I could have shut up about life and marriage. Big money donors wanted me to shut up but I didn't. I lost their support but I didn't lose my soul.I don't wake up each morning and wonder which Mike Huckabee I am going to be. I don't have two sets of views depending on who I am speaking to.I am staunchly pro-life and pro-marriage. As President, I am not going to leave these issues up to the states. I am going to fight for federal laws to end abortion and protect traditional marriage. I will end Planned Parenthood's federal funding as fast as I am going to tear down the IRS with the FairTax.If that's the kind of President you want in office then I urge you to get involved in my campaign today.Knowing I have your support as we head into the final weeks before the Iowa caucus will make all of the difference in the world."""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 29, 2015","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""Underestimated""'","b""Team,As a poor kid growing up in south Arkansas, the odds were always against me, so hard work is all I know.Frankly, if the odds aren't against me, I usually look around and ask myself am I in the right place?So when the media tries to paint this final sprint as a race between two candidates, or when the media began restricting the number of people on the debate stage, I laughed and thought I've seen this story before.When I ran for office in Arkansas, I was underestimated every time. When I fought the most Democrat legislature in the country and passed big conservative reforms, the local press and quite a few politicians in my own party, said I could never do it. I did.I was underestimated again when I took on entrenched corruption in my state and put corrupt politicians in jail. In Bill Clinton's Arkansas, well that just wasn't done. The Democrat party was a well-oiled machine and they had been running the state for decades!I am writing all of this to you now, because I don't buy the line of bull the media is shoveling down voters' throats in Iowa and elsewhere. I was told I couldn't win the Iowa caucus in 2008 because I was outspent and out maneuvered by the big Washington campaigns of my rivals. Well I won and I bet if I asked Rick Santorum he'd say the same thing about his 2012 caucus win in Iowa.That's why I'm confident that with God's help and the help of American people we can mount a comeback in Iowa, win the presidency and finally have real conservative leadership that puts Americans first.Remember the media has a short memory and a bad habit of trying to pick winners and losers. So hang in there and get ready for a big fight. Because we are going to shock the pundits on February 1 and ride our momentum all of the way to the White House!"""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"December 31, 2015","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""100 P-E-R-C-E-N-T""'","b'I am preparing for a kickoff of our ""Americans First"" tour in Iowa on Saturday. As I get ready, I wanted to share some important stats with you about Iowa, so you can understand what we have been building for.Since we began our campaign in May we have held 125 grassroots events in Iowa alone! Looking ahead to January we have scheduled over 150 events and we are still adding events every day!Our Iowa grassroots team made over 20,000 volunteer calls in the month of December. 20,000! We have over 300 volunteer county leaders PLUS we will have 25 full time staff in Iowa in January and a growing number of part time staff PLUS we have dozens of volunteers coming in from all over the country.So what does all of that mean?We are 100% committed to winning Iowa .'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"January 1, 2016","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""My New Year\'s Resolutions""'","b'I resolve that the next time a Silicon Valley billionaire or an A-list Hollywood star praises socialism, I will suggest that he give half his money to me.I resolve to offer a warm, reassuring hug to anyone traumatized by any non-P.C. comments I might make, but at the same time not to provide any ""safe space"" from the First Amendment.I resolve to get through the final year of Obama\'s assault on freedom with the confidence that we can stop it and turn it around.I resolve to keep pointing out that all those climate change conferences involving dozens of fuel-guzzling private jets flying to far-flung luxury destinations could easily be conducted via Skype.And, seriously: I resolve to keep bringing up the shameful treatment of our veterans every chance I get until we have an administration that treats them as the heroes they are!'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"January 2, 2016","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""Do You Feel Lucky?""'","b'To those who actually believe Obama\'s idea of gun control is something that could keep us safer, I have --- at the risk of sounding like Clint Eastwood --- one question:Do you feel lucky?Do you feel lucky when Obama\'s deadly combination of loose immigration and tight limitations on self-defense makes violence more likely?Do you feel lucky when Obama takes aim at law abiding gun owners, guns & the Second Amendment rather than the real problems: mental health, open borders, homeland terrorism, and the breakdown of families and communities?Do you feel lucky when you know that gun laws apply only to the ones who abide by the law already and NOT criminals who couldn\'t care less?Do you feel lucky when Obama insists on dividing Americans into two groups: 1) the powerful gun lobby, and 2) the rest of us, presumably on his side? Plenty of us are just law-abiding citizens who don\'t agree with him and who would like to be able defend our homes and family and exercise the Constitutional right of owning a gun.Do you feel lucky when Obama says it\'s ""insane"" that people on the no-fly list can buy guns, when we know the problem is with the mistake-ridden no-fly list?Do you feel lucky when California has in place the kind of gun control provisions Obama wants in every state, yet they failed to stop terrorism in San Bernardino?So, do you feel lucky? With Obama still in the White House, terrorism is growingand we need all the guns we can get. We can\'t stop him from using executive orders during his waning presidency to implement his futile ideas, but we can, figuratively speaking, give those ideas both barrels, shoot them full of holes and, with the next election, stop them in their tracks and attack the problem of gun violence in a way that makes sense.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"January 2, 2016",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee on the Death of Senator Dale Bumpers',"b""Janet and I were deeply saddened by the news of Senator Bumpers' death. I first knew him as a political opponent and I must confess he beat me like a drum. Later, when I became Governor and he was the Senior Senator we worked very well together. Senator Bumpers was extremely helpful to the state and to me personally. His distinguished service to his country in the Marine Corps, to his state as a Governor and Senator is a legacy of which his family can be justly proud. Our political differences aside, he was a dedicated public servant who always reminded his audiences that 'public service is a noble calling.' His wife Betty is also a proud public servant who was a strong ally of Janet's efforts to promote childhood immunizations and renovate the Governor's mansion. Betty and the family are in our prayers."""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"January 12, 2016",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee on the State of the Union Address',"b'DES MOINES, Iowa- Gov. Mike Huckabee released the following statement in response to the President\'s State of the Union address:""Obama\'s endless excuses are out-of-control and Americans have had enough. He pats himself on the back for giving us an Affordable Care Act no one can afford. He glows and grins about an economy that\'s punching millions of Americans in the gut. And he refuses to accept an ounce of responsibility for his epic foreign policy disasters. Set aside our Union, Obama\'s mind is in a state of confusion, delusion and decay.""It\'s time we stop bankrupting Social Security, Medicare and our childrens\' future and start acting like the United States. It\'s time we quit making excuses for radical Islam, attacking Christians and apologizing for being Americans. I\'m running for President to burn down the corrupt Washington political machine and put Americans first.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"February 1, 2016",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities',b'I am officially suspending my campaign. Thank you for all of your loyal support.'
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"February 1, 2016","b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: ""I Will Never Apologize for My Faith in Jesus Christ""'","b""We've abandoned the building blocks of civilization. Life, marriage and family issues aren't bargaining chips or political considerations. They are moral issues.I will never apologize for my faith in Jesus Christ, my convictions or my values. Period.Life begins at conception. This isn't just a Biblical view  it's affirmed by modern science and every unique human DNA schedule, which is present at conception.As Governor, I promoted and signed a fetal protection act. I imposed a ban on partial birth abortion, established waiting periods, created parental notification requirements, and passed a bill so mothers who brought a newborn to a hospital or fire station would not be prosecuted for child abandonment.I may stand alone, but I am absolutely faithful to the issue of marriage. Not because it's politically expedient, but because it's the Biblical position, the historical position and the right position. We must defend, protect and preserve traditional marriage.Conviction, moral clarity and integrity matters, and the people of Iowa know I will never say one thing in Marshalltown, Iowa and another in Manhattan.Our grassroots team of Iowa families, farmers, teachers, activists and volunteers is energized and excited for victory on caucus night."""
Mike Huckabee,R,s,"February 2, 2016",b'Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee on Suspension of Campaign Activities',"b""Dear loyal friends and supporters:We live in the greatest country on earth and I ran for President because I wanted to make it better for my 5 grandkids. I have no regrets about the effort because it's never our responsibility to determine the results, but to be faithful to the task before us. I have suspended my campaign, but not my desire to see America protect all human life, reward those who work hard, and give our veterans and seniors what they have paid the price to earn.I am blessed with an incredibly supportive wife and family who never wavered in their confidence in me. Our campaign staff was amazingthey gave it their all with competence, compassion, and a spirit of teamwork that I will forever cherish. Our effort didn't fall short due to lack of effort and expertise from our team. And our volunteers every day were stunning and beyond belief in their efforts. On days when I was exhausted and getting hammered by polls, idiotic media questions, or long car rides, I would read a post on FB from one of our supporters or get a letter from a donor that gave me fresh energy and determination.While I truly wish the results were different, I would rather lose with honor than win without it. Thank you so much for your prayers, your sacrifices of time and money, and your tireless efforts for our campaign.Rumors abound that I'm getting ready to endorse someone, but those rumors are totally untrue. While I may eventually support one of the candidates, right now I have a lot of things to do in wrapping up the loose ends of the campaign, trying to figure out my next chapter of life, and spending some time with my dogs who probably wonder if I had abandoned them. (I haven't!)I love you guys, and want to stay in touch. I am eternally grateful for you!With gratitude and great respect,Mike Huckabee"""
