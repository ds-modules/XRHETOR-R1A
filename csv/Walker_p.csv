Scott Walker,R,p,"July 15, 2015",b'Press Release - Matt and Alex From the Road: Announcement Day',"b""On our first day of travel, I want to take an opportunity to share with you the whirlwind that has been the last 24 hours. We started out our day practicing our remarks, while Dad met with several reporters. Alex and I had a lot of friends coming to join us for the big announcement, so it felt like we were pulling out our phones about once every thirty seconds to make sure they were able to get in to the Expo Center.About midday, our family got together to get lunch one last time before the event. Mom, Dad, Alex and I were joined by my grandparents Llew and Pat, my Uncle David, Aunt Maria, and their daughters Isabella and Eva. For me, it was good to just sit down with my family and get my mind off of everything going on for a little while. Not only was it great to see family, but it was great to see my grandpa Llew in such great health too.My nieces are with me as we look at the stage for tomorrow night! #Walker16 - SKW pic.twitter.com/MtsEj3BWB7  Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 13, 2015After lunch, we all rushed over to the Expo Center to do a walk-through of the program. Alex and I got the opportunity to practice our remarks to an almost empty room while a few folks from the staff listened in. It's always a little strange to hear yourself speaking over the speaker system to an empty room. Once we finished practicing, Alex, David and I did a quick interview and then dashed back to the hotel to get changed.Alex and I had to hurry to change and then we headed right back to the Expo Center to begin introducing the speakers who were before our Mom and Dad. Once we got back and the room was packed with supporters, it all began to get so much more real. At that moment, I became overwhelmed with emotion and nerves at the same time. For the longest time the announcement just seemed like an idea in the distant future, but seeing the energy in the room woke me up and helped me realize that the day was actually here.Alex and I had to hurry to change and then we headed right back to the Expo Center to begin introducing the speakers who were before our Mom and Dad.

I thought his remarks showed the American people who he was and outlined his vision going for our country going forward. I'm proud of all he has accomplished and cannot wait to see what he will do going forward.Scott Walker just announced that he's running for President of the United States! #Walker16 pic.twitter.com/XEvM92Ev8Q  Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 13, 2015After wrapping up his remarks, we went around and greeted supporters in the crowd. These guests in the front were fired up and ready to go. I loved their enthusiasm and many folks were excited to share how fat they had driven to be at the announcement.It truly was an amazing event and I have to give a shout out to Matt Hall, Director of Operations, and his team for the hours they put into this announcement event.After the event Alex and I waited in the back while our dad sat down with Sean Hannity. We needed to get out of the Expo Center for a bit, because it was way too hot! It was one of the hottest days in Wisconsin this summer and the packed room only made it worse. They even had us cool off in a walk-in cooler in the back with Dad after he finished up his speech.Expo Center was so hot I went into the cooler & sat on a keg of Miller Lite! -SW #Walker16 pic.twitter.com/pl7YQGQh6i  Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 14, 2015Next, we headed over to the hotel to join family members and supporters for a late dinner.

Mom and Dad again addressed the crowd and then we called it a night.Today, we got up early and are headed for Nevada. This is just the first of many stops ahead of us on the announcement tour.

O\'Brien, a Senior Adviser to Governor Scott Walker and a former US Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, made the following statement on the need to terminate Obama\'s bad deal with Iran:""The next president must terminate this disastrous deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran on Day 1, as Governor Walker has repeatedly pledged to do. In fact, the process of undoing this deal begins right now. We don\'t need more information, we don\'t need to wait to confirm the next Secretary of State, we need decisive leadership and we need it now. This won\'t be easy, but when America leads, and has a strong president with clear priorities who believes in American strength, the rest of the world will follow.""At stake is our safety and the safety of our closest allies, especially Israel. We cannot delay. President Obama is trying to force his successor to swallow his bad deal at the same time he is showing complete disdain for the policies of his predecessors. For the last 36 years, every American President has organized their Middle East policy around challenging Iran\'s revolutionary regime. President Obama has reversed that policy, without support from Congress or the country. If Governor Walker is elected, America\'s policy will be to support our friends and stand up to our enemies. Irana regime that chants ""Death to America"" and wants to wipe Israel off the mapis our enemy whether Barack Obama realizes it or not.""'"

The exchange is below:Keck: First things first, what is your reaction to the recently announced Iran nuclear deal? Do you really intend to terminate it on your first day in office?Walker: The Iran deal is a terrible agreement that will be remembered as one of the biggest diplomatic disasters in U.S. history. It is a threat to our safety and the safety of our closest allies, especially Israel. It gives an American stamp of approval to the Iranian nuclear program, undermines the principle of nonproliferation across the globe, lifts the conventional arms and ballistic missile embargoes on Iran, and provides a signing bonus of around $150 billion to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Seeing this bad deal and President Obama's lack of resolve, our allies are now taking matters into their own hands. That's why I've said this deal is the starting pistol in a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race and will actually make war with Iran more likely, not less.Iran's Supreme Leader should know that a future American president will not be bound by this dangerous agreement. As president, I will terminate the deal on day one by immediately re-imposing sanctions against Iran, working with Congress to impose new crippling sanctions, and convincing our allies to do the same. This will not be an easy task, but given how bad this deal is, we cannot delay. When America truly leads and works with our allies, we can negotiate with Iran from a position of strength, prevent the regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and roll back Tehran's influence across the Middle East.Read more..."""

If elected president, I would terminate the deal on day one.Now is no time to hesitate. Congress should vote against this disaster, and all Republicans and Democrats should repudiate it.But President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other defenders of the deal are pulling out all the stops to keep it in place. Despite the obvious harm the agreement is doing to America and our allies, they are saying we have no choice but to accept it. They paint those who oppose the president's diplomatic retreat as naive war mongers.They couldn't be more wrong. From the beginning, the only thing naive about this entire situation has been the president's insistence on striking a deal that rewards the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism for its long history of aggression against America and our allies.Read more..."""
Scott Walker,R,p,"July 29, 2015",b'Press Release - Scott Walker: Clinton Fights for Special Interests; I Will Fight for Your Interests',"b""Des Moines RegisterYou can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. Hillary Clinton is no exception.Her presidential campaign has been defined by closed-door meetings and carefully choreographed events designed to shield her from the same Americans she is asking for votes. If Iowans were hoping for something different during Clinton's most recent visit to the Hawkeye state, they will be sorely disappointed.Much of Clinton's time was spent in meetings with union bosses. The fact that Clinton is shunning everyday Iowans in favor of big-labor special interests sends a clear message about where her true loyalties lie.For Iowans, my campaign offers a very different vision. While Clinton is dead-set on defending and enabling the special interests that have driven our nation's capital to the point of dysfunction, we're focused on fixing the broken system these forces created. We're bringing new and bold leadership from outside of Washington that takes power away from big government bureaucrats and union bosses and puts it back where it belongs: in the hands of hard-working Americans.Read more..."""

Scott Walker did exactly what he needed to do during tonight\'s debate. He was unflappable, fluent on the issues and above all, presidential. He delivered a commanding performance, keeping his eye on the GOP\'s real opponent in this race: Hillary Clinton. Gov. Walker\'s record of successful reforms in Wisconsin reads like a wish list of conservative policy prescriptions. It is unmatched in the field of 2016 hopefuls, and as Gov. Walker continues to introduce himself to Americans during debates and on the campaign trail, support for him and his brand of bold, successful conservative reforms will only grow.""'"
Scott Walker,R,p,"August 7, 2015",b'Press Release - Walker National Campaign Chairman Releases Strategy Memo',"b'To: Interested PartiesFrom: Walker for America National Campaign Chairman Mike GrebeRe: Campaign UpdateDate: Aug. 7, 2015After a three-week announcement tour covering more than 15,000 miles in over ten states, it\'s been a great ride as we rolled into Cleveland for this week\'s debate. Whether it\'s a positive showing in early state and national polls, meeting fundraising goals or earning a top slot on the Fox debate stage, we couldn\'t have asked for a better entry into this race.Our goal by August was to introduce Governor Walker and his big, bold reforms to America and show the country it isn\'t too late to turn things around. Scott Walker didn\'t win three elections in four years with luck. He did it by unapologetically making the case for his brand of bold and successful conservative reforms one voter at a time and out-working everyone.This campaign is no exception. We are running a retail-style grassroots campaign unlike any other 2016 hopeful, and voters are responding. Our three-week campaign rollout, which kicked off July 13 in Waukesha, WI, was among the most aggressive of any 2016 candidate.In the first week alone, we visited 16 cities in six states and traveled nearly 900 miles across Iowa on the campaign\'s Winnebago. We\'ve pledged to complete the ""Full Grassley"" in the Hawkeye state and have already visited 16 of the 99 counties. We\'ll be campaigning in all 10 New Hampshire counties on a Harley and have impressive organizations we\'re building in South Carolina, Nevada and the rest of the early contest states.Where many candidates see a pathway through one early state, we see pathways through them all.Governor Walker\'s long list of conservative successes in Wisconsin, a blue state a Republican presidential candidate hasn\'t won since 1984, has provided him with a natural base of support that has helped fuel the campaign\'s momentum thus far. There are voters who admire his success in instituting big, bold conservative reforms and there are also state and local leaders who are inspired by Walker\'s ability to win tough policy fights in the face of relentless liberal opposition.The task at hand for us is building on this groundswell of grassroots and grasstops support, and we will do so with a simple strategy: We are going to outwork every other campaign and candidate in the race.In the nation\'s first contest, the Iowa Caucus, more than a third of Iowa state senators have already joined our team, and we\'ve secured the full support and endorsements of more than 60 current and former state and local officials. This is testament to Gov. Walker\'s broad appeal among local leaders and will pay dividends in the coming weeks and months as we unveil an impressive roster of campaign chairs across the country.And this is just the beginning. While Gov. Walker\'s resounding victory over liberal union bosses in the fight to reform collective bargaining is widely noted, his many other conservative achievements  creating jobs, cutting taxes, fixing Wisconsin\'s deficit, defunding Planned Parenthood, and passing Voter ID and Concealed Carry  aren\'t as well known. Governor Walker has yet to become the household-name that so many others have, yet we are in the mix in every state across the country because people are hungry for leadership  something badly needed in Washington.On the stump and in the spotlight, Gov. Walker has earned a reputation for being unflappable, always focused on what\'s important in order to get the job done. Not surprisingly, our campaign has a similar approach. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and while many in the chattering class obsess over the news of the day, we will keep our eye on the ball and concentrate on the fundamentals that win campaigns. This primary will be fought and won one precinct, ward, county and state at a time, and next year the country and the Republican Party will be better off for it.'"

This time, it\'s Hillary Clinton leading the attack against Governor Walker for no other reason than he poses the greatest threat to the liberal agenda. Here are five of the most recent attacks from Hillary Clinton that show how scared she is of Scott Walker\'s reforms.""Take Governor Walker of Wisconsin, who seems to be delighted in slashing higher education in his state, in making it more difficult for students to get scholarships and pay off their debt, eliminating opportunities for young people who are doctors or dentists to actually work in underserved areas in return for having their debt relieved, ending scholarships for poor kids ... And, most surprisingly to me, [Walker rejected] legislation that would have made it tax-deductible for you on your income tax, to deduct the amount of your loan payment. I don\'t know why he wants to raise taxes on students, but that is the result."" - Hillary Clinton, 8/11/15After decades of huge tuition hikes, Governor Walker froze tuition in the University of Wisconsin System for a record 4 years running, and delivered historic levels of need-based financial aid. Those are real steps to making college more affordable for families.""Republicans like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush are calling to defund Planned Parenthood, the country\'s leading provider of reproductive healthcare."" - Hillary Clinton, 8/3/15. One of Planned Parenthood\'s dirty secrets was revealed in a series of disturbing videos: their business sells the parts of the babies they abort. Like most Americans, Governor Walker does not want our tax dollars to be used to finance the buying and selling of human beings and he\'s proud to have cut off state funding for these callous acts.""Governor Walker signed dangerous abortion restrictions into law in WI - without exceptions for rape or incest. Extreme and unacceptable."" - Hillary Clinton, 7/20/15Doctors believe that unborn babies can feel pain at 20 weeks, and Governor Walker signed legislation to protect those babies, which includes provisions to protect the life of the mother.""Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names by stomping on workers\' rights."" - Hillary Clinton, 7/13/15Thanks to Governor Walker, workers in Wisconsin can now choose for themselves whether they want to belong to a union, instead of being forced to join and pay dues. His reforms also allow public sector workers to be paid on performance and promoted based on merit.""In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder -- for college students to vote."" - Hillary Clinton, 6/4/15Voter ID legislation makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat in Wisconsin. College students may use their school-provided photo ID (which they need for every school function) or may get a free state ID. It can\'t get much easier or cheaper.Despite the Democrats\' best efforts - bussing in tens of thousands to protest in the state capital and spending millions upon millions - Scott Walker is still standing and he\'s won three elections in four years.How did he do it? Committed supporters just like you, standing up and joining Scott in his principled fight against the big-government special interests. Hillary Clinton is leading the charge against Walker and we\'re going to need all the help we can get. Add your name here if you\'re committed to standing with Walker. '"

Scott Walker,R,p,"August 19, 2015","b""Press Release - While Hillary Clinton Fights for the Ruling Class, I'm Fighting for the Middle Class""","b'Right now, every-day Americans are fed up. The ruling-class of special interests and bureaucrats in Washington think they\'re above playing by the same rules as everyone else. No one personifies this more than Hillary Clinton, who put her personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people by using a homebrewed email server to store classified information.Apparently, Hillary Clinton also thinks her special-interest friends are exempt from the same rules that govern everyone else. Just recently, Hillary kowtowed to union bosses by pledging to reconsider Obamacare\'s so-called ""Cadillac Tax"" on cushy union health care plans. Yet, in being a champion for ObamaCare and the architect of its precursor, HillaryCare, Clinton has never seemed the least bit concerned with the burdens these policies inflict on ordinary Americans.There shouldn\'t be two separate sets of rules for regular Americans and Hillary Clinton\'s circle of Washington elites. That\'s why in my plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Day One Patient Freedom Plan, one of the first steps we\'d take is issuing an executive order ending the ObamaCare exemption the president gave to members of Congress. The best way to motivate Congress to repeal ObamaCare and pass real reforms is to make sure lawmakers have to live under the same ObamaCare rules everyone else has been forced to suffer under over the past few years.While many candidates talk about defeating the special interests, we\'ve actually done it before and have a real plan to do it again. After we compel Congress to repeal Obamacare, we will build a better system that puts people back in charge of their own health care, gives patients more options, and makes health care insurance more affordable. Our plan makes affordable health care accessible for all Americans, while eliminating ObamaCare\'s government interference and messy red tape. We will protect those with pre-existing conditions and provide tax credits that allow people to obtain affordable coverage. Our plan will move power over health care out of Washington by returning regulatory authority to state and local leaders and giving states the power to administer Medicaid.So while we have a plan to free all Americans from the burdens of ObamaCare, Hillary Clinton is only interested creating loopholes that protect her special-interest allies from the dysfunctional and destructive law. That\'s the difference between a candidate who fights for the middle class and someone like Hillary Clinton, who is only looking out for the ruling class.'"

Watch the video here: http://bit.ly/1TUhLPJ As Walker says, ""Like I did in my state, I\'m going to tell you I\'m willing to stand up against anyone, including members of my own party, to get the job done.

We want to make sure that truly needy people get the care that they need. We need to send that power and responsibility back to the states, where states can be more innovative and are more likely to get the job done. Americans want more than just campaign promises, they want results.""'"
Scott Walker,R,p,"August 20, 2015","b'Press Release - Politicians Talk, Leaders Deliver'","b""It's been happening for years. Like clockwork every election cycle, the politicians on Capitol Hill vow to get our economy growing again and create more jobs.Those of us outside the Washington bubble have all heard the talk, we just haven't seen the results.On the national level, unemployment and taxes are too high, and economic growth and labor participation are too low. Meanwhile the federal government just keeps getting bigger. For all of the fighting the politicians in Washington do, victories on behalf of the taxpayers are few and far between.In Wisconsin, we don't just talk about growing the economy, cutting taxes and shrinking government, we actually make it happen. When I became governor, I inherited a mess. The state was saddled with a $3.6 billion deficit and unemployment was over 8 percent. Wisconsinites had endured so many years of tax hikes, many had stopped believing they'd ever be cut. A week after I was elected, I met with all of the state's Republican lawmakers and said that the voters had told us they wanted big, bold reforms. Some in the statehouse didn't want to challenge the status quo, but I told them it was put up or shut up time. If we didn't do what we said we'd do, the voters would have every right to throw us out. We adopted a strategy that's rare in politics: we actually delivered on our campaign promises.We said we'd cut taxes and we did, lowering them by $2 billion and eliminating an entire tax bracket in my first term alone. By 2017, we will have provided taxpayers with $4.7 billion in honest to goodness tax relief, jumpstarting the economy and helping hardworking citizens. We've also cut property taxes every single year I've been governor, and they are now lower than when I came into office.To help our businesses grow, we eliminated miles of bureaucratic red tape. We made Wisconsin a friendlier environment for businesses and workers by becoming a Right to Work state and giving workers the freedom to decide whether or not to join a union. We turned around a $3.6 billion deficit and balanced every budget I have signed as governor. We did it by cutting wasteful spending and eliminating sweetheart deals for the special interests that were bad for taxpayers.We didn't just shake up the status quo, we turned it on its head, and peoples' lives are better because of it. Our unemployment rate is now below the national average at 4.6 percent, down from 8.1 percent before I took office. Prior to my election, Wisconsin had lost over 130,000 jobs. But since I've been governor, the state has created nearly 150,000 new ones, and our labor force participation rate is now higher than the national average.If we want to get our national economy growing again, cut taxes and shrink government down to size, we need more than someone who is good at giving speeches and making campaign promises. We need a leader who can deliver results, just like we've done in Wisconsin."""
Scott Walker,R,p,"August 20, 2015",b'Press Release - Scott Walker: Get DC Out of Our Health Care',"b""USA TodayRepeal Obamacare, reduce costs, return power to the states and the people.ObamaCare was forced on the American people by Democrats who think the government knows best, chief among them, Hillary Clinton.The seeds of this destructive law were first planted by Clinton in the early 90s as part of her failed health care plan, HillaryCare, and in her 2008 campaign's health care proposal.Although Clinton's health care proposals failed, many of their central provisions  including the individual mandate and harsh penalties for those who don't purchase insurance  succeeded in making their way into ObamaCare.So let's call Obamacare what it is: the result of a decades-long plan by the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party to seize control of health care choice and freedom from individuals and states and hand total power over to the federal government in Washington.ObamaCare is a horrible failure based on phony promises and outrageous shell games peddled by the liberal Washington establishment and its special interest politics. Theytold Americans they could keep their health care plans, even though they couldn't. They promised families health care premiums would go down, even though they wouldn't. Millions promised new coverage were simply tossed onto state Medicaidrolls. The full list of broken promises is long.There is no fixing this disaster. ObamaCare must be repealed lock, stock and barrel. It's time to take back the power Washington robbed from people, families, caregivers and states. I have a plan to do just that.My plan to topple the status quo and rid us of ObamaCare starts with compelling Congress to actually address the problem.Read more ..."""

Politicians in Washington are spending money taxpayers don't have, placing obstacles in the way of job creation, and they aren't doing enough to keep our homeland safe. The current top-down, government-knows-best approach is not working now, and it won't work in the future.But simply talking about the problems in Washington will not fix them. True reform requires big, bold, comprehensive action and a president who knows how to fight for those reforms and win.When I became governor of Wisconsin, the state government was broken. We inherited a $3.6 billion deficit. The rainy day fund was nearly drained and special interests were in charge at the state and local levels. We had a lot of work to do, and undoing the damage required bold action.We started Wisconsin's turnaround by passing common-sense reforms that required public employees to make reasonable contributions to their health care and retirement benefits and ended taxpayer-funded collection of union dues.Liberal union bosses fought our reforms tooth and nail, organizing 100,000 protesters to occupy our state capitol grounds. Unintimidated by their attacks and protests, we took them on and we won.On behalf of Wisconsin students and teachers, we began repairing a broken educational system that rewarded tenure and seniority over teacher performance. Under the reforms we enacted, the old rules are now in the history books.Our policies are working.

On Monday, I called on President Obama to cancel the upcoming state visit by China to the United States. The pomp and circumstance that comes with an official state visit should be reserved for special friends and allies of our country. On the president's watch, we have seen China become more aggressive with the United States. We've seen more cyberattacks against our country, a dangerous militarization of the South China Sea, and a disturbing crackdown on Christians and human rights activists. Yet the president plans to reward China with an official state visit and lavish its leader with White House honors. These planned honors for China are the disturbing culmination of President Obama and Hillary Clinton's many years of empty threats and symbolic summits. Hillary Clinton claims to have made great strides in advancing American interests in the cyber realm during her tenure as secretary of state, yet we have seen increasingly brazen attacks against the United States. President Obama has refused to name China as the perpetrator of the cyberattack on the Office of Personnel Management, which resulted in the theft of over 20 million Americans' personal information. We need China to know that any cyberattack on America will be met with a fast and certain response. Rather than allowing strategic competitors to undermine America, we need to stand up for our economic and national interests and ensure Asia is prosperous, peaceful, and free.That optimistic vision will guide a Walker administration's strategy for China and the region. First, we need to support free trade and exert real economic leadership in Asia. As I have said for months, America must be the economic leader in the region. We need a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that puts American workers first and levels the playing field. A deal that genuinely opens markets and ensures high standards for an area covering almost 40 percent of the world's GDP has huge potential to benefit Americans.

Our nation\'s capital is broken - and we cannot expect those from Washington to fix Washington. The only thing that can change the culture of failure and doing nothing is electing someone from outside of D.C. to clean things up. After I became governor of Wisconsin, we took on the union bosses and won. Even in the face of death threats, 100,000 protestors and relentless attacks from the opposition, we stayed the course, implementing commonsense, fair reforms that took power from the big-government union bosses and put it firmly into the hands of the people. That\'s pro-taxpayer. We reformed our union collective bargaining agreements so we could pay our bills and send money back to the people. We passed Right to Work reforms in Wisconsin so workers have the freedom to choose whether to join a union. That\'s pro-worker. Our budgets cut taxes by $4.7 billion so workers and their families have the freedom to save and invest more of their hard-earned money for themselves. We fixed a $3.6 billion budget deficit so we could focus on helping people create more jobs and higher wages. And so this Labor Day, I want to honor all the men and women across our great land - and particularly our men and women in uniform across the world - who get up every morning to support themselves, their families, their communities and a grateful nation.Hard work - and the very act of labor - is a principle that must always be celebrated and honored. Our workforce is the best in the world, and America can out compete and out produce any nation in the world. But to truly grow the economy, we need to get the federal government out of the way. To do that, we need a new president who can wreak havoc on Washington - someone who has taken on the Washington-based special interests.We fought and won. We got results and did it without compromising conservative principles. That\'s what we need out of the next president: someone who will fight and win for America\'s hard-working families.

Scott Walker,R,p,"September 9, 2015","b'Press Release - Ahead of Eureka Speech, Governor Walker Highlights Day One Reforms'","b'Madison, Wis. - Ahead of his Thursday speech at Eureka College, Gov. Scott Walker today unveiled his Day One Plan, a project to highlight the reforms he would begin implementing on his first day as president. View the Day One Plan here. The plan will be updated each week throughout the campaign as Walker introduces new day one reforms designed to wreak havoc on the status quo in Washington, just as he has done in Wisconsin. The plan is a list of day one promises Walker wants voters to hold him accountable for achieving. They include:  Sending legislation to Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare and ending the taxpayer-funded subsidies that have protected lawmakers from the premium increases ordinary Americans have faced under this disastrous law   Ending President Obama\'s unlawful executive actions, and enforcing our immigration laws. Ending outrageous instances of defying federal law -- such as those practiced by so-called ""sanctuary cities"" will now be a priority   Terminating President Obama\'s bad nuclear deal with Iran After introducing the Day One Plan, Gov. Walker released the following statement: ""President Reagan once said that we needed to drain the swamp in Washington. But since he left, the swamp has filled up again. We cannot expect those from Washington to fix it. It\'s time to wreak havoc on the status quo in Washington and put everyday Americans back in charge. I know it can work, because we did it in Wisconsin. I\'m committed to doing the same thing in our nation\'s capital starting on day one. That\'s why my first day as president would be one of the busiest the White House has seen in years."" - Gov. Scott WalkerWalker is no stranger to busy first days on the job. On his first day as governor, he authorized Wisconsin to join the lawsuit challenging Obamacare, created a commission on government waste, fraud and abuse, and issued an executive order calling for a special legislative session on jobs. Since then, he\'s led the charge in implementing a host of successful conservative reforms, including collective bargaining reform, right to work legislation, fixing a $3.6 billion budget deficit and cutting taxes by $4.7 billion.'"
Scott Walker,R,p,"September 9, 2015","b""Press Release - Time to Focus on Students' Interests, Not Big-Labor Special Interests""","b'More Recess. Less Teaching.You might expect to hear that from kids as they go back to school. You probably don\'t expect to hear that from their teachers. But that\'s exactly what we\'re hearing out of Seattle as union bosses have called an illegal strike. The demands? More recess, less teaching. They\'ve demanded an 18 percent raise, rejecting a generous offer of 9 percent. And today, as 50,000 public school children were supposed to be headed back to the classroom to start a new year of learning and growth, instead they\'re home with parents who are missing work because teachers won\'t teach.The union bosses are betting that if they can make parents and children suffer, they can get what they want. The big-labor union bosses actually sum up the situation best themselves. Several years ago, National Education Association Counsel Bob Chanin said the following:""Despite what some among us would like to believe  it is not because we care about children, and it is not because we have a vision of a great public school for every child. NEA and its affiliates are effective advocates because we have power. ""This is what happens when unions have unlimited power over taxpayers, and why we put an end to it in Wisconsin and put the taxpayer back in charge. This is why the big-government special interests and their supporters like Hillary Clinton are wrong when they say the role of a president is to defend collective bargaining. As president, I will stand in solidarity with any governor - Republican or Democrat - who fights the big-government special interests in their state and takes on collective bargaining like I did in Wisconsin. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was right. Collective bargaining has no place in the public sector, and today we see why: children\'s best interests are held hostage by big-government union bosses.It\'s time to put a stop to this type of organized extortion, just like we did in Wisconsin.As county executive and as governor, I saw how the big-labor special interest groups put their need for power over the needs of our kids. Public sector labor unionsbolstered by monopoly negotiating power and political moneyfed a bureaucracy that sent dollars away from classrooms to fund the political agenda of the union bosses.After years of bullying their members and local leaders in the state, unions in Wisconsin had a chokehold on schools. School districts in our state were forced to spend massive and ever-growing amounts on employee benefits, leaving teachers without the resources or ability to focus on our children\'s education.Union contracts with last-hired-first-fired\' rules forced schools - even those in troubled districts in desperate need of help - to abandon efforts to keep exceptional teachers in our classrooms and focus instead on protecting teachers with seniority and tenure. Union rules meant that the top teachers in our schools faced layoffs.In Wisconsin, the solution to these challenges required more than band-aid fixes. We needed bold reforms that would take power from the special interests and return it where it belonged, to the people closest to the students: parents, teachers, and local school boards. In 2011, we enacted a series of bold reforms to reduce big-government union power and strengthen education for our kids. We required public employees to contribute toward their health insurance and retirement - a commonsense change that has allowed schools to spend more dollars on the critical task of educating our kids. We also eliminated seniority handcuffs so that schools can keep the best and brightest teachers in the classroom and pay them based on their performance. And we set up a system to reward good teachers and ensure that union contract provisions would not stand in the way of commonsense reforms that improve our classrooms and outcomes.Our reforms removed the special interest stranglehold and allowed Wisconsin\'s teachers to do what they do best: educate our kids. Now third grade reading scores in the state have improved, more students are graduating from high school, and Wisconsin students have the 2nd highest ACT scores in the nation. Good things happen when those closest to students are put firmly in charge of educational decisions.The nation needs a president with a proven track record of reform - someone who can stand up to bullies and win so power can be shifted away from the special interests back to parents and students. We\'ve been in solution mode in Wisconsin, and we cleared the path for important reforms in K-12 education. This is how we won for Wisconsin\'s families. And we\'ll take on big labor from Washington to do the same for families across the country.'"

Someone who is willing to go big and go bold. It is not enough to elect a Republican as President, we need a reformer.After the elections, I told the new Republican majorities that it was put up or shut up time. We had to keep our word or voters would have every right to throw us out at the next election.They tried to intimidate us. But we didn't back down. When more than 100,000 protesters occupied our Capitol, we didn't back down. When there were death threats against me and threats against my family, we didn't back down. Instead, we fought and we won. We got results - and we did it without compromising our conservative principles.Now, we need a leader who can wreak havoc on Washington and put the American people back in charge of our government. I am that leader. I have been tested like none other in this race and we have solutions to move this country forward.To wreak havoc on Washington, America also needs a leader who has been tested.

Scott Walker,R,p,"September 15, 2015",b'Press Release - Leading from Behind Has Led to Chaos in Syria',"b""Russia's aggressive actions in Syriabuilding up bases and bringing in air assets, ships, and ground troopsare a serious escalation of the conflict there. Vladimir Putin is filling a power vacuum created by President Obama's accommodation of Iran, lack of strategy in Syria, and abandonment of Iraq. The administration's leading from behind has allowed the situation in Syria to become the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades, with over 250,000 dead, more than four million refugees in neighboring countries, and some seven million people displaced inside Syria. And now there are reports that the Obama Administration is considering leading from behind again, possibly turning a blind eye to Russian military engagement in Syria. This would be a disastrous policy. Syrian dictator Bashar Assad caused this crisis, and allowing Russia and Iran to prop him up would only deepen the conflict in Syria and generate countless more refugees. What President Obama doesn't understand is that Putin will continue to back Assad and expand Russian involvement in Syria until he sees that America is fully committed to Assad's removal and rolling back Iranian influence in the region. Right now, all Putin sees is an American president unwilling to defeat ISIS, ignoring Assad's depravity, and facilitating the rise of Iran's destructive power throughout the Middle East. We have all seen the heartbreaking devastation this approach has caused, and the American people are rightly asking what we can do. To truly help Syria's people and give its refugees hope that they can one day return to and rebuild their country, we must do what no other country can dowe must lead.This means we must enforce a no-fly zone in Syria, train many more moderate fighters to go after both ISIS and Assad, and in response to Putin's build-up in Syria, enact additional sanctions against Russia, especially its defense and energy sectors.By providing strong leadership underscored by a commitment to removing Assad, defeating ISIS and rolling back Iran's influence, we can get real buy-in and support from our traditional allies such as Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, and the Gulf States. Until we provide such leadership, the conflict in Syria and all of its symptoms will only get worse, no matter how many refugees we agree to resettle."""

This time she criticized his ""Power to the People"" plan to take on the special interests and upend the status quo in Washington. You know Scott Walker can\'t be intimidated and he didn\'t back down. .@HillaryClinton Actually, we\'re protecting the American worker from being forced to support candidates like you. - SW  Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 15, 2015 That\'s it for ""This Week with Walker.""'"
