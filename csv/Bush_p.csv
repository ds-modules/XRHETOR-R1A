Jeb Bush,R,p,"June 22, 2015",b'Press Release - The President Must Prioritize Cybersecurity',"b'The United States helped drive the information revolution and created the internet. We benefit tremendously from the open and dynamic architecture of an internet that has become the backbone of global communication and commerce.Given the reliance of the United States government and the private sector on the internet, it is disturbing we remain vulnerable to its disruption and misuse. We have ceded the initiative to those who wish to steal, disrupt, and destroy the intellectual property, personal information, and treasure we entrust to the internet, and, in so doing, we have allowed these adversaries to threaten our citizens\' inherent right to a trusted, free and open internet.It doesn\'t have to be this way.I recently visited Estonia, a country of 1.3 million people that, after escaping Soviet Communism, aggressively pursued free market economic reforms and sought to make Estonia a leader in the internet economy. Their plans were severely disrupted when a 2007 cyberattack sourced to Russia temporarily crippled the small country\'s internet-reliant government and economy. But the Estonians picked themselves up and, with leadership and serious effort, turned their vulnerability into a strength. Today, Estonia is at the forefront of the internet economy and a leader not only in connecting its citizens but also in protecting their data and networks from intrusion.Estonia\'s lesson is a good one for us  if you rely on the internet, you need to invest in protecting it. This is a lesson for average citizens, IT managers, and government bureaucrats alike, who need to take proactive steps to educate themselves and protect their data, but, above all, it is a lesson for the Commander in Chief.Our military, government, and economy rely on the internet to function effectively. There is no going back; our relationship with networks of information must evolve and adapt with the internet\'s own evolution. Something so important must be a priority for the U.S. government, and yet it is not.Effective cybersecurity involves far more than technology, engineering, firewalls, or perimeter defenses. It begins with an appreciation of the extraordinary contributions the internet makes to our economy, our education system, our culture, and our society. We must understand the importance of the internet\'s infrastructure, the data it contains, and the responsibilities of those who build, sustain and use it to ensure its robust defense. That includes all of us  individuals, educators, the private sector, and the government all working in concert to achieve the promise of the internet  and this is where Presidential leadership is so important.The President can issue an Executive Order or give a speech about cybersecurity, but without sustained leadership and determined implementation  including a concerted effort to work with the Congress  we will not adapt to meet the growing threats. Recent high-profile intrusions into private and government networks suggest we are not meeting this challenge.The recent example of the Office of Personnel Management is emblematic of the cultural failure of the Obama Administration to take these threats seriously. A recent Inspector General report indicates that vulnerabilities to OPM\'s systems had been identified as much as a year ago. And no one can suggest the government did not understand the value of millions of personnel records  many of which included the intrusive and sensitive personnel questionnaire (the ""SF-86""). OPM officials knew this data was valuable, knew it was sensitive, and knew it was vulnerable. What use is it that President Obama issued an Executive Order or gave a thoughtful speech about cybersecurity if his own Office of Personnel Management  the human resources department of the entire US Government  failed to take basic steps to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of its employees?Where is the accountability? What consequences will there be for political appointees or bureaucrats who failed to heed warnings and adequately protect these key databases? What will happen to Katherine Archuleta who served as the National Political Director For President Obama\'s 2012 reelection campaign before assuming her role as OPM Director? What message will it send to other managers throughout the government  and private sector  if there isn\'t accountability?Sophisticated foreign intelligence services, non-state hackers, and cyber troublemakers are all doing great damage to our economy and national security, and the threat is growing. The NSA is critical to our defense against foreign cyber-threats, and yet the political class in Washington has been more interested in treating the NSA as an enemy of the state rather than its defender. We need to preserve and enhance the capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community and law enforcement to identify, deter, and respond to cyber-attacks.Given the growing physical and cyber threats to our national security, it is past time to reverse the trend in defense and intelligence spending. If elected President, my budget will reflect the importance of protecting America from these threats, and I will undo the damage the President\'s defense budgets and Sequestration have done to the Defense Department and Intelligence Community in this era of growing threats  cyber and traditional  to the United States and its citizens.We are not powerless unless we choose to be. It would be a start for the President to show leadership on Capitol Hill, and to throw his weight behind the House\'s effort to improve cybersecurity information-sharing between the government and the private sector  a critical impediment to cybersecurity according to experts. For three Congresses in a row, the House of Representatives has passed information-sharing legislation only to see it stonewalled by Senate Democrats. Just recently, with the OPM databreach still on the front page, Senate Democrats yet again blocked Senate consideration of information-sharing legislation. President Obama should step up, show some leadership, and work with Congress to pass this legislation  a key step towards creating a more robust public-private partnership.Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense, economic well-being, and national resilience. We need a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to ensure that our critical infrastructure, networks, and communications remain secure. These efforts will help guarantee America remains on top throughout the ongoing technological and communications revolutions that will transform fundamental aspects of our world, economy, and society.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"June 25, 2015",b'Press Release - This is Not the End of the Fight Against ObamaCare',"b""I was disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling in the King v. Burwell case. But that decision is not the end of the fight against ObamaCare.This fatally-flawed law imposes job-killing mandates, causes spending in Washington to skyrocket by $1.7 trillion, raises taxes by over a $1 trillion and drives up health care costs. Instead of fixing our health care system, it made the problems worse.As President of the United States, I would make fixing our broken health care system one of my top priorities. I will work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law with conservative reforms that empower consumers with more choices and control over their health care decisions.Here is what I believe: We need to put patients in charge of their own decisions and health care reform should actually lower costs. Entrepreneurs should be freed to lower costs and improve access to care  just like American ingenuity does in other sectors of the economy.A few specifics:ObamaCare has proven that Washington cannot impose a one-size-fits-all fix for our health care problems. Instead, we should empower states to implement local, accountable solutions that work for their citizens.Having a pre-existing condition should not mean patients have to worry about keeping their coverage or getting the care they need. We need a conservative solution that works for those patients.I want to protect every American against catastrophic medical expenses  no one should lose their life savings due to an illness or accident.Health care should be more responsive and easier to navigate through transparency, innovation, and accountability in the health care system.Individuals should get tax relief for their premiums and their care. That will help make health coverage portable, helping Americans who change jobs or start their own businesses.We should also strengthen employers' ability to offer more choices at lower costs. We need to make care more affordable for small businesses. This involves better data on prices and outcomes, flexibility for employers promoting wellness programs, and the ability to offer more innovative benefit designs.Americans deserve leadership that can actually fix our broken health care system, and they are certainly not getting it now from Washington, DC."""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"June 30, 2015",b'Press Release - My Career: Through 33 Years of Tax Returns',"b'33 years of tax returns. More than any presidential candidate in history.I\'m releasing 33 years of tax returns  more than any presidential candidate in history. You might remember a few months back, in the spirit of transparency, I posted 280,000 emails from my time as governor on JebEmails.com. Some of them were funny, some serious, some a little embarrassing. But I put them all out because I wanted people to have a window into my leadership style and be able to see for themselves how I handled the issues facing our state.Today\'s release comes in the same spirit because most of my adult life has been spent in the private sector  not in government. This release will show voters how I earned a living over the past three decades and how much of that living I had to give back to Uncle Sam. (Spoiler Alert: A LOT).There are far too many documents here for anyone except the nerdiest accountant to enjoy reading. That\'s largely because we have a broken tax system that\'s one of the most convoluted and anti-growth in the world. I just came back from Estonia where it takes residents less than five minutes to file their taxes. The tax release process sure would\'ve been a lot easier if we were following the Estonia model. But more importantly, our economy would be much more competitive too.""Total Pages: 1,150. Total hours: Far too long. Time it takes Estonians to file their taxes: Less than 5 minutes.""So for the vast majority of you who won\'t be going through all 1,150 pages of tax returns  I want to take this opportunity to tell you about my career in business.Credit: Mary Lou Foy, Miami HeraldIn January 1981, after working on the Reagan-Bush presidential campaign, my wife Columba and I moved to Miami. There, I teamed up with Armando Codina, a great entrepreneur, and I made $42,000 my first year. Armando and I became partners in a real estate business that started from scratch with only one other employee. We grew that company from three people to the largest full-service commercial real estate firm in South Florida creating over 250 jobs along the way. Over those years my income fluctuated based on our successes, failures, and the bumpy Miami real estate market. That\'s the way the American economy works  not from central planners in Washington, D.C.  but people working hard, taking risks, and earning their way to success. Over the course of the decade as the business grew, we were better able to sustain market downturns, so my take home pay did as well. During that time we were raising three kids, George, Noelle, and Jeb Jr., so we were happy for the additional income!I left Codina/Bush in 1997 before I became Governor of the state of Florida. As Governor, I made the allotted salary for the state\'s chief executive and also had additional income that came from investments in stocks and mutual funds that my financial advisor had made during those years. When I entered the Governor\'s office, I declined to take the state pension  $28,730 per year that I would\'ve started to receive this year  because I wanted to put my money where my mouth was on fixing the state budget and restoring fiscal responsibility.Since leaving the governor\'s office, I started a new company Jeb Bush and Associates and soon after was joined by my son, Jeb Jr. In addition to JBA we joined with 3 other partners in establishing Britton Hill, which focused on a few growth capital investments separate from our consulting business. If you ever have the opportunity to work side-by-side with one of your children, I recommend it. It was a phenomenal experience.Together, Jeb Jr. and I consulted for and invested in companies in sectors where we had experience or where we could add value. In health care, I got involved with Cormatrix, which is a small bio-tech company focusing on regenerative tissue technology. In the energy sector, I sat on the board of a start-up company called Geo Fossil Fuels, which develops microbes that extract fossil fuels from environments that the industry has traditionally considered impenetrable. These types of business relationships gave me a perspective on how companies in diverse industries are addressing the far-too-slow economic recovery and debilitating regulations through innovation and American ingenuity.""If you ever have the opportunity to work side-by-side with one of your children, I recommend it. It was a phenomenal experience.""I also was hired as a senior advisor to Barclays where I advised their clients on a wide range of global economic issues with a mind towards navigating government policies. One thing I learned from that experience  the United States can be much more competitive and create new and better paying jobs if only we learned the lessons of why companies choose to invest other places. It doesn\'t have to be so.During this time, I worked constantly and traveled the globe for my clients. I went on 89 trips to 29 different countries. And it paid off. Over these 33 years my income increased thanks to hard work and experience. My most recent tax return reflects that success with an annual income of $7.4 million. But one thing I didn\'t do was get paid to lobby or cut deals with the state government I just left. That was a line I drew and it was the right one. And it\'s a line more people should be drawing in Washington, D.C. where lobbying has become our nation\'s premier growth industry. And this culture of special interest access is a problem I plan to tackle as President.Since I left the governor\'s office I have tried to give back  and even though all of us strive to do more  I\'m proud of what Columba and I have contributed. From 2007-2014 we donated $739,000 to charity. In addition, we have continued to help the causes that we believe in. Through the Celebration of Reading annual event, $17 million has been raised for family literacy. Our annual Cystic Fibrosis events have raised $7.4 million to find a cure for the disease. Finally, through Columba\'s efforts we have been honored to help raise more than $1 million for the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Mrs. Bush has also been a longtime supporter of the Ballet Folclrico de Mxico, including working to establish its Children\'s Cultural Education Fund. Through all of these efforts I\'ve been inspired by so many people who have dedicated their lives to these causes.In addition, I established a national non-profit, the Foundation for Excellence in Education, to advocate for school choice and other education reforms to raise student achievement in states across America. Over the last eight years, we raised $46 million to advance proven reform policies at the state level to give more children the opportunity to rise up and achieve success in school and life. There is no issue more critical to our long-term success as a nation than transforming America\'s education system, and I\'m proud of the work my Foundation has done to advance meaningful reforms to put us on the right path. I stepped down as chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education at the end of last year, but under the leadership of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the organization remains a national leader of the education reform movement.Last December, as I began to contemplate the possibility of moving forward with a run for the Presidency, I stepped down from my business and philanthropic responsibilities so I could focus on the journey ahead.Taken altogether, it\'s been a rewarding and full life. I\'ve been graced with good fortune, by having the most wonderful parents in the world, the best business partners a man could ask for, and opportunities that are out of reach for too many Americans.But part of the reason they are out of reach is that we have a tax code that stifles growth and opportunity. In my case, I paid the government more than one in three dollars that I earned in my career. Astounding. The total effective rate was 36 percent. I think I speak for everyone, no matter your tax rate: we need to get more money back in your pocket and less in the federal kitty.""I say we need to get more money back in your pocket and less in the federal kitty.""'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 6, 2015",b'Press Release - Getting Out Of The Zombie Economy',"b'Barack Obama\'s policies have given us a zombie economy where no matter what else happens, most Americans are falling behind. Last week we got news that the share of Americans at work or looking for work is at a 38-year low. More than 6 million people are working part-time jobs when they\'d prefer full-time. Roughly 5.5 million more Americans are living in poverty than when Obama came to office. More Americans believe that the economy is getting worse than those who think it\'s getting better  and that\'s been true for several months running.Now comes Hillary Clinton, and her economic agenda could be summarized easily: Whatever Obama is doing, let\'s double down on it.Take ObamaCare. It\'s one of the biggest speedbumps in our economy. The mandates and taxes in the law are keeping many businesses from hiring new workers. The law is holding down worker hours and reducing the payoff from working.And now we are hearing that health insurance rates for some Americans could rise by more than 50 percent. This weekend Hillary Clinton reiterated that when it comes to ObamaCare, there\'s no reason to change course. I disagree, and there are millions of people who provide living proof that Hillary Clinton\'s agenda won\'t work  because they\'re not working at full-time jobs.As the next president of the United States, I will work to repeal and replace this job-killing law with reforms that will encourage the private sector to lower costs and to innovate. American households purchasing coverage on their own or people who want to start their own businesses should receive tax relief for more portable, quality coverage. Competition, transparency and individual control will help drive down costs and improve the quality of care. Two weeks ago I wrote about what this free market health care system would look like.""As the next president of the United States, I will work to repeal and replace this job-killing law with reforms that will encourage the private sector to lower costs and to innovate.""That\'s why the next election is so important. We can just stay on cruise control with policies that have given us an anemic economy, a job market that has chased away millions of people and a massive health law that is crushing businesses and families alike.Or we can take on our biggest problems and introduce pro-growth policies that support workers trying to find a job, businesses trying to grow, entrepreneurs trying to get an idea off the ground and free markets that are trying to meet demand. I know my ideas can work because I\'ve done it. Check out my record when I was governor of Florida, and you\'ll see: I do more than promise things. I deliver.Thanks to pro-growth policies Florida\'s economy took off and we ended up leading the nation in small business creation. 81,000 new small businesses created a state economy that produced 1.3 million new jobs, the most in the nation from 2000-2007. Florida averaged 4.4 percent growth during my governorship. Our unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent and middle class incomes increased by $1,300.I refuse to accept that our economy has to sputter along at a tepid pace of 2-percent growth. The defeatist left may think this is the new normal. I believe this nation has the potential to grow much faster, provide far more opportunities, and see household incomes rise. And I know that with your support, I can help America become a nation where everyone can prosper, everyone can participate and everyone has the right to rise.'"

Specifically, where are the emerging opportunities in our economy, and how will we turn those opportunities into more full-time jobs and higher incomes for everyone who wants the opportunity to rise up?These are issues I've been passionate about for decades, from my earliest days helping to run a commercial real estate firm in Miami. It was satisfying to start a business, create jobs, the experience kept me on my toes.What I learned to do is keep my eyes open for new trends in the economy. I loved visiting my clients in their new spaces, seeing what they were doing to create value for customers and create jobs in their communities.That's why today I am visiting a relatively new company called Thumbtack, which is connecting small businesses, providers and freelance contractors to households and consumers. This is a digital service that is helping small businesses compete for work and giving Americans more buying choices.I love learning about these kinds of companies precisely because before they existed, their market didn't exist either. And in creating a new marketplace, they have created something that is valuable to their customers.Now, these kinds of companies cause mental dissonance for people who think they can plan the future of the economy from Washington D.C.  people like Hillary Clinton. She gave a speech recently where she rejected some of the core elements of the shared economy. She sees these emerging companies as a threat to the established order.Worse, she is doubling down on President Obama's economic ideas. She has no ambition to move our nation beyond the mediocre growth path we're on  a growth path which is so different from what our digital innovators and other entrepreneurial Americans can help deliver if we get the right policies in place.We have to challenge the assumptions, regulations and laws that protect most of Washington from true digital disruption  and that means the liberal ideology which would squash so much innovation if it could.Big government liberals fundamentally can't embrace digital innovation because it threatens the way they govern. They see car-sharing services as a threat to the local government taxi cab cartels. They see food trucks and Airbnb as a threat to urban planning and the tax and fee racket that they've imposed on brick and mortar restaurants and hotels. It's no wonder that under President Obama, they've chosen to regulate the Internet using a law from the 1930s. Regulation is all they know and they've been using the same playbook for decades.I've got a different view on things, and a different approach. I don't mind disrupting the established order.And in the coming months, I plan on making my views clear in this space and in speeches around the country. I want to lead this nation as we challenge the assumptions of our federal government. And I want to continue the transformation of our economy through technology and digital innovation.Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section on how we can best create an economy that gives more people the chance to achieve earned success."""

The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in that city  these problems have been with us so long that they are sometimes accepted as facts of life. But a president should never accept them, and I will not. We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation\'s capital  and I mean to do it.""We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation\'s capital  and I mean to do it.""Balanced Budget AmendmentFrom the very outset as president, I would signal a new direction by supporting fundamental reforms that go to the heart of the problem.First, we have to confront and end the habitual practice of deficit spending. As long as deficits are an option, deficits will be the reality. The remedy that I will support as president is a balanced budget amendment. To be clear, a properly-designed amendment must be a tool to limit government  not raise taxes.Americans in every party are right to be worried about the fiscal integrity and solvency of our government. It needs to be fixed. I will urge Congress to submit a balanced budget amendment to the states and let the people decide.Second, it\'s time to revive Veto Corleone. The president should be able to eliminate wasteful spending through a constitutionally sound line-item veto  such as the version that Congressman Paul Ryan has proposed.Overspending is one of those problems where a president has to assert the national interest, even if no one else will. The power to veto irresponsible spending is part of that duty, and I know how to use it.Automatic GovernmentToo much in the federal government runs on automatic  which usually means that things are happening with no one stopping to ask why. We see this in the way the civil service operates. People are hired, promoted, and given pay increases often without regard to performance.More than ever, it\'s a system stuck in old ways, ruled by inertia, and unaccountable to the people. And with over two million employees on the federal payroll, these problems carry a heavy cost, and a few serious reforms will go a long way.My first reform will be placing a freeze on federal hiring. We can expect more than 10 percent of the current federal workforce to retire over the next 5 years. It\'s a fairly safe bet that not everyone who leaves has to be replaced.We will go by a simple three-out, one-in rule across the federal workforce, with exceptions for critical positions related to our security and safety. Only one new hire for every three who leave.This policy can, on its own, reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent within 5 years.Combined with other reforms, reducing the size of the bureaucracy by 10 percent within 4 years is a realistic goal, saving tens of billions of dollars, and without adding to unemployment.There are a lot of exemplary employees in the federal government, but they\'re treated no better than the bad ones. And the bad ones are almost impossible to effectively discipline or remove.Job security is one thing, job entitlement is another, and every time a federal employee needs to be moved along it shouldn\'t be a federal case.I will also propose, along with merit pay, enhanced financial incentives for managers whose skill and careful planning actually reduce spending.When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it  and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.""When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it  and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.""Setting the StandardIn all of these reforms, it matters what example is set by those in elective office. It\'s easy for elected officials to lay out standards of performance for others. But what are high standards worth if we don\'t apply them to ourselves? Consider a pattern in Congress of members who sometimes seem to regard attendance and voting as optional  something to do as time permits.The reality is that Congress is in session for three days in a typical week anyway, so it\'s not asking too much that every member be there and work on those days. And if it\'s an incentive they need, how about the one that pretty much every worker in America has in their job: you don\'t show up, you don\'t get paid for that time.A bill to dock the pay of absentee members might not pass the House or Senate, but at least it would get them all there for a vote. If we can\'t always get them on the job, let\'s at least get them on the record.If I learned anything as Governor of Florida, it was never to take time for granted. I even kept on my desk, where I would always see it, a digital clock counting down the time left in my term to the last hour. I might just bring that clock along, should I have the honor of serving the 1,461 days of the next presidential term.""Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year.""But this era of excuses is drawing to an end. There\'s some lost time to make up, and we can do it. Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year. Balanced budgets, and debt that is finally under control, are also within our power to accomplish. And the driving force must be a presidential-level challenge to the culture of spending. This is essential and achievable in a single term  and don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise.Additional MaterialsMount Washington Full Remarks Backgrounder: Jeb Bush: Proven Leadership to Reform Washington'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 20, 2015",b'Press Release - Things Must Change in Washington',"b'In his ""Mount Washington"" speech, Jeb outlined a few specific plans to disrupt the overspending, overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in our nation\'s capital.For starters, Jeb proposed two concrete solutions to confront and end the habitual practice of deficit spending  a balanced budget amendment and a constitutionally sound line-item veto. As he said, ""Overspending is one of those problems where a president has to assert the national interest, even if no one else will.""Another proposal put forward would punish Members of Congress who seem to regard attendance and voting as optional. The message is simple: If you don\'t show up to votes and hearings, you simply don\'t get paid.Finally, Jeb plans to tackle this problem head on by proposing a 6-year lobbying ban for former Members of Congress.After all, it\'s the relentless expansion of government that made lobbying Washington\'s premier growth industry. Jeb\'s plan will restrain federal spending and bureaucratic meddling.We can no longer tolerate a culture that has enriched lobbyists while leaving hardworking Americans behind.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 22, 2015","b'Press Release - Washington, Iowa'","b'Governor Bush published the following op-ed in the Des Moines Register:Every time I come to Iowa, I\'m struck by how Iowans view Washington D.C. They see it as the remote and gleaming city of marble and glass I like to call Mount Washington.There\'s a lot of frustration with Mount Washington right now  and I agree. Taxes are too high, regulations too intrusive, spending too reckless and borrowing too irresponsible.It goes against the way Iowans live. This state has the lowest credit card debt per capita in the nation. And despite an economy that is growing at a sluggish pace under President Obama\'s failed leadership, Iowans are managing to save for the future, invest in their local communities and live within their means.That\'s why my goal isn\'t to climb Mount Washington to take in the view from the heights. Rather, I\'m running for president to disrupt the established order, change the culture and make possible the real changes that this nation needs.I\'m familiar with this kind of challenge. When I got to Tallahassee as governor in January 1999, I called the city ""Mount Tallahassee"" because it was so remote from the people. But I took it on, and we ended the status quo. That made it possible to do some really big things: Balance budgets, cut taxes, rebuild reserves, reform education and make the state\'s government more efficient and more accountable.It\'s that record I plan to repeat when I take on Washington D.C.I will start with a demand for accountability. These past six years have seen government agencies and government leaders spend more, borrow more and fail more  and the keepers of Mount Washington have not bothered to survey the damage.There was the failure of healthcare.gov. The extended wait times for care at VA hospitals  and the lying to cover it up. The partisan abuses at the IRS, and another cover-up. The ignoring of warnings over cyberhacking at OPM, and the failure to prevent the loss of personnel records and security information for nearly 22 million people.And through it all, almost no accountability. That\'s what you get when you build a government that is as big as a mountain and acts like one.Now is time for a new approach: It starts by cutting off the oxygen to Mount Washington  the tax-spend-and borrow culture of Washington.In my time in office, we balanced eight budgets in a row and increased our state\'s reserves by 8 billion dollars. The state\'s bond rating was upgraded to AAA status. I cut the state bureaucracy by more than 10 percent, and put 16,000 government managers on at-will contracts, making them fully accountable for their decisions.I vetoed more than 2,500 spending items, producing $2 billion in savings, and I\'m glad somebody was keeping count. Legislators started calling me Veto Corleone. I also was the first governor to put an entire state budget online, keeping government out in the open, where it belongs.Here\'s how I think we can repeat this record in Washington D.C.: First, I will urge Congress to submit a balanced budget amendment to the states and let the people decide. Second, I would seek a constitutionally sound line-item veto.Third, I will push to budget the way most Americans do  start from zero every year, and end the assumption among government agencies that they are owed an increase just because the population and inflation went up.I will place a freeze on federal hiring, and only hire one new person for every three who leave. My goal will be to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent within 4 years, saving tens of billions of dollars, and without adding to unemployment.If we do these things, we will change the culture in Washington. And if we change the culture, we will be able to do some really big things: Bring the deficit down. Reform our tax code. Fix our broken immigration system. Double the pace of economic growth. Create 19 million new jobs.It\'s all possible, and it\'s all within reach.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 23, 2015",b'Press Release - Protect and Secure Medicare for Future Generations',"b'Democrats are trying to scare voters by lying about Jeb\'s position on Medicare. Here\'s what he really said, and here are the facts:""First and foremost, whenever you get into a conversation about reforming entitlements the first thing you can be guaranteed of is that the left will attack you and demonize youwe\'ve got to get beyond this because this is not a sustainable system. We need to protect [Medicare] for people that have it and we need to make sure that we reform it for people that are expecting it. As a great country we need to make sure that there\'s adequate access to healthcare. There are solutions to this.""  Jeb Bush, Gorham, New Hampshire, July 23, 2015Today, the Medicare Board of Trustees released its latest annual report, detailing how the looming fiscal crisis is serious and getting worse with the 75-year Medicare unfunded liability at an astronomical $28 trillion dollars.There is no question it is critical we take steps today to strengthen Medicare so it is preserved and available for future generations of Americans. Governor Bush is committed to strengthening Medicare in a fiscally conservative way that maintains our nation\'s social contract and improves choices and quality for our seniors.Unfortunately, Democrats for years have refused to engage in an honest discussion with voters about the state of the program\'s finances (with spending at $613 billion last year). Liberals\' constant distortions of Republicans\' support for saving Medicare is an effort to hide from the reality that they have failed at every opportunity to protect the program. Refusing to even acknowledge the problem is a politically expedient choice that jeopardizes the program itself for future generations.According to some estimates included in the Medicare trustee report today, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is at risk of insolvency by 2030. For anyone doubting the urgent need to fix Medicare, here are some other alarming findings from today\'s report:Action is needed now:""...current-law projections indicate that Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation. Such legislation should be enacted sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.""Trustees urge Washington to work together to save Medicare:""The Trustees recommend that Congress and the executive branch work closely together with a sense of urgency to address the depletion of the hospital insurance trust fund and the projected growth in hospital insurance (Part A) and SMI (Parts B and D) expenditures.""Doing nothing will sacrifice health care for seniors:""However, if the health sector cannot transition to more efficient models of care delivery and achieve productivity increases commensurate with economy-wide productivity, and if the provider reimbursement rates paid by commercial insurers continue to follow the same negotiated process used to date, then the availability and quality of health care received by Medicare beneficiaries would, under current law, fall over time relative to that received by those with private health insurance.""Medicare fails basic financial tests:""The estimated depletion date for the hospital insurance trust fund is 2030, the same as in last year\'s report. As in past years, the Trustees have determined that the fund is not adequately financed over the next 10 years. The hospital insurance trust fund has not met the Trustees\' formal test of short-range financial adequacy since 2003 Growth in hospital insurance expenditures has averaged 2.1 percent annually over the last 5 years and is projected to average 4.8 percent over the next 5 years.""""The Trustees project that hospital insurance tax income and other dedicated revenues will fall short of hospital insurance expenditures in most future years. The hospital insurance trust fund does not meet either the Trustees\' test of short-range financial adequacy or their test of long-range close actuarial balance.""Medicare\'s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund could be depleted as soon as 2022:""There is substantial uncertainty in the economic, demographic, and health care projection factors for hospital insurance trust fund expenditures and revenues. Accordingly, the date of hospital insurance trust fund depletion could differ substantially in either direction from the 2030 intermediate estimate. Under the low-cost assumptions, trust fund assets would start to increase throughout the entire projection period. Under the high-cost assumptions, however, asset depletion would occur in 2022.""'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 24, 2015",b'Press Release - Empowering Individuals With Disabilities',"b'Governor Bush published the following journal in IJ Review.Sunday marks the 25thanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which my Dad signed into law in 1990.Florida has a significant number of citizens who live, learn and work with disabilities, and it is my fundamental belief that they should be given opportunities to do so with support, respect and dignity. During my eight years in office, I worked to create policies and programs so that these citizens were no longer overlooked and they could enjoy greater independence and choice over the services they receive.I pressed for the creation of the McKay Scholarship Program, which provides scholarships for students with disabilities so they can attend an eligible public or private school of their choice. Before this program, students with disabilities had to accept whatever was offered to them by their local public school districts  and not surprisingly, many of these students and their families were treated poorly and taken for granted.The scholarship program changed that  and these students benefitted directly. The educational gains of our children with disabilities has outpaced those in other states since then. More than 28,000 McKay Scholarships were granted in the 2013-14 school year  and each one of these students is getting something that was their right: A quality education.Before I was governor, citizens with disabilities were handled by a hodgepodge of programs and sub-departments. Very little was coordinated, and there wasn\'t accountability. So I signed a law creating the state\'s Agency for Persons With Disabilities. This agency has changed the way our citizens are treated, and the quality of adult care, help with education, jobs and housing has increased dramatically.Every year I was in office, I attended a statewide summit on disabilities and disability issues. In our last year, more than 10,000 people attended  and I showed them that they weren\'t fighting for their rights alone or without a friend in the governor\'s office.""I showed them that they weren\'t fighting for their rights alone or without a friend in the governor\'s office.""We did some basic things, such as increasing the property tax exemption for disabled veterans and eliminating the fee to get a disabled parking permit.And we did some really transformative things. We invested in a waiver programs so people with disabilities could use their Medicaid resources for support programs to stay in their communities, near their families, rather than at costly institutions. This way, the money went for what our disabled citizens wanted, not what they were forced to accept.This program has enjoyed significant public support, from both Republicans and Democrats, and it\'s a model for the rest of the nation. What we achieved through this program wasn\'t just better services for those with disabilities. We proved that we get the best outcomes when we give individuals the ability to make decisions for themselves and hold providers accountable for the care they give.These are achievements I\'m proud of, but the work isn\'t done. And it\'s time we promote continued progress for Americans living with disabilities.I believe as a society we must work on behalf of those who are most vulnerable, and serve those who cannot always help themselves.In our schools, we need to work to create a safer and more inclusive culture for children with disabilities. Today, these children are subject to bullying, physical restraint and seclusion  often in violation of the law. Every child deserves the right to go to school and to learn without fearing pain or isolation. This is an outcome that every American  especially our school leaders  should take seriously. As someone with a long record on the issue of education reform, I look forward to addressing these issues directly as president.""Every child deserves the right to go to school and to learn without fearing pain or isolation. This is an outcome that every American  especially our school leaders  should take seriously.""At work, we need to do more to enhance opportunities for people with disabilities. When I was governor, I traveled the state and spoke directly with business owners and employers about the need to hire people with disabilities. These individuals have talents and skills to offer, and with the right effort to integrate them into daily operations, they can make a significant contribution to a growing business.To me, one of the greatest needs in our treatment of those living with disabilities is in the private sector  and it\'s up to each of us to look for opportunities to hire, train, retain and promote people with disabilities. Adaptive technologies are making these opportunities more possible, and as more businesses see how much value is created by people with disabilities, the more we will achieve on behalf of all Americans through greater growth, earned success and shared prosperity.These steps are the kinds of things we need to do to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act alive. We\'ve seen 25 years of progress  but we can\'t ignore all the things that still have to be done  and I intend to do everything I can to continue empowering individuals with disabilities.'"

In fact, Havana\'s repression of its citizens has continued despite the Obama administration\'s unilateral concessions, and in fact 75 democracy activists were arrested just last weekend. On Friday, Hillary Clinton will announce her support of President Obama\'s call to lift the Cuban embargo.Hillary Clinton was adamantly against easing restrictions with Cuba in 2000 and 2008, going so far as to confirm she would not meet with Raul Castro until there was evidence of political change. There has been no change  and this is just another example of Hillary Clinton putting political expediency ahead of doing what\'s right. Hillary Clinton and President Obama claim that our Cuba policy is a relic of history, but it\'s the Castro regime that is stuck in the cold war.

Immediately, the pessimistic Left said four percent growth wasn\'t possible  that anemic two percent economic growth was the ""new normal."" Yet those who dismissed Jeb\'s positive vision are the same Hillary Clinton allies calling for more of the same failed policies that have led to falling incomes and the lowest labor force participation rate since the 1970\'s.So why has Jeb insisted we set the bar at a level that would lift families out of poverty, create rising incomes and give middle class families their first pay raise in 15 years?He did it as Governor of Florida  better, in fact, than any other state chief executive seeking the presidency.This point was validated by Kevin Hassett, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, this week.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"July 30, 2015",b'Press Release - We Can End Unjust Barriers to Success for Urban Communities',"b'When Governor Bush took office, the state was one of the worst ranked in the country in K-12 education outcomes. Almost half the state\'s fourth graders were functionally illiterate and the high school graduation rate hovered around 50 percent. The situation was particularly alarming for African American children with only 37 percent of Black third graders reading at or above grade level in 2001. Clearly, Florida\'s students were struggling. Governor Bush was deeply concerned by these statistics.During that time two men saw firsthand the reforms Governor Bush put into place, and the impact they had on the children of Florida.T.

He has been President and Chief Executive Officer of the Urban League of Greater Miami for more than five decades.""Before Governor Bush became the governor that we love, the status of schools in Florida was bad. The status of schools in the community that I\'m concerned about were the worst in the state. Clearly, anyone who wanted to deliver to the children understood that you had to fix the education delivery system in order to get that done. When Jeb Bush began to talk about education, it excited my heart.""The schools were bad in my community simply because of the fact that no one believed that my children could learn. Since they believed that my children could not learn, they gave us resources that we did not need. They gave us nothing. They gave us the worst teachers. They give us the worst maintenance programs. They gave us the worst programs.""Bush was an unlikely ally because of my experiences in the system over the years had conditioned me to believe that if you\'re white, I can\'t trust you. If you are aligned with my attitudes, beliefs, and values, then I hold you suspect. So, I was a little concerned about this guy that I had never met before who all of a sudden was saying the same things that I wanted everybody to say.""The first day I met him, my attitude about change of Jeb Bush began to take place, and I learned a lesson for the first time with Jeb Bush. It is unfair for me to condemn people before I know them and I got a chance to know Jeb Bush. In my first meeting, I thought it was going to last for 15 minutes. It lasted for an hour-and-a-half, and twenty years later, we\'re still having that wonderful meeting.""I\'ve been around a lot of folks who are not for real, so I knew that Jeb Bush was for real when we began to have our conversation. In that hour-and-a-half, I had an opportunity to dispel all of my myths about this guy called Jeb Bush.""I believe that at the end of the day, those persons, collectively or individually, who understand that you rise in America no longer because of the color of your skin, but you rise in America because of your academic achievement. Jeb believes that. I believe that. That makes us brothers.""Jeb Bush is special to me because you can take his work to the bank. I\'m probably the only black person in Liberty City who did not vote for Barack Obama. I tell people that I said, \'Because I don\'t trust him. I trust Jeb Bush. That\'s why I would vote for him.""Jeb Bush keeps his word.""He is a man of faith. He believes that there\'s something greater than him that guides him and protects him. He loves his family. Nothing comes before his family. He is honest, full of integrity. You couldn\'t ask for a better friend.""Don GaetzFormer Superintendent of Okaloosa County School District (1994-2006)Florida Republican State Senator Don Gaetz (District 1) was Superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District when Jeb Bush was Governor of Florida. The two met when Jeb was researching what was wrong with Florida\'s public schools.""When Jeb Bush was running for Governor of Florida, before he ran, he went all over the State to listen before he led, to listen to what teachers said and what parents said and spent a lot of time with students.""When he came to my county, he sat in a caf that didn\'t have anybody in it except Jeb Bush and me and our congressmen. He sat there with me for an hour, just listening to what I, as a candidate for school board, was hearing from students and teachers and parents. He took copious notes and he promised me: \'I\'ll be back; I\'ll be back as Governor. We\'ll do the right thing. Our students will do better. Our schools will soar and Don, I\'m going to hold you accountable.\' And he did.""I was one of the adults running a school system, and elected superintendent, and I had to face the tough realities that, even in our school system, which we thought was pretty good, it really wasn\'t so good.""We had to make significant changes in our curriculum. We had to lash our curriculum to the realities of the economy. We had to listen to what parents wanted and then try to re-raft and re-architecture our schools around what would make students successful. It was Jeb Bush, leading from the front, pushing us along, inspiring us, providing the resources, but never ever giving up, especially on children who needed more help to learn.""Jeb Bush is always the happy warrior. He always goes into every fight with a grin on his face, because he is just that kind of a guy. But the only times that I\'ve really ever seen him angry, to see his eyes turn tight, it\'s when somebody says that a poor kid or a minority kid can\'t learn, or that a disabled child has to be relegated over to the side.""Those were the students that Jeb Bush cared about first. Jeb Bush had no patience for people who would push kids off to the side just because they had socio-economic challenges. Those were the ones he wanted to help first and part of it was making sure we had high standards and effective teaching.""Florida started out with only 21% of schools that were high performing, given either an A or a B. By the time he left office, it was up to 74%: almost 3/4 of the state\'s schools were high performing.""There are a lot of people running for president, good people, I\'m sure, and you know, a lot of politicians when they run for office talk about problems. Jeb Bush is somebody who doesn\'t just talk about problems, he seizes opportunities and uses conservative leadership to create real solutions. That what he did for education in Florida.""'"

It will require fixing a few really big complex things, the tax code, how we regulate, embracing the energy revolution with a North American strategy that will allow for high wage jobs to be created in our own country and fixing entitlementsalong with moving from a broken legal immigration system to an economic driver. All those things could allow us to grow at a faster rate. It allows us to solve our entitlement challenges and many other things. And in order to grow at that rate we also need a secure world. I think have the leadership skills based on my record to do it. We cut taxes totaling $19 billion, reduced the state government work force by 13,000, 11%, we created, we were one of two states to go to triple a bond rating in my time.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 3, 2015",b'Press Release - Securing the Border and Enforcing Our Immigration Laws',"b'When Clint Bolick and I published Immigration Wars in 2013, we presented a number of proposals to strengthen America\'s immigration policy. Border security and the interior enforcement of immigration laws, including a greater role for states, formed key parts of this package of reforms. We emphasized that finding a practical solution to the status of the people who are here illegally today is a nonstarter if our borders are not secure against future illegal immigration.I believe that for those already in the country, we need to put in place a rigorous path that requires individuals to pass a thorough criminal background check, pay fines, pay taxes, learn English, obtain a provisional work permit and work, not receive federal government assistance, and over an extended period of time earn legal status. But any plan to address the status of illegal immigrants must be accompanied by a robust strategy to improve border security.Securing the border is possible, but it will require Washington to move beyond divisive rhetoric. The following six proposals offer concrete steps that the federal government should take to help secure the border and enforce our immigration laws. We must transform immigration from a broken system into one that benefits every American.Border Security1. A forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats.In some cases, it takes Border Patrol agents over an hour to get to the remote and rugged areas they need to patrol. Creating more forward-operating bases maximizes agents\' time on the border by stationing them there (much like a fire station) for multiple days at a time. We also have to interdict drugs and people as close to the border as possible by using quick reaction teams that go after the threat the moment it crosses the border. An approach to border security that waits until illicit traffic is miles into the interior of the country effectively cedes sovereign U.S. territory to the cartels and smugglers. These forward-leaning Border Patrol agents should be at the front line of a multi-layered ""defense in depth"" where additional lines of defense increase the likelihood of detecting and apprehending illegal crossers.The Border Patrol also must have the flexibility to deploy resources as needed. The flow of illegal immigrants can and will shift over time. For example, in the mid-2000s, the Tucson, Arizona sector saw the most traffic based on the number of apprehensions; after we applied more resources, people went to less secure areas of the border, such as the Rio Grande Valley sector in South Texas. Our border security posture must be as nimble as the cartels\' ability to shift operations to a different area.2. Use new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border. Having the ability to detect illegal crossings is necessary to secure the border. In order to apprehend a person, you first have to know when and where a crossing occurs. That is one of the biggest problems right nowwe do not have enough surveillance on the border and we are being beaten without knowing it. We can leverage technology to constantly watch the border, develop intelligence, and put our agents and resources where they are most effective at preventing and apprehending illicit border crossers.Technology, such as drones, advanced sensors, and radar, can give our agents a fuller picture of the illegal activity that in turn will enable the country to better allocate resources on the border. More than that, technology can make securing the border safer for our agents who will not have to respond to false alarms. And because the cartels do extensive counter-surveillance on our agents through the use of spotters who report on the movement of the Border Patrol, we need to keep them guessing by using mobile technology.3. Bolster border infrastructure and improve access to federal lands.Road construction and maintenance can provide agents access to areas of the border that would otherwise go unpatrolled. New roads are needed on the border to secure access to remote and rugged terrain to interdict smugglers, and respond to the detection of illicit traffic by technology. Likewise, new boat ramps can provide Border Patrol riverine units more points to put their vessels in the water so they can patrol more effectively.As noted in Immigration Wars, fencing is a component of border security. When combined with surveillance technology and agents to detect and respond to crossings, fencing or other barriers can serve several purposes, including: (1) deterring illegal entries by making it more difficult to cross the border, (2) facilitating enforcement by increasing the time available to respond and apprehend people, and (3) steering dangerous criminals and traffickers away from populated areas, improving public safety. Sufficient funding should be provided to maintain, improve, and expand fences where appropriate (e.g., based on the terrain along the border or the proximity of populated areas).Access to federal lands is another key part of improving access to border areas. Currently, agents have to navigate byzantine environmental rules and regulations to access federal lands, which make up a large portion of the southwest border. Removing these restrictions would help untie the hands of our agents to patrol every inch of the border.Interior Enforcement4. Require electronic verification of employment eligibility.Many illegal immigrants come to the United States for jobs and, despite the prohibition on hiring illegal immigrants, they are hired in large numbers. If we decrease the likelihood of being employed, crossing the border will be less rewarding. However, the current I-9 system does not effectively prevent the hiring of illegal workers. We need a strong E-Verify system to ensure that American businesses are not hiring illegal immigrants. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. Employers should not be penalized if they use E-Verify in good faith and receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. Identity theft protections are also necessary. Finally, with an improved E-Verify, the government must enforce penalties for violations.5. Identify and send home the people who are entering the United States and overstaying their visas or otherwise violating the terms of their admission.In its widely-cited 2006 review, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that nearly half of all illegal immigrants living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport and overstayed their visas. While we need to find a practical solution to the status of people who are here illegally today, as we secure the border going forward, we also need to identify and send home the people who enter the country legally but overstay their visas or otherwise violate the terms of their admission.Unfortunately, without a system in place to track adequately who has actually left the country, it is difficult to know who these individuals are. A biometric exit system must be rapidly implemented so that immigration and national security officials know with certainty who is, and is not, in this country.We also need to increase federal resources dedicated to overstay enforcement. In FY 2012, the federal agency that investigates overstay cases, among other activities, spent less than 2 percent of their time on these cases.Furthermore, we need to create intergovernmental task forces to locate and apprehend overstays, especially those who present public safety risks. With proper training and supervision, state and local police could augment federal agents because they know their communities and have more boots on the ground.6. Crack down on sanctuary cities that undermine efforts to enforce immigration laws.We should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws and make sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. We should also expand federal partnerships that train state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, particularly in jails and prisons. When I was Governor of Florida, the state was a trailblazer in working with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. In 2002, Florida signed the first agreement with the federal government under the Section 287(g) program, which trains state and local police to help enforce immigration laws.These six proposals, when combined with a rigorous path to earned legal status, would realistically and honestly address the status of the 11 million people here illegally today and protect against future illegal immigration. While passions run high on this issue, there is no rational plan to deport millions of people that the American people would support. It would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The policies I am advocating can ultimately receive bipartisan support in Congress and become law. President Obama has had six-and-a-half years to address our broken immigration system. Instead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country. One has to ask whether he is more interested in providing a wedge issue for his party than offering a solution for the country. There should be no doubt where I stand. I am committed to addressing the problem of illegal immigration in a comprehensive fashion so we can respond to the legitimate concerns of the American people and build stronger support for legal immigration, which if done properly can be a catalyst to bring us to strong, sustained economic growth that will benefit every American.'"

We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace. Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail.""""So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary? That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill  and that Iran has exploited to the full as well. ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.""Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton  the storied \'team of rivals\'  took office? So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else\'s problem.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 17, 2015","b""Press Release - Honoring U.S. Veterans: Keeping America's Promises to Those Who Have Served""","b'At the core of America\'s military strength are the men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. We have no greater asset than our service members or greater responsibility than ensuring they are well provided for  while they are in uniform and throughout their lives.Recent revelations of grave conditions at facilities throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs\' health care system have brought to light the failed leadership of the Obama Administration to serve those who have served our nation.Reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), fixing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and improving services to veterans across the board must be a top priority for the next President of the United States.Jeb\'s Florida Record:Florida has the third largest veterans population in the country.[i] As Governor, Jeb made military families and veterans a signature issue. He increased the number of state veterans\' homes from two to six.[ii] He increased property tax exemptions for disabled veterans (from $500 to $5,000) and eliminated the fee to get a disabled parking permit.[iii] Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature created an employment advocacy and assistance program for military spouses and dependents.[iv]He also passed laws that provide free undergraduate tuition at state colleges and universities to Florida recipients of the Purple Heart (and combat-related decorations ranked superior in precedence to the Purple Heart) and their children.[v]Jeb can reform veterans\' services and care and expand opportunities for them because he\'s done it before.Jeb can reform veterans\' services and care and expand opportunities for them because he\'s done it before.Jeb\'s Seven-Step Plan to Keep America\'s Promises to Our Veterans: Improve the Veterans Health Administration by Enhancing Care and Expanding Veterans Choice Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality Services Modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs Create More Opportunities for Veterans Restore Military Troop Levels Improve Healthcare for Female Veterans Honor Veterans\' ServiceOverhaul the Veterans Health Administration to Expand Veterans\' Choices and Enhance CareTaxpayers entrust the Veterans Health Administration to care for our returning warriors. Unfortunately, the VA is long overdue for reform and a recommitment to its core mission. Veterans should be treated by a doctor and at a clinic of their choosing, not at the discretion of federal bureaucrats. Those who choose to use the VA system must have timely access to top-notch medical services.Jeb\'s PlanCurrently, only certain veterans are allowed to choose their doctor  those who can\'t get an appointment within 30 days and those living 40 miles or more from a VA health facility.[vi] That number should be broadened and limitations to private access reduced. If a veteran wants to see a neighborhood physician, he or she has earned that choice. The VA must remain the guarantor of that choice and that care.The challenge in expanding the choice program is in the cost and outreach. Approximately 30,000 veterans have opted to use the program, a paltry number given the nearly 9 million veterans who use VA hospitals.[vii] Though the program is still new, the VA has not sufficiently encouraged veterans to participate. Cost is also a problem. Although total VA funding grew by nearly 73 percent since 2009, the VA ran out of money in 2015.[viii] While it is unconscionable that the VA still can\'t afford to provide reasonable options for veterans, the fact remains that choice is expensive and there needs to be a way to pay for it.With budgetary concerns in mind, increasing choice cannot come at the expense of veterans receiving care at the VA. Despite well-documented problems with VA administrators, many veterans prefer to receive their care at VA hospitals. And many VA facilities specialize in care like post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and prosthetics.""We don\'t have the money"" is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.""We don\'t have the money"" is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.The solution is to reform the VA, and redirect those savings into veterans care. This includes cutting excess administrators (not caregivers) through Jeb\'s \'3-out, 1-in\' proposal, and improving practices so that we eliminate billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, we must fire bureaucrats who refuse to make bidding for VA contracts competitive (as required by law), improve whistleblower protections by accelerating the conferring of whistleblower status and disciplining bosses who retaliate against whistleblowers and remove the VA from missions unrelated to veteran services, such as construction. A whistleblower said that the VA misspent as much as $5 billion in outside care contracts that did not meet requirements for competition. Those funds were misspent in violation of federal law, and included gross overpayments in pharmaceuticals, services, and procurement.Ample resources exist within the VA budget to improve the quality and scope of care. Annual targets for reform savings and choice expansion should be set. Targeted increases in choice would be tied to savings achieved through reform. In other government agencies, commonsense reforms have saved billions. The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.Further, steps must be made to address the wait list for care. Congress and Veteran Service Organizations have put several proposals forth to lower the wait for appointments, and many of them are worthy of careful consideration. In the short term, VA pharmacies should be allowed to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. The current practice requires that all medication be approved in-house, often requiring a VA doctor to confirm the opinion of a veteran\'s private doctor. This is a redundancy that extends wait times for veterans in need.Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality ServicesThe VA Secretary said last year, ""I can\'t just walk into the room and fire someone.""[ix] If a VA employee is guilty of incompetence severe enough that a veteran loses his life, the Secretary should be able to do exactly that.The problem is that the VA, like the federal government writ large, is beholden to both complex union contracts and a broken civil service system. These impediments make it nearly impossible for managers to discipline or fire employees. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, it takes an average of six months to a year to fire a government employee.[x] And after firing, the employee can appeal that decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Then the MSPB process can add many more months before finality of the employment action.The Veterans Choice Access and Accountability Act of 2014 created a new way to remove career Senior Executives (SES), based upon performance or misconduct within the Department. Unfortunately, the law only applies to Senior Executive Service (SES) employees  roughly 370 of VA\'s 300,000-employee workforce.[xi]Jeb\'s PlanIt will take the will of leadership to truly hold employees accountable, which thus far has not been demonstrated by President Obama\'s Administration.The firing authority provided by the Choice Act should apply to all VA employees, especially those who engage in any conduct that results in a lapse of care for a veteran, or are responsible for waste, fraud, and abuse. Further, paid administrative leave for disciplinary investigations should be limited to 14 days per year.The VA has also treated whistleblowers shamefully. To correct this, the timeline for deciding whistleblower status should be accelerated, new whistleblower protections added, and new disciplinary procedures for managers who retaliate against whistleblowers should be established.Further reforms to the SES at VA are needed. This should include the ability to rescind an employee\'s pension if convicted of a felony related to VA, and the authority to rescind a bonus at any time.The point is not to simply punish those who fail, but reward the overwhelming number of VA employees who have devoted their lives to serving veterans. If a VA employee fails in his or her mission, to \'care for those who have borne the battle,\' they must step aside or be removed so that talented employees can rise up.Modernize the Department of Veterans AffairsThe VA still operates under archaic practices and procedures, despite spending around $4Bn on information technology annually. It has struggled to adapt to the 21st century. In an era of high speed Internet, revolutionary advances in medicine, fiber optics and interconnectivity, the VA can still take months to deliver care and responses that could be transmitted in seconds.Jeb\'s PlanOne of the key problems with the wait-list manipulation scandal in 2014 was that the VA relied on an antiquated and unreliable scheduling software system. The software was old and susceptible to falsification. New software is more than capable of eliminating those vulnerabilities and improving the VA user experience.In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle. The current online system is difficult to use, especially for older veterans.In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle.There are also obstacles to refilling prescriptions online, a feature available at most pharmacies nationwide. While the VA does have a system set up for online prescription refills, it is poorly designed. The VA should explore public-private partnerships to replace shoddy software.Veterans have gone too long without a secure online credential that proves their status as veterans. The current system requires a paper copy of the DD-214, a form used to verify service and military discharge. The VA should team with the private sector to create a single, safe credential for veterans that verifies their service and eligibility for benefits.This credential would be provided as they separate from service. Such credentialing could allow a faster admission to veterans eligible for the choice program, allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online. In person, a veteran should be able to pull out a smart phone and prove their service with a few touches of the screen.The problems at the VA are not purely software issues. While it has failed to adapt as quickly as it should to technological advances, the VA still uses out-of-date practices that have outlived their usefulness.An obvious example is that of hospital construction. A new hospital in Denver, Colorado was estimated at $800 million in construction costs. A new estimate is $1.7 billion dollars, nearly a billion over budget.[xii] The VA has no business being in the construction industry. It should stick to tending to the wounded. The practice is outmoded and would be better accomplished by more relevant federal agencies.Create More Opportunities for VeteransWhile veterans\' unemployment has dropped in recent years, nearly 600,000 veterans were still unemployed in 2014.[xiii] Almost 550 service-members transition from the military daily, and approximately one million veterans will rejoin civilian society in the next 3-5 years.[xiv]Jeb\'s PlanOnly 48 percent of working age veterans use their GI Bill benefits, and only 52 percent of those veterans complete their field of study.[xv] But veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self-employed than non-veterans, and $1.2 trillion in sales is generated from 2.4 million veteran-owned businesses  which represent nearly 9 percent of all U.S. small businesses.[xvi]A way to both reduce underuse and misuse of GI benefits is to allow the GI bill to be used to insure a small business loan. Eligible veterans could borrow against their earned GI bill benefits to start a small business, in lieu of using it for education.Restore Troop LevelsWhile veterans\' benefits have rightly been protected from the Budget Control Act and Sequestration, the impact has still been felt at VA facilities. Active duty members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) hit a high point in 2010 with 1.4 million members.[xvii] Under current defense cuts, it is set to drop to 1.2 million by 2019.[xviii]Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.Jeb\'s PlanWhile the military cuts should be reversed for purely strategic security reasons, the fact stands that the sheer number of service members leaving service is overwhelming the VA. The Pentagon needs more soldiers and the VA is inundated with new veterans. Ending the rapid troop drawdown is a simple, pragmatic solution to both problems.Improve Healthcare for Female VeteransFully 15 percent of active duty and 18 percent of National Guard and Reserves forces are women, with projections saying those percentages will grow.[xix] In contrast, the percentage of women in uniform was just 2 percent in 1950.[xx] Under modern combat policies, women are serving in hostile areas in increasing numbers and are incurring critical injuries at levels similar to their male counterparts.However, since the VHA has been historically orientated to care for men, women have received fewer immunizations, fewer cancer screenings, and fewer mental health screenings than their male counterparts.[xxi]Jeb\'s PlanIt\'s time to improve healthcare services for female veterans. That starts by preparing for the further growth in the female veterans population with responsive programs in organization, staff, and training  including in obstetrics, gynecology, and specializations in ovarian and breast cancer.The agency underwent an assessment in 2012 to measure the quality of care for the growing population of female veterans.[xxii] That was a welcome step. However, more must be done, particularly when it comes to engaging the female veterans population and making them aware of the care options available to them, including in the area of mental health services as the long-term behavioral health effects of traumatic brain injury and PTSD are not yet known.Military service members will be facing these challenges long after they have separated and will require care as veterans. The VA needs to ramp their behavioral health services and resources.Honor Veterans\' ServiceOne obstacle to a successful transition from military to civilian life is the stereotype of the wounded, helpless vet overcome with issues like anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Many well-intentioned programs have unintentionally fed into the narrative of the ""broken hero."" Polling suggests this has had a tangible effect on an employer\'s willingness to hire veterans, despite the fact that they generally outperform non-veterans in the workplace.[xxiii]Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that.Jeb\'s PlanJeb is committed to using the bully pulpit of a national election and his presidency to honor the service and character of America\'s veterans. Their many virtues commitment, loyalty, reliability, and integrity will be highlighted, as well as how those merits inject value into communities and businesses. Organizations like Team Rubicon and Hire Heroes recognize that the best way to help veterans is to offer them a noble purpose and the dignity of a rewarding career. They should be acknowledged. Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that. This will be a priority of his first term in office and beyond.[i] Employment Situation of Veterans-2014, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2015, Table 6A, http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/vet.pdf.[ii] Florida Veterans\' Benefits Guide, 2014, Page 12-13, http://www.floridaveteransfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Veterans-Benefit-Guide-2014.pdf[iii] Letter: Jeb Bush supports veterans, The St. Augustine Record, November, 2002, http://staugustine.com/stories/111302/opi_kr002583.shtml.Gov.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 17, 2015",b'Press Release - Medal of Honor Recipients Endorsing Jeb for President',"b'Kyle Carpenter, USMC, AfghanistanRank: CorporalFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Automatic Rifleman with Company F, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, Regimental Combat Team 1, 1st Marine Division (Forward), 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), in Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom on 21 November 2010. Lance Corporal Carpenter was a member of a platoon-sized coalition force, comprised of two reinforced Marine squads partnered with an Afghan National Army squad. The platoon had established Patrol Base Dakota two days earlier in a small village in the Marjah District in order to disrupt enemy activity and provide security for the local Afghan population. Lance Corporal Carpenter and a fellow Marine were manning a rooftop security position on the perimeter of Patrol Base Dakota when the enemy initiated a daylight attack with hand grenades, one of which landed inside their sandbagged position. Without hesitation, and with complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Carpenter moved toward the grenade in an attempt to shield his fellow Marine from the deadly blast. When the grenade detonated, his body absorbed the brunt of the blast, severely wounding him, but saving the life of his fellow Marine. By his undaunted courage, bold fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death, Lance Corporal Carpenter reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.James Livingston, USMC, VietnamRank: Major GeneralStatement: ""Governor Bush\'s strong record on veteran\'s issues makes him the best choice to serve as our next Commander in Chief. We need a strong leader with executive experience who knows how to lead in a dangerous world while also maintaining the highest standard of care for our veterans back home. Jeb Bush is that leader.""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as Commanding Officer, Company E, in action against enemy forces. Company E launched a determined assault on the heavily fortified village of Dai Do, which had been seized by the enemy on the preceding evening isolating a marine company from the remainder of the battalion. Skillfully employing screening agents, Capt. Livingston maneuvered his men to assault positions across 500 meters of dangerous open rice paddy while under intense enemy fire. Ignoring hostile rounds impacting near him, he fearlessly led his men in a savage assault against enemy emplacements within the village. While adjusting supporting arms fire, Capt. Livingston moved to the points of heaviest resistance, shouting words of encouragement to his Marines, directing their fire, and spurring the dwindling momentum of the attack on repeated occasions. Although twice painfully wounded by grenade fragments, he refused medical treatment and courageously led his men in the destruction of over 100 mutually supporting bunkers, driving the remaining enemy from their positions, and relieving the pressure on the stranded marine company. As the 2 companies consolidated positions and evacuated casualties, a third company passed through the friendly lines launching an assault on the adjacent village of Dinh To, only to be halted by a furious counterattack of an enemy battalion. Swiftly assessing the situation and disregarding the heavy volume of enemy fire, Capt. Livingston boldly maneuvered the remaining effective men of his company forward, joined forces with the heavily engaged Marines, and halted the enemy\'s counterattack Wounded a third time and unable to walk, he steadfastly remained in the dangerously exposed area, deploying his men to more tenable positions and supervising the evacuation of casualties. Only when assured of the safety of his men did he allow himself to be evacuated. Capt. Livingston\'s gallant actions uphold the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the U.S. Naval Service.Hal Fritz, USA, VietnamRank: Lieutenant ColonelStatement: ""I most enthusiastically endorse Jeb for president. He\'s demonstrated that he is a true American patriot dedicated to projecting, protecting and preserving equality and freedom for all Americans!""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Capt. (then 1st Lt.) Fritz, Armor, U.S. Army, distinguished himself while serving as a platoon leader with Troop A, near Quan Loi. Capt. Fritz was leading his 7-vehicle armored column along Highway 13 to meet and escort a truck convoy when the column suddenly came under intense crossfire from a reinforced enemy company deployed in ambush positions. In the initial attack, Capt. Fritz\' vehicle was hit and he was seriously wounded. Realizing that his platoon was completely surrounded, vastly outnumbered, and in danger of being overrun, Capt. Fritz leaped to the top of his burning vehicle and directed the positioning of his remaining vehicles and men. With complete disregard for his wounds and safety, he ran from vehicle to vehicle in complete view of the enemy gunners in order to reposition his men, to improve the defenses, to assist the wounded, to distribute ammunition, to direct fire, and to provide encouragement to his men. When a strong enemy force assaulted the position and attempted to overrun the platoon, Capt. Fritz manned a machine gun and through his exemplary action inspired his men to deliver intense and deadly fire which broke the assault and routed the attackers. Moments later a second enemy force advanced to within 2 meters of the position and threatened to overwhelm the defenders. Capt. Fritz, armed only with a pistol and bayonet, led a small group of his men in a fierce and daring charge which routed the attackers and inflicted heavy casualties. When a relief force arrived, Capt. Fritz saw that it was not deploying effectively against the enemy positions, and he moved through the heavy enemy fire to direct its deployment against the hostile positions. This deployment forced the enemy to abandon the ambush site and withdraw. Despite his wounds, Capt. Fritz returned to his position, assisted his men, and refused medical attention until all of his wounded comrades had been treated and evacuated. The extraordinary courage and selflessness displayed by Capt. Fritz, at the repeated risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect the greatest credit upon himself, his unit, and the Armed Forces.Jay Vargas, USMC, VietnamRank: ColonelStatement: ""Right now this country needs a leader. And Jeb is the only one with the experience and the leadership to do it.""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as commanding officer, Company G, in action against enemy forces from 30 April to 2 May 1968. On 1 May 1968, though suffering from wounds he had incurred while relocating his unit under heavy enemy fire the preceding day, Maj. Vargas combined Company G with two other companies and led his men in an attack on the fortified village of Dai Do. Exercising expert leadership, he maneuvered his Marines across 700 meters of open rice paddy while under intense enemy mortar, rocket and artillery fire and obtained a foothold in two hedgerows on the enemy perimeter, only to have elements of his company become pinned down by the intense enemy fire. Leading his reserve platoon to the aid of his beleaguered men, Maj. Vargas inspired his men to renew their relentless advance, while destroying a number of enemy bunkers. Again wounded by grenade fragments, he refused aid as he moved about the hazardous area reorganizing his unit into a strong defense perimeter at the edge of the village. Shortly after the objective was secured the enemy commenced a series of counterattacks and probes which lasted throughout the night but were unsuccessful as the gallant defenders of Company G stood firm in their hard-won enclave. Reinforced the following morning, the Marines launched a renewed assault through Dai Do on the village of Dinh To, to which the enemy retaliated with a massive counterattack resulting in hand to hand combat. Maj. Vargas remained in the open, encouraging and rendering assistance to his Marines when he was hit for the third time in the 3-day battle. Observing his battalion commander sustain a serious wound, he disregarded his excruciating pain, crossed the fire swept area and carried his commander to a covered position, then resumed supervising and encouraging his men while simultaneously assisting in organizing the battalion\'s perimeter defense. His gallant actions uphold the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the U.S. Naval Service.Al Rascon, USA, VietnamRank: Lieutenant ColonelSpecialist Four Alfred Rascon, distinguished himself by a series of extraordinarily courageous acts on 16 March 1966, while assigned as a medic to the Reconnaissance Platoon, Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade (Separate). While moving to reinforce its sister battalion under intense enemy attack, the Reconnaissance Platoon came under heavy fire from a numerically superior enemy force. The intense enemy fire from crew-served weapons and grenades severely wounded several point squad soldiers. Specialist Rascon, ignoring directions to stay behind shelter until covering fire could be provided, made his way forward. He repeatedly tried to reach the severely wounded point machine-gunner laying on an open enemy trail, but was driven back each time by the withering fire. Disregarding his personal safety, he jumped to his feet, ignoring flying bullets and exploding grenades to reach his comrade. To protect him from further wounds, he intentionally placed his body between the soldier and enemy machine guns, sustaining numerous shrapnel injuries and a serious wound to the hip. Disregarding his serious wounds he dragged the larger soldier from the fire-raked trail. Hearing the second machine-gunner yell that he was running out of ammunition, Specialist Rascon, under heavy enemy fire crawled back to the wounded machine-gunner stripping him of his bandoleers of ammunition, giving them to the machine-gunner who continued his suppressive fire. Specialist Rascon fearing the abandoned machine gun, its ammunition and spare barrel could fall into enemy hands made his way to retrieve them. On the way, he was wounded in the face and torso by grenade fragments, but disregarded these wounds to recover the abandoned machine gun, ammunition and spare barrel items, enabling another soldier to provide added suppressive fire to the pinned-down squad. In searching for the wounded, he saw the point grenadier being wounded by small arms fire and grenades being thrown at him. Disregarding his own life and his numerous wounds, Specialist Rascon reached and covered him with his body absorbing the blasts from the exploding grenades, and saving the soldier\'s life, but sustaining additional wounds to his body. While making his way to the wounded point squad leader, grenades were hurled at the sergeant. Again, in complete disregard for his own life, he reached and covered the sergeant with his body, absorbing the full force of the grenade explosions. Once more Specialist Rascon was critically wounded by shrapnel, but disregarded his own wounds to continue to search and aid the wounded. Severely wounded, he remained on the battlefield, inspiring his fellow soldiers to continue the battle. After the enemy broke contact, he disregarded aid for himself, instead treating the wounded and directing their evacuation. Only after being placed on the evacuation helicopter did he allow aid to be given to him. Specialist Rascon\'s extraordinary valor in the face of deadly enemy fire, his heroism in rescuing the wounded, and his gallantry by repeatedly risking his own life for his fellow soldiers are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.Leo Thorsness, USAF, Vietnam, former Prisoner of WarRank: ColonelStatement:  ""Jeb wants the best for our military men and women. He wants to build up our Armed Forces after years of neglect. And he\'s put a special focus on caring for our returning troops. Over the years, the military has had no better friend than the Bush family.""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. As pilot of an F- 105 aircraft, Lt. Col. Thorsness was on a surface-to-air missile suppression mission over North Vietnam. Lt. Col. Thorsness and his wingman attacked and silenced a surface-to-air missile site with air-to-ground missiles, and then destroyed a second surface-to-air missile site with bombs. In tile attack on the second missile site, Lt. Col. Thorsness\' wingman was shot down by intensive antiaircraft fire, and the 2 crewmembers abandoned their aircraft. Lt. Col. Thorsness circled the descending parachutes to keep the crewmembers in sight and relay their position to the Search and Rescue Center. During this maneuver, a MIG-17 was sighted in the area. Lt. Col. Thorsness immediately initiated an attack and destroyed the MIG. Because his aircraft was low on fuel, he was forced to depart the area in search of a tanker. Upon being advised that 2 helicopters were orbiting over the downed crew\'s position and that there were hostile MlGs in the area posing a serious threat to the helicopters, Lt. Col. Thorsness, despite his low fuel condition, decided to return alone through a hostile environment of surface-to-air missile and antiaircraft defenses to the downed crew\'s position. As he approached the area, he spotted 4 MIG-17 aircraft and immediately initiated an attack on the MlGs, damaging 1 and driving the others away from the rescue scene. When it became apparent that an aircraft in the area was critically low on fuel and the crew would have to abandon the aircraft unless they could reach a tanker, Lt. Col. Thorsness, although critically short on fuel himself, helped to avert further possible loss of life and a friendly aircraft by recovering at a forward operating base, thus allowing the aircraft in emergency fuel condition to refuel safely. Lt. Col. Thorsness\' extraordinary heroism, self-sacrifice, and personal bravery involving conspicuous risk of life were in the highest traditions of the military service, and have reflected great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.Bruce P. Crandall, USA, VietnamRank: ColonelFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Major Bruce P. Crandall distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism as a Flight Commander in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). On 14 November 1965, his flight of sixteen helicopters was lifting troops for a search and destroy mission from Plei Me, Vietnam, to Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley. On the fourth troop lift, the airlift began to take enemy fire, and by the time the aircraft had refueled and returned for the next troop lift, the enemy had Landing Zone X-Ray targeted. As Major Crandall and the first eight helicopters landed to discharge troops on his fifth troop lift, his unarmed helicopter came under such intense enemy fire that the ground commander ordered the second flight of eight aircraft to abort their mission. As Major Crandall flew back to Plei Me, his base of operations, he determined that the ground commander of the besieged infantry battalion desperately needed more ammunition. Major Crandall then decided to adjust his base of operations to Artillery Firebase Falcon in order to shorten the flight distance to deliver ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers. While medical evacuation was not his mission, he immediately sought volunteers and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, led the two aircraft to Landing Zone X-Ray. Despite the fact that the landing zone was still under relentless enemy fire, Major Crandall landed and proceeded to supervise the loading of seriously wounded soldiers aboard his aircraft. Major Crandall\'s voluntary decision to land under the most extreme fire instilled in the other pilots the will and spirit to continue to land their own aircraft, and in the ground forces the realization that they would be resupplied and that friendly wounded would be promptly evacuated. This greatly enhanced morale and the will to fight at a critical time. After his first medical evacuation, Major Crandall continued to fly into and out of the landing zone throughout the day and into the evening. That day he completed a total of 22 flights, most under intense enemy fire, retiring from the battlefield only after all possible service had been rendered to the Infantry battalion. His actions provided critical resupply of ammunition and evacuation of the wounded. Major Crandall\'s daring acts of bravery and courage in the face of an overwhelming and determined enemy are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.Robert Modrzejewski, USMC, VietnamRank: ColonelFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. On 15 July, during Operation HASTINGS, Company K was landed in an enemy-infested jungle area to establish a blocking position at a major enemy trail network. Shortly after landing, the company encountered a reinforced enemy platoon in a well-organized, defensive position. Maj. Modrzejewski led his men in the successful seizure of the enemy redoubt, which contained large quantities of ammunition and supplies. That evening, a numerically superior enemy force counterattacked in an effort to retake the vital supply area, thus setting the pattern of activity for the next 2 1/2 days. In the first series of attacks, the enemy assaulted repeatedly in overwhelming numbers but each time was repulsed by the gallant Marines. The second night, the enemy struck in battalion strength, and Maj. Modrzejewski was wounded in this intensive action which was fought at close quarters. Although exposed to enemy fire, and despite his painful wounds, he crawled 200 meters to provide critically needed ammunition to an exposed element of his command and was constantly present wherever the fighting was heaviest, despite numerous casualties, a dwindling supply of ammunition and the knowledge that they were surrounded, he skillfully directed artillery fire to within a few meters of his position and courageously inspired the efforts of his company in repelling the aggressive enemy attack. On 18 July, Company K was attacked by a regimental-size enemy force. Although his unit was vastly outnumbered and weakened by the previous fighting, Maj. Modrzejewski reorganized his men and calmly moved among them to encourage and direct their efforts to heroic limits as they fought to overcome the vicious enemy onslaught. Again he called in air and artillery strikes at close range with devastating effect on the enemy, which together with the bold and determined fighting of the men of Company K, repulsed the fanatical attack of the larger North Vietnamese force. His unparalleled personal heroism and indomitable leadership inspired his men to a significant victory over the enemy force and reflected great credit upon himself, the Marine Corps, and the U.S. Naval Service.James Taylor, USA, VietnamRank: MajorCapt. Taylor, Armor, was serving as executive officer of Troop B, 1st Squadron. His troop was engaged in an attack on a fortified position west of Que Son when it came under intense enemy recoilless rifle, mortar, and automatic weapons fire from an enemy strong point located immediately to its front. One armored cavalry assault vehicle was hit immediately by recoilless rifle fire and all 5 crewmembers were wounded. Aware that the stricken vehicle was in grave danger of exploding, Capt. Taylor rushed forward and personally extracted the wounded to safety despite the hail of enemy fire and exploding ammunition. Within minutes a second armored cavalry assault vehicle was hit by multiple recoilless rifle rounds. Despite the continuing intense enemy fire, Capt. Taylor moved forward on foot to rescue the wounded men from the burning vehicle and personally removed all the crewmen to the safety of a nearby dike. Moments later the vehicle exploded. As he was returning to his vehicle, a bursting mortar round painfully wounded Capt. Taylor, yet he valiantly returned to his vehicle to relocate the medical evacuation landing zone to an area closer to the front lines. As he was moving his vehicle, it came under machinegun fire from an enemy position not 50 yards away. Capt. Taylor engaged the position with his machinegun, killing the 3-man crew. Upon arrival at the new evacuation site, still another vehicle was struck. Once again Capt. Taylor rushed forward and pulled the wounded from the vehicle, loaded them aboard his vehicle, and returned them safely to the evacuation site. His actions of unsurpassed valor were a source of inspiration to his entire troop, contributed significantly to the success of the overall assault on the enemy position, and were directly responsible for saving the lives of a number of his fellow soldiers. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.Leroy Petry, USA, AfghanistanRank: Master SergeantFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry\'s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.Doc Ballard, USA/USN, VietnamRank: ColonelFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life and beyond the call of duty while serving as a HC2c. with Company M, in connection with operations against enemy aggressor forces. During the afternoon hours, Company M was moving to join the remainder of the 3d Battalion in Quang Tri Province. After treating and evacuating 2 heat casualties, HC2c. Ballard was returning to his platoon from the evacuation landing zone when the company was ambushed by a North Vietnamese Army unit employing automatic weapons and mortars, and sustained numerous casualties. Observing a wounded marine, HC2c. Ballard unhesitatingly moved across the fire swept terrain to the injured man and swiftly rendered medical assistance to his comrade. HC2c. Ballard then directed 4 Marines to carry the casualty to a position of relative safety. As the 4 men prepared to move the wounded marine, an enemy soldier suddenly left his concealed position and, after hurling a hand grenade which landed near the casualty, commenced firing upon the small group of men. Instantly shouting a warning to the Marines, HC2c. Ballard fearlessly threw himself upon the lethal explosive device to protect his comrades from the deadly blast. When the grenade failed to detonate, he calmly arose from his dangerous position and resolutely continued his determined efforts in treating other marine casualties. HC2c. Ballard\'s heroic actions and selfless concern for the welfare of his companions served to inspire all who observed him and prevented possible injury or death to his fellow Marines. His courage, daring initiative, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of extreme personal danger, sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.Sammy Davis, USA, VietnamRank: Sergeant First ClassRank and organization: Sergeant, U.S. Army, Battery C, 2d Battalion, 4th Artillery, 9th Infantry Division. Place and date: West of Cai Lay, Republic of Vietnam, 18 November 1967. Entered service at: Indianapolis, Ind. Born: 1 November 1946, Dayton, Ohio. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Davis (then PFc.) distinguished himself during the early morning hours while serving as a cannoneer with Battery C, at a remote fire support base. At approximately 0200 hours, the fire support base was under heavy enemy mortar attack. Simultaneously, an estimated reinforced Viet Cong battalion launched a fierce ground assault upon the fire support base. The attacking enemy drove to within 25 meters of the friendly positions. Only a river separated the Viet Cong from the fire support base. Detecting a nearby enemy position, Sgt. Davis seized a machinegun and provided covering fire for his guncrew, as they attempted to bring direct artillery fire on the enemy. Despite his efforts, an enemy recoilless rifle round scored a direct hit upon the artillery piece. The resultant blast hurled the guncrew from their weapon and blew Sgt. Davis into a foxhole. He struggled to his feet and returned to the howitzer, which was burning furiously. Ignoring repeated warning to seek cover, Sgt. Davis rammed a shell into the gun. Disregarding a withering hail of enemy fire directed against his position, he aimed and fired the howitzer which rolled backward, knocking Sgt. Davis violently to the ground. Undaunted, he returned to the weapon to fire again when an enemy mortar round exploded within 20 meters of his position, injured him painfully. Nevertheless, Sgt. Davis loaded the artillery piece, aimed and fired. Again he was knocked down by the recoil. In complete disregard for his safety, Sgt. Davis loaded and fired 3 more shells into the enemy. Disregarding his extensive injuries and his inability to swim, Sgt. Davis picked up an air mattress and struck out across the deep river to rescue 3 wounded comrades on the far side. Upon reaching the 3 wounded men, he stood upright and fired into the dense vegetation to prevent the Viet Cong from advancing. While the most seriously wounded soldier was helped across the river, Sgt. Davis protected the 2 remaining casualties until he could pull them across the river to the fire support base. Though suffering from painful wounds, he refused medical attention, joining another howitzer crew which fired at the large Viet Cong force until it broke contact and fled, Sgt. Davis\' extraordinary heroism, at the risk of his life, are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Army.'"

Their selfless dedication to our country commands not only our respect and admiration, but also our willingness to provide them and their families with assistance to improve their quality of life""  Governor Jeb Bush, 2006When Governor Bush assumed office, the State of Florida had two Veterans\' homes with a total of 270 beds. During his eight years in office, four more Veterans\' homes were built with a total of 480 beds. In addition, he increased Funding for Department of Veterans Affairs from $14 million to $75 million. Of that $75 million, $67.5 was for the State Veterans\' Homes Program.In 2006, Governor Bush signed legislation that extends the educational benefits of the Children of Deceased or Disabled Veterans Program to the spouses of disabled veterans or soldiers that have been killed or are missing in action. He also passed laws that provides free undergraduate tuition at state colleges and universities to Florida recipients of the Purple Heart (and combat-related decorations ranked superior in precedence to the Purple Heart) and their children.In 2004, Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature created an employment advocacy and assistance program for military spouses and dependents. The goal was to strengthen the link between military families and Florida\'s workforce and employment market. Military spouses had access to a variety of resources through ""one stop career centers"". The centers helped connect them to employers and set up interviews, provided job training, and provided counseling and online resources required to find the kind of work they want to do. The program was a success and expanded in 2006.Under Governor Bush, Florida increased property tax exemptions for disabled veterans (from $500 to $5,000) and eliminated the fee to get a disabled parking permit.In 2002, Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature expanded the in-state tuition program to include Florida National Guard members so that they could receive in-state tuition fees at public colleges and universities.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 18, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb Packs Care Packages for the Deployed Florida Guard Members',"b'Bagram Air Force Base sits in the shadows of Afghanistan\'s Hindu Kush mountain range  nearly 8 thousand miles from Miami. But a short time from now, that distance will be momentarily bridged thanks to some cardboard boxes from Florida.Recently, Jeb spent time with veterans and military spouses packing some of the comforts of home into care packages for our troops in Afghanistan. These parcels will be delivered to Bagram Air Force Base and other forward operating positions, where members of Florida\'s National Guard, 265th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, are currently deployed.As governor of Florida, Jeb had the tremendous honor of serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Florida National Guard. It was a profound responsibility that he undertook with the utmost seriousness and pride. Jeb\'s commitment to the military comes from a great respect for our servicemen and women  born out of admiration for his father, who was injured in combat while serving as a United States Naval pilot.If elected to serve as Commander-in-Chief, he will work tirelessly to ensure that our troops receive the support, regard and care they so richly deserve.Jeb had the opportunity to learn more about how our troops live and serve in Afghanistan when he visited Kabul in 2006. While he loaded items like Sriracha, sunscreen and beef jerky into the care packages bound for Bagram, Jeb spoke candidly with the veterans about their concerns and gave a heartfelt thank you to all the families who bear the burden of sacrifice for America\'s safety.""A lot of guys and gals that are serving are separated from their families,"" Jeb said after packing up the final box.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 18, 2015",b'Press Release - New Opportunities for Veterans',"b'The United States is blessed with great liberties because of the courageous men and women who defend them. The bedrock of this country\'s security is a strong, volunteer Armed Forces and a sacred covenant between the citizen and the soldier.The United States is blessed with great liberties because of the courageous men and women who defend them.The terrible scandals at the Department of Veterans Affairs are a national disgrace. That once-sacred covenant has been called into question. Barry Coates knows this all too well.Barry, who is an Army veteran from South Carolina, spent months in terrible pain. He begged the VA for an examination into the cause  only to be put on a wait list with other veterans. After many months of waiting, Barry was granted his screening. There, doctors found a cancerous tumor the size of a baseball.Many veterans share his story. In 2014, a scandal revealed that many veterans languished and died while waiting for treatment at VA hospitals.The problems at the VA go much deeper.A whistleblower revealed that the VA had misspent as much as $5 billion in taxpayer money. That\'s billions of dollars that could have gone to better care, research into traumatic brain injury, cancer screenings, or new studies on post-traumatic stress.Millions in executive bonuses were awarded to VA officials, many of whom oversaw hospitals where veterans were waiting to receive care. And only three people have since been fired for lying about the time it took for veterans to get an appointment.This happened despite the fact that the Department of Veteran Affairs\' budget has risen 73% in recent years.It\'s time to fix the system.First, we trusted veterans to defend our country; we can trust them to choose their doctor. They should have the right to decide to use the VA hospital system or a neighborhood doctor. Last year, a bipartisan bill gave some veterans the right to do exactly that, with some restrictions.We trusted veterans to defend our country; we can trust them to choose their doctor.We should expand the earned access to quality health care, and ease some of the constraints. If the VA cannot find a doctor for a veteran in need, then we must empower veterans to find proper healthcare.Since the VHA has historically oriented its care towards men, the improvements to the system need to also focus specifically on services required by women veterans. That starts by preparing for the further growth in the female veterans population with responsive programs in organization, staff, and training  including in obstetrics, gynecology, and specializations in ovarian and breast cancer.And VA pharmacies should be allowed to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. The current practice requires that all medication be approved in-house, often requiring a VA doctor to confirm the opinion of a veteran\'s private doctor. This is a redundancy that extends wait times for veterans in need.Further, many VA practices are antiquated. Their software is out of date, difficult for veterans to use, and susceptible to manipulation. Just last week, a whistleblower revealed that as many as 35,000 veterans were denied care due to a computer glitch.The VA spends around $4.7 billon on information technology annually, but it does not have a simple app that allows veterans to make appointments, get medical advice, or refill a prescription from a smartphone or tablet. Nor does the VA offer a single, secure online login for veterans to replace the old paper copy of their service discharge.The VA\'s troubles are not just technical. Contracts are often awarded without a competitive bid, driving up costs and taking resources from veterans who need care. Waste is endemic, and it\'s all but impossible to fire someone.I support a House bill now before the Senate that makes it easier to fire poorly performing VA employees  especially those who have wasted taxpayer money, committed fraud, or were negligent in the care of a veteran. This isn\'t just about punishing incompetence, it\'s about allowing talented VA employees to be rewarded and incentivizing the highest quality care.This isn\'t just about punishing incompetence, it\'s about allowing talented VA employees to be rewarded and incentivizing the highest quality care.With new VA hospitals in Denver, Orlando, and Las Vegas hopelessly over budget, it is clear that the VA has no business in the construction industry. We should turn VA construction projects over to the Army Corps of Engineers.The entire system needs to be simplified, reformed, and refocused on its most important mission  to ""care for those who borne the battle.""But it\'s important to remember that not all veterans use VA hospitals. Part of our covenant with them means opening all the opportunities and the possibilities that this country has to offer.I support efforts to use the GI Bill, an educational benefit, to help veterans who want to start a business. In lieu of using it for education, they should have the option to borrow against their GI benefits for a small business loan.With these reforms  and others that I am proposing today as part of a broader veterans plan  we can dramatically upgrade how our government treats those who have sacrificed so much to protect us and expand opportunity so that our nation\'s heroes enjoy in the bounties of liberty they so richly deserve.'"

Jeb, hearing of the conditions in the camp and the persecution these Jews were suffering, suggested to Reagan-Bush officials that the United States had a duty to support a massive airlift. The resulting effort, Operation Joshua, made history when Israeli planes, with American support, brought these Jews to the homeland of the Jewish people, the State of Israel.Throughout his life, he has been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism and bigotry, and he has been a champion of Jewish American institutions. In 2003, as Governor of Florida, he signed a bill dedicating January as Jewish History month. Florida was the first state in the country to dedicate a month to the celebration of Jewish American history.Throughout his life, he has been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism and bigotry, and he has been a champion of Jewish American institutions.Governor Bush is committed to the security and prosperity of the Jewish State of Israel, and to America\'s alliance with Israel. He has visited Israel five times, and as Governor of Florida he actively sought to boost trade ties between the two nations.Now, as a candidate for the presidency, Jeb Bush continues to stand for the interests of the Jewish people and the State of Israel.""We keep dependable friends in this world by being dependable ourselves.

In Washington, they endlessly talk and debate about the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants across the border  but they don't actually do anything.I respect everyone who comes to this issue with ideas. But I think it's fair to ask every candidate the tough questions on the ideas they bring forward. Donald Trump has staked his presidential campaign primarily on the issue of illegal immigration. But rather than offering serious solutions to this national problem, Mr. Trump is pushing a plan that is not conservative, wildly unrealistic and not reflective of our values. If that is the position put forth by our party's standard bearer, the result will be the election of Hillary Clinton and the continuation of the disastrous economic and foreign policies of Barack Obama.Donald Trump has introduced the idea of an immigration system which comes down to the mass deportation of 11 million people at a cost of as much as $600 billion, massive new federal powers to step on the civil liberties of ordinary Americans, and a border plan that could be best described as a fantasy.That plan is not something a small-government conservative would put forward. It requires the federal government to manage the exorbitantly expensive mass deportation of millions of people. It also requires a massive public works project unlike anything we've seen since the construction of the Hoover Dam  and the federal government, as you may have noticed, hasn't been capable of running such a project judiciously of late. I thought we learned our lesson about government projects and 'shovel-ready' jobs from Obama's trillion-dollar 'stimulus.'What I also heard from local officials in McAllen was that Trump's plan to punish legal trade and commerce between the U.S. and Mexico would devastate border cities like theirs that depend on it. We need to ensure legal border commerce is protected. We also need to ensure local law enforcement has the resources they need to do their jobs. In fact, we should expand federal partnerships that train state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, particularly in jails and prisons.I'm not surprised Donald Trump endorsed big government, big budget, anti-free market ideas  that's how he approaches most issues, from health care to taxes. He's a big government guy and that's how big government guys think.I have actually written a book on the subject on addressing our immigration crisis, and it relies on a different way of thinking. I rely on insights from people who live on the borders  as well as people who deal with the immigration issue in our schools, businesses and communities.Not surprisingly, I come to different conclusions than Mr. Trump and have put forth the most comprehensive and realistic strategy for dealing with the problem of illegal immigration.A great nation must secure its borders for national security and public health reasons. We don't have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on fencing when we can use new technology, improve the Border Patrol's access to streams and rivers on the border, beef up our patrols and adopt sensible policies like e-Verify at workplaces across the country.We must find a practical solution to the status of the 11 million people here illegally today. We need a vigorous path to earned legal status where people are required to learn English, pay a fine and taxes, pass a criminal background check, work and not receive federal government benefits.This isn't amnesty. It's a sensible proposal that can be embraced by people across the political spectrum. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton the politicians in Washington have talked about immigration for 6 and half years but they have no interest in fixing it, only creating a political wedge issue. I will solve this problem, once and for all.As we continue this debate, I will continue to advocate for my deeply held belief that diversity is one of America's greatest strengths and that we are a nation of immigrants and should be proud of that tradition. Most of all, we should look at immigration as a way to build up this country. A thoughtful, strategic approach that reflects the values of this nation and that would treat immigration as an economic driver  meeting the needs of our growing economy.But we're only going to get there if we listen to leaders like those in McAllen. Donald Trump has different ideas, and this campaign season will showcase this stark contrast. As a deeply committed conservative who has spent my adult life fighting to strengthen the Republican Party and to advance the causes of limited government and individual freedom, I am confident we will choose the path that best meets those missions."""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"August 25, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb Bush & Israel: A Record of Support for the Jewish State and the Jewish People',"b'Governor Bush is committed to the security and prosperity of the Jewish State of Israel, and to America\'s alliance with Israel. He believes this strategic relationship is founded not merely on shared interests, but on shared values and emotional bonds between the American and Israeli people.He has visited Israel five times, and as Governor of Florida he actively sought to boost trade ties between the two nations.Throughout his life, he has been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism and bigotry, and he has been a champion of Jewish American institutions. In 2003, as Governor of Florida, he signed a bill dedicating January as Jewish History month. Florida was the first state in the country to dedicate a month to the celebration of Jewish American history.Throughout his life, he has been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism and bigotry, and he has been a champion of Jewish American institutions.When his father was Vice President, Governor Bush played a role in drawing attention at the highest levels of government to the plight of Ethiopia\'s Jewish community. Thousands of members of this ancient community had fled their homeland due to famine for a refugee camp in Sudan. Jeb, hearing of the conditions in the camp and the persecution these Jews were suffering, suggested to Reagan-Bush officials that the United States had a duty to support a massive airlift. The resulting effort, Operation Joshua, made history when Israeli planes, with American support, brought these Jews to the homeland of the Jewish people, the State of Israel.Now, as a candidate for the presidency, Jeb Bush continues to stand for the interests of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. He is a forceful and principled critic of the Obama Administration\'s nuclear deal with Iran. Rather than continue with a failed strategy of appeasement, he has argued for a comprehensive strategy to confront the threat posed by Iran\'s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, support for terrorism, ballistic missile proliferation, threats to destroy Israel, and human rights abuses. He has called out the growing threat of radical Islamist terrorism and was the first candidate to present a detailed plan to address it. And one of his chief foreign policy priorities is to rebuild America\'s relationship with its longtime strategic ally and friend, the State of Israel.""We keep dependable friends in this world by being dependable ourselves. I will rebuild our vital friendships. That starts by standing with the brave, democratic State of Israel.""Update: The page previously cited Operation Moses, as reported by the Tampa Bay Times. It has been updated to reflect the correct name of the mission: Operation Joshua.'"

However, while the power was off in our neighborhood I did notice that the children were outside playing in their yards, neighbors were talking to each other (which normally did not happen) and neighbors were helping neighbors cut trees and clean yards. It was a little like what I remember from my childhood. Now with the power on, life is getting back to the old pattern. We drive home, open the garage door and go into our homes to the TV and air conditioning. Some of us have decided not to let the communication die. We are planning a block party or some other kind of get together.There is also a radio program down here where the disc jockeys are trying to match people in need with people who may have something they can do without or a service they could donate. Surprisingly, not too many people are calling to gouge the system and the program is a huge hit.What I guess I am trying to say, as hard as these hurricanes have been on you and Florida, there is some good coming out of it.Thanks for being a strong leader in a time of need and I will continue to try to be a strong constituent.A loyal democrat but supporter of Jeb Bush.?Subject: Hurricane JeanneMonday, September 20, 2004 1:56 p.m.From: Jeb BushThank you Audrey.

Active duty members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) hit a high point in 2010 with 1.4 million members. Under current defense cuts, it is set to drop to 1.2 million by 2019.Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.While the military cuts should be reversed for purely strategic security reasons, the fact stands that the sheer number of service members leaving service is overwhelming the VA. The Pentagon needs more soldiers and the VA is inundated with new veterans. Ending the rapid troop drawdown is a simple, pragmatic solution to both problems.I assure you the day I am elected President of the United States will be the day that we turn this around, and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 1, 2015",b'Press Release - My Passion for Education Reform',"b""After I lost my first election in 1994, I went through a period of what some might call 'self-reflection' but I referred to it as 'listening and learning.' I was humbled, and determined to learn, so I went into the community  not as a candidate, but as a fellow citizen.I wanted to learn more about my state and why so many Floridians felt like they didn't have an opportunity to succeed. I had spent some time before on the issue of education, but in 1995, I really threw myself into the subject. I visited a lot of schools and saw firsthand that students weren't graduating, and even if they did, they weren't ready for college or work. The school system seemed to be designed to meet the needs of the adults and special interests running the schools, not the kids in the classrooms. And that was wrong.Before I took office, Florida was at the bottom nationally in K-12 education outcomes. Almost half the state's fourth graders were functionally illiterate and the high school graduation rate hovered around 50 percent. The situation was particularly alarming for African-American children with only 37 percent of black third graders reading at or above grade level in 2001. Florida's students were struggling.I met with parents, teachers, administrators and anyone else with an opinion. I worked with the President of the Urban League in Miami, T. Willard Fair, and in 1996, we started our own charter school for the Liberty City neighborhood. At the time there were no charters in Florida. So we said, let's change the law, let's go build a charter school, let's start something new and hopeful for people who shouldn't have to wait for a real opportunity.Our charter school endeavor was an all-volunteer effort. The weekend before Liberty City Charter opened, we realized the school didn't have a flagpole. So I went to the hardware store, and a few of us learned how to mix the concrete and anchor the pole. That Monday morning, 90 kids raised the American flag together. That moment symbolized so much of what we were trying to do  give every kid a chance to be part of American opportunity. It was an experience that still ignites my passion for transforming education today.give every kid a chance to be part of American opportunity. It was an experience that still ignites my passion for transforming education today.In my next campaign, I visited 250 schools across Florida, many of them in low-income communities. After I won the governorship in 1998, we made education reform a chief priority. We built a plan based on strong accountability, high standards, quality testing, quality teachers and unprecedented parental choice. We tripled the number of charter schools. We created the nation's first statewide voucher program and then created three more broad choice programs, in addition to expanding virtual learning.We implemented a mandatory A-F grading scale for schools, ended social promotion and forced schools to offer remedial teaching for low-performing students. We created opportunity scholarships to let kids trapped in failing schools go to public and private schools of their choice.It was our uncompromising belief that every child can learn. Low-income, minority and disabled kids had been ignored by their schools in many cases. So I set a simple standard: Teach every kid and offer every child an opportunity to get the education they deserve.These reforms weren't always popular. We were fought every step of the way by status quo education bureaucrats. We spent huge amounts of time filling out paperwork for federal bureaucrats. And the teachers unions hated what we were doing. In my re-election campaign in 2002, they didn't just bankroll my opponent; they mortgaged their building to do it. But they lost, and the kids won.It was one of the most successful education reform stories this nation has ever seen. Florida's high school graduation rate rose by 50%. The number of schools rated A or B increased from 21% to 74%. Florida led the nation in improvements for low-income and black 4th grade literacy. The percentage of African-American third graders reading on grade level nearly doubled.Low-income and Hispanic fourth graders are the best in the nation in reading. The number of African-American and Hispanic students passing the AP exam more than quadrupled. And Florida became the only state to consistently close the achievement gap between white and non-white students, and between low-income students and the rest of the student body.Jeb TeachingAfter I left public office in 2007, I immediately set out to make these reforms possible in other states that wanted to try them. I launched a foundation devoted to the cause of education reform. From 2008 forward, our foundation went from working with three states to 48. A lot of what we did in Florida ended up happening in other states. It was an amazing revolution in education  and is a lesson for what's possible if you work every day with a single goal: To give every child an opportunity to succeed in life.My experience in Florida taught me we can fix a few, big complicated things with the right leadership. I did it in Florida, and, together, we can do the same in Washington."""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 1, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb Bush: The Unions' War on Parental Choice""","b'As a decades-long advocate for school choice, I\'ve met countless families who have unlocked opportunity for their children through quality education options. That\'s why, during my time as Governor, we made expanding parental choice a key part of our overhaul of Florida\'s education system.The results speak for themselves: Today, more than 300,000 kids in Florida are in school choice programs. Florida leads the nation in reading for low-income and minority fourth graders. Graduation rates have increased by almost 50 percent in the state. The number of \'D\' and \'F\' schools in Florida decreased from 28 percent to 5 percent, and the number of \'A\' and \'B\' schools in Florida increased from 21 percent to 74 percent. Finally, Florida is one of the only states in the nation to make real progress in closing the achievement gap.The statistics capture one half of the picture; the many individual success stories the other.Take Florida 10th grader Valentin Mendez, who has experienced the results firsthand. He was struggling in school, being bullied, not able to learn. His mother found a school  La Progresiva Presbyterian  that he could qualify for using Florida\'s Corporate Tax Credit Scholarship program, which we created in 2001. Here\'s what his mom says today: ""Suddenly it was Valentin doing his homework...Valentin playing sports...Valentin doing everything."" Each life transformed like Valentin\'s is proof of the value of hard work by students, insistence on high standards by parents and teachers and a determination to give students more opportunities to do better and try new things.There are many more students like Valentin out thereliving in poverty, facing hardships most of us can\'t imagine.Unfortunately, the very educational opportunities that are giving so many students a better shot in life are under assault by Hillary Clinton\'s staunchest supporters, the teachers unions. Last August, a group organized by the state teachers union in Tallahassee sued the state of Florida to end the tax credit scholarship program. Even though they rightfully lost the case, the union last week appealed the decision, proving the war on parental choice in Florida continues.School choice is under assault in other areas across the nation as well. In New York City, Clinton ally Bill De Blasio has succeeded in transforming the city into a downright hostile environment for charter schools, where more than 43,000 students now remain on waiting lists for them. And last week, the American Civil Liberties Union  another liberal interest group  sued the State of Nevada over its innovative new Education Savings Accounts program.These are the same special interests backing Hillary Clinton\'s bid for the presidency. And, there is no evidence that Secretary Clinton would buck her friends on the critical issue of education reform if she were elected President.We need a President who will stand up for students. Restoring the right to rise in America begins with providing every child access to a quality education. Education shouldn\'t be a federal initiative, but it can be a national priority. I know we can increase opportunity for every American if we take on the special interests and entrenched establishment that are holding too many children back. I know we can do it because I saw what happened when we took on the teachers union in Tallahassee and won, putting students first.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 8, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb Bush: Reform & Growth',"b'Under President Obama, Americans have now endured six years of tax increases, endless regulation, vast new federal programs and $8 trillion in added debt. The president told us this ""stimulus"" would jump-start the economy. Instead, we got an anemic economy growing at barely 2% a year. Some call this ""the new normal""but it isn\'t something we can accept if we are going to restore the opportunity for every American to rise and achieve earned success.Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can\'t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can\'t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.Today, the tax code is a labyrinth littered with thousands of special-interest giveaways, subsidies and other breaks written to favor Washington insiders. At 80,000 pages, it\'s a tax code only an army of tax accountants and lobbyists could lovebecause they\'ve written it.The code is rigged with multiple carve-outs for favored industries. It penalizes people for moving up the economic ladder. It gives tax deductions for borrowing costs, thereby encouraging companies to take on too much debt and raising concerns about financial fragility, rather than having them focus on real investment and hiring.Low growth, crony capitalism and easy debtthat\'s President Obama\'s economic agenda in a nutshell, and the tax code has helped make it possible. It\'s past time for a change.On Wednesday I am unveiling the plan that, as president, I will submit to Congress and sign into law as the Reform and Growth Act of 2017. My plan centers on accomplishing three major goals:First, I want to lower taxes and make the tax code simple, fair and clear. It should be easy to understand and make it easy for people to fill out their own tax forms.We will cut individual rates from seven brackets to three: 28%, 25% and 10%. At 28%, the highest tax bracket would return to where it was when President Ronald Reagan signed into law his monumental and successful 1986 tax reform.With this reform in place, roughly 15 million Americans will no longer bear any income-tax liability. The plan nearly doubles the standard deduction now taken by roughly two-thirds of all filers. It eliminates the marriage penalty, expands the Earned Income Tax Credit, ends the death tax, retires the Alternative Minimum Tax and ends the employee\'s share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers older than 67.Second, I want to eliminate the convoluted, lobbyist-created loopholes in the code. For years, wealthy individuals have deducted a much greater share of their income than everyone else. We will retain the deductibility of charitable contributions but cap the deductions used by the wealthy and Washington special interests, enabling tax-rate cuts across the board for everyone. And while we\'re doing that, we will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won\'t be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains.Third, I believe that the tax code should no longer be an impediment to the nation\'s competitiveness with China, Europe and the rest of the world. Liberals will tell you that we need walls and tariffs to protect U.S. businesses from international competitors. The liberals are wrong; we need tax reform. To stop American companies from moving out of the country, I will cut the corporate tax rate from 35%the highest in the industrial worldto 20%, which is five percentage points below China\'s.We will end the practice of world-wide taxation on U.S. businesses, which fosters the insidious tactic called corporate ""inversions."" This is when small overseas companies buy big U.S. companies so that both can enjoy the lowest tax rate possible, costing American jobs and revenue. And we will assess a one-time tax of 8.75%, payable over 10 years, on the more than $2 trillion in corporate profits sitting overseas.We will also allow businesses to fully and immediately deduct new capital investmentsa critical step to increase worker productivity and wages. To pay for this, we will eliminate most corporate tax deductionswhich is where favor-seeking and lobbying are most commonand remove the deduction for borrowing costs. That deduction encourages business models dependent on heavy debt.When we accomplish these big reforms, the result will be a much simpler, leaner and fairer tax code.I know that enacting these policies works because I\'ve done it before. As governor of Florida, I cut taxes every single yearreturning a total of $19 billion to Floridians. The state\'s economy took off, growing at an average rate of 4.4%. Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by an average of $1,300. Florida\'s pro-growth climate created 1.3 million new jobs. And we did it all while balancing the budget eight years in a row and increasing the state\'s rainy-day fund by $8 billion.By focusing on tax reform like I did in Florida, America can grow faster, too. But tax relief and reform is only part of what we must do. We still have to reduce the regulations that choke so much of the U.S. economy, especially farms, factories and power plants. We have to fix the broken immigration system so that it helps drive a growing economy. We have to take full advantage of America\'s energy revolution. Finally, we have to transform the education system so that all children are prepared to succeed in college and at work, and participate fully in the economy we\'re trying to build. Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.To achieve these policies, we have to change the way Washington works. And we have to change who we send there to lead. That\'s what my economic plan will achieve, and that\'s why I\'m running for president.Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 9, 2015","b""Press Release - Backgrounder: Jeb Bush's Tax Reform Plan: The Reform and Growth Act of 2017""","b'Overview:Barack Obama\'s policies have given us an anemic economy, where most Americans are falling behind. The share of Americans working or looking for work is at a 38-year low. More than 6 million people are working part-time jobs when they\'d prefer full-time. Roughly 5.5 million more Americans are living in poverty than when President Obama came to office.As the next president of the United States, Jeb Bush has a plan to take on our biggest problems and introduce pro-growth policies to accelerate growth to 4 percent and foster the creation of 19 million new jobs. He can do it, because he\'s done it in Florida. Thanks to pro-growth policies led by $19 billion in tax cuts, Florida\'s economy took off and the state ended up leading the nation in small business creation. 81,000 new small businesses created a state economy that produced 1.3 million new jobs, the most in the nation from 2000-2007. Florida averaged 4.4 percent growth during his time in office; the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent and middle class incomes increased by $1,300.Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can\'t be done without real tax reform. A key element of Jeb Bush\'s economic agenda is a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Fundamental changes in tax policy are among the most promising policy changes to move people back to work, increase productivity and raise their wages. Few policy changes would have a more transformational effect on economic activity, income and employment than real tax reform. The nation needs a tax system that is simpler, fairer and can jumpstart economic growth.Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can\'t be done without real tax reform.That is why, as President, Jeb Bush will submit to Congress and sign into law the Reform and Growth Act of 2017.The Current Broken Tax CodeThe convoluted and contradictory nature of the U.S. tax code demands reform. It has been almost 30 years since we overhauled the tax code. During that time, special loopholes and deductions have skyrocketed, tax rates have risen and the tax code has become even more complex. The failures of the tax code are too numerous to fully list, but consider:Under this administration taxes have risen for small businesses and investors. When President Obama entered office, the highest income tax rate on small businesses was 35 percent, today it is more than 10 percent higher. Taxes on investments  the driver of U.S. productivity  have risen from 15 percent to 23.8 percent. Meanwhile, the President\'s job-destroying health care law increased taxes on low- and middle-income Americans. The President\'s tax increases have increased tax revenue to levels far above historical norms.The U.S. has the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the developed world. The tax rate is 60 percent higher than China\'s top rate. This high statutory rate discourages foreign investment in the U.S. And the huge number of special preferences and loopholes means the corporate tax code not only harms economic activity, but also collects much less revenue than advertised. While acknowledging the need for corporate tax reform, the President has refused to lead. As other nations have reformed their corporate taxes, the United States has become even less competitive. We now regularly see U.S. firms re-domiciling their businesses outside of the U.S., including the large number of so-called corporate inversions.The tax code\'s deductions, credits, and exclusions mean similarly situated taxpayers may have vastly different tax liabilities. These tax expenditures require higher marginal tax rates and distort economic behavior. The state and local tax deduction subsidizes high-tax states. Deductibility of interest for businesses subsidizes debt, discouraging equity financing, thereby threatening long-run prosperity.The mind-numbing complexity of the U.S. tax code wastes billions of dollars. The cost of complying with the U.S. tax code is at least $168 billion.[1] Families spend an average of eight hours filing their taxes. Businesses spend an average of 24 hours complying with complicated tax rules and depreciation schedules with larger businesses spending considerable more time complying.[2] Further, millions of Americans are excluded from filing a basic return because of age, family status, or income.[3]Jeb\'s Plan: The Reform and Growth Act of 2017: Fundamental tax reform requires overhauling the U.S. Tax Code. Jeb Bush\'s Reform and Growth tax plan will eliminate special-interest deductions and lower tax rates to help create 19 million new jobs and rising middle-class wages.Jeb\'s tax reform plan centers on accomplishing these major goals:Lower marginal tax rates.Simplify the tax code for all Americans to lessen the power of the IRS and increase both prosperity and fairness.Reduce loopholes and special tax provisions created by lobbyists that invariably benefit those at the top.Replace the current broken tax code  which has seven different tax rates, with a top rate of nearly 40 percent  with a streamlined system with only three rates: 28 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent.Reform our business tax code to ensure U.S. businesses, small and large, can be at the forefront for the competitive 21st century global economy.Lower our corporate tax rate to 20 percent  below China\'s  to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the United States.Ensure that Americans who are able and willing to work are incentivized to rejoin the workforce.Taxes on Individuals and FamiliesCurrent PolicyJeb\'s PlanTax RatesSeven tax brackets:10%, 15%, 25%, 28%,33%, 35%, 39.6%Three tax brackets:10%, 25%, 28%Personal Exemption$4,000$4,000Standard Deduction$12,600 for married filers$22,600 for married filers$6,300 for single filers$11,300 for single filersItemized DeductionsState and Local Tax Deduction No LimitEliminatedCharitable Contributions Deduction Capped at 50 percent of AGINo ChangeMortgage Interest Rate Deduction Limited to interest on first $1 million of debtCap the tax value of deductions at 2 percent of AGIOther Itemized Deductions Medical deduction, Casualty, Miscellaneous, etc.Personal Exemption Phase-out (PEP)Personal exemption and itemized deductions phased-out for upper middle class incomesPhase-outs eliminatedItemized Deduction Phase-out (Pease)Personal AMTFilers must determine tax liability under two sets of tax rulesEliminatedRates and BracketsThe proposal reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The three remaining rates are 10, 25, and 28 percent. The standard deduction would be increased by $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for joint filers. Under the proposal no one will receive a marginal rate increase.Tax Schedules under Jeb\'s Plan (2015 levels)RatesSingle FilerMarried FilerStandard Deduction$0 to $11,300$0 to $22,60010%$11,301 to $43,750$22,601 to $87,50025%$43,751 to $97,750$87,501 to $163,80028%$97,751 and above$163,801 and aboveSingle filers with incomes below $15,300 and married couples with two children with incomes below $38,600 would no longer pay income taxes. All non-itemizing filers above these thresholds would receive tax reduction of at least $500 for single filers and at least $1,000 for married filers.The majority of tax filers would see a marginal rate reduction. The rate reductions will result in lower tax liabilities for all non-itemizing tax filers, many of whom tend to be lower income or in retirement.Loopholes and Deductions Today, the tax code is a labyrinth littered with thousands of special-interest giveaways, subsidies and other breaks written to favor Washington insiders. The code is rigged with multiple carve-outs for favored industries. It penalizes people for moving up the economic ladder.Itemizing deductions leads to more complicated tax returns, requiring more time and effort to file. These deductions often result in taxpayers with similar incomes incurring dramatically different tax liabilities.By expanding the standard deduction and limiting deductions, the proposal will reduce the need for itemization. In the aggregate, the proposal would reduce the number of itemizers by almost 80 percent (from 47 million to 13 million). This reform will simplify taxes dramatically for these 34 million taxpayers.The proposal eliminates the state and local tax deduction. The tax deduction favors filers in states with high tax rates. Over 90 percent of tax expenditures related to state and local taxes accrue to filers with AGIs above $100,000.[4] The tax expenditure subsidizes high tax states, which encourages poor fiscal policy by state governments. High tax, high spending states have the right to conduct whatever fiscal policies they prefer, but citizens of lower tax states should not be required to pay for it.All remaining itemized deductions, with the exception of charitable contributions, would be limited by a tax cap. The cap would limit the tax value of itemized deductions to two percent of a filer\'s adjusted gross income. Since it is dependent on a progressive tax schedule, a filer in a lower bracket will be able to have more deductions as a share of their incomes. Low- and middle- income filers in the 10 percent tax bracket could deduct up to 20 percent of their income, while high-income filers in the top bracket could only deduct about 7 percent. The cap has the virtue of allowing the taxpayer to use any of these deductions but not to an excessive extent.Impact on TaxpayersAll non-itemizing tax filers will see a tax reduction under the income tax reforms. Low-income taxpayers will receive the biggest percentage reduction in the taxes.Impact of Tax Plan  Taxpayer TypeAdjusted Gross IncomeTax Liability Change Percent Reduction in Taxes Percent Change in After-Tax IncomeSingle No Dependents$15,300$500100%3.2%$25,000$77445.4%3.3%$50,000$1,91133.4%4.3%$100,000$1,91110.5%2.3%$250,000$4,4317.1%2.4%Married Two Dependents$38,600$1,000100%2.6%$50,000$1,14850.2%2.4%$75,000$2,39839.7%3.5%$100,000$3,64837.3%4.0%$125,000$3,82324.4%3.5%$250,000$3,8237.8%1.9% Note: Change in tax liability is shown for filers who do not currently itemize.Business and Investment TaxesCurrent PolicyJeb\'s Plan Business TaxesTop Corporate Tax Rate35%20%Top Pass-Through Rate39.6%28%Foreign earningsWorld-wide taxationUp to 8.75% deemed repatriation tax on prior foreign earningsInvestmentsComplicated depreciation schedulesFull expensing for new investmentsInterest PaidDeductibleNot deductible(non-financial institutions)Interest ReceivedTaxable at Ordinary Rates20%Corporate AMTFilers must determine tax liability under two sets of tax rulesEliminatedInvestment TaxesTop Capital Gains Rate23.8%20%Top Dividends Rate23.8%20%Interest ReceivedTaxable at Ordinary Rates20% Lowering Corporate Tax Rates The top corporate tax rate would be reduced to 20 percent. The rate would be lower than the OECD average and below China\'s corporate tax rate. The tax rate would be tied with the 8th lowest among developed nations. While the statutory corporate income tax rate is important to certain decisions such as where to locate profits and deductions, marginal investment will benefit greatly from expensing benefit and generally face a zero tax rate at the margin but for the 20 percent tax on individual investor returns. Ending Penalties on Capital Investment Under the current tax base, businesses may only deduct a portion of their capital expenditures. This system requires complicated depreciation schedules that increase compliance costs for businesses. The current depreciation schedules distort business investment by providing different tax rates for different business assets.Under the proposal, businesses could fully expense all new capital investments, an approach that seeks to remove taxes on marginal investment returns. This would simplify the tax code and significantly increase incentives to invest in new machines, equipment, buildings, and other structures.Treatment of Interest Generally, businesses would no longer be able to deduct interest payments. Under the current code, debt financing receives favorable tax treatment relative to equity financing. Allowing both expensing and interest deductions would create negative tax rates on debt financed capital expenditures.S-Corps, LLCs, and partnerships would continue to pay taxes under the personal income tax code. The highest tax rate pass-throughs would face would be the top individual marginal tax rate of 28 percent. While it might appear that pass-throughs are treated unfairly compared to the lower rate for C-Corps, shareholders of C-Corps would still be required to pay capital gains and dividend taxes at a top rate of 20 percent. The effective tax rate on C-Corp owners would still exceed those of pass-throughs.Ending World-Wide TaxationThe current system of world taxation deters American firms from repatriating foreign earnings and discourages firms from headquartering or managing their capital in the United States. The United States is one of seven OECD countries to tax businesses on all profits independent of where their profits were earned.[5]Under the proposal, firms would only pay taxes on profits earned in the United States. As part of the transition away from worldwide taxation, firms with deferred foreign income would face a deemed repatriation tax of up to 8.75 percent. Firms would have ten years to pay the tax.Loopholes and DeductionsMost business tax expenditures are related to the deferral of foreign earnings and accelerated depreciation policies. Because the proposal would adopt territorial taxation and full expensing, these special tax expenditures would no longer exist, rather all companies would have equal tax treatment. Several remaining tax expenditures for businesses would be phased out. Importantly, the proposal will maintain the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. Government has a role in encouraging basic research and the R&E; Tax Credit furthers this end.Investment IncomeThe proposal would eliminate Obamacare\'s 3.8 percent net investment tax. The tax is currently levied on single filers with AGIs above $200,000 and married filers with AGIs above $250,000. Obamacare\'s investment tax resulted in a top capital gains and dividend tax rate of 23.8 percent. This discourages capital investments that increase productivity and ultimately increase wages.All non-investment income will be taxed at ordinary rates. That is, only those putting real capital at risk will be able to benefit from the lower rate on capital gains. Specifically, ""carried interest"" without real capital at risk will no longer receive the same tax treatment as real investment income, but instead will face a top rate of 28 percent.Tax Code SimplificationFull expensing will bring dramatic tax simplification for businesses. Meanwhile, limiting deductions while reducing rates will simplify the tax code and decision-making for individuals and families. As mentioned above, the number of itemizers would fall from 47 million to 13 million. There are several other parts of the tax code that needlessly complicate tax filing. Jeb\'s plan will simplify them.Eliminating the Alternative Minimum TaxThe reform would eliminate the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for individuals and corporations. The AMT requires filers to determine their tax liability under two separate tax systems. It was intended to tax only a handful of Americans, but over time it has become a burden on middle class families. By eliminating the AMT, the proposal simplifies the tax code and ensures filers will no longer be forced to calculate their tax liability under two different tax systems. Eliminating the Personal Exemption Phase-Out and Limit on Itemized DeductionsThe proposal eliminates the personal exemption phase-out (PEP) and the limit on itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers (Pease). Eliminating PEP and Pease not only reduces the complexity of the tax code, it also reduces the marginal tax rate for affected filers.Eliminating the Estate TaxDeath should not be taxable event. This reform ends the estate and gift tax to protect family businesses and farms from an unfair tax. The proposal will eliminate the ""step-up basis"" upon death for capital gains in excess of the current estate tax thresholds. When the gains from these estates are eventually realized, heirs will pay capital gains based on the original basis (so-called ""carryover basis""). The tax treatment for bequests to spouses would be unchanged to current law.Getting America Back to WorkThe reduction in personal income taxes and business taxes will increase productivity, hiring, and encourage more Americans to return to work. There are, however, certain groups that may still face relatively high marginal tax rates that discourage labor force participation. The proposal suggests further reducing taxes for low-income childless filers, secondary earners, and seniors.Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion The Earned Income Tax Credit provides subsidies to low-income tax filers. Up to certain income thresholds, the credit increases with earnings. For example, a single filer with one child receives $0.34 for every dollar earned up to approximately $10,000. At that point the credit plateaus. Currently, the EITC is not available to childless filers below age 25 and the benefit for childless filers ages 25 to 64 is capped at $503.This reform will double the size of the credit for childless workers. This change means childless workers face a zero marginal tax rate when entering the workforce. The proposal would also expand the credit to filers ages 21 to 24 who are not enrolled full time in school and double the size of the maximum credit. There are approximately 1.6 million childless filers between the ages of 21 and 24 not in the work force who would be eligible for the expanded credit.[6] The credit will also be reformed to reduce fraud rates.Allowing Secondary Earners to File Taxes SeparatelyUnder the current tax system, married filers are permitted to file separately. However, doing so limits the credits either spouse may claim and often results in higher tax liability. By discouraging spouses from filing separately, secondary earners face high marginal tax rate as their income is added to the primary earners income. This discourages secondary earners from entering the work force.In 2013, there were 14.2 million married families where only one spouse worked.[7]The proposal would allow the individual in a married couple with the lower earnings (wage and salary income) to file a separate simple tax return using the tax schedule for single filers. All other income, deductions, and credits would remain on the tax return of the primary earner. This would achieve four goals:Eliminates the marriage penalty.Provides the current non-working spouse with a zero marginal income tax rate on the first dollar of earnings and reduce rates on additional earnings.Lowers the marginal tax rate for many second earners.Lowers the marginal tax rate for many primary earners.Payroll tax relief for seniorsNearly all workers must contribute 6.2 percent of their income (up to specified levels) for the employee share of Social Security taxes. Currently, seniors who are eligible for Social Security must continue to pay payroll taxes so long as they remain in the work force. This proposal eliminates the employee portion of payroll taxes for workers who have reached the full retirement age.[1] National Taxpayer Advocate (2012), 2012 Annual Report to Congress, Volume 1. available at http://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/2012-Annual-Report/FY-2012-Annual-Report-To-Congress-Full-Report.html[2] IRS, Estimates of Taxpayer Burden, available at http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040a/ar03.html[3] The IRS allows childless filers under 65 with taxable income below $100,000 to file a 1040EZ.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 9, 2015",b'Press Release - Facts on the Reform & Growth Act of 2017',"b""Top Line:Broad-based tax reform will help create high, sustained economic growth leading to 19 million new jobs and rising middle-class incomes. Cutting high tax rates for American businesses will help us compete with China  and win.This plan will eliminate loopholes and carve-outs for special interests in Washington and on Wall Street, and lower rates for American families and small businesses.More than 42 million middle class families will get a 33% cut in their income tax rate, and a family of four earning less than $40,000 will face no federal income tax whatsoever. Rate Reductions: Collapse the seven tax brackets into three brackets: 10%, 25%, and 28%.Top rate on small businesses will fall from 39.6% to 28%  the lowest since Ronald Reagan.Corporate tax rate falls to 20%, below China's (which is at 25%).Special Interests To lower rates for families and businesses, we will reduce deductions, carve-outs, and loopholes.These provisions reward well-connected Washington and Wall Street insiders rather than American families.Eliminating them will make our tax code fairer and our economy more competitive.Low-Income Americans: Single individuals earning $8,000 will get an additional $500 earned income tax credit.Low-income seniors earning $10,000 will see their after tax-income rise by $620.15 million poor families will no longer pay income taxes at all:A married family of four with incomes below $38,600 would no longer pay income tax.Single individuals with incomes below $15,300 would no longer pay income tax.Middle-Income Americans: Under Jeb's plan, more than 42 million middle class families will get a 33% cut in their income tax rate:A family of four earning $50,000 will have their taxes cut in half, saving over $1,150 a year.A family of four earning $75,000 will have their taxes cut by 40%, saving $2,400 a year.A single individual earning $50,000 would have taxes cut by 35%, saving $1,911 a year.Simplifying Reforms: Today, 47 million Americans itemize their deductions. That number will fall to 13 million, resulting in 34 million who will no longer have to file long, complicated tax forms.The elimination of the alternative minimum tax means Americans will no longer have to calculate their income taxes twice.Deductions: To support the generosity of the American people, the plan maintains the charitable giving deduction.The state and local tax deduction is eliminated to ensure people in low income tax states are no longer ?forced to subsidize high-tax, high-spending state governments.Low-income families will be able to deduct up to 20% of their income while high-income people will only ?be able to deduct 7% of their income.Businesses: Special-interest deductions for certain industries are eliminated, but businesses will have lower tax rates.If a company buys a piece of equipment that increases productivity, they can now write off the cost of that ?machine immediately, making the U.S. more competitive and creating more jobs.Ending the interest deduction for business will mean that government will stop subsidizing corporate and ?Wall Street debt.Investment Income: Obamacare's growth-destroying taxes on investment income will be eliminated, returning the capital gains tax rate to 20%  the same rate as under President Clinton.Only those putting their own capital at risk will be able to benefit from the lower rate on investment income.Other Provisions: Death will no longer be a taxable event with the elimination of the estate tax.The marriage penalty will be eliminated and secondary earners will face a 0% tax on their first dollar earned when they enter the workforce.Impact of Tax PlanTaxpayer TypeAdjusted Gross IncomeTax Liability Change Percent Reduction in Taxes Percent Change in After Tax IncomeSingle No Dependents$15,300$500100%3.2%$25,000$77445.4%3.3%$50,000$1,91133.4%4.3%$100,000$1,91110.5%2.3%$250,000$4,4317.1%2.4%Married Two Dependents$38,600$1,000100%2.6%$50,000$1,14850.2%2.4%$75,000$2,39839.7%3.5%$100,000$3,64837.3%4.0%$125,000$3,82324.4%3.5%$250,000$3,8237.8%1.9%Note: Change in tax liability is shown for filers who do not currently itemize."""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 10, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb's Tax Plan: What would you do with your extra money?""","b'Katie, North CarolinaFor my parents\' generation, a college degree came with the promise of a better life. It meant finding a job and being able to move toward the hallmarks of adulthood  like a savings account and a home to call your own. Though I was fortunate enough to land a job in this difficult economy, it still feels like I\'m barely getting by. Jeb\'s plan would knock nearly $2,000 off my tax bill  and get me one step closer to financial freedom. I\'d consider it a down payment on my future.Luisa, OhioLess than a year ago, I lost my job in human resources and put everything I had into finding something new. After searching for eight months, I took a job working at a grocery store deli for minimum wage. It\'s not ideal, but with my daughter in college and a son living at home, my income is important to keep my family going. The tax cut that Jeb is proposing would save us about $4,000. Right now, everything we make goes toward paying the bills. But this extra money could be the start of a rainy day fund  and a little peace of mind.Mary, MassachusettsI graduated from college over two years ago and was one of the fortunate students in my class, I found a job in nursing straight out of school. I had dedicated myself, studied and it paid off. But it came at a price, I had accumulated $85,000 in student debt. So after school I moved back with my parents in New Hampshire and commuted to save money. Now, half of every paycheck goes to paying down that debt. It\'s a problem that weighs on me. I\'ve since saved enough to move out on my own, but the $1,911.00 that I would save with Jeb\'s tax cuts would allow me to pay down that debt, and relieve the burden it brings.Rhonda, FloridaI\'m self-employed as a decorative painter, and the economic slowdown has wreaked havoc on my business. People are afraid to spend money on their homes because they worry that an economic comeback is impossible. I\'ve never seen anything like it  and something has got to change.Under Jeb\'s plan, my family will get a tax cut of almost $4,000. I\'m going to put it toward the most important thing in my life  my daughter Kayla\'s education. But this tax cut is about more than just my family. It\'s about restoring confidence and allowing businesses all across the country to thrive.Jonathan & Reagan, South CarolinaRecently we packed our bags, left the Palmetto State, and headed to Oklahoma where Jonathan was stationed. It\'s been an honor to serve, but we look forward to the day when we can head home and put down firm roots. We\'ve been saving for that day, and I\'ve been saving to open a bridal shop. It\'s been my dream throughout my life. My grandmother, mother, sister and I would stop at every formal dress store, wedding dress boutique, even the dress section at the department store just looking at everything they have. For as long as I can remember, we always said in passing, dreaming, ""One day, we are going to have our own shop."" We would dream about what the shop would look like, what designers we would carry, and how much fun we would have together doing what we love. In 2011 my grandmother, the true matriarch (and the founder of this dress dream), unexpectedly passed away due to a major heart attack. The void she left can never be filled, as she was truly one of a kind, but the dream did not die with her. Thanks to my gracious, loving, and financially savvy mother-in-law, the forever dream is now possible. The tax relief in Governor Bush\'s plan will definitely help, too. We\'re planning Murr\'s Bridal Boutique, named after my grandmother, and will hopefully open its doors in 2016.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 12, 2015",b'Press Release - Florida Republicans: All in for Jeb',"b'Nearly every Florida Speaker of the House from the last decade is rallying around Jeb Bush for president.Jeb is honored to have the endorsement of eight Florida Speakers, past and present, who recognize his strong leadership and unwavering support of conservative principles.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 12, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb Bush's Tax Reform Plan""",b''
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 14, 2015",b'Press Release - Strengthening Cybersecurity',"b""The Internet has transformed everyday life for people, revolutionizing communications and how Americans interact with each other and the world. The Internet's impact on economic growth has likewise been profound. U.S. manufacturers reported e-commerce shipments were $3.3 trillion in 2013. According to one report, from 2004 to 2009, the Internet accounted for 15% of GDP growth.Yet, for all of the Internet's transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factorcybersecurity. If people have no confidence their information will remain safe online, they willquite simplybe less willing to use the Internet, thereby jeopardizing future growth possibilities.for all of the Internet's transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factorcybersecurity.Unfortunately, a series of high-profile cybersecurity failures and the Obama administration's feeble response to the growing threat have demonstrated real vulnerabilities in government and private systems, eroding public confidence in both the government and even the Internet itself. In June, I published some thoughts on cybersecurity, and at many town halls across the country I hear concerns from Americans about this threat.This is an issue that gravely needs presidential leadership. Ultimately, we need Internet security, and a strong tech industry that can be leveraged to the public's benefit, in order to achieve high, sustained economic growth that will benefit everyone. Let's not mince words: in order to achieve 4% growth and the 19 million jobs that come with it, we need a vibrant and secure Internet. Here is my plan to achieve that, starting with tackling the cybersecurity challenge.1. Place a Command Focus on Cybersecurity.We need to recognize the reality that today we are under cyberattack and we are not keeping up with the threat. We also need to identify clearly the mission for government and the private sector: to work together to ensure the security of the Internet. The rapid expansion of information technology in the past several decades, coupled with both the open architecture of the Internet and poor cybersecurity practices, have contributed to a dramatic rise in cyberthreats to the nation. Last year, 60% of all targeted attacks struck small and medium-sized organizations, which often have fewer resources to invest in cybersecurity. In 2014, five out of every six large companies were targeted with spear-phishing attacks, a 40% increase over the previous year. Attacks against small and medium-sized businesses increased 26% and 30%, respectively. And these are just the attacks we know about. Many penetrations go unnoticed or unreported by companies that are victims of these attacks.Effective cybersecurity starts with all of usindividuals, businesses, and the governmentrecognizing the importance of Internet security and our responsibility to help ensure its robust defense. Effective cybersecurity depends in large part on the protective measures one takes before a cyberattack. If we do not make cybersecurity a priority, we will continue to see major breaches and damaging attacks. Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.2. Restore Accountability within the Federal Government.The government should lead by example. We need presidential leadership to get government to take the cybersecurity threat more seriously, fix the vulnerabilities of government systems, and hold government leaders accountable for the security of information entrusted to their care. It is easy to give a speech about cybersecurity. What we need is unwavering leadership and determined implementation, including a concerted effort to work with Congress.The intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)the human resources department of the U.S. Governmentillustrates the cultural failure of the Obama administration to take these threats seriously. The OPM systems contain millions of personnel recordsmany of which included an intrusive and sensitive personnel questionnaire. OPM officials knew this data was valuable, sensitive, and vulnerable, but failed to take basic steps to protect it.We need to change the culture of government, which is impossible absent presidential leadership. Leadership means not hiring political hacks or cronies for critical positions that involve cybersecurity. It also means holding executive branch officials accountable for their failure to prioritize cybersecurity and protect the networks under their care. The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.The President also cannot allow cabinet secretaries and senior officials to violate rules and procedures meant to protect classified and national security-related government communications. It should not be too much to ask government officials to abide by the laws and rules in place to safeguard our national security. Secretary Hillary Clinton's growing email scandal highlights reckless behavior by officials entrusted with some of our nation's most sensitive secrets.3. Increase U.S. Intelligence and Law Enforcement Cybersecurity Capabilities and Strengthen International Cooperation.We need to preserve and enhance the capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement to identify, deter, and respond to cyberattacks as part of a national strategy to protect the country. This starts by undoing the damage that sequestration has done to the Defense Department and Intelligence Community and restoring funding to them. The National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the frontlines of defending the United States against cyberthreats. We must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also needs more resources to fight back against the onslaught of cybercrime.In addition, we must reform a convoluted acquisition process that imposes years of delays and inefficiencies in procuring new cybersecurity systems. The Defense committees of Congress are already working on acquisition reformthe President should work with these committees and others to ensure that a byzantine acquisition process is streamlined for cybersecurity defense technologies. The government could build upon some of the lessons learned by Secretary Bob Gates' efforts to reform parts of the inefficient and costly defense acquisition process.The President should also prioritize cybersecurity in discussions and agreements with our allies and partners around the world. No one country can solve the cybersecurity problem, which is a global challenge. The need to protect sensitive systems from bad actors is a modern-day equivalent of securing the world's oceans for freedom of navigation, and just as nations came together to protect the seas, they should do so to secure the Internet. At the same time, the United States must retain a strong leadership position in Internet governance. For example, we should maintain oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages the Internet's domain name system.We must also hold to account those who are stealing our nation's intellectual capital. Efforts to expose, prosecute, and in some cases retaliate against these actors will raise the cost of conducting such attacks and increase deterrence of future attacks. Such deterrence will be stronger if we work with partners to establish international rules of the road and get them to establish the legal framework necessary to prosecute cybercriminals.4. Create Public-Private Partnerships to Improve Cybersecurity in the Public and Private Sectors.The U.S. Government and businesses should work together as partners to improve cybersecurity in public and private sectors in a way that also respects citizens' privacy. Just as the government needs to pay more attention to cybersecurity, so too must the private sector. The government must do its part in getting its own house in order and then enable, empower, and expect the private sector to do the same. Some industries take this threat more seriously than others, and there are lessons to be learned from their experiences.The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors. And to be clear, this will not be achieved with finger pointing and talking down to industries that have struggled with security while looking the other way as our classified information is handed over to state-sponsored cyberterrorists.The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors.At a minimum, the government should redouble efforts to: (1) reduce legal and technical barriers to cybersecurity information sharing between the federal government and private sector, and (2) promote best practices for the private sector, including voluntary cybersecurity standards (e.g., through the National Institute of Standards and Technology's ongoing work).The House of Representatives has passed a bill to facilitate information sharing by, among other measures, providing liability protection to private-sector companies that share cyberthreat information with each other or with the government. Unfortunately, the bill languishes in the Senate due to opposition from Senate Democrats. The President should lean on these Democrats to allow this bill to come to the Senate floor for a vote.5. Remove Barriers to Innovation in the Tech Industry.As part of this national effort to improve cybersecurity, the government must not be an obstacle to innovation in the tech industry. The government's power to incentivize and empower must take precedence over its predilection to regulate and constrain. Because cyberthreats are always evolving, effective cybersecurity requires continuous innovation, which a flourishing tech industry provides.We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity.We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity. For example, regulatory barriers continue to make it extremely complicated, costly, and time-consuming for small companies to raise capital through the securities markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission should reassess existing regulations to further minimize the number and complexity of documents that must be filed before everyday Americans are able to invest in emerging companies. It should also work to ensure rules are in place to enable the creation of liquid markets for securities offered by startups. We need to transform immigration into an economically-driven system that retains and brings in highly-skilled immigrants. Such a system would help create startups and increase innovation. We must lower business taxes to encourage investment and hiring in the United States.The Internet and innovation from the tech industry have enormous potential to help address public policy challenges. For example, digital connections between power plants, transformers, substations, and transmission lines allow for better management of the electric grid. With such networks, utilities are better able to anticipate, avoid, or respond to power outages. Using technology we can create a secure online credential for veterans that verifies their military service. Such a credential could allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online. However, without a secure Internet, these types of initiatives may never reach their full potential. Our country, starting with the President and federal government, must recognize the cybersecurity challenge and dedicate itself to conquering it.The Internet is one of the greatest innovations in history and has led to unrivaled opportunity and a great leveling of the playing field for all. I will be a President who works to actually bring people together from both sides of the aisle, as well as the public and private domains, to better address the very real threats confronting this critical global resource."""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 15, 2015",b'Press Release - A Reagan-Inspired Tax Reform Plan',"b'The Republican candidates for president will debate Wednesday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. It is fitting that this important debate be held in Southern California, the birthplace of the tax-cut movement in America.Thirty-seven years ago, Howard Jarvis, a Southern California businessman and political activist, spearheaded Proposition 13, a ballot measure to place a strict cap on property taxes. Californians, who had endured massive increases in the taxes on their homes, revolted against the status quo in Sacramento and passed Prop. 13 overwhelmingly, sparking a nationwide movement to cut taxes that Ronald Reagan referred in his autobiography to as a ""prairie fire.""President Reagan wisely identified that the American people were fed up with paying exorbitant taxes and weary from the failed economic policies of the Jimmy Carter administration. During his run for the presidency in 1980, Reagan put dramatic tax relief at the center of his campaign, calling for an across-the-board reduction in marginal tax rates. As president, Reagan succeeded in ending the Carter malaise by bringing the top marginal tax rate down from 70 percent to 28 percent and, in the process, unleashing a period of economic growth and prosperity that renewed the American Dream.After six and half years of the Obama administration, the nation again finds itself at a critical crossroads. President Obama has increased taxes by nearly $2 trillion and left us with one of the weakest recoveries in our nation\'s history, so weak that, for many, the recession never stopped due to the hardships they are personally experiencing.What these working and middle-class Americans see as a recession, the Democrats and liberal academics call ""the new normal.""What these working and middle-class Americans see as a recession, the Democrats and liberal academics call ""the new normal.""'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 22, 2015",b'Press Release - Regulatory Reform',"b'Regulations are choking America\'s economy, imposing an invisible tax of $1.9 trillion every year  that\'s $15,000 per family.During his time in the White House, President Obama has added roughly $3,100 per second in regulatory burdens to the economy.Think what America could be and the prosperity we could experience if we took off the shackles from government rules and rule makers. My goal as president would be to set new, reasonable standards for the government agencies that issue rules that choke economic activity and opportunity.As president, I will use my executive authority to do the following:First, we will require regulators to live within a budget  for every one dollar of regulatory cost they propose, they will need to also propose ways to save an equivalent dollar through regulatory relief. We will implement a ""one in, one out"" regulatory budget. A rule like this would have avoided roughly $99 billion in regulatory costs over the Obama presidency.Second, we will enhance and enforce presidential control over regulations. Regulations will not be issued unless regulators have identified a major market or policy failure that new regulations are likely to solve. They will need to show that state-based solutions are insufficient and that benefits outweigh costs. And we will expect regulators to strictly adhere to the plain, ordinary meaning of constitutional and statutory limitations. I will also sign the REINS Act into law, empowering Congress to approve or reject, through a simple majority vote, regulations that impose outsized burdens on the economy.Third, we will establish a two-year deadline for completing federal permitting process  including environmental impact reviews  for major infrastructure projects that are mired in delays stretching up to a decade or more. We will get highway, port, bridge and other critical projects going, creating jobs and growing our economy.Last we will repeal or reform the most onerous Obama rules and regulations.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 22, 2015",b'Press Release - The Regulatory Crisis in Washington',"b'America\'s regulatory system has failed, and its families, workers, consumers, and small businesses are paying the price: weaker growth, less opportunity, fewer full-time jobs, and lower wages. Instead of improving our lives, regulation today too often oppresses and stifles the economy. Americans in schools, hospitals, and small businesses even those working within government itself are tangled up in red tape that makes no sense to them or anyone else.Things happen when real people are able to act, not when they are forced to consult rulebooks or hire lobbyists to protect their interests from government bureaucrats. But leaders in Washington have increasingly fallen prey to a ""regulators-know-best"" mentality, which drives them to dictate choices and control the economy. This is the basis for President Obama\'s infamous and sometimes unconstitutional ""phone and pen"" strategy to govern through regulation, disregarding Congress and the states.Making this worse, Washington\'s bureaucrats rarely evaluate how their rules actually affect people on the ground, the real daily choices made by businesses, teachers, doctors, and others. And so, regulation accumulates, like sediment in a harbor, building up over time, and ensuring that Americans must consult a rulebook or hire a lobbyist to accomplish basic tasks. The United States, long the shinning light of business dynamism, has consequently sunk to a dismal 46th in the world in ease of starting a business.America needs to get moving again. We can unleash untold dynamism now buried under the weight of rulebooks by fixing our regulatory system. Nothing stimulates an economy more than the energy of real people, motivated to pursue their dreams in their own way. That has long been the secret of America\'s success.Fixing our regulatory system will promote growth and reduce consumer prices, while retaining the benefits of sensible rules to protect our health, our safety, and our environment. For American businesses, these programs will increase the ability to compete, both at home and abroad. These reforms are especially important for the many small firms and middle and low income Americans, who disproportionately bear the costs of regulation.By identifying areas that are more appropriately handled at the state level, regulatory reform will also drain the federal bureaucracy of some of its power. An America where states serve only in the shadow of the federal government restrains our energy and keeps bottled up the full power of state engines of innovation. Combined with a forthcoming initiative on federal-state relations, regulatory reform will restore the proper relationship between the federal government and the states.Regulatory reform can bring America into the top 10 in ease of starting a business. It can increase productivity. It can finally give American workers a raise. Fully implemented, regulatory reform can boost GDP by three percent over the next 10 years. In conjunction with Governor Bush\'s tax reform plan, the regulatory reforms outlined here will help increase average compensation, so that by 2020 a typical family of four earning $50,000 will have an after-tax income that is approximately $3,100 higher than it would without these reforms.To unleash the American spirit again and set the country on a path to achieve these results, Governor Bush is proposing reforms that will:End the Washington-knows-best mentality by scaling back existing regulations and promoting smarter regulation going forward.Make regulators accountable to Americans rather than special interests.Reduce red tape and uncertainty to restore business dynamism.Reform Goal #1: End the Washington-knows-best mentality by scaling back existing regulations and promoting smarter regulation going forward.The Obama Administration has overseen an annual increase in the number of major rules (those that impose more than $100 million in costs on the economy) of 30 percent. In 2010, the Administration set a record for the number of major rules adopted. In 2012, it imposed a record $219 billion in costs on the economy. Were they to be paid directly, regulatory costs would average nearly $15,000 per household more than 20 percent of the average household income of $64,000 and almost 30 percent of average household expenditures of $51,000. This exceeds every item in the average household budget except housing.The costs of economic activity that regulation prevents or delays are even harder to measure. Ideas that could turn into innovative products and services never make it off the drawing board because regulatory obstacles promote the status quo. According to one recent report, bureaucratic delays in permitting infrastructure projects cost more than $3 trillionnearly double the total cost of modernizing infrastructure through the end of the decade, and more than $10,000 for every American citizen.Regulation should be practical and focused on important public concerns: it should not be a source of paralysis or central planning. America\'s businesses should be focused on innovation and expansion, not compliance with thousands of immaterial regulatory dictates or overcoming the next regulatory obstacle.Examples:President Obama\'s Carbon Rule forces states to switch some of their energy generation from coal to renewable sources, contrary to Supreme Court precedent that affords states ample authority to choose how they generate energy. The regulation is the EPA\'s first foray ""outside the fence,"" requiring states to meet the rule\'s requirements by taking action beyond the physical boundaries of electricity generation facilities. The regulation will likely result in substantial price increases often of more than 10 percent to many families\' energy bills without meaningfully affecting either global emissions or temperature.The Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule subjects nearly all private land use to review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The rule, which is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent, requires farmers to cater to the EPA in order to obtain permission to build a fence, apply fertilizer, pull weeds, or spray for insects. The rule expands federal authority to virtually all wet areas (and temporarily wet areas) ditches, drains, seasonal puddle-like depressions, and large ""buffer areas"" of land adjacent to waterways. For example, the rule subjects 99 percent of Pennsylvania\'s acreage to federal jurisdiction. The WOTUS rule unnecessarily and arbitrarily increases the cost and uncertainty of many industrial, commercial, and farming operations. And those who fail to comply face stiff penalties of roughly $40,000 per violation.Five years of heavy-handed Dodd-Frank regulation has created a two-tiered banking system. A few huge financial institutions sit securely at the top, insulated from competition by regulations that impose heavy compliance burdens on their smaller rivals. Community banks, for example, have to comply with capital and liquidity requirements, undergo stress tests, and adhere to corporate governance rules that are tailored to neither their activities nor the risks they pose to the economy. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult for Americans with less than perfect credit to access capital to start, upgrade, or expand businesses and pursue their ambitions.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has imposed particularly heavy regulatory costs on smaller and community banks: 71 percent of small banks says that the CFPB affects their business activities, 64 percent report that Dodd-Frank has caused them to change their mortgage offerings, and 15 percent say that they have responded to Dodd-Frank by either exiting or considering an exit from the residential mortgage markets entirely.Regulators\' efforts to protect the spotted owl under the Endangered Species Act have done little to protect the owl and much to decimate the timber industry in the Northwest and the jobs and the towns it supported. That same overly restrictive approach applied to the sage grouse will likely have a similar effect on the energy and mining sectors.The Department of the Interior\'s onerous regulations governing fracking activities on federal lands prevent America from harnessing the full benefits of the energy revolution.Because of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, safe sunscreens available elsewhere in the world cannot be found in America\'s stores.FDA regulations make food more expensive without materially improving health outcomes.Policy Solutions:Regulatory Freeze: To the extent permissible under existing law, Governor Bush will prohibit publication of new proposed or final regulations or significant guidance until they are approved by an agency head he has nominated. He will also direct agencies to withdraw proposed and final regulations awaiting publication in the Federal Register. And he will delay the effective date of regulations that have not yet taken effect.Presidential Task Force: Governor Bush will establish a presidential, cabinet-level taskforce, staffed primarily by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), that will drive his regulatory reform agenda. The task force will also signal to agencies and others that smart regulation is a top White House priority and work to ensure agencies adhere to OIRA\'s regulatory determinations.Supplement Executive Orders on Regulation: Governor Bush will promptly issue an Executive Order to compel agenciesincluding independent agenciesto strictly adhere to principles of smart regulation listed below. Governor Bush will seek to codify these principles and empower courts to enforce them. His regulatory Executive Order will require agencies to:abstain from regulation where there is not identifiable market or major policy failure;prefer state-based solutions to federal solutions;favor regulations that incorporate ""best practices"" from the state laboratories of democracy rather than those that rely on untested approaches;ensure, to the extent possible, that each regulation\'s benefits ""outweigh"" its costs, measured using an honest and transparent methodology, and has been crafted in accordance with the Information Quality Act;select the least costly regulatory alternative, unless there are compelling reasons to adopt a more burdensome option;favor simple and flexible regulations that enhance regulatory certainty, maximize competition, and minimize burdens on small actors;strictly adhere to the plain, ordinary meaning of constitutional and statutory limitationsRegulatory Budget: Governor Bush will establish a regulatory cost cap of zero in the first year of his presidency. As a result, new regulatory costs will be offset by regulatory savings elsewhere. This ""regulatory budget"" will force government to make explicit tradeoffs between regulatory priorities and to eliminate old regulationsjust as it does now under the fiscal budget. The UK operates under a regulatory budget that requires regulators to eliminate two rules for every new rule they add. Since its inception in 2011, the initiative has reduced regulatory burdens by roughly $3.4 billion. In Canada, small business owners successfully pushed for a 1:1 regulatory budget that holds the regulatory burden constant at $37 billion per year. Governor Bush will work with Congress to build upon this regulatory budget framework in subsequent years of his administration.Spring Cleaning of Existing Regulations: Governor Bush will create an independent commission to conduct a regulatory spring cleaning. The current process for reviewing existing regulations works poorly. Those who create the rules review them, and they often ignore regulations\' cumulative and interactive effects. An independent commissionmodeled along the lines of the military base closing commission or Australia\'s regulatory review commissionwill review regulations from the perspective of regulated entities. Governor Bush will encourage Congress to codify the commission\'s mission and establish procedures for approving or rejecting its recommendations through a simple up-or-down vote. In its work, the commission will identify regulatory laws that need to be modified or repealed and areas of regulation that Congress should relinquish, in whole or in part, to state control. The commission will publish its recommendations within the first year of Governor Bush\'s administration.Retrospective Review of New Regulations: Governor Bush will empower OIRA to review the costs and benefits of each new major regulation within eight years of its effective date. In addition to helping weed out ineffective regulations, these reviews will create strong incentives for agencies with vested interests in their regulations to track their real world impacts.Regulatory Hippocratic Oath: Governor Bush\'s will require his nominees to regulatory agencies to commit to his regulatory reform agenda and take a regulatory ""Hippocratic Oath."" Nominees will commit to ""do no harm"" through their regulatory initiatives and commit to working productively with OIRA to promote smart regulation. Personnel is policy and the oath will establish a leadership-level counterweight to the pro-regulation mentality and impulses toward perfection that regulators often exhibit. The oath will remind regulators to be humble about their ability to ""solve"" complex problems better than the American people.Reform Goal #2: Make regulators accountable to Americans rather than special interests.Agencies today make far more laws than legislators. But unlike courts and legislators, regulators conduct their deliberations in relative obscurity, often outside of the public\'s view and effectively accountable to no one, not even the President. Ordinary Americans are accountable in their daily lives, and bureaucrats should be as well.The regulatory thicket also protects the status quo and keeps less politically connected competitors on the sidelines. An ever-expanding and increasingly unaccountable regulatory state adopts and enforces complicated and highly technical regulations, without sufficient oversight or accountability. These rules inherently benefit powerful and politically connected entities, who are able to influence rulemakings to their advantage and deploy ample resources either to comply with or mitigate the effects of enforcement efforts. This makes it more difficult for smaller businesses to compete, creating a drag on the economy.Examples:The Federal Communications Commission\'s Net Neutrality rule classifies all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as ""public utilities,"" subjecting them to antiquated ""common carrier"" regulation. Rather than enhancing consumer welfare, these rules prohibit one group of companies (ISPs) from charging another group of companies (content companies) the full cost for using their services. Small broadband operatorslike KWISP (475 customers in rural Illinois) and Wisper ISP (8,000 customers near St. Louis, Mo)have declared under penalty of perjury that the Net Neutrality rule has caused them to cut back on investments to upgrade and expand their networks.The CFPB, created by Dodd-Frank, is controlled by a single individual who is effectively free of oversight from either the White House or Congress. Given the lack of accountability, it is not surprising that the agency aims build itself lavish headquarters, featuring a two-story waterfall and a four-story glass staircase and a budget that ballooned from $55 million to $216 million.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, also created by Dodd-Frank, has asserted the remarkable authority to declare entities to be ""systemically important"" behind closed doors without considering either the costs or the benefits of that determination.Today, 30 percent of the U.S. workforce must obtain permission from some level of government in order to do their job. That\'s up from five percent in the 1950s. From hair braiders and masseurs to florists and travel agents, more than 1,100 jobs now require an occupational license in at least one state. Licensing regimes slow job growth, limit employment opportunities, and make it harder for workers to relocate across state lines. They stand in the way of millions of jobs, raise consumer costs by more than $100 billion, harm military spouses and inhibit re-integration of former criminals, generally without improving products or services.Policy Solutions:End Sue and Settle: Governor Bush will end the abusive practice known as ""sue and settle."" In sue and settle, agencies and special interest groups enter into collusive settlement agreements negotiated without input from all stakeholders or from the public. Because courts bless these agreements, special interests and agencies can use them to achieve regulatory outcomes, without public input, that undermine congressional and presidential priorities. The solutions are simple: Governor Bush will advance legislation to reform so-called citizen suit provisions, so that standing is limited to entities with tangible, particularized injuries. He will also advance legislation to ensure that parties with constitutional standing are not shutout of any settlement negotiations. He will also ensure that the public has a full and meaningful opportunity to comment before regulations are changed and require that covered settlements undergo OIRA review before they are submitted to the court.Court Reform: Governor Bush will nominate judges and justices who recognize and are committed to the judiciary\'s critical role in enforcing statutory and constitutional limits on regulators\' authority. He will also promote legislation to limit the deference that courts give to agency interpretations of congressional enactments. For instance, absent explicit congressional directive, courts should reject regulations premised upon novel statutory interpretations that depart from ordinary, common-sense definitions.Congressional Oversight: Governor Bush will promote legislation to enable more robust congressional oversight of regulations. Consistent with the REINS Act, Congress will be required to approve, through an up-or-down vote, critical regulations that impose outsized burdens on the economy before they take effect.Licensing Reform: Governor Bush will work with state leaders to develop appropriate federal incentives to encourage increased licensing reciprocity between states and substitution of lesser forms of regulation (e.g., certification, registration, no regulation) for existing licensing regimes that do more to protect incumbents than the public.Reform Goal #3: Reduce red tape and uncertainty to restore business dynamism.The government has strangled itself with red tape, rendering decision making on reasonable timetables nearly impossibleunduly hindering private initiative in the process. The United States ranks a dismal 41st in the world in ""dealing with construction permits.""The country\'s infrastructure is growing obsolete and, in some cases, dangerousroads, bridges, power generation and transmission facilities, water treatment and delivery systems, and ports all need repairs and upgrades. Yet it can take years to complete required environmental reviews and other permitting processes. Environmental reviews and permits are necessary to empower government to make informed tradeoffs between development and the environment. Project opponents, however, have increasingly abused the process to make projects costlier and to delay their implementation.The stakes are very high. Delays burden both the economy and the environment. Wasted energy attributable to the country\'s outdated power grid is equal to the output of 200 coal-burning power plants. Failure to build and upgrade roads, bridges, and railway projects prolong pollution-generating bottlenecks. Overall, delay may cost the economy nearly twice as much as simply giving American infrastructure the upgrades it needs. The upside of cutting this red tape is enormous: by one estimate, building all of the projects caught up in our permitting system could produce up to 1.9 million jobs and $1.1 trillion in economic activity during each year of construction.Examples:Much of America\'s infrastructure is between 50 and 100 years old and must be modernized. Accomplishing this task would stimulate the economy, create close to two million jobs, and improve environmental outcomes. But regulations and litigation bog projects down, sometimes for more than a decade.The Bayonne Bridge is not high enough to allow the next generation of cargo ships to access the Port of Newark, which processes 10 percent of shipping containers entering the United States and employs roughly 250,000 people. Incredibly, federal environmental review of the solution, which called for raising the bridge on its existing footprint, took five years. One of the EPA\'s core concerns was that enabling the port\'s continued vitality by raising the bridge could generate ""too much"" truck traffic in nearby neighborhoods.The Hempstead power plant in Arkansas filed for its first permit in 2006. It has been delayed by litigation that has deployed ""virtually every statute and regulation"" in the books to challenge ""permits and approvals under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and several others."" Regardless of the outcome of the review, we need a faster review system if we are going to create a favorable climate for business investment.Since 2005, Shell Oil has paid nearly $2.1 billion for federal leases in Alaska. It took years, however, to obtain the permits necessary to operate the drilling rig, diminishing other investors\' interest in energy exploration in Alaska.Policy Solutions:Permit Streamlining: Governor Bush will reorganize and streamline the federal permitting process so that, absent extraordinary circumstances, infrastructure projects can be permitted or rejected within two years. He will promote early coordination with stakeholders, synchronize reviews (so that, for instance, EPA and Army Corps of Engineers reviews occur simultaneously), reduce the number of decision makers by ensuring that each project is managed by a lead agency with authority to conclusively move projects forward, empower agencies to rely on high-quality and up-to-date environmental reviews that are already on file, and establish clear lines of authority up to the White House to assist the lead agency in dispute resolution. A comprehensive dashboard will also keep interested parties up to date on the status of any project, and let the public know when agencies have fallen behind schedule.Environmental Litigation Reform: Governor Bush will advance legislation to reform environmental litigation so that it is not a tool of delay. Environmental litigation will be subject to strict standing rulesso that only parties who stand to suffer injury from the action can sueand statutes of limitation. It will also be subject to fast-track procedures. In addition, courts will be instructed to give economic growth and job creation at least as much weight in the analysis as other concerns.ConclusionFederal regulation is holding America back from its potential, stifling job creation, inhibiting growth and responding to the needs of special interests rather than Americans. Governor Bush believes that America can break free of the so-called new normal of two percent economic growth and set its sights on a high growth strategy that will lift people out of poverty and give everyone a chance to achieve their dreams. These reforms are critical to that vision, fixing a broken regulatory system and unleashing the spirit and ingenuity of the American people.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 22, 2015","b""Press Release - How I'll Slash the Regulation Tax""","b'As president, I\'ll repeal the coal ash rule, the clean water rule, net neutrality, and much more.To understand what is wrong with the regulatory culture of the U.S. under President Obama, consider this alarming statistic: Today, according to the World Banknot exactly a right-wing think tankthe U.S. ranks 46th in the world in terms of ease of starting a business. That is unacceptable.Think what the U.S. could be and the prosperity we could have if we rolled back the overregulation that keeps us from ranking in the top 10. It wouldn\'t just be easier to start a business. It would also be easier to find a job, get lifesaving medicine, get a loan, and see a doctor or health professional. Costs and prices would go down. The U.S. economy, stalled in the worst economic expansion since World War II, would be unleashed. Regulatory reform alone could add more than three percentage points to U.S. GDP by 2025.Since January 2009, the Obama administration has mired America\'s free market in a flood of creativity-crushing and job-killing rules. This administration has issued rules targeting banks, farms, medical offices, hospitals, credit unions, insurers, tanning and nail salons, power plants, factories, federal contractors, cars, trucks and appliances. And in perhaps its most shocking display of regulatory overreach, it is regulating the Internet as a public utility, using a statute written in the 1930s.If you\'re wondering why it\'s hard to get a mortgage, why no new banks are opening up, why your power bill will be going up, why your health insurance costs more, why we don\'t build new highways, why you can\'t get medicines that are available in Europe, Barack Obama\'s rules are a big part of the story.These rules create a moat around America\'s wealthiest and well-connected. They can afford to comply and absorb the costs. The burden of meeting the new rules\' requirements falls heaviest on everyone else through higher prices. And if a business can\'t pass on the cost of new rules to consumers, it just cuts wages or jobs.The increased cost of new regulations, in time and money, has been phenomenal. According to the American Action Forum, since Mr. Obama took office, new regulations have resulted in an additional 443 million hours of paperwork each year for Americans. All told, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute\'s 2015 report on the federal regulatory state, regulations impose a $1.88 trillion silent tax on the U.S. economy each yearthat\'s nearly $15,000 per family. For every second of his presidency, Mr. Obama has added roughly $3,100 in regulatory burdens to the economy.It\'s time we did a better job regulating the regulators. My goal as president would be to find and retire the rules that are posing a major obstacle to people who want to get a job, start a business, move up the income ladder or do anything else that contributes to the prosperity of this nation. If elected president, I will use my executive authority to direct agencies to create one dollar of regulatory savings for each new dollar of regulatory cost they propose. We will eliminate and reform outdated and burdensome rules and, when necessary, work with Congress and the courts to overcome legal obstacles that stand in the way of sensible savings.My administration will create a commission charged with reviewing regulations from the perspective of the regulated and shifting more power from Congress back to states. In my administration, every regulation, including those issued by so-called independent agencies such as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, will have to satisfy a rigorous White House review process, including a cost-benefit analysis. Regulations will be issued only if they address a major market or policy failure. Regulators will be directed to favor private and state-driven solutions unless it is clear that federal intervention is necessary and appropriate.My administration will also supercharge infrastructure projects by restructuring the permitting process for roads, highways, bridges, ports, pipelines, wind farms and other vital infrastructure projects. Permitting decisions will be made within two years instead of 10. And I will sign legislation to prevent frivolous litigation from endlessly tying up federal infrastructure projects in court.As early as possible, I promise to roll back many of the most reckless and damaging rules promulgated under President Obama. As president, I will repeal the Environment Protection Agency\'s new rule extending federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over millions of acres of private land, its new regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Power Plan, and its new and costly coal-ash standards for power plants. I will also work to repeal the so-called net-neutrality rule forced on the Federal Communications Commission by the White House and the Department of Education\'s ""gainful employment"" rule that punishes for-profit colleges. That\'s for starters.I will also work with Congress to repeal significant portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, and we will reform the complex set of rules that perpetuate too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Later this fall, I will announce a detailed agenda to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Regulation feeds into Washington\'s revolving-door culture. Regulators spend years writing complex rules, then leave for the private sector to sell their inside knowledge to the highest bidderusually a big, well-entrenched company. No wonder so many Americans are cynical about who Washington really works for.Most important, as president, I will be guided by the faith that we are a nation of free men and women who are capable of achieving far more than liberals and regulators believe possible. Once we remove the burdens of overregulation, America will once again reclaim its reputation for inventiveness, energy and boundless opportunity.Originally posted on the Wall Street Journal'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 23, 2015",b'Press Release - The Power of My Catholic Faith',"b'Millions of American Catholics, like me, are excited that Pope Francis is making his first journey to the United States. In our Holy Father, we have a model of personal holiness and deep concern for the most vulnerable among us. He reminds us to speak out for the persecuted, advocate for the unborn, comfort the afflicted and welcome the stranger.Catholicism has grounded my own life. In Catholic teachings, the family is a ""domestic church,"" and the Catholic faithful are a kind of extended family. The Catholic Church has always bound my own family together.Even before my own conversion, we attended Mass together, sharing as a family the message of hope and love, praying for peace and grace. My wife was raised in the Catholic faith, we were married in a Catholic student center, and we in turn raised our children as Catholics.After I lost my first campaign for governor of Florida in 1994, I took stock of my life and my beliefs, and I decided to fully embrace the faith that had been guiding my family and me for many years. I attended Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults classes. I gained a deeper appreciation for the sacraments of the church and the grace they impart. I studied Catholic Church doctrine, and how it is renewed in every age. The more I learned, the more I appreciated the rich history of the church and its teachings, and my heart was changed by God\'s hand.In the 20 years since my conversion, the church has given me the faith and hope to cope with life\'s many challenges.Members of my family were blessed to meet Pope John Paul II, one of the truly great saints of our time. I vividly remember 1979, when Saint John Paul, in solidarity with the Polish people, gave communion to more than 1 million Catholics in Warsaw, nourishing their faith and encouraging their determination to live in truth. He set a fire of liberty that led to the freedom of Poland and the end of Soviet domination.I have witnessed the power of God, through his church, to touch lives and transform the worldI have witnessed the power of God, through his church, to touch lives and transform the world  both on the world stage and in my own heart. The church has grounded me and my beliefs in a deep way of thinking about mercy, penance and the dignity and potential of every life, young and old, rich and poor, born and not yet born.The power of that Catholic faith can be seen today, not only in the crowds that will greet Pope Francis in the coming days, but in the millions of men and women who heal the sick, comfort the lonely, work for peace and feed the hungry. It is a faith that touches heart and mind, and it brings comfort to all who listen to its message of hope. And it is a faith that I am proud to call my own.'"

The centerpiece of my economic agenda is a bold tax reform proposal that will allow families to keep more of their hard-earned money and make American businesses, especially manufacturers, more competitive.The centerpiece of my economic agenda is a bold tax reform proposal that will allow families to keep more of their hard-earned money and make American businesses, especially manufacturers, more competitive.For taxpayers, my plan would consolidate the seven current brackets into three  at 28 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent. We would eliminate many of the carve outs, loopholes and special interests provisions in the tax code that benefit the politically connected who can hire the best tax lawyers and lobbyists. Under my plan, a family of four with income under $40,000 would no longer pay federal income taxes and the average middle class family will receive a tax reduction of approximately $2,000. A family of four earning the median family income would see a 40 percent reduction in their annual tax bill.Allowing families to keep more of their hard-earned money will lighten their burdens and accelerate our economic growth. There is no doubt that this additional money in their pocketbooks will be better spent, saved or invested than if it were shipped off to Washington, D.C.For employers, my tax reform plan would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Right now, U.S. businesses pay the highest corporate taxes in the developed world. Under my plan, the rate American job providers pay would fall to 5 percentage points less than China's top tax rate, ensuring that American workers will be more competitive and that good-paying manufacturing jobs can be created in large numbers again in our nation. To further promote economic growth, my tax reform plan would allow businesses to receive full expensing when they invest in new equipment rather than deal with the complicated depreciation system that exists today.Taken together, my reform proposals, which are the boldest since Ronald Reagan upended the tax code in 1986, will put our nation on the path to 4 percent economic growth, 19 million new jobs and rising wages for the middle class.Hillary Clinton and others on the defeatist left are already attacking my plan because it threatens the big government status quo they so feverishly defend. Clinton and her allies refuse to believe that we can do better than the new normal of 2 percent growth that has produced one of the weakest recoveries in U.S. history, the lowest workforce participation rate in 38 years and a $2,000 decline in middle class family incomes under President Barack Obama.I know America can do better if we cut taxes, streamline regulations and make it easier for businesses to compete. This isn't a theoretical exercise. One has to look no further than the example we set in Florida during my eight years as governor. We cut taxes every year by a total of $19 billion. We took on the trial lawyers to pass meaningful legal reform. And we reformed workers' compensation to make our small businesses more competitive. The results speak for themselves. Florida led the nation in job creation during the final seven years of my administration. We led the nation in small business creation and 1.3 million net new jobs were created as middle class incomes rose by $1,300.As president of the United States, I will work hard to fix our convoluted tax system, restore common sense to federal regulations and harness the power of the energy revolution to bring manufacturing back to America. It is simply unacceptable that millions of Americans are trapped in low-paying jobs or can't even find a job.If we fix a few big things, this can truly be the best time to be alive in American history. We are on the verge of our greatest century and I have the ideas and leadership skills to make America an economic superpower again.Originally posted on The Detroit News"""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 25, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb's Newest Supporter""",b''
Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 25, 2015",b'Press Release - Jewish Leadership for Jeb',"b'Jeb has condemned the recent terrorism directed at Israelis. In a recent tweet he said:It\'s past time for Obama Admin to call on Palestinian leadership to stop incitement, combat terrorism and accept Israel\'s right to exist.Follow Jeb on Twitter and Facebook.When I launched my campaign, I was proud to count some long-time friends as my supporters. They have been with me since my earliest days in Florida, and we have shared great memories together. Among them include members of the Jewish community who have welcomed me into their homes for Passover Seder, taken me as a travel companion to Israel and worked with me on issues of shared concern, such as religious freedom, school choice and economic opportunity. Having their support has meant so much, and we are looking to build that team.My hope is to campaign in every state and in every community, because I believe my message and conservative ideas will resonate everywhere. We will rebuild our economy so everyone can have a chance to rise. We will defend the institutions of faith and civic engagement, which are this nation\'s glory. We will confront anti-Semitism wherever it exists. We will restore our alliances around the world, especially with the brave and democratic State of Israel.Getting involved in my campaign will make a difference as we work to accomplish these goals. Everyone can do their part, and I\'m asking our volunteers to pitch in, gather signatures to get on the ballot, help raise funds, talk to their friends and build the kind of campaign we need to win the nomination and then the election. The work ahead will be challenging, but I hope it will be joyful.Jeb has support from across a broad spectrum of the Jewish community. Here is what some of our supporters have to say:""There are four qualifications for the presidency in which Jeb surpasses all other candidates: intelligence, temperament, relevant experience, and a focused commitment to using this nation\'s strength to defend the values that underlie Western civilization.""  Former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey""I am supporting Jeb Bush for President because I saw first hand as a Florida resident how Gov Bush was an effective and strong leader. I have no doubt that the world leaders who currently see weakness in American leadership will know once Jeb is elected that the Boss is Back.""  Ms. Morgan Ortagus""Governor Bush appreciates the unique relationship we have with the State of Israel. There is no better friend to the most stable democracy in the Middle East than Governor Bush. The stability and security of Israel is a major concern to people of faith across our nation and there is no one better to restore this vital relationship than Jeb Bush.""  Dr. Jason J. Rosenberg""I have personally known Jeb for over 20 years. I have been with him at events related to both the Jewish community and Israel. I have had intimate conversation with Jeb about Israel and the Jewish people both prior, during and after his many trips to Israel. There is no one running for President today that has a deeper understanding and deeper connection to Israel and the Jewish people than Jeb. And no other candidate will be as committed a friend to Israel than my dear friend Jeb Bush.""  Ambassador Ned Siegel""I am supporting Jeb Bush for President because he is great on all issues relating to Israel. He is honest and cares. Jeb Bush is a great patriot and Zionist.""  Mr. Isaac ""Yitz"" Applbaum""Today Israel is threatened from without by Iran through Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds forces in Syria and from within by a coordinated effort by Abbas and Hamas to terrorize Israelis with seemingly random attacks inside Israel. Obama has followed his typical ""blame the victim"" policy of accusing Israel of over-reacting to the attacks on innocent Israeli citizens as they go about their daily lives in Jerusalem and other cities. We need a President with the moral clarity to recognize the truth of the situation and the courage to speak lout, regardless of political correctness and what the Europeans might think. Jeb is the leader who can and will speak out for our ally Israel as it is besieged by these threats from within and without.""  Mrs. Leora R. Levy""Jeb has proven himself a strong leader, and clearly has such conviction. What\'s more, Jeb does not view political adversaries as implacable enemies. Repairing the breach in American society, arresting the trend of political polarization, are essential for a century of peace and prosperity. By successfully governing one of America\'s most diverse states, and earning the confidence and respect even of his political opponents, Jeb is the only candidate who can indeed bring Americans closer together.""  Michael Granoff""It is no accident that the erosion of America\'s economy coincides with the destructive chaos that currently rules the globe. Ironically, we are at a time in our history where innovation can give wings to every dream. Jeb has the right ideas, values, abilities and determination to bring all Americans together, leverage that national strength of innovation and put us back in charge of our own destiny so that an economically revitalized America can once again be a global source of inspiration and strength for everyone in the world that believes in individual freedom and economic progress for all.""  David Carmen""I support Jeb because he\'s the only candidate who has the experience and temperament to lead this country at this incredibly challenging time. The simple truth is that no one is more qualified for the office than Jeb.""  David Germunder""Gov. Jeb Bush has the strongest record of leadership and clearest vision for a optimistic, principled leadership that will restore our economy and our nation\'s power for good in the world. When others seem to run on anger and promises, he is running to restore the American Dream to my and future generations.""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 25, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb Bush: Bad Regs Have To Go',"b""President Obama has presided over a massive expansion of the federal government during his six and half years in office. He shepherded Obamacare into law  a $1.7 trillion spending bill that vastly increased Washington's role in the healthcare industry. He has raised taxes by nearly $2 trillion, while adding $8 trillion tor the national debt. The president has also imposed more than 2,500 new regulations on the American economy that carry a staggering price tag of $670 billion.It should come as no surprise then that our economy has limped along during the Obama presidency. The anemic two percent rate of growth on his watch is one of the weakest recoveries in American history and it has resulted in labor force participation falling to a 38-year low. Middle class families' incomes have fallen by $2,000 and there are six million more people living in poverty today than when Barack Obama took the oath of office.Right now, federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion a year. This works out to an average of $15,000 per household. We need to cut excessive federal red tape and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in our nation.Obama-era regulations such as those in Dodd-Frank, Obamacare, and his War on Coal are having a chilling effect on our economy. As president of the United States, I will conduct a spring cleaning of existing regulations to get rid of the ones that are too costly or not providing value to the American people. I will establish a regulatory budget that ensures that for every new dollar of regulations we impose on the American people we cut a dollar of existing regulations somewhere else. I will appoint judges to the judiciary who are committed to reining in regulatory excesses and preventing unelected regulators from exceeding the intent of Congress.Finally, I will sign into law the REINS Act, which will provide another check on executive agency regulatory authority. The REINS Act would ensure that major rules and regulations are approved by Congress before they can take effect.Regulations act as a hidden tax on the American people. Reining in their cost is just as important as reducing taxes. When coupled with my bold plan to reduce tax rates and simplify our tax code, my regulatory reform agenda will help drive America to four percent annual growth. Together, these policies will result in the average family seeing their income increase by $3,000 and their tax burden decline by $2,000. This is a significant boost in a middle class family's budget that will make it easier for them to pay the mortgage, buy groceries, save for college and build a nest egg for retirement.I know how to do this, because as governor of Florida, I cut taxes every year, by $19 billion total. I streamlined regulations and made my state the national leader in small business creation. During the final seven years of my governorship, Florida led the nation in job creation. Our unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent and we added 1.3 million new jobs. Over the course of my full two terms in office, Florida averaged 4.4 percent economic growth.Secretary Hillary Clinton will double down on the massive expansion of taxes, debt and regulations we have seen under President Obama. I am offering the country a different vision that will empower entrepreneurs and American businesses to grow and provide better wages and benefits to the American people. I look forward to having the debate with Hillary Clinton and her allies on the defeatist Left about how best to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in America and provide a boost to a middle class that hasn't seen its wages rise in 15 years.Originally posted on the Washington Examiner"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 28, 2015","b'Press Release - Jeb Bush: My tax proposal would deliver $2,000 to middle-class families'","b""Hillary Clinton would continue Obama economic policies that squeeze Americans.I recently unveiled a dramatic tax reform plan that upends a dysfunctional and complicated tax code that was written by special interests. We would go from seven brackets to three (28%, 25% and 10%). To get to the lower rates  which are essential to sparking economic growth  the plan would eliminate carve outs, loopholes and deductions that primarily benefit the wealthy.My plan would also reduce the top corporate rate that American businesses pay from 35% to 20%. At 35%, our job providers pay the highest business taxes in the industrialized world. Is it any wonder we have been losing jobs to our foreign competitors? Under these reforms, American businesses would pay five percentage points less than Chinese companies. This would help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and make American workers more competitive across the board.Most important, the plan would put nearly $2,000 back in the pockets of the average middle-class family in America by increasing their after-tax income. This is real money that will make a big difference in the lives of millions of working families. Two thousand dollars is four mortgage payments for the median American household; or eight months of gas; or six months of utilities; or about three months of groceries. Better yet, if a family were to invest the $2,000 they would save annually over a 20-year period and at compounded interest rate of 8%, they would accumulate a nest egg of $108,000 to help better prepare them for a comfortable retirement.Hillary Clinton's allies on the defeatist left have predictably attacked my plan as benefiting the rich. But when you dig into the details, it provides a significant boost to the middle class. A family of four with $40,000 of income would no longer pay income taxes, and with the added savings, their standard of living would see significant improvement.I look forward to having a lively debate with Secretary Clinton about tax policy and how best to boost wages. Clinton is doubling down on the failed economic policies of President Obama that have resulted in the middle class losing nearly $2,000 of income over his time in office. I have a bold plan to provide them with $2,000 of tax relief and to get America's economy growing at 4%  a rate of expansion that will ensure that the middle class receives a true pay raise for the first time in 15 years.Original Posted on USA Today"""

Jeb Bush has an energy plan to create millions of jobs, increase wages and lower energy costs:Let the US Export Oil and Natural GasLift the ban on exporting American crude oil. Remove restrictions on exporting natural gas. Lifting the ban would create a million new manufacturing jobs and rapidly reduce gasoline prices.Give More Deference to States That Want to DrillThe Obama Administration is preventing willing states, such as Alaska and Virginia, from fully developing energy resources. Hillary Clinton has taken an even more extreme position: She would flatly prohibit drilling off Alaska's north coast. Washington should listen to states and tribes, deferring more often to what they want for their citizens.Approve the Keystone XL PipelinePresident Obama and Hillary Clinton politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. Building it would increase economic growth by over $3 billion and support 42,000 jobs while the pipeline is under construction.Reduce OverregulationOverregulation discourages domestic energy production and increases gas, heating and electricity costs on families. The Obama Administration's rules often usurp state and tribal authorities and go beyond what is necessary to protect quality of life and the environment. Some, such as President Obama's Carbon Rule, need to be stopped in their tracks.Affordable Energy Can Help All Americans RiseJeb will be announcing other energy policies in the coming months, but taken together, these policies will unleash domestic energy production, creating millions of jobs, higher wages and cheaper gas and electricity.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"September 29, 2015",b'Press Release - My Message for Hispanic Heritage Month 2015',"b""By Columba BushFormer First Lady of the State of FloridaThis year marks the 27th anniversary of National Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15  October 15), a month-long recognition of the many contributions Hispanics and Latinos have made to our country. In honor of the anniversary of Independence Day for five Latin American countries, September 15th was chosen as the official kickoff day for this important month. As an American of Hispanic origin, I am proud to celebrate my heritage and join with each of you as we recognize the tremendous influence of the Hispanic culture on our great nation.Love of faith, family, friends, and food are often considered the foundation of the Hispanic culture. When I met Jeb 41 years ago, I was moved by his willingness to learn Spanish and his desire to immerse himself completely in the Hispanic culture. I often tell friends that Jeb not only fell in love with me but simultaneously fell in love with our culture and our people. After marrying Jeb and moving to the United States, I quickly realized that the love of faith, family, friends, and food are the cornerstones of the many cultures represented in this diverse country.In the early 90's, I had the pleasure of blending my love of art, education, and heritage by assisting with the creation of the Children's Educational Fund of the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico which provided the opportunity for school age children in the United States to attend dance performances that emphasized local folk culture while combining ballet characteristics. One of the greatest joys of my adulthood was watching these performances through the eyes of small children.While serving as Governor and First Lady of the State of Florida, Jeb and I recognized National Hispanic Heritage Month each year by hosting a reception at the Governor's Mansion honoring the contributions of Florida's Hispanic community to the state's cultural heritage. We proudly displayed paintings by Salvadore Dali, the prominent Spanish surrealist painter, Romero Britto, a Brazilian Neo-pop artist as well as countless others and invited schools in the area to tour the Mansion and learn about the importance of our Hispanic artists.I believe that those of us who are given a voice should use it to educate and promote issues that are near and dear to our hearts. As such, in recognition of 2015's National Hispanic Heritage Month, I am asking each of you to engage in one activity that expands your knowledge of the Hispanic culture. Visit your local public library and identify a book for your children to read that highlights the history of Hispanic leadership in the United States. Gather as a family and cook a meal that originates from a Latin country and share the recipe with your friends. Go to a museum that highlights Hispanic artists and if you find yourself in the Washington, D.C. area visit the Smithsonian where they plan to honor Hispanic Heritage Month by showcasing vibrant performances, lectures, family activities, and exhibitions at various museums throughout the Institution. And perhaps you will consider volunteering at your local community based charity because I can think of nothing more appropriate than giving back to others during a time of celebration.As a wife, mother and grandmother, I am very proud to see my Hispanic American children and grandchildren grow and succeed in the love and strength of our cultures. I love that as a multi-cultural family, we get to celebrate and enjoy all that America offers us. Most importantly, I am proud to be a citizen of the United States, a country that is comprised by so many who comes from around the globe to join us as we stand as one nation under God. It is truly an exceptional nation that embraces and cherishes each and every culture.Originally Posted on Fox News Latino"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 5, 2015",b'Press Release - An Escape From Domestic Violence',"b""By Columba BushFormer First Lady of the State of FloridaThe 2014 Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Uniform Crime Report reflects a 10.2 percent increase in domestic violence homicides, which represents a stunning 20.9 percent of all homicides in our state. During the 2014/2015 fiscal year, Florida's 42 certified domestic violence centers provided 546,658 nights of emergency shelter to 15,397 survivors and their children, many who fled a violent home with nothing but the clothes on their backs.For the past 15 years, I have worked side by side with the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence (FCADV) to raise awareness about the impact of domestic violence on our state, our communities and our families. During this time, I learned that our certified domestic violence centers are the heart and soul of prevention and intervention.My work in Florida has taught me that the strength of one shelter is a direct result of the unity of all shelters working toward the common goal of ending domestic violence.During the past several months, I have traveled the country touring domestic violence shelters in both large and small states.I have spent hours talking with advocates working in shelters and continue to hear about the lack of available resources to provide critical emergency shelter services to survivors and their children.These advocates are warriors in their communities and work tirelessly to help women, children and men devastated by domestic violence.In one shelter, I met a mother holding a 2-week-old infant while she discussed a potential job opportunity with an advocate. At another shelter, a survivor shared her story of survival, which was built upon the foundation of hope for the future. And during one tour, I spoke with a proud 12-year-old boy who just returned from a baseball game where he was named Most Valuable Player.Each of these visits inspired me and reaffirmed my commitment to work harder to raise awareness about domestic violence while also increasing resources for survivors and their children.October is recognized nationally as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a time when we honor and remember those who have lost their lives at the hands of someone they once loved and trusted. It is also a time to celebrate the lives of survivors who were able to escape their violent homes.As part of my efforts each year, I ask you to engage in one activity during October to raise awareness about domestic violence.Each year, I am amazed and delighted with the breadth of your creativity, from educating your children about healthy relationships to volunteering with your local domestic violence center.Many of you emailed me with updates of your ongoing activities to combat this crime that plagues too many families.I love hearing about your efforts to raise awareness about domestic violence, so please continue to email me at [emailprotected]By taking action, you are lending your voice to those individuals most silenced and affected by domestic violence. In addition to your local efforts, consider contributing in one of the following additional ways: Consider joining Jeb and me at the fourth annual FCADV Foundation Door to Hope dinner on Oct. 17 at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. Visit: fcadv.org/foundation/door-to-hope for information.For the first time, the FCADVF was selected to participate in the Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse Challenge for an opportunity to win $100,000 to support Florida's 42 certified domestic violence centers.Please consider donating to the Purple Purse Challenge before Oct. 27 by clicking donate.For more information:fcadv.org/purple-purse.If you or someone you know is living in fear, call the toll-free statewide Florida Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-500-1119 for help.You are not alone.Originally Posted on the Miami Herald"""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 5, 2015",b'Press Release - Making the Domestic Energy Boom Work for America and Its Allies',"b""The energy revolution can be harnessed not only to fuel dramatic economic growth, but also as a powerful geostrategic force multiplier to strengthen our own national security. The advantage of seizing this opportunity can be seen most clearly with respect to Russia.One predictable consequence of President Obama's abdication of American leadership is that Russian president Vladimir Putin has become increasingly aggressive in undermining U.S. interests.In the wake of Obama's disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran, Putin has moved quickly to expand Russia's influence in the Middle East. In concert with Iran, he has deployed military forces to prop up an Assad regime whose brutal war against the Syrian people has left more than 250,000 dead, generated a massive refugee crisis, and fueled the rise of ISIS.Putin's invasion of Ukraine and threats to our Baltic allies not only threaten the NATO alliance's cohesion and the stability of Europe but also erode fundamental principles of the international system.Putin is a bully who has exploited Europe's dependence on Russian energy for too long. Although a more comprehensive international strategy will be necessary to respond broadly to Putin's aggression, we can start helping ourselves and our allies by putting more American energy on the global market.We need to lift the ban on U.S. oil exports and make it easier to export natural gas.We are at a watershed moment in our nation's history. Through a combination of two American inventions, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, the United States has become the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil combined.The unexpected growth of energy production has been an economic boon across the country. Families have saved, on average, about $1,000 a year because of lower energy prices. Many households have saved twice that much.The abundance of American-made energy has also strengthened businesses, touching off a nationwide manufacturing renaissance. In the next 15 years, we could add 900,000 new manufacturing jobs.And yet, the federal government under President Obama seems to be apathetic, or even hostile, to America's new status as an energy superpower. The Obama administration is stuck on the policies of the past, wedded to an energy scarcity that ties our hands. In the last five years, natural-gas production has increased by over 30 percent on private- and state-owned land, while it decreased by about 30 percent on federal land. And the Obama administration's new anti-fracking regulations could further depress production.Nothing shows the Obama administration's energy antipathy more starkly than the president's politically motivated veto of the Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline would help domestic and Canadian oil get to market, solidify the U.S.Canadian partnership, and support 42,000 American jobs while it was under construction. Hillary Clinton shares the anti-energy mindset of Barack Obama. She opposes the Keystone Pipeline and is calling for more regulations from Washington, which could squander the benefits of the energy revolution.We should be doing everything we can to responsibly maximize the newly found supplies of American energy. Incredibly, the Obama administration still prohibits the export of crude oil despite multiple analyses showing that such exports would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive down gas prices even further.National-security experts across the political spectrum share my belief that lifting the crude-oil ban would better leverage U.S. interests abroad and reduce Russia's influence on Europe. This policy would be far more effective than the failed Russian-reset strategy pursued by Secretary Clinton or the equally nave thinking embodied by Obama's current Russia policy.President Obama has the discretion to start allowing the export of crude oil today. Why is he willing to lift sanctions and let Iran, the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism, resume oil exports, while denying the same opportunity to American producers?We need to get Washington out of the way and allow America to assert its energy prowess in the world. The right national energy strategy will enhance our foreign policy by strengthening our allies in Europe at the expense of regimes like Putin's, which cynically use energy as a weapon.Lifting the ban on U.S. oil exports and making it easier to export American natural gas would strengthen our economy and our national security. If President Obama won't do this, I will.Originally Posted on the National Review"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 6, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: Shaking Up Mount Washington',"b'Seven years into Barack Obama\'s presidency, the American people are growing increasingly distrustful of all things happening in Washington, D.C.A recent Iowa Poll conducted for TheDes Moines Registerfound that 90 percent of potential Republican caucus-goers were either unsatisfied or ""mad as hell"" about the federal government. It is not hard to see why. President Obama has led a massive expansion of the federal government.If left unchecked, over the next 10 years, he will have raised taxes by nearly $2 trillion. At the same time, he has still managed to grow the national debt by $8 trillion.His signature policy achievement, Obamacare, has been a drag on economic growth, discouraging hiring and resulting in businesses cutting back on workers\' hours. For the first time in history, more American businesses are failing than starting up. Workforce participation has fallen to a 38-year low. Middle-class families\' incomes have declined by $2,000 and 6 million more people are living in poverty.While the American people struggle under the failed leadership of Barack Obama, the insiders in Washington, D.C., have never had it better. The nation\'s capital is now America\'s new boomtown with the highest per capita income in the country. The wealth explosion in Washington is not attributed to innovation or manufacturing new products. It is driven almost completely by influence peddling. There is something deeply wrong with the fact that special interest groups, lobbyists and political insiders are profiting from bigger government, higher taxes and a soaring national debt while the average middle-class family in America hasn\'t received a pay raise in 15 years.While others in this race pay lip service to reforming Washington, I am the one candidate for president with the strongest record of bringing disruptive change to government. As governor of Florida, I turned the political culture of Tallahassee upside down. We took on the teachers unions to make Florida a national leader in school choice and school accountability. We took on public employee unions to shrink the size of the state bureaucracy by 11 percent. We took on trial lawyers to rein in frivolous lawsuits and make our business climate more conducive to small business growth. And we took on big spending politicians from both parties to balance eight budgets and cut taxes eight years in a row by a total of $19 billion.My reform agenda includes passing a Balanced Budget Amendment and line-item veto to put an end to the deficit spending and crushing debt that is threatening America\'s future. I will push for a six-year lobbying ban on former senators and members of Congress, closing the revolving door of the influence industry. I will push for term limits to end political careerism. And I will fight for a new law to cut the pay of lawmakers who refuse to show up for work. If they skip votes or miss hearings, they should have their paychecks dockedthat\'s what happens in the private sector. Finally, I will dramatically downsize the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent, matching the level of reduction in government I achieved in Tallahassee.These reforms will make the political class more accountable to the American people and turn off the spending spigot. But the most important things we can do to curtail the arrogance and overreach of the federal government is to dramatically change our tax and regulatory systems. The status quo benefits the politically connected who can hire the best lawyers and lobbyists. It is time to clean out the tax code of all the special carve outs, deductions and loopholes that benefit the wealthy so we can provide real tax relief to the middle class. My tax plan would put $2,000 back into the pockets of the average working family in the nation, and my regulatory reform agenda will unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in the nation and make it possible for more Americans to start and build successful small businesses.We are at a watershed moment in our nation\'s history. The American people are yearning for change. The question is who can deliver it. We are not going to fix a dysfunctional Washington, D.C., by electing a celebrity entertainer or D.C. senator who is either part of the problem or has proven incapable of fixing it. I have the most successful conservative governing record in the field and I intend to be a president who will shake up Washington in a dramatic and profound way that will free up the American people to pursue their dreams and achieve earned success.Originally Posted on the Des Moines Register'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 13, 2015",b'Press Release - Backgrounder: Health Care Plan',"b'America\'s health care system has long been an anachronism. It works by payment rules, regulations and tax policies that date back to the 1940s and 1960s and have made little sense for decades. No wonder it is expensive, complex and inaccessible. And ObamaCare has only further entrenched and worsened its problems. It is time to introduce health care to the 21st century and enable the possibilities of 2025. Governor Bush believes transformational solutions should accomplish three goals:Promote innovation Lower costs Return power to statesChange and disruptive innovation happen across the American economy. Medicine itself is modernizing, despite an unusual number of barriers. Smart phones make it possible to video chat with doctors and caregivers. Precision medicine can personalize and more effectively treat cancer and other diseases. 3D printers can turn out replacement blood vessels, liver cells and heart valves. Unfortunately, Washington has been micromanaging and holding back this progress, and preventing Americans from fully benefitting from it. Instead, it should put itself on the side of transformational innovation driven by the ingenuity of Americans.This would not only help medicine make us healthier, it is also the only strategy to bring down health care costs for hard-working Americans who see their wages suppressed, their premiums rise or their access to care prove inadequate when it matters most.Unfortunately, ObamaCare doubled down on the 1940s and 1960s-era system. Instead of promoting innovation, it regulates and taxes innovation. Instead of empowering problem-solvers in the real world, it embodies the liberal ideal that Washington needs to and can solve every problem.ObamaCare enabled Washington control of more than one-sixth of the American economy, and it confiscated citizens\' ability to select a health plan, a hospital and even a doctor. It epitomizes why Americans are so fed up with Washington. Government inserts itself into our daily lives, fails to keep its promises, fails to recognize unintended consequences, spends trillions of dollars the country does not have, disrupts the lives of millions of Americans and leaves many worse off. Americans are frustrated  and they have a right to be.American families are still facing massive premium increases. American workers still cannot get the hours they need at work to make ends meet. Four out of five Americans are now worse off under ObamaCare. By some measures, ObamaCare increased the average financial strain at every income level. While millions now have a Medicaid benefits card, they do not have coverage that gives them reliable access to care when they need it. And even after 10 years and ObamaCare\'s $1.7 trillion in spending, 27 million will still be left uninsured. With Americans still suffering, the country cannot give up.ObamaCare must be repealed and replaced. To position American health care to make the most of the potential of transformational innovation, policy solutions should go even further to stop the damage Washington central planners have caused for decades. Solutions should ensure that health care is centered on individuals, the consumers, and that the health care system benefits from the innovation that will make it more accessible, convenient, personal and affordable. Some say the problem is that American health care gives the private sector too great a role, but the real story is that Washington intervention holds back value creation in the $3.1 trillion health sector.Here are just three examples of how central planners impede value and access in America\'s health care system. First, 1940s-era wage controls led to favorable tax treatment of employer-sponsored health benefits, which biases employer health coverage over individual health coverage and biases insurance over out-of-pocket spending. Second, Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service programs in the 1960s implemented price controls across the system. This top-down approach drowns providers in regulations, mandates and shortsighted reimbursement cuts and leaves little opportunity for them to design more efficient and effective strategies to deliver care to seniors and the vulnerable. Instead of focusing on outcomes and value, providers see incentives to focus on volume. Third, government mandates and taxes  with ObamaCare representing the latest assault  force Americans to buy expensive products with benefits they do not want and may never need. Not only does this intervention deprive individuals of the right to buy policies that fit their needs, it limits competition and innovative care options.As president of the United States, Jeb Bush will make fixing the broken health care system one of his top priorities. He will work with Congress to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Governor Bush\'s reforms will get Washington out of the way and empower patients with more choices, security and control over their health care decisions. These reforms will not only lower the costs of care, they will substantially lower federal spending. They will enable a modern system that is convenient, affordable, accessible and results-oriented.How Governor Bush\'s plan will help AmericansEconomy: Repealing ObamaCare will add 0.7% tothe American economy over five years. Repealing ObamaCare is an important part of Governor Bush\'s plan to enable high, sustained economic growth leading to 19 million new jobs and rising middle-class incomes.Workers: High health care costs suppress worker wages by 2.3%. ObamaCare has reduced the aggregate number of hours worked by 1.5%, and taken four million full-time equivalent jobs out of the economy. Governor Bush\'s plan will repeal ObamaCare and address the root causes of health care costs, and enable employers and workers to balance good benefits with fair wages.Small businesses: ObamaCare has hit small businesses with higher costs and increased complexity. Governor Bush\'s plan will address the root causes of health care costs and give small businesses the option to make tax-free contributions to portable health coverage for their employees.Middle-class Americans: ObamaCare created huge new subsidies for low-income Americans, but it left middle-income Americans facing higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs. Governor Bush will give individuals without an offer of job-based coverage a tax credit, regardless of income, to help cover the cost of plans that provide preventive care and comprehensive protection for high-cost medical events. In addition, Governor Bush\'s plan will give middle-class Americans help with out-of-pocket costs through enhanced health savings accounts.Individuals who rely on Medicaid: Medicaid isn\'t delivering patients the results they deserve. For example, children on Medicaid end up using the emergency room as a doctor\'s office more than uninsured children. Governor Bush\'s plan will offer Medicaid patients more advanced care and better health outcomes.Individuals with pre-existing conditions: ObamaCare\'s centrally-planned approach has not worked. Governor Bush\'s plan will guarantee access to care for individuals with pre-existing conditions who switch to a new insurance company or move to another state.States: Rather than crowd out innovation with Washington\'s myriad regulations that ObamaCare compounded, Governor Bush will give states the freedom and accountability they need to make their insurance markets more competitive and to improve care for their most vulnerable citizens.Promote innovation in health careMedical research has identified the molecular causes of roughly 4,000 human diseases, but treatments only currently exist for approximately 250. Alzheimer\'s causes suffering for seniors and their families, it is the sixth leading cause of death in America and it costs the nation $226 billion each year. Yet, Alzheimer\'s cannot be prevented, cured or slowed. Breast cancer is still the most common cause of cancer in women, and it kills more than 41,100 women each year. It should not cost $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion nor take 12 to 15 years to advance a medicine from discovery to patients, but that is the case under the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA) current regulatory mess. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plays a critical role in developing basic science for new cures, but it lacks the resources to fund the most promising research. Right now America has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which discourages innovative companies from basing their work in America. (Governor Bush addresses this issue in his plan to grow the American economy and reform the tax code.) If the country is going to win the battle against devastating diseases, a multi-faceted strategy is needed. The country\'s entire medical ecosystem must be committed. The government must do its part, but advances will be led by the creativity and courage of America\'s scientists, care providers and innovators.American entrepreneurs have achieved disruptive innovations that improve our lives, strengthen our economy and reduce the cost of living. Think of Uber, smart phones, Twitter and Facebook. These innovations radically increase efficiency and lower costs. However, health care costs grow faster than any other sector of the economy and innovation lags. Why? Government over-regulation in health care creates high barriers to entry, adds excessive costs, fosters excessive complexity and impedes innovation. When the government tries to ""promote"" health innovation, it impedes health innovation. For example, the government spent more than $30 billion on federally-approved health information technology (IT) for physicians and hospitals, but one hospital system still cannot share patient information with another to coordinate care. And the IT systems are so complex that physicians spend less time with patients.To fight disease and promote a culture of innovation in America, Governor Bush would adopt a multi-faceted strategy to enable the private sector to drive transformational change.Modernize the FDA regulatory approach: Modernize the tools that the FDA uses to make scientific decisions, including biomarkers, patient-reported clinical outcomes and real-world data; accelerate clinical trials by utilizing patient data as it accumulates, rather than rigid predetermined timelines, to continuously modify and improve studies; allow manufacturers to share truthful, non-misleading scientific information and peer-reviewed clinical data with physicians and patients; and ensure that the FDA is adequately resourced to make timely approvals of safe and effective innovator and generic drugs.Increase funding for the NIH: Increase NIH funding for research and require the Director of the NIH to submit a more robust strategic plan and biennial report on progress toward top research priorities such as Alzheimer\'s disease, breast cancer, autism and precision medicine. The strategic plan will need the buy-in from researchers across the country to ensure research is targeted and coordinated. The strategic plan should set specific and lofty goals for Alzheimer\'s, breast cancer and autism. Even as investing in the NIH is critical, scarce resources do not need to fund studies on rabbit massages, how Buddhism explains the science of meditation and smartphone games to empower parents in vegetable-eating negotiations with their children. The NIH Director would also report publicly on efforts to eliminate unnecessary, duplicative research so that priorities have the resources to succeed.Promote private sector leadership of health information technology adoption: Lead private sector collaboration, rather than government mandates, to establish national standards for electronic health record features and data interoperability; eliminate government mandates and penalties for health care providers who do not use government-approved electronic health records; protect health information from hackers and cyber attacks; and enable patient ownership of their medical history and records. Individuals should have access to their longitudinal medical records, which will help providers offer more personalized and timely treatments for individuals.Release patient de-identified Medicare and Medicaid data: Medicare and Medicaid patient de-identified claims data would be made more broadly available for commercial purposes in its original form (it is currently made available in processed forms). This would allow entrepreneurs to use the biggest clinical data repository in the country to make health care more efficient and unlock quality and cost information for consumers. For instance, entrepreneurs could evaluate the value and benefits of various treatments much more easily.Establish a review of regulatory barriers to innovation: As outlined in Governor Bush\'s regulatory reform agenda, he will establish an independent commission to conduct a regulatory spring-cleaning. As part of this initiative, the commission would undertake a top-to-bottom review of federal regulations that impede access to higher-quality and lower-cost health innovations.Lower costs and enable portable, secure coverage for all AmericansAmerica spends twice as much as other industrialized countries on health care as a share of our economy. At least in part, this has to do with the perverse incentives federal policy creates for excessive spending throughout the system. The tax treatment of health insurance is one good example. Following World War II, the Internal Revenue Service granted favorable tax treatment to health insurance offered through businesses (an indirect response to wage controls during the war). While the employer-based system offers significant benefits (and should be protected), the tax treatment favors upfront premium payments over out-of-pocket use-based payments, such as deductibles and co-pays. This system has distorted the meaning of ""insurance"" in health care  promoting high-premium, pre-payment over value-driven insurance. Instead of protecting against high-cost events like insurance does in most sectors, third parties in health care pay the bills for common, low-cost procedures. This results in a lack of basic price signals. Consumers do not pay the bills for most of the medical services they receive so providers are not directly accountable to them for value. Furthermore, insurance companies and the government control how care is delivered and how much to pay for it, leaving little opportunity for doctors, hospitals and entrepreneurs to design innovative solutions to improve value. Until health care is oriented around consumers, providers and innovation, Americans will not get better value and results out of the health care system.A well-functioning, portable individual market is critical to meeting the needs of a 21st century workforce. At the same time, employer-sponsored health insurance represents a strong coverage platform for 154 million Americans  the largest source of private coverage. This market has recently yielded innovations in health care  despite ObamaCare. For example, defined contributions to private exchanges use robust competition to give workers real choices, responsibility and ownership of their health plans. Employers and workers should have the tools they need to lower health care costs and realize higher wages.To lower costs and create portable, secure health coverage for all Americans, Governor Bush would:Provide a tax credit to those who do not have employer coverage: Individuals who do not get coverage through their employer should also get a tax break on their individual health insurance purchase. Governor Bush would make available an advanceable, refundable tax credit for health care to those individuals as a matter of fairness. The value of this credit would:Be based on the average tax benefit that workers who get coverage through their jobs enjoy;Help Americans access a basic level of preventive benefits and protect them from losing their life savings over a major medical event;Be adjusted by age (so that it is more valuable for older Americans who may face higher premiums); andGrow with inflation each year.This would facilitate more portable and secure coverage over time. The credit would be available to Americans under age 65, regardless of income, who do not have an offer of employer-sponsored insurance. Instead of ObamaCare subsidies that go to insurance companies, these tax credits would go directly to individuals. Whatever portion of the credit is not used to cover insurance premiums could be deposited into a Health Savings Account (HSA). States would have the resources to supplement the value of the credit for low-income and vulnerable Americans.Increase contribution limits and uses for HSAs: HSAs can be used by individuals to pay for out-of-pocket costs like physician or hospital visit co-pays. Governor Bush would allow individuals to make higher tax-free contributions to HSAs, up to $6,550 vs. $3,350 today. $6,550 represents the full out-of-pocket exposure (deductibles and co-pays) on an HSA-qualified health plan. Employers could continue to make contributions to employee HSAs as well. This means that consumers with high-deductible plans will be able to fully pay for out-of-pocket expenses with pre-tax dollars. In addition, HSAs could be broadened and used for more health-related purchases like over-the-counter drugs. High-deductible plans could also be tailored for those with complex conditions, offering comprehensive care management options below the deductible. This will encourage more individuals to adopt HSAs (about 18 million currently use them), turning them into value-conscious consumers.Facilitate transparency on costs and outcomes: As consumers control more of their own health care decisions, they deserve better transparency about the value of their care. Governor Bush proposes transparency standards so that consumers have access to key information on price, outcomes and performance. For example, Florida has a website that allows consumers to compare charges and lengths of stay for hospitals across the state. This would include making simple information available about the physician and hospital networks available in insurance policies  before individuals sign up for coverage.Allow employers togive financial incentives toemployees who make healthy lifestyle choices: Employers offer health care benefits to more than 154 million Americans and are using innovative strategies to identify chronic conditions early and treat them in order to improve health and reduce unnecessary costs. This is something that should be protected. However, complicated and conflicting new government regulations aredisrupting the ability of employers to offer common-sense financial incentives to reward healthy behaviors. Governor Bush would make it clear that offering a reward forhealthy behaviors can be done. This would free employers to designhealth promotion and chronic disease management programs that haveshown promisein helping employees lead longer, healthier lives.Allow small businesses to make tax-free contributions to individual health plans: Small businesses that cannot afford to provide insurance now cannot make a tax-free contribution to health plans that their employees purchase in the individual market without facing huge penalties. Governor Bush would enable employers to make tax-free contributions to Health Reimbursement Accounts or HSAs so that their employees could purchase portable, individual market insurance policies. (For this purpose, the contribution limit for an HSA would be higher than $6,550.) This would allow small businesses to help their employees obtain health benefits, if they cannot afford the costs or complexity of offering the policy itself.Cap the employer tax exclusion:Governor Bush would allow individuals a $12,000 ($30,000 for family plans) tax break on the value of their health insurance obtained through their employers (the value of the cap would grow with inflation each year). This will encourageemployers to offer lower-costplans,but also allows employees to choose the benefits that best suit their needs.This would replace ObamaCare\'s complex and onerous ""40% tax,"" which forces employers to arbitrarily reduce benefits to avoid the taxand thus limitthe benefits employees may want and need.Even economists on the left believe that this policy would reduce spending without harming health outcomes. Further, this policy would allow employers and employees to balance the need for good benefits and increased wages.Take health care control out of Washington and return it to statesObamaCare included unprecedented and costly federal regulation of state insurance markets. For instance, individual market plans must comply with ObamaCare\'s costly ""essential health benefits"" mandates. In addition, states have to comply with a litany of rules in operating their low-income health programs and undergo a lengthy waiver process if they want to make innovative changes to improve care. Different rules for ObamaCare, Medicaid and the Children\'s Health Insurance Program make state approaches to vulnerable populations uncoordinated and cumbersome.The most responsive and effective care is best delivered locally. Patients, physicians, nurses, therapists and other health care providers live, practice, treat and collaborate in communities of care. Thus, for states to meet the needs of all its citizens, states must have responsibility to make their individual insurance markets more competitive, enhance access to care and enable community-based solutions for low-income and vulnerable Americans. Instead of Washington standardization, this emphasizes transparent outcome standards.Instead of multiple federal funding streams and sets of rules, states would present a plan to receive comprehensive and capped federal allotments. This funding could be used to provide affordable care for individuals with pre-existing conditions, the vulnerable and low-income populations. In return for this streamlined federal funding, states would be responsible to meet transparent metrics.To ensure states have the resources, ability and accountability to implement local solutions, Governor Bush would:Restore state regulation of competitive insurance markets: States receiving federal funding would have to meet the following metrics:Reform their insurance markets and allow insurers to offer an affordable, catastrophic plan. Individuals would be free to choose plans with richer benefit designs, but this reform would give that choice back to individuals to select the plan that meets their needs. This would enable a new market where insurers could offer plans with premiums equal to the newly-created tax credit, and therefore with no upfront out-of-pocket costs for individuals  allowing everyone to afford coverage that would protect them against high-cost medical events.Ensure access to affordable policies for individuals with pre-existing conditions. States would be held accountable to ensure access for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Such arrangements could require insurers to issue coverage to those who have maintained continuous coverage, establish well-funded high-risk pools, establish reinsurance arrangements or provide for risk adjustment among insurers who sell in the states. The federal government would hold states accountable for results and could provide technical assistance for a range of approaches to achieve the results. Until states implement a workable solution, there will be a federal continuous coverage protection. If an individual has maintained health insurance, they cannot be denied coverage when moving to a new state or changing insurance.Ensure access to affordable health care. States would report on access to care, including catastrophic coverage or population health outcomes. This would pave the way for provider-led care models, such as local hospitals or physicians offering primary care clinics and medical homes. (Federal funding could not be used for a Medicaid fee-for-service expansion.)Develop an action plan to reduce the growth of health care costs. States would need to develop an evidence-based action plan to address costs under their control, such as medical liability reforms or reforming payment models to focus on outcomes.Develop a transition plan for the more than 17 million low-income individuals entangled in ObamaCare. For example, states could supplement the new tax credit so that low-income individuals have a fully funded HSA to meet all of their out-of-pocket costs.Create accountability for better care and outcomes for low-income and the vulnerable:The Medicaid program today may offer a benefits card to enrollees, but it does not achieve the health outcomes that vulnerable patients need or provide reliable access to physicians. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment found that Medicaid eligibility made little difference in health outcomes. This failure is unacceptable. During the next president\'s first term, the country will spend more than $700 billion a year on Medicaid, and Americans must demand results for their fellow citizens. As a condition of funding under this proposal, states would have the resources and tools to focus on population health outcomes. Rather than all of Medicaid\'s bureaucratic rules and regulations, states could use the capped allotments to implement solutions such as:Premium assistance for low-income individuals around the new federal tax credit for low-income individualsIndividualized, community-based and innovative benefit designs (e.g., value-based insurance designs tailored for high-risk individuals, expanded primary care, consumer-driven benefit designs and incentives for healthy behavior)Coordinated care for individuals with behavioral health conditions and the disabledTailored care delivery to reflect the diversity of state populationsPersonalized care management solutions for high-risk, high-need individuals, by leveraging proven data analytics and information toolsWork requirements for able-bodied individualsOutcomes transparency and value-based payment designsBlended funding from various programs to better coordinate care (e.g., child welfare and dually-eligible populations)This policy would not regulate the approaches states decide to take, but it would hold states accountable for outcomes since they are receiving federal funding. This reflects requests from a majority of the nation\'s governors as they seek to provide affordable, high-quality care for their most vulnerable citizens. States would receive a single allotment, based on the number and risk profiles of vulnerable and low-income individuals in their populations, and this would grow at the rate of inflation.Additional policiesApply the Hyde Amendment, an important policy to protect innocent human life that has been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike for nearly four decades, to funding and tax credits provided under this proposal.Implement conscience protections, so health care providers can practice medicine in ways that do not violate their moral or religious convictions.Readopt the ""Reagan rule"" to prevent Title X taxpayer dollars from going to entities that provide or refer for abortions.Enable states to stop Medicaid funding of organizations that provide or refer for abortions by clarifying that states have this discretion over how they operate their Medicaid programs.Strengthen and secure MedicareGovernor Bush will release a separate plan to strengthen and secure Medicare.ConclusionObamaCare promised to fix a broken health care system; but instead, it doubled down on the status quo and left millions of Americans, particularly middle-income families, worse off. This proposal takes the opposite approach. It repeals Washington\'s power grab, empowers individuals with choice and security and allows the states to design their own solutions. Instead of assuming the government can solve every problem, it establishes a fair, vibrant and transparent market for entrepreneurs to design innovative solutions to lower costs and improve access to care. This proposal will move us from a system stuck in 1965 to one that empowers individuals and embraces the future.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 13, 2015","b'Press Release - Jeb Bush: Incentives, Not Mandates, Will Bring Down Health Care Costs'","b'Today, I\'m rolling out an aggressive plan to repeal Obamacare once and for all and replace it with conservative reforms that lower health care costs.One of the biggest flaws of Obamacare  something that was easily predicted by those who read the bill before it became law  is that it resulted in skyrocketing health care premiums across the country. In New Hampshire, carriers are asking for exchange plan premium increases between 19 and 51 percent and in the coming days, Granite Staters will find out what the final premium increase will be for their families.Just as we predicted the staggering increases, we can also predict the response from the Washington crowd. Some will blame the insurance companies. Some will call for more Washington spending and regulations  the very ""solutions"" that have caused this problem. Some may rightly blame Obamacare, but fail to offer their own alternatives.None of these responses will solve the fundamental problem: Central planners have been impeding value and access in America\'s health care system for decades.Obamacare is the latest example of how Washington makes health care and health coverage so extraordinarily expensive. Obamacare\'s mandates and taxes force Americans to buy expensive products with benefits they don\'t want and may never need. It also places a disproportionate share of the premium costs on the young and healthy. In addition to higher individual premiums, it costs small businesses more to comply with Obamacare\'s myriad new rules than it does to insure a worker.As a result of Obamacare, providers are not being held directly accountable to patients for the value of the care they deliver, and little information is available to consumers on prices and quality. Furthermore, insurance companies and the government control costs and how care is delivered, leaving little opportunity for doctors, hospitals and entrepreneurs to design innovative solutions to improve value.I am proposing solutions that center health care around individuals, and enable innovation to make care more accessible, convenient, personal and affordable. Here is how I will address high health care costs:Provide support for the purchase of affordable, portable health plans that protect Americans from high-cost medical events.Help Americans with out-of-pocket costs by enabling individuals to save $6,550 a year in a Health Savings Account (HSA) and making associated health plans work for individuals with chronic conditions.Insist on costs and outcomes transparency so patients have the information they need to make value-conscious decisions about their care.Encourage states to guarantee access for those with pre-existing conditions and to make affordable health plans available in their states.Give individuals a $12,000 tax break on the health benefits they receive through their employer  a reform that will encourage lower insurance premiums and higher wages.Allow employers to use financial incentives to promote wellness and care for chronic medical conditions.Enable small businesses to make tax-free contributions for their workers\' individual, portable health plans.Promote innovation by enabling health information technology, modernizing the Food and Drug Administration, investing in the National Institutes of Health, and facilitating big data solutions in health care.Give states the accountability and freedom they need to improve care and outcomes for the most vulnerable in our society.If we\'re going to fix health care in this country, we need to wrest control away from Washington and give it back to the states, citizens and their care providers. Entrepreneurs should be liberated to innovate in ways that lower costs and improve access to care  just like American ingenuity does in other sectors of the economy.Originally posted on the New Hampshire Union Leader'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 15, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb's Commitment to Transparency""","b""Jeb has always demonstrated a strong commitment to transparency.In January, Governor Bush released 280,000 emails from his time as governor, and he's set to release an ebook capturing his tenure. Just two weeks into his candidacy, Governor Bush released 33 years of tax returns, more than any other presidential candidate in history.Now, he's going above and beyond the existing campaign finance disclosure requirements, which only require disclosure of federally registered lobbyists who have raised a minimum of $17,600 during a covered period. Using this requirement as a benchmark for transparency, Governor Bush has chosen to release the following list of volunteer fundraisers who have raised a minimum $17,600 for the Jeb 2016 primary election. Unlike other candidates, Jeb will continue to run a campaign in the spirit of transparency, and we are incredibly grateful for the dedication and support from the individuals mentioned below.Bill AchtmeyerBostonMAAndy AdamsMurfreesboroTNIra AkselradNew YorkNYCarlos AlfonsoTampaFLEric AndersonSeattleWAScott AndersonSalt Lake CityUTTony AntoneBloomfield HillsMIJorge ArrizurietaCoral GablesFLStephen BabsonSeattleWAJose BalderasMissionTXLee BarfieldNashvilleTNHector BarretoSan Juan CapistranoCARodney BarretoCoral GablesFLLarry BathgateLakewoodNJFrank BaxterLos AngelesCASlater BaylissTallahasseeFLDick BeardTampaFLBill BeckerVero BeachFLElias Behar-YbarraSan JuanPRDavid BeightolChevy ChaseMDRudy BeserraBrookhavenGARandy BestDallasTXHarold BeznosFarmington HillsMIBoysie BollingerHoumaLANick BonfiglioMiamiFLRobert BonnerPasadenaCARandy BoydKnoxvilleTNRob BoyerLenexaKSMalachi BoyulsDallasTXDan BranchDallasTXDon BrandtPhoenixAZKimmy and Steve BrauerSt. LouisMONancy BrinkerPalm BeachFLFritz BroganWashingtonDCReg BrownAlexandriaVAMatt BrownNew YorkNYDavid BrownWindermereFLG.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 15, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb's Doctor Signs Off""","b""Alberto A. Mitrani, M.D.Internal MedicineHealth Status Summary John Ellis (Jeb) Bush Date of Birth: 02.11.1953This health statement is provided at the request of John E. Bush and it summarizes his medical history. I have served as Mr. Bush's personal physician since 2007. I am an Internist practicing in South Florida as a faculty physician at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine from 1987 to 2001 and in a private practice from 2001 to the present. I maintain an affiliation with the University of Miami as a Voluntary Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine.Mr. Bush was last evaluated in September 2015. His general appearance was that of a healthy normal male. Current daily medications include atorvastatin 20 mg and vitamin D3 2000 i.u. At the time of his visit, his blood pressure was 116/75, and his pulse was 64/min and regular. Other vital signs were normal and his BMI was 25.8. The physical examination was normal. Laboratory testing demonstrated a total cholesterol of 146 mg/dl; LDL of 64 mg/dl; HDL of 89 mg/dl; and triglycerides of 33 mg/dl.Previous mild elevations of his blood pressure and his blood glucose have normalized with intensification of exercise, careful eating habits and loss of weight. He has been exercising regularly and he has maintained generally healthful eating habits for many years. Prior medical history includes vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps, sinusitis, and low back pain. Surgical history includes an appendectomy, a tonsillectomy, and arthroscopic knee surgery. Due to his family history, exercise stress echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography were recommended. The exercise time on the treadmill was greater than 12 minutes as Mr. Bush achieved 13.7 METS, indicating a capacity to complete high intensity physical activity. The carotid ultrasound revealed minor thickening of the carotid wall with normal blood flow. With the family history in mind, Mr. Bush began taking atorvastatin in 2013.With respect to preventive health maintenance, prostate, dermatological, and eye examinations have been unremarkable. Colonoscopy will continue to be indicated periodically due to the presence of previous colon polyps.As detailed above, Mr. Bush is a healthy and vigorous 62-year-old man. He is proactive from a cardiovascular perspective and actively engaged in his health care. He is compliant with medical recommendations and maintains favorable lifestyle habits. He is in excellent physical and mental condition and able to serve in any stressful and demanding executive setting including the Office of the President of the United States.Alberto A.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 19, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb: As President, I'll End Crony Capitalism""","b""Barack Obama has failed miserably to bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The country is more polarized than ever before and working families across the nation have lost faith that their elected officials in Washington have any understanding of the challenges they face in their lives.It is not hard to pinpoint the source of the American people's anger. During the Obama presidency, taxes have been increased by nearly $2 trillion over a 10-year period, while the national debt has risen by $8 trillion. The Obama economy has sputtered along at a tepid rate of 2 percent growth, resulting in the lowest workforce participation rate since the Carter presidency and a decline in middle class incomes of $2,000.While the rest of America has struggled, Washington, D.C., has become America's new boomtown, with the highest per capita income in the nation. This explosion of wealth hasn't occurred because of some new private sector innovation or the manufacturing of products that have improved the lives of the American people. It is has been driven by the growth of government and debt, which is coming at the expense of taxpayers who are losing ground in a weak economy.As president of the United States, I will use all the powers of my office to disrupt the political culture of a dysfunctional Washington, D.C. We need to clean house and it must start by eliminating the crony capitalism that is pervasive throughout the federal government. There are tens of billions of dollars of corporate welfare subsidies tucked into the federal budget. An honest effort to cut the deficit should start here.During the debate on the last farm bill, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa declared his opposition by pointing to the fact that 70 percent of the subsidies in the bill would go to the largest farmers. We can take care of small family farms and provide sufficient protection to American agriculture without handing out billions in subsidies to the biggest agribusiness companies. We also need to stop picking winners and losers in the energy industry. My tax reform plan would phase out all the tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, as well as those for wind, solar and renewables.With a level playing field and regulatory certainty from Washington, we can leverage our newly realized status as an energy superpower to create jobs and reduce the cost of gasoline and utility bills for the American people.Ending crony capitalism also requires a complete rewriting of the tax code and a seismic change in the way we regulate the American economy. I would eliminate corporate tax breaks, loopholes and carve outs so we can lower the top business tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Right now, American companies pay the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. By simplifying the tax code and lowering rates, we will give our economy and American workers a significant lift.But we cannot stop here.We also need to restore common sense to federal regulations. During the Obama presidency, there have been more than 2,500 new regulations imposed on the economy with a staggering price tag of $670 billion. This is one of the reasons we have more businesses dying in America today than starting up. I would bring sweeping regulatory reform to the federal government, adopting policies to stop the biggest corporations from rigging the rules to their favor and establishing a regulatory budget to ensure that every new dollar of regulatory cost is offset by eliminating a dollar of cost from old regulations.Taken together, these efforts will make our economy more competitive, rein in the growth of federal spending and help restore the trust of the American people in our political process, paving the way for much needed reforms to our entitlement programs.None of these reforms will be easy to make. The influence peddling industry in Washington will fight every step of the way to defend their fiefdoms and special favors. It is going to take a president with a stiff spine and a proven record of delivering conservative reforms to disrupt the old, established order.I intend to be that president.Originally Posted on the Washington Examiner"""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 20, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: A Clear Choice on National Security',"b""In the latest episode of the reality show that is Donald Trump's campaign, he has blamed my brother for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on our nation.That Trump echoes the attacks of Michael Moore and the fringe Left against my brother is yet another example of his dangerous views on national-security issues.This is a man who has previously stated he would prefer Hillary Clinton had led negotiations on the nuclear agreement with Iran. He has expressed a willingness to allow Vladimir Putin to dominate the Middle East by aligning with Iran and propping up the ruthless Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad  an action that would only worsen the existing refugee crisis and endanger our national-security interests and those of Israel. And he has been ignorant and dismissive of the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations, saying that we shouldn't have gone into Afghanistan to hunt al-Qaeda and end the safe haven for terror provided by the Taliban, only to retreat from that stance this week.Let's be clear: Donald Trump simply doesn't know what he's talking about. And his bluster overcompensates for a shocking lack of knowledge on the complex national-security challenges that will confront the next president of the United States.We are in serious times, and we need a President who will have the resolve to take on the terrorists and restore America's position in the world. Unlike Trump, I have offered strategies to confront Iran and combat the growing terrorist threat to our country.One of the greatest honors I have received in this campaign is to be endorsed by twelve Medal of Honor recipients. These heroes are some of the most highly decorated veterans in America. They support me because they know I have the leadership skills and executive experience to rebuild our military and keep our nation safe from rising threats such as those presented by Iran, Putin, and ISIS.If I earn the honor of serving as Commander-in-Chief, I will reverse Barack Obama's devastating defense cuts. I will strengthen the NATO alliance and use America's newly realized status as an energy superpower to lessen others' dependence on Russian oil and gas, and the advantage it gives Putin. I will repair our alliance with Israel and regain the trust of our other partners in the Middle East in order to halt Iran's aggression. And I will have a strategy to defeat ISIS and Assad and protect American interests in the region.I am ready to be Commander-in-Chief and lead America during a time of increasing turmoil around the world. Donald Trump has failed to demonstrate the temperament and understanding of our nation's challenges needed to live up to that responsibility.Originally Posted on the National Review"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 21, 2015",b'Press Release - Western Land and Resource Management',"b'The American West is a land of wonder and opportunity. The West is a destination for those seeking the serenity of the outdoors as well as home to many families that work the land, whether ranching, mining minerals or developing renewable or fossil energy. As in so many other parts of our economy, the federal government\'s role in managing these resources is overreaching, priorities are misplaced, and it is harming people in the region.People in the West feel the impact of federal decision-making more acutely than those in the rest of the nation. Of the 635 million acres owned and managed by the federal government, 582 million acres  90 percent  are in the West, including Alaska. In the 11 most Western states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the federal government controls nearly half the land (see map below). For instance, over 80 percent of Nevada is federally-owned. By contrast, the federal government owns 4 percent of all the remaining 37 states further east.Increasingly, the federal government does not treat Western states, local governments, tribes and land owners as equal partners. Under the Obama Administration, federal land management is characterized by restrictive regulations, more land use constraints, more land acquisition, more ""analysis paralysis,"" and more ""sue and settle""-driven policies.This relentless overregulation has undermined the trust between Western communities and the federal government. It must be restored. Washington, DC needs to acknowledge that people who live on the land in the West are the best stewards of the land. Federal holdings should be valuable recreational and economic assets, not a liability to economic freedom and growth.I will fix the relationship between the federal government and the West. I propose four principles, backed up by specific policies, to rebuild trust.Full and Equal PartnershipWestern communities need an equal partner in the federal government. Washington, DC\'s decisions from afar are too often based on the baseline assumption that states and tribes care less about the environment than federal officials. That is false. Decisions relating to lands, rivers and lakes, and wildlife affect local people\'s livelihoods, the places their families camp or hunt and the water they drink. No one has a more vested interest in stewardship of our natural heritage than those that coexist with it.For instance, as governor, I secured a full and equal partnership with the federal government in restoring the Everglades. It is the world\'s largest intergovernmental watershed restoration effort and the most ambitious ecosystem restoration effort in history. I brought stakeholders, businesses and conservationists together with state and federal agencies, forging a fair and equal coalition to ensure the Everglades would be conserved for generations to come.In order to fix this relationship I will:Support moving the Department of the Interior headquarters from Washington, DC to a location closer to the lands it manages and the people it most affects, such as Denver, Salt Lake City or Reno. Historically, presidents export a Secretary of the Interior from the West to Washington, DC. It is time to import the Department from Washington, DC to the West;Direct agencies, consistent with law, to give deference to states to determine what land uses are sustainable and most compatible for citizens who live in a particular area;Practice dynamic and partnership-based decision-making starting with convening a meeting of Westerners (e.g., Western Governors, tribal leaders and other elected officials) to agree on a better framework for cooperative decision-making including, for instance, having a more inclusive process for establishing National Monuments which can lock up land from multiple uses; andAdopt ""states-first"" wildlife conservation policies that provide more deference to state plans for protecting and restoring species\' populations such as the greater sage grouse.Take Better Care of What We HaveThe federal government owns about half of the west, yet it continues to acquire more land. In some cases these acquisitions make sense, such as inholdings or to promote recreational access, but in other cases they erode local tax bases and constrain growth.Washington, DC needs to acquire less and take better care of what it already owns. Too much of the government\'s property is a mess and our lands are sick. For instance, the National Park Service turns 100 years old in 2016, but we have a maintenance backlog in our national parks of $11.5 billion. These are our national treasures, but over a third of our national parks\' trails are in poor condition, over two dozen bridges are ""structurally deficient"" and 90 percent of the national parks paved roads are in ""fair"" or ""poor"" condition.Washington, DC needs to acquire less and take better care of what it already owns.Worse, a lack of active management of our forests and rangeland has led to deadly wildfires that are growing in number, size and intensity. More than nine million acres of forests and rangeland were affected by wildfires this year, an area the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined. Forests and rangeland are thick with fuel. This risk can be reduced by conducting prescribed burns, more actively managing invasive plants, removing dead wood and harvesting timber.In order to rebalance our priorities, as president I will:Back the temporary modification of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to better consolidate and maintain federal assets by:Providing our crown jewels  the national parks  with a 100th anniversary gift by supporting the redirection of a portion of acquisition funds to reduce the backlog of maintenance projects in our national parks;Targeting federal acquisition funds at inholdings and enhancement of existing lands and outdoor recreation opportunities; andSupporting the permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to provide greater certainty of funding for states; andConvene the nation\'s top experts on forest health to develop a new national wildfire policy and direct my cabinet to expedite the review of activities that would decrease wildfire risk.Shared Use of ResourcesThe Obama Administration has increasingly attempted to grab state authority and constrain the acceptable uses of federal lands. This needs to be reversed. We can conserve our natural resources and create economic growth while avoiding the pitfalls of federal bureaucracy.When it comes to the West, the federal government needs to demonstrate extra sensitivity to the decisions that can block economic opportunity for people whose livelihood is tied to the land. Onerous and overreaching rule-making, ""paralysis by analysis"" and ""sue and settle"" are all methods use to strangle multiple use projects, such as water infrastructure, grazing, timber, mining, renewable and fossil energy development and outdoor recreation. The overreaching Waters of the United States rule, for instance, has created great uncertainty among those families that rely on the land for their livelihood. The rule, for example, places up to 99 percent of Montana\'s land under the Environmental Protection Agency\'s jurisdiction.When it comes to the West, the federal government needs to demonstrate extra sensitivity to the decisions that can block economic opportunity for people whose livelihood is tied to the land.Even when Washington, DC does have clear authority to regulate, it is overbearing. Minerals and metals mined from Western lands are necessary for making computers, cell phones and structural steel. But an overly burdensome federal permitting process means a new mine takes seven to ten years before development can begin. That alone moves responsible mining operations to other parts of the world. Federal bureaucracy should not be denying Westerners jobs.To help reinvigorate the West I will:Reaffirm western water rights by protecting against federal encroachment of surface and groundwater resources and stopping the Waters of the United States rule in its tracks;Expedite funding, studies and permitting for water infrastructure, especially water storage projects, as one way to address historic drought conditions; andSupport a ""two is enough"" permitting policy whereby projects on federal lands requiring federal approval must be permitted or rejected within two years unless there are unusual circumstances. (This expands the scope of a previously announced regulatory reform proposal.)Sportsmen and Outdoor Recreation AccessAmericans should be encouraged, not discouraged, to fish, hike, hunt, camp and recreate on Federal lands. Yet, millions of acres of public land in the West are inaccessible to the public due to historic checkerboard land ownership patterns and inadequate points of entry. Importantly, lack of access to lands is a primary reason that hunters stop participating in this traditional sport.I understand this. As the governor of Florida, I instituted a ""no net loss"" of sportsmen\'s access. I also signed a law ensuring Florida citizens had the right to carry firearms for lawful purposes while in national forests and state parks.To continue to encourage families to seek out and enjoy outdoor activities, as president I will:Establish a national goal of ""no net loss"" of sportsmen\'s access, as I did in Florida; andSupport a set-aside in the Land and Water Conservation Fund for funding easements, acquisitions or other projects that provide access for hunting, angling and other recreational activities on landlocked federal lands.A New Relationship with the WestConservation implies that people can actually access and responsibly use our land and water, but this administration has consistently made more resources off-limits to human beings. They are not listening to Western communities and the individuals who know Western lands best. As president, I will fix that relationship and propose policies that will show greater respect for local values and needs. I will increase, rather than suppress, opportunity for Western families.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"October 27, 2015","b""Press Release - Jeb's Backgrounder on Medicare and Social Security""","b'As a great, prosperous and compassionate nation, we must ensure access to health care and retirement income security for our seniors.Seniors rely on Medicare to provide access to critical health care and for financial security following their working years. Since 1935, Social Security has played an important role in ensuring workers have a base of retirement income, reducing poverty among seniors in retirement and protecting Americans against the risks of disability and premature death. Workers contribute to the programs during their working years and see a return on those contributions during their retirement years.Unfortunately, too many Washington politicians have been unwilling to engage in an honest conversation with voters about maintaining a social contract with seniors and the next generation. In 1965, health care programs and Social Security spending were less than a sixth of Washington\'s budget, but today they consume almost half of all federal spending and crowd out other national priorities. Without action, the problem will only get worse: spending will more than double as a share of our economy by 2040, growing from $1.8 trillion to $4.5 trillion. Unless we make changes to preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security, the trust funds will be exhausted and benefits will be cut. In Medicare, hospital benefits will be cut by nearly 15 percent in 2030. In Social Security, benefits will be cut by more than 20 percent in 2034.Improving security for current seniors and prosperity for the next generation will require experienced leadership.Strengthen and Secure MedicareToo many politicians in Washington have not been honest about the unsustainability of the Medicare program. Governor Bush believes that everyone deserves the truth and that seniors deserve better quality care. He also believes that care providers should not be saddled with heavy-handed regulations. Governor Bush will approach these challenges with the following strategy:Be honest about the problemImplement bipartisan Medicare premium supportStabilize Medicare\'s financesBe honest about the problem: Medicare\'s current path is unsustainable There is bipartisan concern about Medicare\'s fiscal sustainability. Serious and thoughtful Democrats and Republicans have had the courage to acknowledge that Medicare needs to be strengthened, if it is to be preserved long-term. Here are the fiscal facts about Medicare:Medicare spending is crowding out other national priorities. On the current path, the country will spend more on Medicare than it will on national defense by 2019.While workers do contribute to Medicare through payroll taxes, much of Medicare\'s budget comes from general revenues or adds to the national debt. $260 billion of the program\'s more than $600 billion annual budget has no dedicated funding source, so it adds to the national deficit and debt each year.Longer-term, it gets worse. Over the next decade, spending will go from more than $600 billion to $1.2 trillion. Over the next 75 years, the program will exceed dedicated financing sources by $28 trillion. To put this in perspective, the nation has accumulated $18 trillion in debt over its entire history.Without leadership and action, the benefits of current enrollees are in jeopardy. Without action to secure the program, seniors\' hospital benefits could be cut across the board by nearly 15 percent in 2030. Benefits could be in jeopardy as soon as 2022, if health care spending rises more quickly than expected.Implement bipartisan Medicare premium support Medicare needs to be strengthened to make it work better for current seniors and preserve it for the next generation. Rather than doubling down on bureaucratic boondoggles or increasing taxes, Governor Bush will enable a more innovative Medicare to achieve better outcomes with more efficient spending.Governor Bush will give seniors access to care that is:Portable  Their health care records should travel with them so providers can provide appropriate care without duplicating tests or prescription drugs.Modern  Remote monitoring technology could be used to detect and prevent complications from chronic conditions like congestive heart failure or diabetes.Value-based  If seniors choose to receive their care in less expensive settings that demonstrate equal or higher quality, seniors should be able to benefit from that choice.Convenient  If seniors are traveling or cannot physically get to their physician, they should have access to their primary physician via inexpensive video applications on their smart phones or other remote communication tools.Governor Bush will achieve these goals through premium support, a bipartisan idea supported by leaders such as Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), former Budget Director Alice Rivlin, former Senator John Breaux (D-LA), former Senator Bill Frist (R-TN), former Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) and former Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH).Under current law, seniors in Medicare can choose the traditional option (called fee-for-service) or private health plan options (called Medicare Advantage).However, politicians, bureaucrats and lobbyists  not doctors, patients and innovators  decide how much government pays for those benefits. Under this proposal, private health care plans, like Humana and Kaiser, other innovators and traditional Medicare will compete on the best price to offer Medicare benefits to seniors. Seniors\' premium support level will be based on the average of those prices. If a senior chooses a plan cheaper than the average price, they will realize the savings. If a senior chooses a more expensive plan, they will pay the difference in the form of a higher premium. Competition will make spending more efficient, and seniors could pay less and have more options.As part of this structure, participants could offer innovative benefit designs. Instead of delivering benefits almost exactly like traditional Medicare does, private plans could offer ""actuarially equivalent"" benefits. The value of the benefits will be the same, but participants could design a plan that better meets patient needs. For example, a private health plan may offer a plan that covers fewer days in the hospital each year but reduces the need for hospitalization because the senior can talk to their doctor with a free video communication tool whenever they have a medical question. A different private health plan may offer a high-deductible plan that covers fewer physician visits but gives seniors money to pay for a physician visit through a fully-funded Health Savings Account (HSA) (Payments to participants will continue to be adjusted based on the health risks of patients in order to minimize insurers covering only healthy individuals).In addition, this proposal will create opportunities for innovation in care delivery for seniors. Competition need not be limited to insurers and traditional Medicare in a premium support model. The level of consolidation in the health care industry is at an all-time high, and the need for additional, innovative options for seniors has never been greater. Governor Bush will encourage new entrants to compete for seniors\' business.This proposal will lower premiums for enrollees by approximately six percent, on average, relative to current law projections. According to non-partisan estimates, this proposal could achieve hundreds of billions of dollars in savings over the next two decades. The experience with Medicare Part D  which is now 40 percent under its original budget  demonstrates that this competitive structure can achieve even greater cost savings and high quality care over the long term.Stabilize Medicare\'s finances with common-sense reformsIncrease means-testing for Medicare premiums: Today, wealthier seniors receive lower premium subsidies from the federal government. This proposal will further reduce the level of government subsidies for wealthier seniors, as consistent with bipartisan proposals. For example, a senior making $160,000 will receive only a 35 percent subsidy from the government under this proposal (compared with 50 percent under current law).Current law thresholds: Proposed thresholds:Income (single)SubsidyIncome (single)Subsidy<$85,00075%<$85,00075%$85,001-107,00065%$85,000-107,00060%$107,001-160,00050%$107,000-133,50047.5%$133,500-160,00035%$160,001-214,00035%$160,001-196,00022.5%>$196,00010%>$214,00020%Improve Medicare management practices: Ten percent of Medicare\'s annual budget is now subject to waste, fraud and abuse. The Government Accountability Office has made common-sense recommendations to reduce the level of improper payments, which Governor Bush will review and implement as appropriate. For example, Governor Bush will increase transparency about providers who have been fined or suspended from a federal health care program so they do not take advantage of other programs.Ensure fee-for-service providers are appropriately reimbursed: Payments should balance access to services with efficiency from providers. Updates should be implemented with a particular focus on reimbursement innovation, instead of simply blunt cuts.Provide financial security through HSAs: Seniors may be responsible for co-pays, deductibles and premiums, which can be difficult to meet on a fixed income. Currently, seniors who enroll in Medicare cannot save money in tax-free HSAs. Governor Bush will allow seniors to keep their HSAs to help save for out-of-pocket health care spending. In addition, a senior\'s health plan or provider could contribute money to an HSA. (This proposal will build on HSA reforms Governor Bush proposed in his Conservative Plan for 21st Century Health.)Redirect ObamaCare\'s Medicare cuts to Medicare solvency: ObamaCare raided Medicare by more than $800 billion to create a new entitlement. Instead, Governor Bush will ensure that Medicare savings in current law go toward improving Medicare solvency and securing it for the next generation.These reforms will secure and strengthen Medicare, enabling us to move closer to the goal of improving Medicare for seniors and guaranteeing the next generation a more prosperous future.Strengthen American Retirement Income SecurityWashington\'s over-promising has resulted in an impending Social Security crisis. Ten years ago the Social Security program ran annual budget surpluses, and today it is running major deficits. Because Congress never acted to secure the program, the problems are now more difficult to solve. Strengthening retirement income security will require a three-part strategy:Encourage private savingEncourage workStabilize Social Security\'s financesEncourage private saving to reduce government dependencyThe majority of American workers have access to a private retirement plan. Seventy-four percent of full-time workers have access to some type of retirement plan through their employers. Among workers at medium and large companies, the rate is 84 percent. Americans have accrued over $25 trillion in personal and employer-sponsored retirement plans and another $26 trillion in Social Security benefits (which the government does not have a plan to pay for).  Current American retirees have among the highest incomes across westernized countries, both in dollar terms and relative to the incomes of working-age residents.Workers with access to plans are saving nearly 10 percent of their salaries each year. Workers contribute five to seven percent of their salaries to retirement accounts. Adding employer contributions, total savings are 10 percent. These savings will be an important part of complementing Social Security income during retirement.While access to retirement accounts is at an all-time high, more can be done to make these savings vehicles a reality for small-business and part-time employees. Only 51 percent of small-business employees have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, and the majority of low-wage workers lack access to an employer-sponsored savings plan.To build on progress toward private saving and offer more options to employers and individuals, Governor Bush will:Increase access by reducing complexity: Fiduciary liabilities, annual reporting, audit requirements, compliance rules and other onerous regulations simply make retirement plans too complex for many small businesses to offer. Reducing unnecessary burdens could make it easier for employers, especially small businesses, to offer retirement plans. This will go a long way toward helping the 49 percent of small business employees who do not have access to employer retirement plans.Increase retirement plan options for workers: Workers in most large- and medium-sized businesses have access to 401(k) retirement savings plans, but many small businesses cannot afford to pay toward retirement plans for their workers. Governor Bush will help small-business employees by allowing them to automatically save part of their salary in a ""starter 401(k)"" plan, even if their employer cannot afford to contribute a matching amount.Make it possible for small businesses to pool together: Multiple small businesses should be able to access a single retirement savings plan for all their employees, which will save administrative costs and complexity.Make it easier for employees to enroll in their own retirement savings plans: Governor Bush will encourage employers to automatically enroll their employees in a retirement savings plan. This makes it easier for workers to save their own money for retirement because their employer handles the sign-up process and automatically helps them save part of their paychecks.Make it easier for employees to save more money from each paycheck: Employers can help their employees save more by automatically diverting up to 10 percent of their employees\' paychecks into private savings accounts. Governor Bush will eliminate the 10 percent arbitrary limit on this savings tool.Make it easier for individuals to save: Earlier this year, the Obama Administration rewrote the rules for who is qualified to give investment advice for retirement plans. These sweeping proposed regulations will limit consumer choice of financial advisors, hurt low-income Americans and drive up the costs of private saving. Governor Bush will not let that happen. Instead, Governor Bush will review and streamline existing regulations that add unnecessary costs and make it difficult for individuals to save.Recognize that Americans are living longer, healthier lives and make it easier for those who choose to work longerLife expectancy has increased substantially since Social Security was created in 1935. Yet Social Security\'s structure still discourages work past early retirement ages. Individuals, who delay retirement under current law, must continue to pay payroll taxes, but the additional benefits they earn are rarely enough to compensate for more than a fraction of these additional taxes. Reforms should update Social Security to respect seniors\' desires and abilities to continue to work later in their lives. Governor Bush will encourage work through the following reforms:Adjust benefits for seniors who choose to retire early or work past the retirement age: Under current law, seniors who choose to retire before the normal retirement age (66) get smaller Social Security checks, while seniors that choose to work longer get bigger checks when they retire. Half of workers retire as soon as possible and most workers retire before reaching the full retirement age. Governor Bush will give even smaller checks to those who choose to retire early and even bigger checks to seniors who choose to wait to claim Social Security benefits.Eliminate the retirement earnings test: Under current law, the government reduces the amount of Social Security benefits for seniors who choose to continue working and make more than $15,720 a year. Governor Bush will eliminate that provision, so seniors can enjoy a full private-sector paycheck and their full Social Security benefit check.Eliminate the payroll tax for seniors at age 67: This will eliminate a 6.2 percent tax on work for seniors who choose to work in retirement (This proposal was included in Governor Bush\'s plan to grow and strengthen the economy).Increase the Social Security retirement age: Workers are now eligible for full Social Security benefits at age 66 (gradually increasing under current law to age 67). Workers can choose to retire as early as age 62, if they agree to a lower Social Security check each month. This proposal will very gradually change these eligibility ages by a month every year starting in 2022. In the year 2058, when life expectancy will likely be even longer than it is today, workers will become eligible for Social Security at age 70 (or age 65, if they agree to a lower Social Security check each month). By continuing to allow early retirement as early as age 65, Americans will still be able to withdraw benefits as early as they could in President Roosevelt\'s time. Additionally, disability benefits will continue to be available for individuals with health conditions that prevent them from working.Stabilize Social Security\'s finances by implementing bipartisan proposalsWithout action to stabilize Social Security, current law will result in benefits being cut by more than 20 percent when the program\'s trust fund runs out. These drastic cuts will hit people both rich and poor  and at any age during retirement. Bipartisan problem-solvers know what needs to be done and, with strong leadership, Americans can avoid sudden benefit reductions and have a smoother and more sustainable rate of growth going forward. Modest changes now can prevent even more painful cuts down the road.Based on bipartisan proposals in the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Simpson-Bowles), Governor Bush will ensure that Social Security remains stable over the next 75 years. Over the long-term, the money coming into Social Security will match the benefits paid. This was a goal supported by President Roosevelt at the program\'s creation.Provide a minimum retirement benefit for low-income workers: Social Security was intended to reduce the rate of poverty among the elderly, but it does a poor job of protecting the most vulnerable. While there is a ""special minimum benefit"" for retirees today, the value is approximately 80 percent of the poverty level and only an estimated 75,000 qualify. Seniors who have worked for 30 years will be guaranteed a minimum benefit that is approximately $15,000 a year (125 percent of the federal poverty level for an individual). This will guarantee that seniors do not live in poverty.Slow the growth of costs over time by adjusting benefits for wealthier seniors: Under current law, the government determines the amount of a worker\'s Social Security check through a complicated formula based on a worker\'s average earnings. This proposal will change that formula so that wealthier workers, who can afford to save more for retirement on their own during their careers, get smaller checks from Social Security during retirement. This change will be phased in gradually over decades to give workers time to plan.Change how Social Security checks are updated each year: Each year, the government updates the amount of the Social Security checks they send to each senior. The annual adjustment is based on growth in the overall American economy, but the government currently uses inaccurate data to calculate the change. This proposal will use a more accurate measure of inflation called the chained consumer price index (Governor Bush will implement this more accurate measure of inflation across federal programs, with the exception of military and veterans spending).'"

Governor Bush will eliminate that provision, so seniors can enjoy a full private-sector paycheck and their full Social Security benefit check.Eliminate the payroll tax for seniors at age 67: This will eliminate a 6.2 percent tax on work for seniors who choose to work well past the retirement age.Increase the Social Security retirement age: Workers are now eligible for full Social Security benefits at age 66 (gradually increasing under current law to 67). Workers can choose to retire as early as age 62, if they agree to a lower Social Security check each month. This proposal, similar to one in the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Simpson-Bowles), will very gradually change these eligibility ages by a month every year starting in 2022.Stabilize Social Security\'s finances by implementing bipartisan proposals. No current retirees or seniors approaching retirement will see a cut in benefits under this proposal.Three reforms, which have all received bipartisan support, would slow the growth of Social Security costs:Provide a minimum retirement benefit for low-income workers: Seniors who have worked for 30 years will be guaranteed a minimum benefit that is approximately $15,000 a year (125 percent of the federal poverty level for an individual). This will guarantee that seniors do not live in poverty.Slow the growth of costs over time by adjusting benefits for wealthier seniors: Under current law, the government determines the amount of a worker\'s Social Security check through a complicated formula based on the worker\'s average earnings. This proposal will change that formula so that wealthier workers, who can afford to save for retirement on their own during their careers, get smaller checks from Social Security during retirement.Change how Social Security checks are updated each year: Each year, the government updates the amounts of the Social Security checks they send to each senior. The annual update is based on growth in the overall American economy, but the government currently uses inaccurate data to calculate the changes. This proposal will use a more accurate measure of inflation called the chained consumer price index.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 11, 2015",b'Press Release - Happy Veterans Day',"b""My father is a true American hero. Not that he would ever think that, much less say it. And now he's likely annoyed at me for saying it out loud.But on the day we honor all veterans for their service to our country, it's long past time for me to talk about George H.W. Bush and how incredibly proud I am that he is my Dad.Like most kids, I was largely unaware of anything about my Dad's life that took place before I arrived in it. He was the guy who was great at building things, and reading bedtime stories, putting burgers on the grill, and tossing around a baseball in the backyard. During my teen-age years, he at times was slightly annoying. He set and enforced curfews, had occasional negative opinions about the way I dressed and my lack of haircuts, and more than once rolled his eyes at my strong views on current events.It wasn't until 1980, after I had married and started a family of my own, and my Dad was running for President of the United States, that I found out just who my father really was.I threw myself wholeheartedly into his 1980 campaign and enjoyed telling folks about my Dad. So I did my homework. I actually read his biography, to see if there was anything about him I didn't know.It's hard all these years later to describe, or even imagine, my shock when I learned that when he graduated high school, he volunteered to join the Navy (against his father's wishes, I should add); that when he earned his pilot's wings, he was briefly the youngest pilot in the Navy; and that at age 20, he was shot down over Chi Chi Jima. And that while he survived, his two crew members did not, never to be found.My dad was shot down? He was almost captured by the Japanese? He was almost imprisoned on an island where the Japanese commander became famous for eating the livers and hearts of captured American pilots? He was plucked out of the water by an American submarine that just happened to be nearby? And he was 20 years old?When I asked him about it, he joked that it was true, he almost became an hors d'oeuvre.For all of you who have parents, or grandparents, who are a member of the Greatest Generation, my guess is you have a similar story. They went to war; they fought for their country, and then they came home and got married, raised their families, and made a life. And they never ever talked about their service to country.Yet, without them, our world very well might have been lost to tyrants and dictators. That, too, is a world that is hard to fathom.Some of our country's darkest days were during World War II, but the challenges confronting us today in many ways are just as concerning. We are facing an enemy whose main weapon is terror, and who have no respect whatsoever for life, and want nothing more than for most of us to disappear from the face of the earth.Like the Greatest Generation, many of our young people are volunteering to go to the front lines of this ongoing war to make our country safe. They often do this without fanfare, without credit, and without celebration. One of my toughest jobs as Governor of Florida was to call the families of the men and women in our state whom died in this noble calling. No matter how many times I had to do it, it never became easier.So today I honor all veterans of all ages, of all wars, of all battles, who loved their country enough to join the military. There are no words of gratitude to thank them for what they did. Certainly my pledge to them is that I will forever respect and honor them, starting by making sure all our veterans programs are what they deserve. I am grateful for the trust 12 Medal of Honor recipients have placed in me with their endorsement and support. I will not let them or their military brethren down.Maybe today each one of us can make sure we let at least one veteran know how grateful we are. Maybe by attending a parade, or flying the American flag, making a phone call, or writing a note.I know I will.My dad is an American hero. And I am a grateful and proud son."""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 11, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: How I Would Replace Obamacare',"b'As gridlock persists in our nation\'s capital and good legislation continues to die in the Senate, it is clear the next president will play a key role in determining the future of Obamacare. That means candidates\' positions on the issue will be among the most important when ballots are cast next year.Obamacare\'s ""three-legged stool""  the subsidies, guaranteed-issue rules and individual mandate  is already collapsing under its own weight. The failing Obamacare co-ops mean that more than 500,000 Americans have lost their health plans, while individuals face a new wave of premium increases  about $600 a year on average for a silver-level federal exchange plan. The individual mandate is overreaching and ineffective; Obamacare\'s attempt to stop ""pricing out people with preexisting conditions,"" as a Nov.2 Post editorial put it, has priced out people who don\'t have preexisting conditions; and while the subsidies primarily benefit those below 200percent of the poverty level, the majority of Americans are worse off.If Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins the White House, the only question will be how much she or he can expand Obamacare, growing our debt and raising taxes in the process.I know there is a better path. That is why I recently proposed the most substantive conservative plan to repeal and replace Obamacare presented to date. My Obamacare alternative addresses the root causes of high health-care costs, offers patients more options and strengthens the safety net for the most vulnerable Americans.First, my plan would lower costs. Health care is expensive primarily because Washington has long distorted the meaning of ""insurance."" Health insurers pay the majority of bills and control how most health-care services are delivered.Under my plan, instead of an insurer directly paying all the bills, consumers would be empowered to make choices that are right for them. For instance, an asthma patient could save money by choosing a treatment costing $8,000 instead of one from a different hospital in the same city costing $34,000.Additionally, medical entrepreneurs would be given better opportunities to develop new approaches to delivering care. Instead of getting paid every time a diabetic patient came into the office, what if a specialist could manage all of that patient\'s diabetic care, including the use of remote monitoring technology, for a one-time payment? Such an approach might save money and lead to better outcomes.But this does not mean patients would be on their own to cover costs; rather, they could choose from a range of innovative coverage options. Patients may spend far less on premiums and be able to save more for out-of-pocket costs with a health savings account (HSA), and they may select a high-deductible plan that offers them a defined amount when they need certain services, so that they can select a specialized physician to provide them. And states could supplement the value of plans for the poor by fully funding HSAs.The point is that individuals, instead of insurers, would control more of the health-care dollar, via tools such as HSAs. My approach would also make these HSAs work better for those with chronic conditions by offering plans with lower deductibles for certain services related to a given condition and would establish transparent information on the value of services so consumers have the information they need to make informed choices and demand value.Second, my plan promotes innovation. It can take 12 to 15 years and more than $2billion to develop a new cure for a disease. In a $3.1trillion system, efficiency and effectiveness are desperately needed; yet under the current system, health-care start-ups face costly and complex government overregulation. My plan would overhaul Washington\'s entire approach to innovation, including modernizing the Food and Drug Administration, investing in the National Institutes of Health and promoting big-data solutions in health care. Advances can be led by the creativity of America\'s scientists, care providers and innovators.Finally, my plan would strengthen the safety net. The primary goal of the tax credits for the purchase of insurance included in my plan is to finally achieve tax fairness between the employer and individual health insurance markets. A middle-class family that needs to purchase health coverage should get a tax break similar to what another middle-class family receives through an employer. The tax credit would benefit low-income Americans, and my plan would enable the states to target additional resources to the needy by supplementing the value of the credit.Furthermore, these changes would complement reforms to Medicaid that replace unnecessary rules with an approach that insists on results. The most exciting improvements we have seen to the safety net have come from the states breaking free from Washington\'s rules, and we need to build on those successes. With the right tools and accountability in place, states can achieve far better outcomes for the poor.Unfortunately, Obamacare was built on top of a 1940s- and 1960s-era system. A 21st-century health-care system requires innovation and an overhaul of this antiquated structure. Only then will all Americans realize the lower costs, better options and greater possibilities of the future.Originally Posted on The Washington Post'"

For decades, preserving this global peace and prosperity required a strong, innovative economy, forward-deployed global military presence, robust military alliances, close intelligence partnerships with allied governments, and active diplomacy.The U.S. faces a stark choice: rebuild our military, repair our alliances, and restore our leadership in order to preserve this hard-won peace and prosperity or continue to allow our global influence and leverage to erode in the face of growing dangers.Today, a mere fifteen years into the 21st Century, this American-led international order is at risk. The U.S. faces a stark choice: rebuild our military, repair our alliances, and restore our leadership in order to preserve this hard-won peace and prosperity or continue to allow our global influence and leverage to erode in the face of growing dangers.Consequences of Operating in a ""Strategy Free Environment""The global strategic environment today is more dangerous than at any point since the Cold War. The spread of radical Islamist terror groups, the rise of unfriendly regional competitors, the continuing challenges of nuclear proliferation, the ever growing dangers of cyber threats, and the prospect of continuing state failure in key regions of the world are just some of the perils facing the United States, its allies, and friends at the dawn of this new century. What has magnified these dangers is the absence of a coherent U.S. strategy for confronting them these past seven yearsa weakness further exacerbated by the diminishing U.S. defense budget, the sorry record of neglecting our alliances, and the loss of credibility resulting from levying empty threats.Since President Obama took office in 2009, the terrorist threat has only grown, and al Qaeda, ISIS, and other like-minded terrorist groups continue to plot attacks against America, our allies, and our friends, with the horrific attacks just days ago in Paris as the most recent reminder.Iran  the world\'s most active state sponsor of terrorism  continues its efforts to achieve regional hegemony, support terrorism, destabilize its neighbors, expand its illegal missile programs, threaten Israel, and repress its own population. The reckless nuclear deal with Iran has not thwarted Iran\'s nuclear ambitions; it has only delayed its path to a bomb.The reckless nuclear deal with Iran has not thwarted Iran\'s nuclear ambitions; it has only delayed its path to a bomb.Multiple states within the Greater Middle East have failed or are failing, notably Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya  all embroiled in burgeoning violence with no end in sight. These conflicts threaten regional stability, as well as the security of key American allies and partners such as Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt. This violence and radicalism has also spilled out of the Middle East into Europe, and in such an interconnected world may threaten our homeland.Out of the chaos of Syria and Iraq, ISIS has grown in strength, and in just the past couple years has taken control of vast swaths of territory, destroying state institutions and stoking sectarian violence in countries whose territory they openly occupy.The return of ambitious competitors confronts us with the challenge of dealing with dangerous states in addition to numerous sub-state threats. Putin\'s Russia, emboldened by our weakness, intimidates its neighbors, invaded Ukraine, increased its cyberwarfare activities, represses its own citizens, and is pursuing aggressive intervention in the Middle East.China\'s dramatic economic development has offered Beijing the opportunity to play a constructive role in promoting regional and global stability. It has also fueled a vastly expanded military strength, which many experts fear emboldens its illegitimate claims of sovereignty over international waters and poses a growing risk to Japan, Southeast Asia, and India. Notwithstanding recent diplomatic initiatives, China\'s growing military power threatens Taiwan and the ability of its people to choose their own future.A nuclear-armed North Korea continues to pursue erratic and aggressive policies that could destabilize northeast Asia. The Iranian nuclear program has now been legitimized as a result of Barack Obama\'s nuclear deal, and it will continue to pose a long-term danger to Israel, our friends in the Arab world, and over time, beyond the Middle East as well. Pakistan\'s nuclear weapons program is growing rapidly and its delivery systems can now reach Israel as well. Russia\'s nuclear and missile modernization efforts not only enhance Russia\'s offensive strike capabilities, but also likely violate its international treaty obligations. China continues its own impressive nuclear weapons modernization effort and the endpoint of that effort is not in sight.Amidst these growing dangers, the risks to state stability in key regions continue unabated. A resurgent Taliban threatens to undo years of progress and a fragile stability in Afghanistan. Mixed signals and tepid commitment to our Afghan partners have raised questions about America\'s credibility and commitment to Afghanistan\'s security, emboldening an insurgency once thought to be on the ropes. Similar dangers are manifest in countries as far apart as Iraq and Nigeria.Closer to home, corruption, narcotics trafficking, trans-national organized crime, and growing violence threaten stability in Central America and the Western Hemisphere, undermining economic opportunities, spurring mass migration and extending the reach of narco-traffickers and violent criminal networks into our own cities.It is clear that America\'s next President must have a new strategy to provide for the common defense in the face of an increasingly insecure and dangerous global environment.It is clear that America\'s next President must have a new strategy to provide for the common defense in the face of an increasingly insecure and dangerous global environment.Governor Bush\'s Four-Part StrategyThe first and most sacred obligation of the U.S. Government is to provide for the common defense, an enumerated responsibility in the Constitution. It requires, among other things, the development of a national security strategy that reaffirms the importance of active U.S. global leadership; the reversal of the massive military cuts enacted by both President Obama and Congress; and the reform of the Defense Department for the more effective implementation of U.S. military modernization. To advance these objectives, Governor Bush will pursue a four-part strategy.1. Restore International Order & Promote International Stability2. Rebuild the Military to Defend American Interests & Values3. Reform the Pentagon4. Defend the HomelandThese four objectives are described below along with a specific plan to successfully achieve each.1. Restore International Order & Promote International StabilityU.S. leadership is required to repair key alliances and partnerships that are essential for restoring the post-World War II international security system so critical for creating a stable and secure environment. This means renewed attention to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has been weakened by shrinking defense budgets and strategic incoherence, and bilateral alliances and partnerships from the Western Hemisphere to the Indo-Pacific, where allies fear diminishing American military capability and will to confront aggression. It means a revitalized U.S. military presence in regions of strategic interest to the United States. And it means the United States and its allies will hold accountable aggressors who threaten international peace and stability.The task of safeguarding international peace and security does not fall on the United States alone, but without U.S. leadership it will not happen.Governor Bush\'s PlanRestore Alliances. America\'s alliance system is a source of national strength and a crucial means by which we promote our economic and security interests, as well as our values abroad. Yet many allies and friends question American commitments and resolve today. Whether by failing to enforce our red line after Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\'s repeated use of chemical weapons, or responding tepidly when Russia invaded Ukraine, or when ISIS overran large swaths of Iraq, America\'s reliability is questioned. So too is our credibility in Asia, where a much touted ""pivot"" or ""rebalance"" seems increasingly hollow.As president, Governor Bush will repair these alliances and restore military readiness. Governor Bush will also exercise diplomatic and economic tools against those who threaten international peace and stability, and he will uphold America\'s commitments to support our allies and partners. These treaty obligations must be supported by force deployments, a greater overseas presence, and stronger surge capabilities.Bolster U.S. commitment to Europe, particularly in the Baltics and Poland. Governor Bush would pursue a more robust presence on NATO\'s eastern frontier to more credibly deter growing threats to those allies. We should also lead consultations within NATO on how to realign NATO forces to meet the growing security challenges we face as an alliance. In light of growing dangers from Russia in the East and terrorism from North Africa and the Middle East, Governor Bush believes the Trans-Atlantic alliance is more important than ever for U.S. national security.To address the unconventional threats Russia poses, we should return a U.S. Army Special Forces Group to Europe. U.S. Special Forces should focus on improving the local defenses and popular resistance forces of NATO frontline states, especially the Baltic states threatened by Russian aggression. The U.S. and its allies should more frequently conduct naval exercises in the Black and Baltic Seas to signal U.S. and allied resolve and presence in the face of further Russian provocations.Increase our presence, restore alliances, and build partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. For nearly 70 years, a forward-deployed U.S. presence in support of our long-standing alliances has kept the peace in the Asia-Pacific. The United States military has played an integral role in ensuring the world\'s most heavily trafficked waterways remain open and free to international commerce. This stability and security has helped to make this region an engine of global economic growth whose continued development is key to our own economic growth.In light of the growing challenge posed to U.S. and allied interests in the region by China\'s military buildup and increased assertiveness, the United States will strengthen ties among our allies and partners to deter aggression and threats to stability or freedom of navigation.We will also need to repair our alliances and restore our credibility, including by increasing our capabilities and presence in the region to compensate for the hollowness of the Obama/Clinton ""rebalance."" To do so, we must provide our forces with the budgets, equipment, and stockpiles they need to do their jobwhether deterring adversaries, training partners, or responding to major national disasters.We must sustain a sufficiently robust maritime capability and presence in the region so that, in concert with key allies such as Japan and Australia and with partners such as India, we can ensure the entire Indo-Pacific remains a peaceful international waterway and a region of strong economic growth.Counter Iranian Aggression, Hasten Assad\'s exit in Syria, Defeat ISIS, and Restore stability in Iraq and Syria. The United States must have a comprehensive strategy not merely to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, but also to confront Iranian aggression, terrorism, and malign activities that have stoked such sectarian violence and destabilized the region. To accomplish this, the U.S. will have to repair broken alliances and partnerships, above all with Israel.To defeat ISIS and stabilize Iraq and Syria, as Governor Bush advocated in a speech at the Reagan Library, the U.S. should deploy U.S. Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) and other special operations forces to work with Iraqi security forces and Sunni tribes, Syrian moderate rebels, and Kurdish forces to ensure their ability to call in U.S. airstrikes in support of local forces\' ground operations. He would also implement a no-fly zone to stop Assad\'s barrel bombings that are fueling the conflict and creating a humanitarian catastrophe, and he would work with partners to establish safe zones in Syria to alleviate the pressure mass migrations have imposed on neighboring countries like Jordan.Governor Bush would strengthen cooperation between U.S. and Gulf Cooperation Council special operations forces. And he would affirm America\'s commitment to maintain a sufficient military force in Afghanistan to advise and support Afghan security forces until the Taliban is defeated.Governor Bush also believes that for the duration of the war against radical Islamic terrorism, we will require a secure place to detain captured battle-hardened terrorists so they do not return to the fight. We have such a facility, and the President should end his political obsession with closing Guantanamo Bay and instead focus on winning the war. Governor Bush would keep the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open unless and until a suitable alternative is found.Improve America\'s Efforts to Build Partner Capacity and Train Foreign Militaries and Security Services. Despite bipartisan agreement that it is preferable to empower local forces to provide security so that large numbers of American forces need not be deployed far from our shores, our record in training foreign security forces to provide stability is not a good one. If we are to help our friends provide for their own security, we\'re going to need to do better than the Syria train and equip program that fielded 50 fighters at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Whether in the Western Hemisphere, the Sahel, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Southeast Asia, we must improve our capacity to train, mentor, and build long-term relationships with foreign security forces so that we do have trusted, moderate, and effective partners on the ground.2. Rebuild the Military to Defend American Interests & ValuesRebuilding the military means putting an end to senseless military cuts in the Budget Control Act and sequestration. Governor Bush would make certain our warfighters are prepared to go into battle at any time and with every advantage. We must maintain America\'s crucial edge in power projection, strike capabilities, and logistics. As Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the large Florida national guard and a state with an enormous military presence he understands the benefits of a strong national defense and the unique needs of those who keep us safe. Restoring our Armed Forces and rebuilding faith with our troops starts with reversing defense cuts enacted by President Obama and Congress.Governor Bush\'s Plan to Rebuild the MilitaryReverse Reductions in U.S. Army End-Strength, Fully Fund Readiness, and Invest in Needed Future Capabilities. No service\'s soldiers have carried a heavier burden recently than the Army, who have borne the most casualties in war over the past fifteen years. The Army has also been hit with the deepest budget cuts by far. The Army is headed toward an Active Duty force of 450,000 by 2018, which is simply too small to protect our interests. Governor Bush\'s plan would grow Army Active Component end-strength back to 490,000.Ensure a Marine Corps Ready to Respond to Crises. Governor Bush\'s plan would increase Active end-strength back to 186,000 Marines to generate sufficient forces to meet crisis response requirements. The plan would end the recent situation in which nearly 50 percent of USMC non-deployed units are not prepared to fight.Increase Naval Firepower and Readiness. The Chief of Naval Operations has testified that the size of the Navy is inadequate to meet current threats. Many sailors are spending far more time at sea than normal, due to backlogs in maintenance and shortage of ships. Governor Bush will seek to increase the fleet size based on national security needs and priorities, taking into account the evolving threat, in order to maintain existing U.S. force projection advantages. He would commit to building two Virginia-class submarines annually. He would halt the mothballing of certain ships, such as cruisers, slated for premature retirement due to budget cuts. And rather than put airmen and sailors in range of advanced radar and missile systems, Governor Bush will explore new longer range conventional strike options.Increasing the Striking Power of the Air Force. After several decades of relative neglect, the Air Force\'s bomber fleet is now the smallest and oldest it has ever been. Only 20 B-2 stealth bombers are capable of penetrating integrated air defense systems being fielded and exported by countries like Russia and China. Even today\'s most advanced fighter aircraft lack the range needed to operate from bases located beyond the reach of enemy missiles and lack the payload to deliver sufficient weapons.Governor Bush\'s plan would increase the planned production rate of the next generation stealth bombers, a cornerstone of America\'s ability to fight and win, to ensure a force of at minimum 100 bombers.As the Air Force is suffering from a shortage of deliverable offensive power, his plan would study the feasibility of a high-altitude, medium-to-long endurance persistent ISR/strike system to complement the new long range bomber. An exportable version of this system could provide needed deterrent power to allies like Israel, Japan, and Australia.Governor Bush believes that it is wrong to send pilots into harm\'s way flying aircraft that are several decades old. He would increase the combat fleet by continuing with the F-35 program, but also would explore other options for air supremacy. This could include restoring the F-22 line or accelerating development of a new air superiority combat system. It has been decades since an American rifleman was attacked by an enemy aircraft. Air supremacy is vital. His plan would reverse the recent atrophy in air superiority capabilities.A Safe, Secure, Reliable Nuclear Deterrent. After more than six years pursuing an approach to nuclear weapons that seeks major near-term reductions in U.S. nuclear forces and their eventual elimination, the Obama Administration has weakened U.S. strategic nuclear forces at a time when other nuclear states are modernizing their nuclear forces and when the number of nuclear-armed states may expand in the coming decades.For several decades, the U.S. has delayed modernization of the nuclear triad. These decisions have caught up to us, with a wave of equipment reaching the end of its service life. Governor Bush recognizes that nuclear deterrence is the backbone of U.S. national security, and will take the necessary steps to rebuild a safe, secure, and modern nuclear deterrent.3. Reform the PentagonThe Defense Department\'s process for buying weapons and services is broken. It is bloated with bureaucratic clutter. There are too many managers and not enough doers. The number of headquarter staffs and civilian personnel have exploded. Irrelevant requirements drive up costs and create an environment that is so regulatory-heavy, it is prohibitive to small businesses. Competition is lacking. And many new weapons the Pentagon fields have come in billions of dollars over-budget, years later than scheduled, and without the combat capability that our troops actually need. Many have been outright canceled, wasting billions of dollars in the process.Governor Bush\'s Plan to Reform the PentagonClear Lines of Accountability in Acquisitions. One example of this problem can be seen in how the Pentagon has abandoned clear lines of authority and accountability for managing major procurement programs. The size and layers of civilian offices, agencies, and military staffs has steadily grown, resulting in severe bureaucratic bloat. That has slowed down the process, eroded accountability, and frustrated the system\'s participants. Most critically, it has delayed the delivery of vital equipment to American forces who are in harm\'s way, or are operating weapons that are straining under decades of age.To correct this, the Pentagon must provide clear decision-making authority and personal accountability to manage major programs. The service secretary, who has the essential levers of control (including power over assignments, promotions, retirements, and expenditures) should have ultimate authority, with the service chiefs providing military advice and having a role sufficient to ensure that these programs provide needed combat capability.One person must have clear responsibility for each major program and authority to manage itwith his tenure aligned with major ""milestone"" investment decisions.Another problem is that large acquisition programs tend to be supported by poorly defined operational requirements and unrealistic performance expectations. Under those circumstances, the ""requirements generation process"" for many systems has not been traceable, defensible or repeatable as they should be, subjecting them to a high risk of ""requirements creep"" or ""gold-plating."" Governor Bush would direct the Pentagon to simplify their requirements for new weapons in order to get them into the hands of the warfighter in a timely manner.Create More Competition among Defense Suppliers. Because of the gradual contraction in the industrial base, the Pentagon lacks a fundamental tool to drive affordability and ensure the availability of the latest advances in technology. After the end of the Cold War, with its 70% reduction in procurement funding, the Pentagon encouraged consolidation among top-tier contractors. That process went much too far, with some 50 prime contractors merging into only a handful of large companies.To address this, the Pentagon must aggressively introduce competition into its efforts to develop and manufacture major weapon systems wherever possible. Competition is the key to affordability and innovation.Also, regulatory barriers that discourage cutting-edge technology companies from doing business with the Pentagon must be reconsidered and, where necessary, removed. For example, the Navy requires that all new purchases be certified resistant to saltwater. As a result, even their software purchases must meet this irrelevant certification requirement.Reform Management at the Department of Defense. The United States is facing increasing dangers from emerging and existing threats around the world but is allowing its military capabilities to be restrained due to self-imposed budget pressures. Congress, outside observers, and multiple Secretaries of Defense identified numerous opportunities to address this issue by improving management and processes at the Department of Defense. Yet progress has been modest, at best.There are many sacred cows in the Pentagon, and in an era of political gridlock, it often seems too hard to accomplish what is necessary. Yet there is hope. In the 1990s, the Pentagon civilian workforce was cut by 38% and numerous reforms were introduced. This shows what is possible.Cut Administrative Costs. Despite the fact that the Department of Defense spends more than $100 billion a year on clerical, administrative, and management costs, there are useful comparisons to the private sector where implementing best practices can result in substantial productivity gains. This would result in savings that could invigorate neglected defense capabilities.Reduce the Civilian Workforce. DoD should focus on the civilian workforce and the outside contractor base. There are approximately 720,000 civilian personnel in the workforce. This reflects a dramatic increase in manpower that has outpaced the growth in military personnel. A General Accounting Office (GAO) report found the Army Staff rose more than 60% since 2001, while uniformed military decreased. The Pentagon should begin to address this overgrowth by trimming redundant agencies as well as by enacting a program consisting of early retirements and voluntary separation packages that can free up money for uniformed military and combat operations.Reduce DOD Spending on Headquarters. The Department of Defense will spend over $40 billion on high-level headquarters. These include Combatant Commands and their Service component commands, the military department headquarters (e.g. Army or Navy), and staffs supporting the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These are costly enterprises with many senior people, elaborate facilities and extensive support (e.g. cars and planes). This cost is nearly as large as or greater than the entire military budgets of some of our NATO allies.Deep cuts in these headquarters\' staffs and their associated facilities and support would free up billions of dollars to help modernize our forces and enhance readiness. It would also speed decision processes and enhance the agility and responsiveness of our forces by eliminating needless layers and reviews.The new Secretary of Defense should establish a small task force of experienced business people and retired senior military officers to review and recommend actions to cut and reconfigure bloated headquarters. Leaders of industrial companies have experience in making deep cuts in overhead expenses when dictated by business conditions. Retired senior military officers can assess the impact of change and ensure critical functions are spared and new structures will work effectively, supporting the Secretary of Defense and the President.The goal would be a 20% reduction, freeing up billions to support critical defense programs. The effort would be short and intense. Final recommendations would be made within 6 months, with implementation complete one year later.4. Defend the HomelandProtecting the homeland, advancing U.S. interests abroad, and protecting American allies in the face of 21st Century threats and a globalized economy will require more than erecting walls and policing our shores. It requires restoring our intelligence capabilities, securing our national infrastructure, defending our borders, and combatting radical Islamic extremism at home and abroad. At the Reagan Library in August 2015, Governor Bush laid out his vision for defeating ISIS and combatting radical Islamic terrorism.Governor Bush\'s Plan to Protect the HomelandSecure the Border. Securing the border is possible, but it will require Washington to move beyond divisive rhetoric. Governor Bush\'s plan for securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws includes the following six steps.1. Establish an effective, forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats.2. Use new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border.3. Bolster border infrastructure  including physical barriers  and improve access to federal lands.4. Require electronic verification of employment eligibility (E-Verify).5. Identify and expatriate those overstaying their visas or otherwise violating the terms of their admission.6. Crack down on sanctuary cities that undermine efforts to enforce immigration laws. Finding a practical solution to the status of the people who are here illegally today is a nonstarter if our borders are not secure against future illegal immigration. Governor Bush\'s full border security plan can be found here.Protect Vital Infrastructure. An important element of the federal response strategy to disasters or attack is working with federal, state, local, and private sector partners to ensure our infrastructure is ready and able to recover quickly when an event occurs.A key barrier to investing now is that many decision makers, both those in federal office as well as at state and local community level, struggle to apply the time and resources to fully protect critical infrastructure when the benefits and return on investment cannot be clearly realized in the foreseeable future. In order to have the right attention and focus on critical infrastructure resilience, Governor Bush would foster greater cooperation and coordination between the private sector and government officials across critical infrastructure sectors. The purpose would be to connect those in government whose mission involves strategic leadership with CEOs who have the ability to set priorities, motivate action, and achieve results. This will also help identify additional critical resources and interdependencies across sectors that must be taken into consideration.The focus would be on survivability and the continuation of the American way of life. This may include aerostats with communication systems, water purification systems, and solar powered command centers  which can contribute to the quick response and recovery of an emergency situation.Restore the Intelligence Community. Our intelligence agencies are increasingly overburdened, underfunded, and struggling to respond to technological advances by adversaries and leaks of sensitive information. This is an enormous challenge.The cornerstone of any effective military or counterterrorism strategy is ensuring accurate, timely, and actionable intelligence. Neither special operators in the field nor law enforcement at home can protect America against the growing terrorist threat without adequate intelligence capabilities. The backbone of U.S. intelligence is its talented corps of professionals, who work tirelessly in the shadows to support the warfighter and protect our safety and security. They do not deserve to be demonized by politicians, but rather must be provided with the capabilities needed to keep America safe. These cutting-edge technologies can be found in our commercial industry and the defense industrial base, where the world\'s best research and development reside. Governor Bush would be committed to ensuring these professionals have everything they need to get the job done.Fully Reauthorize the Patriot Act. Giving our intelligence community the tools they need to protect the homeland is of vital importance. As he called for months ago, Governor Bush would restore Section 215 of the Patriot Act to ensure that we have a technological ability to connect the dots between known foreign terrorists and potential operatives here in the United States. This important and carefully overseen program appropriately protected privacy and civil liberties, and if we give up our advantages over our enemies, we risk putting the freedoms we hold most dear at risk. You can read Governor Bush\'s June statement about the PATRIOT Act here.Cyber Security for the 21st Century. Governor Bush recognizes that the cyber realm is the new frontier of U.S. security, communications, and prosperity. Cybersecurity should be a critical element of our national defense, economic wellbeing, and national resilience. Governor Bush will mobilize public and private resources to ensure our critical infrastructure, networks, and communications remain secure. These efforts will help guarantee America remains on top throughout the ongoing technological and communications revolutions that will transform fundamental aspects of our world, economy, and society. In September, Governor Bush laid out a detailed cyber security plan that would help the United States protect our critical information systems and preserve the freedom and security of the internet.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 19, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: A U.S. Defense Policy for the 21st Century',"b""The savage attacks on Paris last week are a reminder of what is at stake in this election: We are choosing not just the president of the United States, but the leader of the free world.The last seven years under President Obama have taught us that problems do not take care of themselves in the absence of American leadership. And his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has said that her foreign policy would be no more aggressive or forward-leaning than his.Let me say what they will not: We are at war with radical Islamic terrorists. It is the war of our time, and a struggle that will determine the fate of the free world.The urgency of addressing this growing threat is clear, and the United States should not delay in leading a global coalition to take out ISIS with overwhelming force. Militarily, we need to intensify our efforts in the air, though they alone cannot produce the results we seek. In conjunction with NATO allies and local partners, we will also need to increase our presence on the ground. And ISIS can't be defeated without ending Assad's brutal war against his own people, creating a political solution that allows for a stable Syria.For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, American military power, and American credibility kept the peace and deterred the violent. This is the way forward in our time as well. The fate of millions, the security of our own people, and the cause of human freedom itself all depend on the decisions we make in these coming years.Defending our national interests always involves risk, but the greatest risk of all is the risk of military inferiority. Unless we change course, that is where we'll wind up.The next president will take office after an eight-year drawdown of American military power, and careless, chronic neglect by the president and Congress.In the span of a decade, our government will have withheld a trillion dollars from our national-defense budget. There is no strategic rationale for these cuts. They are completely arbitrary, imposed by a process that everyone in Washington claims to dislike, but no one in Washington has the courage to stop. In my administration, security for the United States will mean gaining and keeping the edge in every category, old and new. Whether it's our command of the seas, the land, or the air, of space or cyberspace, America's goal should be technological superiority beyond any doubt.My plan puts the warfighters first, to maintain a force without equal. When we do use force, it must be effective, and our objectives must be well defined, so that one deployment doesn't lead to endless others  or leave the job undone. I have a plan for a 21st-century military to project that force  when necessary  around the globe. We don't need to be the world's policemen, but we must restore our place as the leader and indispensable power of the free world.Beginning immediately as president, I would work with Congress to rebuild our military forces, starting with their most urgent needs: a new generation of aircraft, so that our planes aren't older than our pilots; a larger naval fleet, so that our sailors patrol in the strongest and safest ships on the seas, and an acceleration of our submarine program, so that America's silent service can maintain its lethal edge; improved missile defenses to protect against the growing threats posed by Iranian and North Korean missiles; surveillance and cybersecurity capabilities superior to anything fielded against them, so that we find the threats before the threats find us; and a restoration of the PATRIOT Act's metadata program, to ensure we have the ability toconnect the dots between known foreign terrorists and potential operatives here in the United States.But we cannot and will not simply throw money at this problem. We need to reform the Pentagon, shedding overhead passed down from a different generation and adapting it to our 21st-century challenges. That means procurement reform so we buy the right tools at the right price  and get them to our warriors at the right time.In the aftermath of the bloodshed in Paris, this generation knows the cost of war, but also knows the even greater cost of drift and inaction. Radical Islamic terrorists have declared war on the West. Their aim is our total destruction. We can't withdraw from this threat, nor negotiate with it. As president, I will be resolute in pursuit of our only option: We must defeat it.Originally Posted on the National Review"""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 19, 2015",b'Press Release - Admiral Robert Natter: Rebuild the U.S. Navy',"b'One of the memorable moments in the 2012 presidential debates came when Mitt Romney pointed out that the U.S. Navy\'s fleet was at its smallest size since 1917  and trending downwards.""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of military\'s changed,"" retorted President Barack Obama.The president is right: Our military is always changing. But our ships, submarines and aircraft can still only be in one place at one time. In 2003, when I headed Fleet Forces Command, we could still meet our commitments, though we didn\'t have much wiggle room.Today, we face a situation where the number of ships in our Navy is insufficient to meet the demand. To deal with this situation, the Navy is being forced to make impossible choices between competing priorities.For the first time in decades, the Navy has determined that it can no longer keep one carrier group on station near each hotspot. Budget pressures are forcing the Navy to put into mothballs 11 very capable guided missile cruisers. And because of inadequate funding, the nation is forgoing the acquisition of necessary amphibious ships, modern strike fighters, and other capabilities needed for conventional missions. With this shortfall, the Navy\'s fleet of attack submarines will also fall from 53 boats at present to just 41 in 2029.Perhaps most critically, however, our Navy is being forced to choose where it will still be able to project U.S. power. In 2011, the Obama administration announced that the United States would ""pivot"" to the Asia-Pacific region in response to China\'s growing military power and its outrageous territorial claims. But with the Navy\'s numbers and resources so constrained, increased presence in Asia comes at the expense of other regions. In the Middle East, this has resulted in a three-month ""gap"" during which no carrier has been present, undermining our ability to deter threats like Iran.In European waters, U.S. presence has dwindled to almost nothing, even as Russia conducts naval exercises in the Mediterranean and uses its reconstituted submarine force to penetrate allied waters and menace America\'s Eastern Seaboard with sub-launched cruise missiles and nuclear torpedoes. In Asia, the region where some 60 percent of our forces are being deployed, the resources provided may not be sufficient to deal with China\'s aggressive maritime activities and the alarming rate at which its military forces are modernizing.With the growing threats around the world and the constraints that have been imposed on our Navy, several stark choices appear. First, we can sustain the ""pivot"" to Asia, leaving Russia unchecked and ongoing operations in the Middle East under-resourced. Second, we can pivot again to Russia at the expense of Asia. Or, third, we can try to spread our shrinking forces among all three regions, and risk having insufficient forces to sustain our objectives in any of them.But there is a fourth choice. With more responsible presidential leadership, we can reverse the historic decline in funding for defense, regrow our fleet and bring the level of U.S. naval forces back into alignment with their growing demand. Jeb Bush has been a strong advocate for the U.S. military, strong enough to earn my support. As he said on Hugh Hewitt\'s radio show earlier this year, our Navy has ""kept the sea lanes open... created a much more peaceful world... [and enabled] us to take advantage of prosperity in the world as well.""This week Bush will unveil his plan for rebuilding the military. Hampton Roads\' large Navy and military community will see much to like. The plan commits to growing the Navy fleet, accelerating the building of Virginia-class submarines, and modernizing older ships now slated for retirement. It eliminates the budget cuts held into law by the sequester, a word this community has learned to hate. And it recognizes that our sailors have spent far too much time at sea, vowing to do away with extended Navy deployments that have become the new ordinary.As part of a balanced military, a strong U.S. Navy is critical for our national security, the maintenance of peace and prosperity overseas, and the health of the economy in Hampton Roads and nationwide. The 2016 field has many talented candidates, but for this old sailor, Bush has presented the strongest plan in the field for rebuilding our military.Originally Posted on The Virginian-Pilot'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 19, 2015","b'Press Release - General William ""Buck"" Kernan: Paris is a Wake-Up Call for Rebuilding Military'","b'In the wake of the worst terrorist attack on a Western power since Sept.11, Americans must look to the sad state of our military. Paris is a terrible tragedy, but it is also a wake-up call.Since 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress have cut a projected $1 trillion from the Armed Forces. The Army, in particular, has taken terrible losses.Our active duty end strength has already been reduced by 145,000 soldiers since 2012, a number larger than the entire British Army.What\'s worse is that the soldiers who do survive the hatchet will not be as well-trained or equipped as their predecessors. Gen.Raymond Odierno, the former Army chief of staff, warned ""today we only have 33 percent of our brigades ready, when our sustained rate should be closer to 70 percent.""Iowans will recognize the impact of these cuts immediately. Recently it was announced that the Iowa National Guard could be deployed to Afghanistan in 2016. The Guard was once an emergency force, only to be used in time of dire national circumstances. But because our active duty Army is smaller than necessary, Guard and reserve units have been used to fill the gaps.I was commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command on Sept.11, 2001. I saw how reckless military cuts during the Clinton years left uswith inadequate forces to address the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attacks happened so quickly, we had scarce time to shift onto a wartime footing. The lack of preparedness was costly. We paid for it with too many American lives, too much time away from families, and too much risk to our national security.Our active duty Army that deployed had to absorb 15-month tours in Iraq until we could activate and train up the Reserve forces necessary to meet wartime requirements. Given the world-wide threats,time is not a luxury we enjoy.Iowans in particular have a special voice in selecting a new president, and as such it is incumbent on them to pick an experienced leader. Times have grown too dangerous to fool around with an unproven commander-in-chief.It is imperative that we have a trained and ready Army with the requisite capability and capacity to respond immediately to any threat to our national security.We need a candidate with experience leading large organizations so that they are ready to lead the Armed Forces and a candidate who has a serious plan for restoring the U.S. military.For this formerRanger andparatrooper, that candidate is Gov. Jeb Bush. This week he released a detailed plan for rebuilding the military after years of cuts by President Obama and Congress. The plan includes adding 40,000 soldiers and 4,000 new Marines. It calls for replacing aircraft that are older than the pilots that fly them. It calls for giving our bravest the best training, equipment, and leadership in the world, so that American can meet the challenges of our time  and return our country to better days of peace and prosperity.Equally importance is placed on fixing the Department of Veteran Affairs. Governor Bush already unveiled a specific plan to fix the VA, so that those who come home to us wounded have all the care they need. Not only is this a moral imperative, but a strategic one as well. America has an all volunteer military. There is a sacred trust between the American people and those who honor us with their service. That trust has been undermined in the wake of terrible scandals at the VA. We must look seriously to those candidates who have serious policies for restoring that trust.In the Army, young lieutenants straight out of training are assigned the heavy responsibility of leading a platoon. But the heart and soul of those units lie in the seasoned platoon sergeants, who have the experience leading troops that those young lieutenants lack.Retention of our seasoned and combat proven senior non-commissioned officers is a readiness imperative.That is because through the grave trials of leadership, there is simply no replacement for experience. That goes for both a sergeant and a commander-in-chief. As governor of one of the largest states in the country, with one of the largest military and veteran populations, and a purple demographic like Iowa, Jeb Bush has the leadership experience our troops crave.It is for this reason that Iowans often see Medal of Honor recipients introducing Governor Bush at events. It is for this reason that he has the largest national veteran coalition of any candidate. It is for this reason that 25 former generals and admirals came out and endorsed him in the wake of the Paris attacks.I am one of those generals. And I have signed on for the same reason as so many other veterans. In times of crises, America looks to experience and leadership to see us through.Jeb Bush is that leader.Originally Posted on the Des Moines Register'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"November 20, 2015","b'Press Release - Jeb: Presidents Should Lead, Not Lecture'","b'I believe the commander-in-chief of the world\'s one indispensable superpower ought to lead, not just lecture. Unfortunately, after the terrorist attacks in Paris, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have chosen to criticize leaders for raising concerns about the administration\'s proposal to bring tens of thousands of refugees into the United States.Their tone has been partisan and sanctimonious, and it is undermining a serious conversation about this foreign and domestic policy challenge.A less divisive President, who understood that the security of the American people must come first, would not engage in name calling. He or she would explain what he was doing to keep them safe and address their concerns, rather than dismissing them. And he or she would review and revise counterterrorism and immigration strategies to make sure they were effective, and ensure that we are not putting our nation at risk.Americans don\'t need lectures on compassion from those who failed to act to address the conflict that caused ISIS\' growth and the refugee crisis in the first place. If President Obama and Secretary Clinton want to identify the individuals who have shown little empathy or willingness to stand up for displaced Syrians, they should look in the mirror.The best way for America to show compassion and protect our homeland would be to provide safe zones in Syria and destroy the root causes of the refugee crisis in the region  ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Instead, President Obama  who hours before the Paris attacks told us that ISIS was ""contained""  simply reiterates that his strategy is working, despite plain evidence to the contrary.Meanwhile, his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was part of the team that developed that failing strategy, one that ignored the growing terrorist threats. Although she spoke differently in a speech Thursday, she also recently admitted she would be no more aggressive on foreign policy than President Obama.Yes, Secretary Clinton claims she would rebuild alliances with Israel and our traditional Arab allies. But they are unlikely to forget her role in forging and endorsing the Iran nuclear deal that left them less safe. Asked to name an enemy she is most proud of making, Clinton recently cited Republicans  a chilling signal that the divisiveness of the Obama era could become even worse with her in the Oval Office.In the meantime, because defending his strategy is increasingly impossible, President Obama instead raises a host of obvious ""straw man"" arguments about the alternatives to his incremental approach, such as claiming that others have ""half-baked"" schemes to reinvade and occupy the entire Middle East.President Obama also continues to ignore his own role in this unfolding tragedy. He should recall that he called for the butcher Assad to step down, but did nothing to make him do so. He pledged to support the Syrian opposition, but failed to deliver. After months of Assad slaughtering his own people, he drew a ""red line"" regarding the use of chemical weapons, yet failed to enforce it after Assad repeatedly used those weapons against his own people. Years of indiscriminate aerial bombing of civilian populations by Assad remains unchallenged by his administration. President Obama\'s ""JV team"" has now slaughtered innocent people on at least three continents, and seems eager to add our own to that bloodstained list.Where was President Obama\'s patronizing, feigned outrage then?Given the reports that ISIS seeks to hide among refugees, that at least one of the attackers in Paris may have been a refugee, and bipartisan concerns about the refugee screening process in Congress, the pause in bringing refugees to this country that passed the House of Representatives this week is both sensible and appropriate.My heart aches for the hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives, and the millions who have been displaced, in Iraq and Syria. America has a great moral tradition of taking in persecuted peoples throughout the world, and we should not turn our back now.That is why I\'ve outlined a strategy to address this humanitarian tragedy, protect the Christian and other religious minorities that are being eradicated in the Middle East, defeat the terrorists and Assad, confront Iranian aggression and end this conflict on terms favorable to the United States and its allies. That is a President\'s job. As President Obama\'s term draws to an end, Americans will have a chance to choose a President who will lead, who will inspire, and will work to fix the problems that face us. That\'s what I will do as President of the United States.Originally Published by CNN'"

A threat this administration has ignored as it has grown on their watch.One place where their inaction and lack of moral clarity in this fight has been particularly stark has been in relation to our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.Israeli citizens have for decades lived with the daily threat of terror on their doorstep, in their communities, and when they travel abroad. Today, while old enemies like Hezbollah and Hamas continue to threaten Israel, the Jewish state has also seen a new threat emerge inside its borders. A string of stabbings, hit-and-runs, and shootings of innocents whose only crime was being Jewish is but the latest form of anti-Israeli terror.This recent surge in violence has left Israeli citizens vulnerable in their everyday life, and cries out for allies who understand how disruptive such a threat could be.As president, I will restore resolve, consistency, and moral clarity to America\'s efforts to combat terrorism.Israel has faced radical Shiite terrorists, such as during the 2006 war with Hezbollah, when the Iranian-backed terrorist group rained thousands of rockets on the northern part of the country.Since then, Iran and Syria have re-armed Hezbollah with more than a hundred thousand rockets, including longer-range sophisticated weapons that can hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Hezbollah has also plotted to slaughter innocent Jews around the world, including in Latin America, Africa, and Europe.Israel has also faced radical Sunni terrorism, such as Hamas\' campaign of terror, which at times has included daily rocket strikes against civilian areas, bombings, and other attacks against Israel.Hamas also knows that Israel takes extraordinary care to avoid civilian casualties when defending itself, and exploits Israel\'s respect for innocent Palestinian lives by using human shields and locating weapons stockpiles and firing positions in schools and hospitals.Such horrific exploitation of innocents in the promotion of terror reminds us there can be no moral equivalence between Palestinian terrorism and Israel\'s efforts to defend itself against it.In addition to a disturbing trend of anti-Semitism in Europe and even on university campuses in the United States, Israel also faces a concerted international effort to delegitimize it. The ""boycott, divestment, sanctions"" (BDS) movement is but one manifestation of this appalling anti-Israel effort and as president I will fight and rebuke it.Given the deep historic, cultural, and emotional ties that bind the United States and Israel, as well as our shared interests in fighting the growing terrorist threat and combatting Iranian aggression, the U.S.-Israel relationship should be stronger than ever.Yet under Obama, Clinton, and Kerry we have seen a tremendous erosion of this essential alliance. Obama and Clinton promised to always have Israel\'s back, but they went behind Israel\'s back in conducting secret negotiations with Iran.The deal Obama reached with Iran ignores Iran\'s support for terrorism and missile proliferation that directly threatens Israel, and has rewarded Iran with more than $100 billion to spend on its terrorist proxies.The Obama administration has suggested the U.S. might withhold vetoes against anti-Israel resolutions at the UN.As president, I will restore resolve, consistency, and moral clarity to America\'s efforts to combat terrorism.I will speak against the moral equivalence that criticizes just societies like Israel who defend themselves against terror.I will hold Palestinian leaders accountable for official acts of incitement that honor terrorists, glorify violence, and teach children to hate.I will actively combat Iran\'s support for terrorism, and aggressively work to interdict and impose consequences for its provision of weapons and support to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic jihad.I will rebuild the trust that has been badly eroded during this administration between the United States and Israel.I will make clear that the pathway to peace requires an end to violence and the recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.I will restore the trust that binds America\'s alliance with Israel, and send the world the unmistakable message that we stand as one in our common effort to defeat the enemies of civilization.If we cannot stand with our ally Israel in the face of this terror, we cannot be relied on to lead the world in the name of free people any longer.President Obama and Hillary Clinton have demonstrated they are not up to the task.I will be.Originally Posted on FoxNews.com'"

At the same time, we are struggling to respond to our adversaries' technical advances and damaging leaks of sensitive information.The cornerstone of any effective military, counterterrorism or homeland security effort is ensuring accurate, timely and actionable intelligence. As president, Governor Bush would immediately reverse constraints imposed on our intelligence community by the Obama Administration, including:PDD-28, a Presidential Decision Directive that restricts overseas intelligence collection and imposes other White House-directed, self-imposed restrictions on our intelligence community.Obama's Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) regarding counterterrorism that imposes an overly bureaucratic approach to targeting foreign terrorists overseas. This guidance is emblematic of the Obama Administration's flawed approach to counterterrorism that has ignored growing terrorist safe havens and proliferating threats while reducing effectiveness through risk-averse rules of engagement.Governor Bush would also immediately call for Congress to fully reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act's counterterrorist metadata program to allow the intelligence community to connect the dots between foreign terrorists and potential operatives in the United States, and to make permanent other key provisions of the PATRIOT Act that increase our ability to monitor terrorist communications.This important and carefully overseen program appropriately protected both privacy and civil liberties. If we abandon our technological advantages over our determined enemies, we are putting the safety we hold most dear at risk. If we identify or capture an ISIS terrorist in Syria, we should have the tools to determine if they've been communicating with someone in Sacramento.Under President Obama, our enemies do not fear us, and our allies do not trust us. Governor Bush would also move to restore intelligence liaison relationships with allies and partners overseas that have atrophied during the Obama Administration. Now more than ever, we need to enhance our intelligence cooperation with partners, both in the Middle East and Europe. Neither law enforcement at home nor special operators in the field can effectively keep America safe without adequate intelligence capabilities, and Governor Bush intends to make restoring America's intelligence community a top priority.America will not be safe if we only play defense. Governor Bush believes that in addition to bolstering our defenses at home, we must take the fight to the terrorists who have declared war on us and our way of life. In his August speech at the Reagan Library, he proposed a comprehensive strategy to abandon President Obama's failed incrementalism and destroy ISIS and discredit its radical ideology.Jeb Bush is the only candidate in the race who has outlined serious and substantive plans to destroy ISIS, restore the American military and reverse President Obama's risky counterterrorism policies."""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"December 9, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb Answers Question From Fifth-Grader',b'Jeb met a smart 5th grader in New Hampshire who asked about his 1st term plan. Watch to hear his answer:'
Jeb Bush,R,p,"December 9, 2015",b'Press Release - The Tenth Amendment Presidency',"b'The Constitution\'s architecture is shaped by separation of powers principles. Horizontally, the Constitution divides powers among the three branches of the federal government and allocates to each branch separate and distinct authorities. Vertically, the Constitution divides powers between the federal and state governments. Vertical separation of powers, known as federalism, finds life in several of the Constitution\'s provisions. Most notably, the Constitution creates a federal government of limited and enumerated powers, leaving all other legitimate government authority ""to the States respectively, or to the people.""Most notably, the Constitution creates a federal government of limited and enumerated powers, leaving all other legitimate government authority ""to the States respectively, or to the people.""Separation of powers aims to achieve three goals. The first is to prevent any single governmental entity from accumulating too much power. The second is to ensure that each branch of government exercises the type of authority that is best suited given its institutional nature; for example, since legislation requires careful consideration and compromise, legislative power is vested in a multi-member Congress. By contrast, executive power must be often wielded with dispatch and decisiveness and is, therefore, vested in the unitary executive. The third is to promote political accountability, so that the people can readily praise or blame the appropriate governmental entity for their happiness or their frustration. The Framers understood that these three goals are critical to the protection of individual liberty.Unfortunately, over time, the federal government has amassed power at the expense of the states. Sometimes, this change has come about as the result of amendments to the Constitution. The 16th Amendment, for example, expanded the power of the federal government by enabling it to impose income taxes, without having to apportion them among several states. Meanwhile, the 17th Amendment limited the ability of states to have their voice heard in the Senate, thereby cabining their capacity to influence federal legislation. Other times, however, federal aggrandizement has been the result of an overaggressive federal Congress and/or the executive. As a result, states today too often operate in the shadows of national authority, functioning as the docile wards of a distant federal government. Individual liberty has suffered as a result.We must re-empower states to be high-octane suppliers of change and innovation, allowing them to exercise their constitutional freedom to govern their citizens and residents. States are closer than the federal government to the schools our children attend, the hospitals that care for our sick, the rivers and lakes in which we swim, the water we drink and the air we breathe. It is the height of hubris for the federal government to assume that state governments care less about these things than the federal government. As an added bonus, states typically perform better and at less expense than the federal government. The appropriate devolution of responsibilities and activities would save families hundreds of billions of dollars on everything from health care costs to energy bills.The federal government, of course, violates the Constitution when it seeks to act beyond its enumerated powers and when it tries to use its enumerated powers to commandeer state resources or to coerce state officials to carry out federal policies. But, even when the federal government is acting constitutionally, it violates the spirit of federalismand often generates bad policywhen it seeks to use its authority to impose one-size-fits-all policies on the states. It is long past time for federal officials and lawmakers to acknowledge that the mere ability to trump state decisions is an insufficient justification for attempting to do so. Before acting, federal officials and legislators should ask why it is that the federal government is better suited than state and local governments to handle the issue under consideration.As a country, we must acknowledge that many problems, even some that are of national scope, do not call for federal solutions.As a country, we must acknowledge that many problems, even some that are of national scope, do not call for federal solutions. Governor Bush believes that shifting power to the states across the domestic operations of the federal government would simultaneously improve policy outcomes, put money back into American taxpayers\' pockets and enhance individual liberty.For this reason, Governor Bush has announced and will continue to announce policy initiatives that will restrain the size of the federal government and restore state authority in several areas, including health care, education, the environment, lands management, welfare and transportation. In addition to those substantive policies, Governor Bush believes that the following initiatives will help restore the proper balance between the federal and state governments, unleash robust economic growth and harness the benefits of our vast geographic diversity.Prioritize Presidential Leadership over Federal MandatesOur shared values imbue the president with substantial soft power over the states. A president can harness this power to move policy in his preferred direction without resorting to coercive measures. By emphasizing persuasion and coordination over preemption and control, the president can achieve his policy objectives while respecting states as the primary governors of their citizens and residents. A federalism-based leadership strategy also promotes flexible solutions capable of accounting for local circumstances and enabling a diversity of approaches, all while mitigating the dangers of picking the wrong policy to govern the entire country. And in an age of congressional gridlock, a leadership strategy offers a constitutional means of moving policy notwithstanding federal legislative recalcitrance.As president, Governor Bush will make it a priority to hold regular meetings with governors to coordinate state-driven solutions to national concerns, exchange lessons learned and discuss the role the federal government should play in improving outcomes. In this regard, the president will assume the posture of a leader of chief executives. He will also strive to ensure that federal regulations respect states\' autonomy and ingenuity. Under Governor Bush, all federal regulatory agencies will promote state-based solutions over federal solutions and when a federal rule is appropriate, regulators will first turn to state best practices before attempting to create a new approach from whole cloth. Governor Bush\'s regulatory spring cleaning commission, announced in September 2015, will identify areas of regulation that should be returned, in whole or in part, to state control.Adhere to the Constitution\'s Limits on Federal PowerAmerica must return to the idea of a limited federal government. Not only should the federal government defer as often as possible to state governments, in many cases it is constitutionally required to do so. The federal government cannot act beyond its constitutional limits. And even when the federal government stays within those limits, it cannot coerce states or command state officials to operate in particular ways or deploy state resources in a particular manner. Unfortunately, in the last century, the federal government\'s three branches have worked to foster a view of the Constitution that empowers the federal government well beyond anything the Founders\' contemplated.The next president need not accept this state of affairs. The president owes loyalty directly to the Constitution. Accordingly, the president should exercise authority consistent with their understanding of the Constitution. At times, that will mean adhering to the historical practice of not enforcing or defending laws that trample upon state constitutional authority. That will mean vetoing laws that are inconsistent with federalism.Governor Bush will be the first president in our history to commit to vetoing legislation that he determines clearly exceed the limits of federal authority.Governor Bush will be the first president in our history to commit to vetoing legislation that he determines clearly exceed the limits of federal authority. Governor Bush will provide written justifications for his vetoes, empowering the public to better understand the Constitution\'s limits on federal authority and the Congress to adopt legislation that complies with those limits. Governor Bush will use his veto authority to rein in the expansive judicial interpretations that have reinterpreted the Commerce, the Necessary and Proper, and the Tax and Spend Clauses to grant the federal government nearly unfettered authority to require and coerce states to bend to the dictates and desires of the federal government.Governor Bush will also ensure that his judicial nominees are committed to vigorously enforcing the Constitution\'s limits on federal authority, rejecting reliance on vague notions of deference to uphold decisions of the political branches that exceed the limits of those branches\' constitutional authority. Governor Bush\'s nominees will be people of the highest character and integrity who have extraordinary intelligence and the ability to persuade. They will also have a clear, proven record grounded in strictly interpreting the law, adhering to the Constitution\'s limits on government authority, and not legislating from the bench. Governor Bush has a consistent record of appointing judges who understand that their role is to enforce the Constitution, regardless of their policy preferences.Nominate & Appoint Executive Branch Officials Committed to FederalismA federalism-focused president must infuse a zeal for state-based governance throughout their administration. While the president sets the tone, their nominees and appointees are responsible for an array of decisions that determine the course of the federal government. People who have been socialized inside the beltway or in an ivory tower may be less inclined to govern with the respect and deference for state authority and autonomy that Governor Bush would expect from his administration officials.Accordingly, Governor Bush will prioritize people with proven experience in the states over Washington insiders and academics in filling those administrative positions where state-federal cooperation is most critical. State-focused nominations and appointments will be most important at the Education, Energy, Interior, and Justice Departments, as well as at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.State-focused appointments will also be important within the White House, particularly at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). OIRA is vital to presidential control over federal regulations because it oversees agencies\' compliance with presidential executive orders on regulation. As president, Governor Bush will issue an executive order directing agencies to construe statutes in favor of preserving state authority, to favor state-based solutions over federal regulation, and to incorporate state-based best practices into federal regulations, if such regulations are appropriate. OIRA can also use its unparalleled visibility into proposed and final regulations government-wide to aid Governor Bush\'s independent commission to conduct a regulatory spring cleaning that will identify areas of federal overreach. A state-centric OIRA Administrator could be the difference between the success and failure of these federalism-based regulatory initiatives.Broadly Reform the Regulatory ProcessAs discussed in Governor Bush\'s regulatory reform plan, many of President Obama\'s regulations offend federalism. The regulatory process must be substantially reformed to prevent such abuses from reoccurring. Statutes like the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and Executive Order 13,132 call on agencies to account for federalism concerns before regulating, but these legal authorities are riddled with loopholes, under-enforced and readily evaded. One consequence is that states have spent the Obama years challenging regulatory overreaches in the courts.That will change under Governor Bush. In his administration, all agenciesincluding independent agencieswill document, in detail, steps taken to resolve federalism-based concerns before finalizing any new regulatory initiatives. Among other things, agencies will be required to create a State Impact Analysis (SIA) for regulations with significant federalism implications. The SIA process will require agencies to document conclusions regarding the effects of their regulatory initiatives on state regulatory flexibility and budgets. OIRA will enforce these requirements through prompt review, and return letters, which will have presidential backing through a cabinet-level taskforce on regulation. Moreover, Governor Bush will make legislative codification of these principles a priority, so that they are binding on future administrations.Environmental protection is an area ripe for regulatory reform. State officials consistently report frustration with the federal government\'s takeover of environmental regulation, as far-flung bureaucrats patronizingly reject state attempts to protect their own natural resources in favor of one-size-fits-all federal plans. Such decisions seem rooted in an unjustified assumption that states care less about their environment than does the federal government. Of course, the federal government has an important role in protecting the environment, but we cannot forget that states have ample incentives to protect the rivers and lakes in which their children and grandchildren swim, the water they drink and the air they breathe. Before intervening in this area, the federal government should have to make the case that there are interstate issues at stake and that state governments are not willing or able to adequately respond.In recent years, the federal government has demonstrated a particular willingness to override state environmental authorities in ways that devastate private property rights. For example, the ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) rule subjects nearly all private land use to review by the Environmental Protection Agency. The rule expands federal authority to virtually all wet areas (and temporarily wet areas) in the statesincluding ditches, drains, seasonal puddle-like depressions, and large ""buffer areas"" of land adjacent to waterways. For example, the rule potentially subjects 99 percent of Pennsylvania\'s acreage to federal jurisdiction. The WOTUS rule is inconsistent with longstanding presumptions in favor of state-based water regulation and unnecessarily and arbitrarily increases the cost and uncertainty of many industrial, commercial and farming operations. Those who fail to comply face stiff penalties of roughly $40,000 per violation.The recently announced $1 trillion Ozone Rule is also troubling from a federalism standpoint. In this rule, the administration adopted a new overly stringent maximum level of ozone allowed in the air, notwithstanding that ozone levels were declining, due in large part to local regulation and market-based solutions. The Ozone Rule will likely curtail agriculture and manufacturing production, alter farming methods, require new waste storage mechanisms, impede food processing operations and impair the production of renewable fuels. With state regulation and market-based solutions driving ozone levels to record lows, this is an unnecessary expansion of the federal government\'s control over states.The same is true for the administration\'s so-called Clean Power Plan, which unlawfully seizes from states the authority to regulate power supply systems. The plan violates the Clean Air Act and disrupts a long history of state control over how they generate and distribute electricity. It violates both the horizontal and vertical separation of powers.The plan aptly demonstrates the pitfalls of uniform federal ""solutions,"" imposing emissions control requirements on states that do not account for local needs, infrastructure or resources. The result of the plan\'s onerous requirements is to make the continued operation of many coal-fired plants impossible, giving states little option but to replace those plants with enormously expensive alternative sources of energy generation.Governor Bush has pledged to repealand where necessary replaceeach of these regulations. He believes that these regulations must be repealed, not only because they are costly and will produce little to no environmental or health benefits, but also because they upset the proper relationship between the state and federal governments.Governor Bush will pursue two regulatory reforms that will keep regulators focused on truly federal problems, leaving states with more time and resources to govern their residents and less need to fight back against federal overreach.In addition, Governor Bush will pursue two regulatory reforms that will keep regulators focused on truly federal problems, leaving states with more time and resources to govern their residents and less need to fight back against federal overreach. First, Governor Bush will require federal agencies to live within a budget. Regulators will be forced to make tradeoffs between regulatory priorities while eliminating or modifying regulations that no longer make sense. Agencies will not add regulatory costs during the first year of Governor Bush\'s administration unless they are offset by regulatory savings. Second, Governor Bush will ensure that his regulatory spring cleaning commission scrubs the regulatory code for rules that need to be repealed or modified in order to restore the proper role of state governments in our constitutional system.Create an Office of Cooperative FederalismGovernor Bush has already detailed how he will return substantive regulatory authority to the states in several areas, including health care, welfare, the environment and land management. He will soon release an education agenda focused on rolling back the Obama Administration\'s coercive imposition of Common Core and dramatically enhancing state flexibility with respect to education resources provided by the federal government.Even with these reforms, however, the federal government will retain ample authority in those and other areas where states can play a constructive role, on their own or in partnership with the federal government. For this reason, many federal laws already empower agencies to engage in cooperative federalism with states, whether by giving states the opportunity to implement federal law, subject to agency oversight, or by giving agencies authority to waive federal requirements. The goal of these cooperative federalism opportunities is to free states to develop innovative solutions to public policy problems.Unfortunately, cooperative federalism in practice has often failed to achieve these goals. Rather than free states to explore new policies, agencies have abused cooperative federalism, converting it into a tool to coerce states to adopt policies that sometimes exceed the bounds of federal law. Cooperative federalism can thus provide the illusion of state control, while in reality allowing bureaucrats to assume the mantle of lawmakers.For example, the No Child Left Behind Act has become largely dysfunctional and needs to be substantially overhauled. In the absence of congressional resolution, however, the Obama Administration has withheld desperately needed waivers from states unless they bend to its policy desires. Similarly, federal law gives states primary authority to meet clean air standards in a document known as a State Implementation Plan (SIP). In the unusual event that a SIP is deficient, the Environmental Protection Agency can set standards using a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). Until the Obama Administration, FIPs were relatively rareroughly one per year. Since 2008, the administration has imposed, or attempted to impose, nearly 20 FIPs, sometimes using them to drive states toward policy outcomes not required by federal law.These results should not be surprising. Federal regulatory agencies are staffed by many unelected people who come to view their positions as opportunities to implement policies they believe are good for the country. Properly implementing cooperative federalism reserves that power to state officials. Allowing federal officials to abuse waivers also enhances their power, usurping authority from both Congress and the states.As president, Governor Bush will urge Congress to transfer cooperative federalism authority from the various departments to a new Office of Cooperative Federalism within the Office of Management and Budget. Staffed primarily by people with experience in state government, this small office will oversee and coordinate waiver requests, state-federal planning and other delegation issues, giving respectful consideration to states\' innovative policies and promoting meaningful federal/state flexibility and cooperation. To promote regulatory innovation, the office will generally grant waivers and approve state-driven plans unless the proposals are arbitrary, infeasible or contrary to federal law.Enhance State Enforcement of Federal Immigration PoliciesFirst, the federal government should augment its current enforcement of immigration laws, such as identifying and apprehending people who overstay their visas, by training and supervising state and local law enforcement officials to assist them. Local law enforcement personnel know their communities better and have more boots on the ground. Governor Bush\'s border security proposals, announced in August 2015, included this proposal. Under Governor Bush, Florida was the first state to partner with the federal government under its Section 287(g) program to enforce federal immigration laws. These training and supervision programs should be further expanded to ensure an unprecedented level of federal/state cooperation in immigration enforcement.Second, we need to amend current law. States cannot enforce state laws that conflict with federal immigration law, which is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). During the Obama Administration, however, the federal government has taken an even more hostile view toward state law, preventing states from enforcing state laws that harmonize with federal immigration laws. For instance, federal law currently penalizes employers who hire illegal workers. However, the president has attempted to thwart states who pass laws bolstering enforcement of this existing federal law, especially in the face of weak federal enforcement efforts.Congress could amend the INA to make it a ""conflict preemption"" statute rather than a ""field preemption"" statute, allowing states to enforce complementary state laws that do not conflict with federal law, do not violate civil liberties, and do not criminalize conduct that is not criminal under federal law.This one change could be critical in unlocking the country\'s ongoing debate over immigration policy. Empowering states to enforce laws that promote the goals of federal immigration lawwithout allowing states to create their own immigration regimeswill address states\' persistent demand that any effort to reform the country\'s immigration system ensures that the border is secured and that internal enforcement is robust. In such a system, states could be confident that federal immigration law will be enforced, even during administrations and Congresses that direct federal resources to other areas.Promote State-Driven Labor and Employment PoliciesTechnological advances are changing the way people live and work in the modern economy. Rigid work rules designed for an industrial economy are poised to stifle innovation and foreclose new and flexible work opportunities for millions of Americans. Federal initiatives to redefine who counts as an ""employee,"" a ""full-time employee,"" or an ""employer"" are more often than not, efforts to enhance the control of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services over the economy, and to force employers to act in accordance with the policy preferences of distant federal bureaucrats. The NLRB, for example, seeks to make more types of employers subject to unionization so that it can prevent them from engaging in practices it believes are unfair. Meanwhile, the Labor Department seeks to redefine the law to limit the number of hours employees can work at agreed-upon wages. Moreover, the Department of Health and Human Services redefines what it means to work ""full time"" so that it can force employers to provide workers with Washington-determined health benefits packages.Many states, however, believe that there are better ways to regulate labor relations in the modern economy. They are pursuing their own policy initiatives in areas like the minimum wage, right-to-work rules, and other issues related to the changing nature of work. As our economy changes, it is unlikely that inflexible federal rules will generate the best possible outcomes.As president, Governor Bush will work to ensure that federal labor regulations do not unduly restrict state flexibility in responding to the workforce demands of the new digital economy.As president, Governor Bush will work to ensure that federal labor regulations do not unduly restrict state flexibility in responding to the workforce demands of the new digital economy. Federal labor policy must not be an obstacle to the development of the innovative business models that characterize today\'s economy. The federal government must ensure that our state policy laboratories have ample flexibility to experiment with different models of labor regulation. This flexibility maximizes the opportunities for American ingenuity to flourish, helping the country achieve the growth necessary to afford economic opportunities to people at all levels of society.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"December 10, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: A Clear Choice on Protecting our Veterans',"b""In an astonishing statement, Hillary Clinton recently declared that the abuses and incompetency inside the VA Department that led to the deaths of thousands of veterans was not a widespread problem.Every American, especially the heroes who defended our nation and their families, should be outraged by Hillary Clinton's callous disregard for the inferior care that is being provided to our veterans. The VA scandal where veterans were put on waiting lists and denied care resulting in their deaths is one of the most glaring examples of an uncaring bureaucracy that I have ever seen. Even more disturbing is the fact that only three people have been fired and that the VA decided to hand out more than $140 million in bonuses this year.The incompetency at the VA is also on vivid display in Denver, CO where a new VA hospital that was supposed to cost $300 million has ballooned to nearly $2 billion. Is it any wonder that the American people are fed up with Washington, D.C. and no longer trusting in the ability of their elected officials to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars?When I become president of the United States, I will clean house at the VA and ensure that our veterans receive the quality health care benefits they have earned and deserve. Hillary Clinton may not think the scandals inside the VA are a big national problem. I couldn't disagree more.I recently unveiled a comprehensive plan to improve the performance of the VA and to ensure that veterans have more health care choices. Under my plan, more veterans could choose between receiving care at a VA hospital or using their benefits at another health facility. I believe strongly that giving veterans more choices and control over their health care will create competition that will result in the VA becoming better at providing services and more accountable.During my campaign for the presidency, I have met with countless veterans who have told me about their frustration in dealing with the VA. The status quo is clearly inexcusable and it must be disrupted by the next commander-in-chief. I have a proven track record of making government more efficient and accountable. In Florida, I turned the old order upside down and challenged entrenched special interests. I will do the same thing in Washington, D.C. and I will start first with the VA Department.I am honored to have been endorsed by over 75 prominent veterans nationally, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients and 30 former generals and admirals. These heroes are some of the most highly decorated veterans in America. They are supporting my candidacy because they know I will be a strong commander-in-chief who will rebuild our military, strengthen our standing in the world and defend our homeland. I am inspired by the sacrifices they have made for our nation and motivated by their valor to pursue reforms at the VA that will honor the service of every American who wore has the uniform of our armed services in service of our nation.Originally Posted on Townhall.com"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"December 13, 2015",b'Press Release - A Welfare Plan for Getting Americans Back to Work',"b""My fundamental belief is that every American has the God-given ability to achieve earned success and rise up the income ladder, as long as there is an environment that gives them the opportunity to do so. The problem is that for too long, a dysfunctional Washington has imposed rules and regulations that create additional barriers for people.To fix it, I am offering the most dramatic reform agenda of any campaign. Part of that means transforming the welfare system so that the dignity of work is given far greater value.Too many of our safety net programs are based on the mistaken belief that simply writing bigger checks will increase opportunity and upward mobility. Some of these programs actively discourage working-age people from getting a job, and Obama's policies have only made matters worse.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously called Food Stamps, grew by nearly 30 million recipients from 2000 to 2014. The number of non-elderly, able-bodied adults who receive SNAP went from 3.1 million in 2000 to 11.3 million in 2013. This is, in part, a product of weakened work requirements. Under the law, able-bodied adults without dependents are required to work fulltime, but in the age of Obama, most states have waivers from this requirement.Many low-income families are also eligible for federal housing assistance. With few exceptions, though, this assistance has no employment requirements at all. As a consequence, only half of working age, able-bodied adults who receive housing assistance earn the majority of their income through work.This isn't the way to alleviate poverty. Reducing poverty and expanding opportunity requires new policies rooted in conservative principles. That means fixing the nation's economy first and foremost, but it also means reforming welfare programs to actively encourage people who can work to get a job.Under my tax plan, a family of four earning under $40,000 would owe no income taxes. I would also expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), an effective anti-poverty tool that encourages low-income Americans to enter the work force.Our safety net programs should also have real, enforceable work requirements for able-bodied adults.Charlotte, NC began imposing work requirements in some public housing developments in 2014. Early evidence finds that the requirements successfully raised employment rates.The best example we have of the success of work requirements was the welfare reform led by Congressional Republicans in the 1990s. Policymakers replaced the permanent cash welfare program with a program based on the idea that work was the best way to permanently rise out of poverty, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).At the time, many on the far left claimed that the TANF would hurt recipients. They were wrong. Employment levels increased and child poverty rates fell dramatically following the enactment of TANF.Nearly two decades later, there is more work to do. In 2012, the official work participation rate for TANF recipients was only 34.4 percent. Twenty-three states failed to meet their work participation rate standards. Many states that technically meet the standards do so without actually improving workforce participation.In the coming weeks, I will release a detailed plan to empower welfare recipients. States will have more flexibility to target assistance and better help those in need. As part of this reform, work requirements will be strengthened to ensure federal tax dollars are used to help people rise out of poverty, not trap them in it.Originally Posted on The Nashua Telegraph"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"December 29, 2015",b'Press Release - Jeb: America Must Lead Against New Generation of Threats',"b'America is once again called to lead the world against a new generation of threats. When we call on our warfighters, we must make certain they have the tools equal to the task. From the terror attacks in San Bernardino and Paris and the carnage in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, to the invasion and occupation of Ukraine, to the growing Taliban and ISIS threat to Afghanistan\'s fragile stability, to aggression in vital waterways like the South China Sea and the Persian Gulf, the tenuous peace we have worked so hard to secure around the world is slipping into chaos.The peaceful international order America helped create at the end World War II, which endured despite Cold War tensions, was built on the foundation of a powerful American military, strong enough that no country dared test it.Today, in the wake of President Obama\'s devastating defense cuts, that military is atrophying. Longer deployments, equipment in disrepair, and too many missions done with too few resources are symptoms of an Armed Forces that needs a healthy injection of support. Our military needs more funding  no one can deny that  but we cannot and must not simply throw money at the problem.The Pentagon has grown thick with inefficiency and waste. The number of managers and administrators skyrocketed, even as the number of uniformed military personnel dropped. The time needed to design and field a new airplane has gone from a few months during World War II, to a few years during the Cold War, to several decades today.Large weapons programs have frequently been canceled, many of them ""5 yards from the goal line."" After billions were spent in research and development costs, programs like the Comanche Helicopter, the Army Future Combat Systems, and the Joint Tactical Radio System were deemed too costly without ever having been deployed.This is partly due to an unfettered passion for adding new military requirements. A ""requirement"" is a list of something that a new weapon must be able to do. Requirements for a new jet, for example, would list performance criteria like ""fly at Mach 2"" or ""carry 20,000 lbs of ordnance."" The lists were once simple. Today, as part of an unhealthy habit called ""gold plating,"" they have grown out of control. A request for a new service pistol, for example, recently came in at 350 pages. If the requirements for something as simple as a handgun clock in at longer than a Tom Clancy novel, imagine the list for a new nuclear missile submarine.Further, the way that the Pentagon allocates money is irrational. A study found that the Defense Department\'s logistics agency over-purchased equipment to the astounding tune of $7 billion dollars. One former Air Force officer told me that his squadron leadership would go on annual shopping sprees ahead of each fiscal year. Annual unit budgets were based on the prior year\'s spending, so the onus was on commanders to spend the same or more money each year. Otherwise, they\'d face a budget cut. Flat screen TVs, this officer told me, were an easy way to get squadron spending up. Brand new televisions would often replace sets purchased just 11 months earlier.The Pentagon is long overdue for reform, and we have a moral obligation to fix it. That\'s because the loser here isn\'t just the taxpayer. It\'s the soldiers with rifles in their hands and sand under their boots. Money needs to be spent intelligently and directed to our troops, who should never find themselves in desperate need of equipment that never made it to the front lines.Last month, I introduced my plan to reform the Pentagon and its wayward spending practices. It calls for fewer civilian bureaucrats to free up resources for more uniformed military personnel  including 40,000 new soldiers and 4,000 new Marines. It mandates reductions in overhead and administrative costs. It requires greater competition for new programs, because competition is a proven tool that keeps costs down.The plan would change the way we purchase equipment. It mandates a reduction in requirements for new equipment. Buying and flying a new jet, for example, shouldn\'t take more than 5-6 years. Upgrades can and should be made, but these can come after new equipment is already in service.Senator John McCain and Congressman Mac Thornberry, chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, have devoted serious study to these problems and should be commended for their work. That, perhaps, is the most important part of my plan. Recognizing the expertise and role of Congress, and working closely with leaders there, is the only way a new president can fix this mess. Come January 2017, I intend to do precisely that.Originally Posted on Military.com'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 2, 2016",b'Press Release - Jeb: Agriculture is the Foundation of America',"b'As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness."" Today, it is a great economic engine for our country.Millions of families rely on our farms and ranches for their well-being. Millions of our youth see it as their future, their opportunity to rise.In Florida, world-class agriculture is the second biggest industry in the state. Florida provides over 40 percent of the world\'s orange juice, and food production contributes over $100 billion a year to the state\'s economy.When I was governor of Florida, the state achieved 4.4 percent annual economic growth. Florida farmers did better, along with everyone else. Now, I have a plan for real, sustained 4 percent economic growth for the entire country.It starts with putting the interests of people in towns like Washington, Iowa in front of the special interests in Washington, D.C.In Iowa, it\'s been 15 years since middle-class families have gotten a pay raise, while Washington, D.C. has become a boom town. We need a president who can help farm families and rural America rise up.I think Washington can learn a few things from rural America  things like common sense, a respect for the land and love of country.These are rural values I share. Too many in Washington D.C. do not share these values. It\'s time for a change, and that\'s why I\'m running for president.Instead of suppressing farm production, we can strengthen rural America. Here is my plan to do that:Free us from the Chokehold of Federal RegulationsOverreaching federal regulations stifle the potential of American agriculture and make a mockery of state authority and private property rights. For example, the federal ""Waters of the United States"" rule is simply an illegal powergrab that demonstrates a gross lack of understanding about what it takes to run a farm or business. Worse, we now know that the federal governmentpresented the public with biased informationin order to force the rule through. Fortunately, a number of states are challenging this regulation in the courtswith some success.On day one of my administration, I will stop every single regulation in process. I will immediately begin a sweeping reform of federal regulations, including repeal of the most onerous Obama-era rules and regulations including the ""Waters of the United States"" rule and Dodd-Frank financial regulations. I will execute detailed plans I have already laid out to:free us from overbearing regulations;reverse the illegal federal powergrab of states\' rights; andloosen the tight grip on landsthat burdens ranchers in the West.Expand Trade and Open New MarketsWhen we compete on a level playing field, American workers and farmers win every time. More trade  and fairer trade  may be the single best way to increase prosperity in rural areas. Total U.S. agriculture exports were over $150 billion in 2014, accounting for a third of gross farm income. Over 50 percent of the world gets its corn from the United States. We supply 40 percent of the world\'s cotton. Almost 30 percent of its wheat. And the world will be asking for more. We\'ll have the potential to feed billions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and Africa over the next few decades.That\'s why I support trade deals that are good for American workers and farmers. For instance,unlike Hillary Clinton, I have consistently backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trade deals are not just about lowering trade barriers, boosting sales and creating jobs. They are about America playing a leadership role in setting policies that will shape the global economy.Lower TaxesUnder President Obama, Americans have now endured six years of tax increases, and yet the federal government still added $8 trillion to our debt.Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can\'t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Farmers and ranchers, in particular, are burdened by federal taxes if they wish to pass their operations on to the next generation. Mycomprehensive tax reform plandecreases tax rates across the board, establishing the lowest rate since President Reagan. Perhaps more importantly to farmers and ranchers, I would entirely eliminate the death tax.Renewable Fuels StandardThe law that was passed in 2007 has worked, look at the increase in production. It has been a benefit to us as we\'ve reduced our dependency on foreign sources of oil.We need to level the playing field for all sources of energy. As we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest and we ought to continue to innovate to create the lowest cost energy sources in the world. Ultimately if you can compete in an open market place, then you\'ll thrive, we need to make sure there is market access. I do think that phasing out, getting to a place where we don\'t pick winners and losers and we don\'t create mandates, over time, is the proper thing to do.2022 is the law and is probably the good break point.Agricultural InnovationToday the average American farmer is 15 times more productive than the average farmer in 1950. Farming is one of the most innovative sectors of our economy. We are still discovering what biotechnology can accomplish to increase yields and better meet the needs of consumers.Too often, the federal government chokes innovation through overregulation and high taxation. But the federal government also misses opportunities. The government spends too much, but it also spends too much on the wrong things. Research, including agricultural research, is undervalued. For instance, the federal governmentspent $80 million last yearon employees to sit at home and do no work. Some of that funding would have been better spent pursuing breakthroughs, such as the prevention of plant disease, in our agricultural research programs.On the Verge of our Greatest TimeIf we get a few big things right, we are on the verge of the greatest time to be alive. But, under President Obama, Washington is standing in the way. We need a president who makes it easier, not harder, for people to rise above their current condition. That includes getting Washington D.C. off our backs, expanding food markets, lowering tax rates and promoting innovation. Removing government barriers and opening up opportunity will offer every hardworking farming and ranching family the ability to achieve their dreams. That\'s what I will do as the next president of the United States.Originally Posted on TheIowaRepublican.com'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 4, 2016",b'Press Release - Drug Abuse: A National Epidemic',"b'Our country is in the midst of a massive heroin epidemic, compounded by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. Currently, this ""opioid"" abuse crisis is affecting some regions of the country more than others, but the problem is spreading, particularly in less populated areas of the country. Heroin use has doubled in just the last 10 years, and deaths related to heroin have nearly quadrupled to 8,257 last year. In 2014, more Americans died from drug overdoses than during any other year on record.Huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, with Mexican drug cartels involved in the production, trafficking, and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs is contributing significantly to this problem. The Mexican cartels have dramatically increased their production of heroin. Most heroin available in the United States is smuggled across the border by the Mexican cartels. A cousin of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the fugitive head of the Sinaloa cartel, was recently convicted in New Hampshire on federal drug trafficking charges. While the conviction was related to cocaine, it illustrates the reach of the Mexican cartels, which have distribution networks throughout the United States.Beyond the Mexican cartels, abuse of prescription painkillers, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, is a contributing cause of the epidemic of heroin and fentanyl abuse, and a major concern in its own right. A staggering four in 10 Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription painkillers. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that more than two million Americans were abusing prescription opioid painkillers. Deaths in the United States due to prescription opioid painkillers have more than tripled over the last 15 years. Half of the young people addicted to heroin started with a prescription painkiller. Four out of five heroin users previously used a prescription painkiller for non-medical reasons. The epidemic affects both genders, persons of all races, all ages and all income levels.While the heroin/prescription pain killer crisis is nationwide, New Hampshire is one of its epicenters. There were more than 300 drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire in 2014, with 99 of those deaths related to heroin (compared to 12 murders in the state). In one New Hampshire city, first responders treated individuals ranging from age 16 to age 69. The anguish and suffering for New Hampshire families is at an all-time high.Background: Failing current effortsIn 2010, the Obama Administration articulated a strategy from the Office of the National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) with seven goals for reducing illicit drug use. In a progress report this year, ONDCP noted that the federal government spends more than $26.3 billion on drug control programs annually. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent government watchdog tracking progress towards these goals, recently testified before Congress that the Obama Administration had made progress toward just one of these goals over the last five years, while ""none of the goals in the Strategy have been fully achieved."" Meanwhile, prescription drug abuse and heroin-related deaths have skyrocketed. The Obama ""strategy"" has been a failure.Of its total drug control program spending, the federal government invests nearly $12 billion a year on drug abuse prevention and treatment, but these efforts are divided among more than 76 programs in 15 different federal agencies. According to one study, at least 40 percent of these programs are not coordinating with other federal programs, leading to duplication and inefficiency in the fight against illicit drug abuse.Of the $12 billion spent on prevention and treatment, Medicare/Medicaid and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) invest the most. SAMHSA spends $2.2 billion out of its $3.4 billion total budget on substance abuse prevention and treatment. And despite all of this spending, 24 million Americans now use illicit drugs, an increase from 6.7 percent in 1990 to 9.2 percent in 2012.Congress has focused on increased funding for current efforts to fight the epidemic. The omnibus spending bill recently passed by Congress includes more than $100 million in additional funding to fight the opioid epidemic. These funds will strengthen drug control efforts through the Drug Enforcement Agency, the CDC, substance abuse treatment programs and drug courts. While this funding is an important step, real change must include reforms to ensure we do not just add more money to reinforce the failure of the status quo.Proposal: A comprehensive strategy Some government leaders label the drug epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex challenge. The demand for abused and illicit drugs must be addressed in tandem with arresting the supply of these drugs. Governor Jeb Bush believes we need a strategy that:1. Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins;2. Strengthens criminal justice;3. Secures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs; and4. Improves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs.Heroin and opiate-based pain pills are interrelated, and it is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. Presidential leadership is essential if the country is going to dramatically reduce drug abuse. As Governor, Jeb Bush used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use in Florida by approximately 50 percent among youth. As President, Jeb Bush will re-elevate the Director of the Office of the National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to a cabinet-level job and empower the ONDCP Director to coordinate the multi-disciplinary components of a national drug control strategy. The Director will evaluate and streamline current efforts, coordinate activities across the federal government, collaborate with the states and measure progress toward clearly defined goals.1. Prevent drug abuse and addictionInvest as children grow and develop: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in early childhood and be reinforced throughout middle and high school. That starts with dedicated parents and strong communities. It should be emphasized through locally-driven education system strategies (and many states are already taking the lead to promote drug education in schools). And current federal efforts must be better coordinated, improved with evidence-based models, coordinated with states and  most importantly  closely monitored for results. Strategies should include public and social media approaches with positive role models highlighting the dangers of drug abuse and addiction.Engage local community and private sector leadership: Federal and state governments must play a critical role in preventing and fighting prescription drug abuse, including the use of public education campaigns. However, the government cannot solve it all; the private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success. Coalitions organized by local communities should involve health, local law enforcement and social services professionals to play key roles in developing solutions targeted to unique threats that differ across urban and rural areas. In addition, critical private sector efforts include better training of health care practitioners, including physicians, nurses and dentists, and a review of current clinical guidelines for opioid prescribing. Americans make up approximately five percent of the world\'s population, but consume about 80 percent of the world\'s opioid supply. Organized medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, must engage so clinicians are properly trained to manage pain without overprescribing.Encourage Abuse Deterrent Formulations (ADF opioids) of prescription painkillers: Innovative pharmaceutical companies have invested in and developed opioid-based medications that reduce the risk of addiction and deter abuse (though may not fully prevent it). For example, an ADF may limit the drug\'s release if the pill is inappropriately cut, chewed or ground. As President, Jeb Bush will continue to encourage these innovations through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. In addition, his FDA will reduce generic opioids on the market that lack the abuse deterrence technology when an innovative company develops a formulation of the same drug with ADF. While ADF opioids are not a silver bullet, they can play an important role in a comprehensive strategy.2. Strengthen criminal justice Support law enforcement efforts: More than $14.8 billion in federal resources support federal, state and local law enforcement in the fight against drug trafficking and use. However, the percentage of federal drug control resources invested in supply reduction through law enforcement has dropped by six percent since 2007, while the supply of heroin from Mexico has substantially increased. Specific spending levels should be determined each year with law enforcement officials, but President Jeb Bush will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources to target illicit drug pipelines and supply chains.Coordinate the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Investigative Support Centers: The HIDTA program is a federally-funded effort coordinating federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies conducting drug-trafficking investigations. GAO has reviewed current efforts and found that they are not well-coordinated, leading to duplication, overlap of responsibilities and lack of focus. For example, different HIDTA partners write the same intelligence reports and investigate the same links between criminal organizations. As President, Jeb Bush will require all federal agencies involved in HIDTAs (including the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and ONDCP) to develop a process to coordinate efforts across agents in the field, monitor their progress towards drug control and evaluate results. This will reduce duplication of efforts across involved agencies and conserve staff and budgetary resources.Identify and shut down ""pill mills"": Pain clinics are health care facilities focusing on the management of chronic pain through a suite of legitimate medical treatments (both prescription and over-the-counter). Unfortunately, some of these clinics (often referred to as ""pill mills""), motivated solely by financial interests, are enablers of prescription drug abuse and addiction. In contrast to legitimate pain clinics, pill mills typically fail to maintain medical records, accept only cash payments and fail to screen for substance abuse issues. President Jeb Bush will support policies distinguishing pill mills from legitimate pain clinics and provide technical support to states in their role of exercising effective oversight of pain clinics. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi\'s work serves as a model on this issue. Florida was an epicenter of pill mills in 2010, but today the number of registered pain management clinics in the state has been reduced by approximately 60 percent. Her successful strategies include stronger state regulation of pain management practices, better oversight of physician dispensing habits, and a statewide Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).Enact smarter federal sentencing laws: Drug dealing is harmful to society and should be punished, but current federal drug sentencing laws are antiquated and often counterproductive. Prison time served by drug offenders has increased and nearly 50 percent of federal inmates are serving drug-related sentences, but  at the same time  illegal drug use has also increased. There should be stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities without serving excessive mandatory minimum sentences. This approach, whose champions include Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), will result in fairer drug abuse sentencing and will generate billions of dollars in savings (from reduced burden on federal prisons) to invest in drug prevention, treatment and recovery programs.Strengthen and expand access to drug courts: Drug courts provide an alternative to the traditional justice system so that nonviolent drug offenders are screened for risk, and then given the option to obtain treatment and recover under close court monitoring and supervision for at least a year. This restorative solution model involves multi-disciplinary coordination, including participation from the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. According to the GAO, drug courts result in a 26 percent lower rate of recidivism. Florida led the nation in creating drug courts; and as Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush tripled the number of drug courts in the state. As President, Jeb Bush will ensure this critical program is adequately funded to broaden access in every state.3. Secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United StatesSecure the border: In August, Governor Jeb Bush offered a border security plan with six concrete steps to strengthen border security. These will make a critical difference in interdicting the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. The plan includes a forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats, using new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border, bolstering border infrastructure, withholding federal law enforcement funds for cities undermining federal immigration laws and making sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. The full plan can be found here.Work with partner nations to address the source of illicit drugs: While the current ONDCP Strategy makes vague references to drug control efforts of major drug source and transit countries, there are few measurable action items to address it. Under President Jeb Bush, the United States will take an active role in training partner countries\' law enforcement officials to interdict illicit drugs and press the issue in high-level diplomatic conversations. These efforts should be targeted at countries with high rates of poppy cultivation and heroin production, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan. For example, President Jeb Bush will assist the Mexican government in dismantling and destroying the major drug trafficking organizations based in Mexico.4. Strengthen drug abuse treatment and recoveryBecause prescription painkiller abuse is closely related to heroin use, treatment and recovery efforts should address both epidemics.Strengthen Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs): States run PDMPs to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. They help identify inappropriate prescribing, abuse of controlled substances and patients who visit multiple doctors to abuse painkillers. However, these programs are not linked across states, and a drug abuser can drive across the border from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to obtain a new supply of prescription painkillers from a physician unaware of the patient\'s addiction. Under President Jeb Bush, these state databases will connect across state lines. Governor Jeb Bush has also promoted allowing electronic health care records to be shared among physicians and hospital systems (to make them ""interoperable""): The full plan can be found here.Promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools: Buprenorphene and methadone can help wean an individual from addiction to painkillers; naltrexone can block effectiveness of painkillers for abusers; and medical professionals and first responders need naloxone to save lives in emergencies by reversing the effects of severe overdoses. These are important tools in the fight against drug abuse and addiction, but more are needed. As President, Jeb Bush will promote innovation to fight against prescription drug abuse and heroin use. Governor Jeb Bush released his plan to promote innovation broadly through the FDA in October.Increase accountability for existing federal prevention, treatment and recovery resources: SAMHSA, whose mission is to advance the behavioral health of the nation, currently invests over 60 percent of its budget on prevention and treatment. However, GAO has evaluated SAMHSA\'s stewardship of federal dollars, particularly on mental health programs, and found poor oversight of current programs and limited coordination of efforts across the federal government. President Jeb Bush will conduct a rigorous evaluation and overhaul of existing programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs for states and to consistently measure and monitor results. Funding should support proven models, including community-based programs with peer counseling and recovery communities that provide ongoing support to individuals and families. In addition, he will review and streamline current programs across the federal government to reduce duplication of efforts and maximize impact.ConclusionDrug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. Existing federal efforts must be better coordinated, streamlined and monitored for results. This will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. We know how to make a difference in this fight, and with the right leadership and solutions, we will.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 5, 2016",b'Press Release - Addressing the Heartbreak of Addiction',"b""As a father, I have felt the heartbreak of drug abuse. My daughter Noelle suffered from addiction, and like many parents facing similar situations, her mom and I struggled to help.I have so many friends and know so many families who have faced this terrible challenge. Addiction crosses all barriers, all lines, all races and all incomes. It creates real hardship and heartbreak in families. And, it places substantial demands on government at every level.I never expected to see my precious daughter in jail. It wasn't easy, and it became very public when I was Governor of Florida, making things even more difficult for Noelle. She went through hell, so did her mom, and so did I.It's very debilitating when you have a loved one who is struggling, and you can't control it. You have to love them, but you also have to make it clear you cannot enable the behavior that gets them in trouble.Showing a lot of courage, Noelle graduated from drug court. Drug courts use a restorative solution model involving multi-disciplinary coordination, including the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. I was the proud dad that saw Noelle finish that. She's drug-free now.As Governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent. As President, I will lead this country to dramatically reduce drug abuse.The country's massive heroin and illicit drug epidemic is compounded and fueled by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. The problem is exacerbated by huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, primarily the result of Mexican drug cartels getting involved in the production, trafficking and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs.Some label the drug abuse epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex and heartbreaking challenge. It is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. To win this fight across the country, I believe we need a multi-faceted strategy that:Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins"""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 5, 2016",b'Press Release - Protecting the Second Amendment',b'Jeb will fight as hard as he can against any effort by President Obama to challenge our 2nd Amendment rights.'
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 5, 2016","b""Press Release - Barack Obama's Executive Orders Trample on the Second Amendment""","b""Barack Obama has proved again why he will go down as one of the most liberal and divisive presidents in the history of our nation. Obama's declaration that he will impose his gun control agenda by executive order shows an utter disregard for the Second Amendment as well as the proper constitutional process for making laws in our nation.Liberals like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton seize on every opportunity to advance a gun-grabbing agenda. After the ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Obama and Clinton called for sweeping gun control provisions that would trample on the Second Amendment. Recognizing that there is no chance to push their agenda through Congress, where even less liberal Democrats oppose their gun control policies, Obama has once again turned to unlawful executive orders to bypass Congress. Similar to his executive orders to grant legal status to millions of immigrants here illegally without securing the border or the support of Congress, Obama is now trying to do an end-run on the Second Amendment.When I am president of the United States, I will repeal Obama's anti-gun executive orders on Day One of my administration. I will oppose legislative actions that impose unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners, and I will nominate and fight for conservative judges who have a deep respect for the Constitution and the Second Amendment. With the next president possibly having the opportunity to nominate as many as four justices to the Supreme Court, the stakes in this election couldn't be higher for gun owners. Hillary Clinton will surely stack the federal judiciary with liberal judges who will chip away at the Second Amendment. We cannot give her that opportunity.The question facing Republican voters is who is the best candidate to take the fight to Hillary Clinton. No one has a stronger track record of standing up for gun owners and winning than I do. I am a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and as governor of Florida I passed several pro-Second Amendment pieces of legislation that made our state a national model for protecting and advancing gun rights. We were the first state to pass Stand Your Ground to enable citizens to defend themselves from attackers outside their homes. We also expanded concealed carry permits and provided reciprocity to gun owners in other states so they could carry while visiting Florida. As a result of our efforts to fortify Second Amendment rights of our citizens, Florida today has more concealed carry permit holders than any other state. I am proud of the fact that I earned an A+ rating from the NRA.I am equally proud of the fact that we proved in Florida that reducing gun violence and crime and respecting the Second Amendment can go hand-in-hand. Early in my first term as governor, I signed a law that imposed tough mandatory minimum sentences on felons who used guns in their crimes. The legislation, which was called 10-20-Life, put gun felons behind bars for 10 years if they brandished a firearm in the commission of a crime; 20 years if they shot the weapon; and life in prison if they shot and injured or killed another person. Together with other tough on crime strategies, 10-20-Life helped reduce gun violence in Florida by nearly 20 percent while bringing our overall crime rates down to a 35-year low.With radical Islamic terrorist organizations like ISIS using mass shootings like the ones in San Bernardino and Paris to wage jihad against America and our allies, I believe it is more important than ever to stand strong in defense of gun rights.The Second Amendment is the original homeland security act. Rather than taking guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens as Obama and Clinton would like to do, we should focus on keeping guns out of the hands of the terrorists who want to kill innocent Americans. My commitment to responsible gun owners is clear. As president of the United States, I will defend the Second Amendment, always.Originally Posted on The Cedar Rapids Gazette"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 8, 2016",b'Press Release - Empowerment Agenda for the 21st Century',"b'The federal government continues to waste hard-working taxpayers\' dollars while failing to help poor Americans rise out of poverty. The current welfare system is so broken that it not only fails those on welfare, but it contributes to a sense of unfairness among non-welfare recipients, who feel they work hard yet support a system that does not encourage work.Under President Obama, the weakest economic recovery since World War II has only made matters worse. Today, 6.8 million more Americans live in poverty than when President Obama took office. Nearly one-in-five households worry that the food they can afford will run out before the end of the month.Worse, economic mobility  the hallmark of a successful economy and the backbone of the American dream  is woefully low for poorer Americans. Over 40 percent of children growing up poor remain poor as adults. That is a rate of economic mobility no better than half a century ago  before the \'War on Poverty\' began.The facts show that economic growth is the best anti-poverty program we have. Under President Obama, the ""new normal"" of 2 percent economic growth limits opportunities for poor Americans  and Secretary Clinton only offers more of the same. That is why Governor Bush has developed a pro-growth economic agenda to fix our nation\'s broken tax code, end burdensome regulations and develop an energy policy that will meet the needs of a growing economy. The result will be 4 percent economic growth  double President Obama\'s dismal record  rising middle class wages and 19 million new jobs.Sustained, strong economic growth is only half of the equation for expanding opportunity and reducing poverty. To ensure all Americans have the right to rise, we must also develop policies that support the ingredients to permanently exiting poverty  work, family and education. Currently, our education system fails the poor and the nation\'s social safety net discourages work and weakens families. To fix our education system, Governor Bush has a forthcoming plan to close the opportunity gap and make sure all children have access to a quality education.Likewise, Governor Bush believes the nation\'s welfare programs need radical reformation. The only way forward is to start over and create a 21st century safety net. His empowerment agenda will fix the nation\'s safety net by:Giving Control Back to the States  The current one-size-fits-all approach to welfare policy gives Washington D.C. too much power and fails to meet the needs of impoverished families. That has to change. Governor Bush will eliminate bloated, destructive welfare programs and give control back to the states through a block grant so they can better meet the needs of poor families.Promoting Work  Too many of our safety net programs are based on the mistaken belief that simply writing bigger checks will increase opportunity and upward mobility. But we know that a job is the best way to improve the lives of poor individuals and families. Governor Bush\'s plan promotes work by ending program requirements that discourage work, requiring work for able-bodied welfare recipients and doubling working tax credits for childless filers (EITC). This will not only benefit welfare recipients, it will also ensure that hardworking Americans are no longer forced to subsidize those capable of work.Cutting Waste and Abuse  The nation\'s safety net is subject to considerable waste, fraud and abuse. This is unfair to the taxpayers who fund the program and to the poor families who need help. Governor Bush\'s plan cuts the waste and abuse in welfare programs by doing more to verify recipients\' income. His plan will also eliminate billions of dollars in wasteful spending by cutting federal administrative costs.Strengthening Families  The most effective anti-poverty program is a strong, two parent family. But today our welfare programs not only fail to promote marriage and the importance of two active and consistent parents in children\'s lives, they also have reduced efforts to ensure that single parents receive child support from absent parents. As president, Governor Bush will ensure that safety net programs encourage marriage. His administration will end welfare programs that penalize marriage and instead support marriage and parenting improvement programs. Governor Bush will also reinvigorate our nation\'s child support enforcement system to ensure hardworking single moms get the support they deserve.Failing the Poor: The Current State of the Social Safety NetThe lack of economic opportunity for impoverished Americans comes at a time when welfare caseloads are at an all-time high. In 2000, 17 million Americans received assistance from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps). Today, the number of beneficiaries has increased by nearly 30 million to over 46 million. In 2014, the federal government provided housing assistance for nearly 10 million Americans. And over 4 million Americans currently receive cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and related state programs.The nation\'s failure to reduce poverty is a consequence of a confusing, poorly designed social safety net. Our welfare programs fail to encourage work, weaken families, are rife with waste and abuse, and do not work well together.Problem #1: Programs Discourage WorkThere is no better way to eliminate poverty than through a good-paying job. A job provides money, as well as the necessary work and life skills needed to rise out of poverty. It sets an example for children, increasing upward mobility in the next generation. However, our social safety net shows a surprising disregard for getting people back into the workforce. This creates an unfair system where Americans not receiving assistance work hard to make ends meet, but those receiving assistance are not encouraged to work their way toward independence.Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program  SNAP is the nation\'s largest food security program. While the program alleviates poverty and reduces food insecurity, it does so at a very high cost to recipients. SNAP includes an effective tax on working where every extra dollar in earnings above certain levels reduces benefits by 24 cents. SNAP is supposed to require able-bodied adults without dependents to engage in full-time work. However, states with high unemployment rates have been granted waivers from this requirement. In 2015  more than six years since the official end of the recession  28 states plus Washington D.C. still have statewide waivers and an additional 13 states have partial waivers. These waivers help explain why only 16 percent of the 4.5 million households with able-bodied adults without dependents receiving assistance report any earnings.Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  TANF, the product of the bipartisan Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996, was successful in reducing poverty and promoting independence through a renewed focus on work and temporary assistance. Over the years, though, the program has become less concerned with getting people out of poverty and into work. There are work requirements in TANF, limiting assistance to families who do not enter the workforce after a specified amount of time. But, these work requirements are often too weak to effectively encourage recipients to find permanent employment. In 2012, the official work participation rate for TANF recipients was only 34.4 percent.Housing Assistance Programs  Poor families may be eligible for rental subsidies or federally financed public housing programs. With few exceptions, federal housing assistance does not require work. Like SNAP and TANF, housing assistance creates an implicit tax on working. For every dollar of earnings, benefits typically fall by 30 cents. That is one reason why only half of the working age, able-bodied housing assistance recipients receive the majority of their income through work.Problem #2: Programs Undermine FamiliesPoverty in the United States is heavily concentrated among single-parent families. Single-mother families are four times as likely to be impoverished as married couples. Over 60 percent of impoverished families are headed by single individuals, most of them women.[xiii] Yet, the nation\'s safety net programs fail to promote marriage and some actively discourage it.Single parenthood has an impact on the economic mobility of children as well. After controlling for demographics, young men (age 28-30) from intact families earn $6,500 more than other young men, while young women from intact families earn $4,700 more. Children of intact families are more likely to graduate from high school, and they work more hours once they enter the labor force. Single-parent families are much more likely to use federal assistance programs than married families.Too many of our nation\'s federal and state welfare policies impose financial penalties on marriage. Economists Adam Carasso and C. Eugene Steuerle have written, ""Most transfer programs for low-income families with children contain mainly marriage penalties  the additional income introduced by a spouse generally reduces or even ends benefits received before marriage.""While the welfare system discourages marriage, Governor Bush understands that marriage is not possible in every family. However, parents must still take responsibility for their children\'s well being. Single parents with custody of their children need financial support from the absent parent. Currently, too many hardworking single mothers are not getting the support they deserve.For poor families especially, child support collections are an important resource making up a substantial portion of their income. But the percentage of custodial mothers who receive support has dropped significantly over the past decade. A growing number of single mothers in poverty are not being served by child support services and are not getting the financial support they and their children need. In Florida, Governor Bush led efforts to nearly double child support collections in the state.Problem #3: Programs Waste Taxpayer DollarsTaxpayers\' money is too often wasted. In 2014, the Government Accountability Office estimated that 24 percent of the $60 billion in earned income tax credit (EITC) payments were improperly paid. Combined with housing assistance and SNAP, more than $18 billion in improper payments were made in 2014. This is unfair both to the hardworking Americans who deserve assistance and to the taxpayers who fund the program.The abuses go beyond improper payments. Legislation has also made it easier for states to increase SNAP enrollment to individuals with assets above existing limits.[xix] This means more SNAP dollars are going to those who can provide for themselves, wasting taxpayer dollars and creating more dependency.Problem #4: Programs Are Not CoordinatedThe nation spends over $400 billion annually on non-health related low-income assistance programs. Including health care programs, there are at least 82 different programs, and these programs often work against one another. This exacerbates the large work and marriage penalties found in many programs. Poor coordination also wastes taxpayer money by increasing opportunities for graft and abuse.Poorly-coordinated programs can be a barrier to rising out of poverty because ""benefit cliffs""  situations where public benefits decrease very quickly when a person\'s income rises by a small amount  discourage work and increased earnings. Funds restricted for use in one way are used to treat the assigned symptom, but too often, these interventions fail to take a complete view of a person\'s individual needs or develop a new path forward.Poor coordination among programs also magnifies marriage penalties. One study that examined multiple safety net programs found large marriage penalties for families across the income spectrum. A couple with two children with a household income of $20,000 faces a marriage penalty ranging from $1,800 to $8,900, depending on the state and the division of earnings.Empowering Families: Fixing the Safety NetThe nation\'s welfare programs are hopelessly broken. The programs fail to encourage work, hurt families and cost taxpayers billions of dollars in waste and abuse. We must do better. Governor Bush\'s empowerment agenda for the 21st century will end wasteful welfare programs, give power and money back to the states and empower recipients by focusing on work and families. His plan will create a safety net that protects hardworking Americans when they fall but no longer traps families in perpetual dependence. A safety net where work pays more than welfare, and power does not rest with Washington D.C. Giving Money and Control Back to the StatesGovernor Bush will replace the current major means-tested welfare programs with Right to Rise Grants to states. States will have the opportunity to develop programs and benefits that best meet the needs of their impoverished citizens. The grants will replace the following programs:Supplemental Nutrition Assistance ProgramTemporary Assistance for Needy FamiliesSection 8 Housing Choice VouchersSection 8 Project-Based Rental AssistancePublic Housing ProgramsThese programs amounted to nearly $130 billion in federal spending in FY2013, or 32 percent of the non-health anti-poverty budget. The grants will be given in proportion to how much a state and its residents currently receive from these assistance programs.Right to Rise Grants will give states more flexibility in how services and benefits are delivered. As the former governor of Florida, Bush understands first-hand that states are the laboratories of democracy. He implemented innovative reforms across the state\'s low-income assistance programs. For example, Florida received federal Medicaid waivers that allowed the state to increase choice and provide Medicaid recipients with more control over their healthcare. Providing states with more flexibility will open the door for transformative ideas to eliminate poverty and increase opportunity.Additional flexibility will also allow states to better target assistance. Each poor family faces unique circumstances and challenges. This is especially true across different states. Poverty in California looks different than poverty in Ohio or South Carolina, but our nation\'s current safety net insists on a one-size-fits-all approach. Under Bush\'s plan, states will partner with local government and community organizations to tailor programs that best meet the needs of their citizens.The grants will not be an open-ended entitlement to states. Instead, states will be required to meet several conditions before they qualify for the grants. States must:Identify Benchmarks for Success  Too many federal and state welfare program bureaucrats measure the success of their programs by the size of their caseloads. Instead, states will develop quantifiable goals based on how well their programs get people back to work and out of poverty. In addition, states will be expected to develop outcome-based goals to reduce out-of-wedlock births and promote marriage. To measure their progress, states will be expected to develop improved and streamlined records.Prioritize Assistance  These grants must primarily go to families living in poverty. States will not be permitted to redirect federal dollars to other projects unrelated to alleviating poverty. Likewise, states must not use these grants to offset existing state expenditures.Institute Real Work and Time-Limit Requirements  States will adopt strong work requirements and reasonable time limits for able-bodied adults. To ensure a robust safety net for those who have severe employment barriers and challenges, such as especially low skill levels, states will be permitted to exempt a minority of beneficiaries from these requirements. The reform will provide additional funding in the event of an economic downturn.The federal government will partner with states to ensure low-income families are not adversely affected during the transition to the new system. In addition, evidence suggests that residential mobility is important in expanding opportunities for low-income families.[xxiv] States will accordingly be encouraged to coordinate with each other to allow for greater portability of benefits.Most safety net programs were designed decades ago and have never been meaningfully reformed. Combined with Governor Bush\'s health care proposal, Right to Rise Grants will bring the nation\'s safety net into the 21st century. This holistic approach will encourage innovation among the states, allowing them to develop new technologies and approaches to eliminating poverty. The result will be a system better equipped to meet the immediate needs of recipients and improve economic mobility for low-income families.Promoting WorkFull-time employment is key to permanently exiting poverty. That is why Right to Rise Grants will include real work requirements for able-boded adults. Emphasizing work among recipients, though, is only half the answer. The plan will also make sure work pays for low-income families and individuals. Hillary Clinton and other democrats argue that we can increase take-home pay by simply increasing the minimum wage, but this only makes it harder for low-income Americans to find a job. Instead, Governor Bush will increase take-home pay by lowering taxes for working Americans.Governor Bush\'s tax plan will deliver immediate tax relief for working families. Under his plan, a married family of four earning under $40,000 will pay no income taxes. Single individuals will pay no income taxes on the first $15,000 earned. Businesses will have more incentive to invest and expand, ultimately leading to higher wages and more jobs.To further increase take-home pay, Governor Bush will expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The credit has been shown to be successful in getting people into the workforce. However, the credit currently offers meager work incentives for childless filers. Childless filers below age 25 are not eligible for the credit, and the benefit for childless filers ages 25 to 64 is capped at $503. Governor Bush will double the size of the credit for childless workers. This means childless workers will face a zero marginal tax rate when entering the workforce even after accounting for payroll taxes. The proposal will also expand the credit to younger filers who are not enrolled full-time in school.Eliminating Fraud and AbuseGovernor Bush will also adopt reforms to reduce the waste in safety net programs. With more than $18 billion in improper payments in EITC, SNAP, and housing assistance programs, there is no doubt that reforms are needed in their own right, and also to protect the budget.The EITC expansion will be paired with needed reforms to cut down on the waste and abuse of the credit. To ensure the credit is not abused, Governor Bush\'s tax plan will institute commonsense reforms, including:Verify Income  Some filers overstate or understate their income to maximize their credit. Currently, the IRS will often give refundable tax credits before even receiving tax forms that would verify a filer\'s reported income (e.g. W-2, form 1099), in essence creating an honor system. Governor Bush\'s plan will require the IRS verify a filer\'s reported income matches W-2s and other forms reported by employers and vendors. This will reduce overpayment and ensure filers only receive the credit they are eligible for.Check Other Assistance Programs  Records from other assistance programs can corroborate a tax filer\'s information. Evidence suggests that providing the IRS access to SNAP records could help identify filers who may have improperly claimed dependents. Under the Right to Rise Grants, states will be expected to maintain more detailed information on recipients. These records will be used by the IRS to further reduce improper EITC payments.Allowing SNAP and housing assistance to be eliminated will end the abuse and misuse of federal taxpayer money in these programs. By ending these programs and replacing them with Right to Rise Grants states will have the authority and incentive to eliminate the fraud and abuse endemic in existing programs. Taxpayer dollars are also wasted on expensive federal bureaucracies that administer these programs. By giving control back to states, Governor Bush will eliminate the need for these Washington D.C. bureaucracies  saving taxpayers money and furthering the governor\'s goal of cutting the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent.Strengthening FamiliesGreater flexibility for states, as well as a much stronger emphasis on work, will go a long way toward improving our nation\'s anti-poverty programs, but Governor Bush believes even greater gains will come when we have reestablished a societal norm centered on the importance of two active and consistent parents in the lives of children.There is a growing bipartisan consensus that a two-parent family is key to reducing poverty. A recent report by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution made it clear: ""Marriage is more than an instrumental good; it is more than a mechanism through which households receive two incomes. Marriage matters.""Twenty-five years of extensive research and evaluation have shown that marriage matters when it comes to reducing poverty and increasing opportunity. Children raised in married intact families do better than children raised in single parent families on a whole host of measures including graduation rates, criminal justice involvement and earnings as adults. But too often in discussions of poverty, this vital issue is left out of the discussion. It won\'t be in Governor Bush\'s Administration.In addition to reducing marriage penalties in welfare programs, Governor Bush\'s approach will have three main components:Promote Marriage  Governor Bush will promote marriage as the most reliable route to family stability and resources. As president, he will join with other political leaders, educators and civic leaders in being clear and direct about how hard it is to raise children without a committed co-parent. In the same way that leading institutions advise us to abstain from smoking, eat healthy foods, get plenty of exercise, read to our children, volunteer, and finish school, they should advise young people to postpone having a child until they have a stable partner and are ready to be parents.Develop Parenting Skills  Governor Bush will encourage parenting skills and practices, especially among low-income parents. In recent years, evidenced-based programs have shown success at improving outcomes for children by enhancing the parenting skills and practices of their parents. States will be encouraged to use a portion of their Right to Rise Grants to support and expand these programs.Invest in Future Fathers  Governor Bush will promote skill development, family involvement and employment among young men so that they can be better fathers. The governor recognizes that too often, our welfare programs have operated as if poor men and especially poor fathers were unneeded, or worse, unwanted. To reduce poverty through stronger families, Governor Bush will focus special attention on improving skills, labor force participation and parental involvement of young men so that they can be more reliable and effective fathers. This includes expanding the EITC to childless filers to promote work among young men.Invigorate the Child Support Enforcement System  As president, Governor Bush will help single parents who currently do not receive child support payments from absent parents. He will refocus the child support enforcement system on its core mission: the collection of child support payments  set at levels commiserate with the income of the absent parent. He will also extend the reach of child support by ensuring that single parent recipients of benefits provided from Right to Rise funding are referred to, and expected to cooperate with, child support enforcement efforts.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 12, 2016","b""Press Release - Jeb: Here's My Plan to Address the Monumental Threat of Cyber Attacks""","b""With alarming regularity, foreign-intelligence services, terrorist groups like ISIS, rogue hackers, and common thieves are conducting attacks against computer networks belonging to the US government and private companies, and against critical infrastructure like power companies, hydroelectric dams, and water-treatment plants.In the face of this threat, we can be certain of one thing: We can't trust someone as our next president who didn't take cybersecurity seriously when she was secretary of state.Sensitive US military networks have been targeted. Federal agencies have been hit. Local governments have been attacked. Voter databases have been compromised. Multinational companies, banks, casinos, health insurers, Hollywood movie studios, pharmaceutical manufacturers, Silicon Valley titans, online and brick-and-mortar retailers  the list goes on and on.It is said there are two types of companies: those that have been hit by a cyberattack, and those that don't yet realize they've been hacked.Virtually every aspect of our way of life in the 21st century depends on data stored in or communicated via the Internet; failure to secure it will harm all of us.Recent high-profile cyber attacks are another reminder that we are not keeping up with the growing threat, and there are thousands of more attacks that go unreported and unnoticed by the general public. I have a plan to address this growing threat.Cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the federal government, but the next president must harness an array of tools to confront this challenge. Without meaningful presidential leadership, there is little chance the US government, private sector, and international partners will coordinate effectively to secure the Internet. As president, I will ensure the private sector is provided the most current threat information, the best practices and standards to protect systems and critical infrastructure, and a legal framework that better allows it to defend itself.As with national security generally, cybersecurity has been undermined by a lack of leadership and by massive cuts to the US military and intelligence community imposed by Obama and Congress. The backbone of US intelligence efforts and frontline defense against cyberattacks are the talented intelligence professionals and law enforcement officers who work tirelessly in the shadows to identify, deter, and respond to cyber-attacks. They do not deserve to be demonized by the political class in Washington, but rather praised and provided with the capabilities and authorities needed to keep America safe.Although our military and intelligence community are often ahead of the cyberthreat curve, the rest of the government clearly lags behind, as thetheft of millions of documents from the Office of Personnel Management demonstrates. If it is to lead the way in addressing these threats, the federal government must put its own house in order, prioritizing to reflect the urgency and importance of protecting key databases and communications. Agency chiefs who fail to prioritize cybersecurity and poorly performing IT managers must be held accountable.Good cybersecurity is not just about technological solutions and physical improvements to firewalls, perimeters, and data links, but about the cultural and behavioral aspects of security. Just as preventative maintenance keeps our cars running, so too must we use best practices and vigilance to keep our networks secure and our data safe. The government has a role to play in promoting, and adopting, these best practices, and in helping to change the culture of complacency that makes us vulnerable.The average time lag between a cyber attack and when the attack is detected is roughly 200 days. We need to adapt our approaches to cybersecurity so we are more likely to detect an intrusion before it its too late. This means more regularly scanning networks, applying new technological tools to detect intrusions, and better sharing of threat signatures so an attack on one does not lead to an attack on many. Recently passed legislation to increase information-sharing between the government and private sector, and within the private sector, is a step forward but more needs to be done. Deterring attacks in the first place is as important than detecting them. We must increase the cost to those who are stealing our nation's intellectual capital and personal information. Exposing, sanctioning, prosecuting, and in some cases retaliating against these attackers will help deter other would-be attackers.Presidential leadership will be needed to encourage international partners to join us in writing international rules of the road and legal frameworks to facilitate prosecution of cybercriminals, who rarely operate solely within the physical boundaries of United States.We should pursue negotiations with foreign governments who have been known to conduct cyberattacks, as the Obama administration has done to discourage China hacking, but it would be nave to believe these countries will abide by such agreements unless we are willing to impose meaningful consequences. (Indeed, public reporting already suggests that Chinese industrial espionage has continued in spite of this recent agreement.)Effective cybersecurity is essential for our national and economic security. The next president will have to marshal public and private capabilities to ensure our critical infrastructure, networks, and communications are defensible and defended. In my administration, this will be a strategic priority, not a talking point. We will maintain our technological edge and return to a position of unparalleled leadership in the world.Originally Posted on Business Insider"""

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 15, 2016",b'Press Release - Jeb: Religious Liberty Must Be Respected and Protected',"b'This weekend, Americans celebrate National Religious Freedom Day, a day set aside each year to honor the right to freely exercise our deeply held religious beliefs. President Obama will follow precedent and issue a proclamation to mark this day on the calendar. But people who cherish religious liberty should harbor no illusions. This administration has been hostile to our first freedom at almost every turn.America has traditionally respected the role of faith in public life. We have respected the claims of conscientious objectors when laws put them at odds with their deepest convictions. We have worked with religious groups of all kinds that believe that taking care of the needy is part of their calling: from Jewish hospitals to Catholic soup kitchens. We have let spiritual leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. remind us that politics must aim at justice.I cherish this tradition and will uphold it as president. But it is a tradition with which too many progressives have grown uncomfortable.Under Obamacare, the administration has attempted to force almost all businesses and non-profit organizations  even religious charities and small businesses with religious owners  to cover the cost of contraceptives and abortifacients in their health plans. Many of these people of faith are fighting back, and rightfully suing for their freedom. The most high-profile case involves the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Obama administration wants to compel this group of nuns to include contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs among their health benefits  an absurd mandate that attempted to address a non-existent problem.People of faith are also being asked to compromise their beliefs on the issue of marriage. While people of good will have different opinions on same-sex marriage, in a nation as large and diverse as ours, we ought to be able to find sensible compromises that accommodate bakers and florists and photographers who choose not to participate in weddings they find objectionable. The liberal Left in America, however, is unwilling to practice this kind of tolerance.With many of these battles over religious liberty ultimately finding their way to the federal courts, the stakes in this upcoming election couldn\'t be higher for religious liberty. The next president could have the opportunity to appoint as many as four justices to the Supreme Court. There should be no doubt about where Hillary Clinton stands on religious liberty. In a speech last year, she said that religious teachings must change to favor abortion. In her words, ""deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed"" for the sake of giving women access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. Whatever our views about abortion  and there are people of good will on all sides  we should be able to agree that no politician should be telling churches, synagogues, and temples what they should think about it.Someone who does not understand that basic point cannot be trusted to protect religious liberty, and cannot be trusted to appoint judges who will protect it.So long as we respect religious liberty, it is appropriate for faith to inform our political convictions. My own faith certainly guided me as I worked to expand educational opportunity, improve public safety, provide help to victims of domestic violence and drug abuse, reform our care of people with developmental disabilities, and promote a culture of life. I am proud that when I was governor, the abortion rate in Florida fell twice as fast as it did in the nation.As president of the United States, I will be guided by the same principles. I will seek to limit government, honor the rights of conscience, and help those in need. I will nominate and fight for judges who will protect our constitutional rights, and who understand that Americans\' freedom isn\'t jeopardized by menorahs at City Hall  it\'s jeopardized by a government that seeks to override our conscientious convictions.Too many of our political leaders are turning away from our distinctly American tradition of religious freedom. That\'s why it\'s important to stand up for it. No other candidate running for president has a stronger record on religious liberty than I do  and no one is more eager to defend it from Hillary Clinton and others who don\'t see its value.Originally Posted on National Review'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 17, 2016",b'Press Release - Restoring the Right to Rise through a Quality Education',"b'Every individual in this country has the right to rise. Yet today, the American Dreamthe idea that anything is possible through hard workis threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success. Choice, innovation and transparency have transformed practically every part of our lives, and yet our schools remain artifacts of another century.Governor Bush\'s goal is to ensure that all Americans, no matter their background or zip code, graduate from high school, college and career ready, and have the opportunity to pursue affordable post-secondary education or training. Achieving this goal requires a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students. Empowering individuals doesn\'t require additional money or programs designed by Washington. What we need is a national focus on fueling innovation and providing quality choices for every student in this country.Governor Bush\'s plan is budget neutral but will dramatically improve educational opportunities in America. Rather than spending more, this plan consolidates current programs, eliminates waste and returns power back to states, local districts and families. In fact, this plan reduces the size of the federal Department of Education by approximately 50 percent.Governor Bush has an unmatched record of reforming education to improve results. As governor of Florida, he expanded choices for families, increased transparency on the quality of schools, and increased student achievement across the board, particularly among minority and low-income students. The only thing he needed from Washington bureaucrats was for them to stay out of the way. As president, he will return power to families and states. This platform reflects the fundamental belief that every student can learn and that parentsnot bureaucratsshould make decisions for their child. It gives students and families real choices, the resources they need for a strong start in life, and the information they need to make critical decisions.Governor Bush\'s education reform agenda is guided by four core principles:Education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible. The federal role in education should be limited, and should respect the decision-making power of parents, teachers, schools, and local and state officials.Choiceof all kindsshould be expanded across the board. Choice fuels innovation and competition in the education market, resulting in a greater diversity of options for students and teachers, and ultimately better results. Choice goes beyond just choosing a school. It also means being able to tap into opportunities to learn outside the traditional classroom. Rather than having the students fit into the ""system,"" we need to empower individual families to find the learning environments that best meet their unique needs.Transparency is essential to choice, quality and results-based accountability. Parents and students need information to make good choices; teachers need information to improve their teaching; and policymakers need information to ensure scarce resources are invested in what works. Information should be used as a flashlight to guide progress rather than simply as a hammer to punish failure.Innovation requires flexibility. In exchange for choice and transparency around outcomes, we should reduce the number of rules and requirements tied to federal dollars. These rules simply drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources and preventing innovation. We need to empower educators to use their passion, creativity and energy to transform education.Supporting Lifelong EducationIn our increasingly knowledge-based economy, all Americans need a quality education that equips them with the skills to succeed. Understanding that many families invest in their children\'s education well before college, Jeb\'s plan allows for the conversion of 529 college savings accounts into Education Savings Accounts. These accounts would allow families and individuals to save tax-free for lifelong education, including for pre-K, elementary school, high school, college, job training, tutoring, summer school or online classes. Relatives, employers, and other non-relatives would also be able to contribute to these accounts. As they currently do with 529 college savings plans, states would choose whether to offer Education Savings Accounts and would continue to oversee these savings plans.To help low-income families save for their children\'s education, Governor Bush would foster charitable giving directly to the Education Savings Accounts of low-income children by making those contributions tax-deductible. If the full amount of funds in an individual\'s account isn\'t spent, that individual can pass the funds down to their child.Early Childhood EducationDespite spending roughly $22 billion each year on early childhood through approximately 44 different programsmore than the federal government spends on low-income students in K-12too many low-income children are unprepared for Kindergarten. In order to ensure that those dollars are spent directly on children\'s education, rather than wasted on bureaucracy, Governor Bush would allow states to return these funds directly to parents and let them choose the type of education that their children actually need (day, night, weekends, center-based, home-based), rather than the type a bureaucrat is offering. Giving families choice will ensure each child\'s unique educational needs are met, as well as fueling a focus on results, innovation, transparency and accountability in early childhood education. This new system would be optional for statesstates could choose to opt-in or they could maintain the status quo and continue to participate in the fragmented menu of programs and services available from the federal government.In the states that choose to participate, Governor Bush\'s plan would consolidate existing federal early childhood funds and deposit $2,500 annually in the Education Savings Accounts of low-income children under the age of five. Participating states would create and execute a plan for regulating, evaluating and holding providers accountable for high educational quality, and ensuring parents have critical information on program quality and outcomes. States may (and would be encouraged to) contribute additional state and district funds to each child\'s account, facilitating seamless coordination with the significant state early childhood investments already in place. In most cases it will require more than the federal dollars to ensure adequate funding for a strong start for low-income childrenthe federal investment is intended to be supplementary to state, local, and family expenditures, just as it is for the education of children from low-income families in K-12 and post-secondary. Unspent funds would grow within the Education Savings Accounts and could be spent on K-12 education expenses, college tuition or postsecondary training.K-12 EducationOur primary and secondary schools have failed to keep up with the increasing knowledge and skill demands of the competitive 21st century global economy. We need a system that meets the unique needs of students through a diverse set of educational options with strong accountability for results. This is best achieved through empowering those closest to studentsparents and teachersto make decisions and returning the funding and accountability decisions back to states and local school systems. The states must continue to be the laboratories for change while the federal government\'s role should be limited and focused on responsibilities for which it is uniquely suited. The federal government cannot run or fix schools from Washington, but it can make it easier for families, educators and entrepreneurs to reform education.The proposals below are designed to be budget neutral and return power and decision-making to the states and citizens. To leverage the limited, but critical role of the federal government to create the conditions necessary for every child to graduate from high school prepared for the demands of college or the workplace, Governor Bush would:Empower parents and students with quality optionsSupport states with the flexibility and resources to create great schoolsReward great teaching and successful student outcomesGive parents, teachers and taxpayers the information they needDrive innovation and research to break the stranglehold of the status quoEmpower Parents And Students With Quality OptionsSupport Charter School Expansion: There are nearly a million students languishing on waitlists around the country, hoping for the opportunity to go a charter school. Governor Bush would do everything within his powerfrom using the bully pulpit and reducing regulations and restrictions to increasing fundingto support charter school expansion and success so that more students around the country have the school options they want, need and deserve. Specifically, Governor Bush proposes doubling federal support for charter school expansion to meet the high demand of students on wait lists around the country.Strengthen Educational Opportunity in D.C.: In order to improve education in our nation\'s capital and give more families the opportunity to attend a school that best fits their needs, Governor Bush would ensure continued funding for the three-sector strategy which supports public, charter and private school options, and strengthen the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.Support States With The Flexibility and Resources To Create Great Public SchoolsDefend State Control Of Education: Governor Bush would continue to build on Congress\' recent restoration of state control over accountability decisions and would ensure the federal government does not interfere with state decisions related to academic standards, content or curriculum. The federal government cannot, and should not, impose a one-size fits all model of anything on states. As the newly reauthorized Every Student Succeeds Act reinforces, states need to be held accountable for serving their citizens, not federal bureaucrats. This fundamentally conservative approach must be expanded to every part of education, not just accountability systems. States are best positioned to decide how to serve every student and family; the federal government must make it easier for states to do this, not create more rules, burdens and programs.Increase State Flexibility & Allow States To Expand Choice For Disadvantaged Students: Governor Bush would block grant Title I dollars to states to give them the flexibility and resources needed to expand student choices and innovate to better serve low-income students. He would also allow states to make Title I portable so that federal funds can follow low-income students to the school, course or program of their choice. States could deposit these funds directly into students\' Education Savings Accounts or use them to expand school choice in other ways. Allow States To Make Federal Special Education Funds (IDEA) Portable: Instead of forcing parents to fight in court for the right to send their special needs student to a different school, Governor Bush would give parentswith state approvalthe federal dollars allocated to their special-needs child. Parents could then use those fundsmade available through an Education Savings Account or a state choice systemto pay for the education that best serves their child\'s needs.Reward State Success: Rather than dictating specific reform prescriptions from Washington D.C., Governor Bush proposes giving low-income and high needs schools the chance to earn additional dollars based on their ability to improve student outcomes. Rewarding performance will create incentives for schools to think more creatively about innovating in education in order to capture the additional dollars by improving performance goals. More importantly, it gives complete flexibility for schools to achieve the outcomes however they see fit and ensures the federal government pays for success, not just promises. States are the laboratories of innovation, and rewarding success instead of applying punitive regulations and bullying from D.C. will drive reform around the country.Reward Great Teaching And Successful Student OutcomesSupport Great Teaching and Ensure The Neediest Benefit From The Best Teachers: Teachers are our most valuable resource. To support great teaching, Governor Bush would block grant Title II funds and give states the option to spend those funds on rewarding top teachers in a state\'s lowest performing schools; recruiting new talent to the teaching profession; or creating individual training accounts that teachers can use to further their own professional. Just as school choice allows students to receive the education best suited to their needs, giving teachers more choice over professional development would allow them to receive training tailored to their needs. States would need to evaluate and demonstrate the positive impact of their approach on student outcomes.Give Parents, Teachers And Taxpayers The Information They NeedPublicly Report Critical Student Outcome Measures: Transparency is the most basic form of accountabilityparents, teachers and taxpayers need information to evaluate their schools and make informed decisions. ESSA will ensure that there is richer information on student achievement available to the public than ever before, but much more must be done to provide taxpayers, policymakers and parents actionable information beyond static test scores. Rather than having states bury information in warehouses or state websites, Governor Bush would require states to ensure every citizen receives a complete, useful and timely picture of student achievement, system progress and finances in their schools.Guarantee Parent and Teacher Access to Information: Governor Bush would ensure that every parent is given their own child\'s information in a timely, contextual, useful format, as well as information on the quality of schools and programs available to their family. Every teacher should also receive information on the students enrolled in their classes before they show up for the school year.Safeguard Student Privacy: States must prioritize the safeguarding of student information through strong governance, use of best practices in information security and privacy protection and increased training and communication around data protection. Parents should be able to trust that their child\'s information is being safeguarded and used in appropriate ways.Drive Innovation and Research To Break The Stranglehold of the Status QuoSupport Next Generation Education Models: Every part of our lives has been transformed by technology and information; yet, today\'s students ""receive"" education in the same passive manner that their grandparents did. In order to encourage innovation and play a trust-busting role, Governor Bush would support states\' creation and scaling of innovative school models such as online, blended and competency-based learning models.Invest in Research, Development and Dissemination: Governor Bush would invest in researching what is working in education around the country and disseminating that information to ensure that leaders and educators in every state and district can learn from the successes and failures of others.Post-Secondary Education & TrainingEducation after high school has become critical to upward mobility, yet post-secondary education and training has become too expensive for many Americans to afford, not to mention the quality of degree and certificate programs varies dramatically. Students lack the information to identify colleges that are worth the investment, and more than 40 percent of those who start a program fail to finish one in six years. Increasing numbers of student loan borrowers struggle to repay their debts. Simply spending more federal money will not solve these problems. Existing aid programs give institutions every incentive to enroll students at high tuition prices and less incentive to make sure they are equipped to succeed. While advances in technology and new models of education could create a wider array of affordable, effective options, regulatory barriers to entry keep new competitors out. To fix these problems, Governor Bush would implement a new system that will:Ensure Flexible Access to Post-Secondary Education and Training with Education Savings AccountsDrive Down Costs and Hold Post-Secondary Institutions AccountableExpand Student Access To Innovative New Types of Education and TrainingGive Students and Families the Information They Need To Make Good DecisionsHelp Existing Borrowers Successfully Repay their LoansEnsure Flexible Access to Post-Secondary Education & Training with Education Savings Accounts:A vibrant future for all Americans requires every single one of our citizens to be a skilled and contributing member of society. In our increasingly skilled economy, a successful career requires education and training beyond high school. That may come in the form of apprenticeships, short-term programs for career preparation, micro-credentials, or more traditional two-year or four year collegesbut everyone needs access to postsecondary training. And they need options that fit their needs and goals. Many students cannot afford to drop everything and enroll in a traditional college for multiple semesters. They would prefer to jump in and out of programs to gain the skills they need, when they need them.To ensure flexible access to post-secondary education and training, Governor Bush would consolidate all current funding and replace the confusing, burdensome federal loan program with an entirely new, income-based financing system that gives students ownership and the flexibility to plot their own individual educational path. This new financial aid system would eliminate FAFSA, the confusing financial aid application process, and remove the menace of accumulating interest, default, damaged credit and collections agencies. It would ensure that repayment is predictable and affordable, protects students during periods of unemployment or underemployment, and eliminates defaults. It would encourage low-income students to aim high and invest in their future, and give students ownership of their student aid, incentivizing them to be cost-conscious and spend funds carefully over the course of their education, which will help bring down the spiraling cost of post-secondary education.Specifically, Governor Bush would provide all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit (similar to the amount currently available for independent undergraduates) through their Education Savings Account. Recipients would be able to use the funds to pay for a wide-range of educational and skill building programs over the course of a lifetime, with sensible first year spending limits. Unlike the federal contributions to Education Savings Accounts for low-income students (early childhood, K-12, Pell Grants) which come with no repayment obligation, every student accessing the $50,000 line-of-credit would repay by contributing a percentage of their incomes proportional to the amount spent1% for every $10,000 spentthrough their federal income taxes for 25 years. No student, no matter how successful, would repay more than 1.75 times the amount spent. As they do currently, students will have to make satisfactory academic progress to maintain access to funds. To help students navigate their educational finances, Governor Bush would incorporate financial education into all aspects of the program\'s management.Low-income students, in addition to the $50,000 line of credit, would also have access to an improved need-based Pell Grant through their Education Savings Accountso that every student, regardless of income, knows that college is within their reach if they work hard. For children under 18, eligibility would be assessed through their parents\' tax returns. Students would be notified of likely eligibility in 8th grade, and the total grant amount would be credited to their Education Savings Account over the course of high school. Once students graduate from high school, they would be able to access a portion of the total grant amount each year to spend on educational and skill building programs. Low-income adults without a postsecondary degree could become eligible for grant funds by completing a simple application when they file their taxes.Dual-Enrollment: In order to support student efforts to save themselves time and money, Governor Bush would allow students to use a portion of their line-of-credit or grant to pursue postsecondary worksuch as AP classes, college credits and industry certifications etc.while still enrolled in high school, provided they meet certain performance benchmarks. Drive Down Costs and Hold Post-Secondary Institutions AccountableAmerica has some of the best colleges and universities in the world but our higher education system is increasingly unaffordable for most Americans and too often doesn\'t prepare students to succeed in the workforce, raising important questions about institutional accountability. To protect students and taxpayers, drive down costs and ensure Americans are getting real value for the money they spend on higher education, Governor Bush would give colleges and career training programs ""skin in the game.""He would put all institutionscolleges, universities, workforce training programs, apprenticeship etc.on the hook for a portion of the federal funds students spent at that institution and were unable to repay. Giving colleges ""skin in the game"" forces institutions to share the risk of failure with students and taxpayers, incentivizing them to increase the value of their programs by reducing costs and boosting quality, and ensure that students graduate with the skills to succeed in the workforce. Institutions whose students chronically fail to repay their obligations would also lose eligibility based on a new and more rigorous performance standard. To ensure colleges maintain access for low-income students, colleges will receive bonuses for every low-income graduate.Expand Student Access To Innovative New Types of Education and TrainingMany students cannot afford to drop everything and enroll in a traditional college for multiple semesters at a high price tagthey would rather get recognition for what they learned on the job or in the military and/or pursue the skills they need for career-advancement as quickly and affordably as possible. New models of educationlow-cost course and assessment providers; exam-based certifications of learning; targeted, short-term programs for career preparation; and apprenticeship modelsoffer alternative and often less expensive routes to develop skills with great labor market value. Unfortunately, students are currently unable to use their federal aid at many of these programs, making these successful new options unaffordable for most students.Governor Bush would allow students to spend Education Savings Account funds at a broader set of postsecondary organizations  prior learning assessments, short-term occupational training, industry certifications, apprenticeships etc.  that have demonstrated positive student outcomes. New providers will gain incremental access to federal student aid based on their rates of student success (completion, licensure/certification passage rates, labor market outcomes). Initially, providers would have no access to federal funds upfront, but would be reimbursed based on their rates of student success. Over time, successful providers could gain full access to Education Savings Account funds based on their performance. New, independent quality assurance organizationsemployer groups, industry associations, nonprofitswill be granted the authority to oversee the process and make eligibility decisions in exchange for more accountability and transparency.Give Students and Families The Information They Need To Make Good DecisionsToday, prospective students lack the information they need to choose the school or program that is best for them. To ensure that students have the information needed to evaluate schools and training programs, Governor Bush would incentivize the creation of state databases that make information on student outcomes on the program level (retention, completion, unemployment, earnings, etc.) available to the public. He would do this by making receipt of federal student aid at institutions within a state contingent on the state creating this database, and by making federal information on repayment rates, loan performance, and graduation rates available to states and other third parties. This information is already being collected at the state and federal level, and should be made available to students and families while ensuring the privacy and security of student information through strong governance, use of best practices in data security and privacy protection, and increased training and communication around data protection.To guarantee that students actually receive this critical information, Governor Bush would require students to verify they have received it from the program they plan to enroll in before they can spend the money in their Education Savings Account.Help Existing Borrowers Successfully Repay Their Loans:While Governor Bush\'s income-based repayment model will eliminate debt balances, interest and defaults for all future students, there are millions of Americans currently struggling to repay their debtor already in default with disastrous consequences for their ability to buy a car, a home, start a business or get a job. For those students, Governor Bush proposes the following reforms to ensure they successfully repay their loans:Allow borrowers with existing debt to transfer into Governor Bush\'s new financing system and repay their outstanding debt with a percentage of their income.Facilitate struggling borrowers movement into the existing REPAYE program. Millions of people continue to default and ruin their credit despite existing options for income-based debt repayment due to various administrative and informational barriers.Allow all borrowers to extend debt repayment period up to 30 years to reduce the monthly burden of student debt and lower the risk of default.Make federal debt collection more transparent, simple and fair while intensifying efforts to move borrowers into income-based repayment when they first miss payments.Task the Department of Treasury with managing the $1.2 trillion in outstanding federal loans to mitigate the financial risk to our nation\'s fiscal stability.Make it easier for private student debt to be discharged in bankruptcy.ConclusionReaching our goal of four percent annual growth requires providing every individual in this country with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy. We know how to do this. Jeb\'s record in Florida proves that when we empower families with quality learning options and the means to access them, student achievement increases. Making America\'s education system world class is not only an economic imperative, it is a moral one. We can change the trajectory of our nation\'s future as well as the lives of individual students. There is nothing more important to the right to rise than a world-class education. Our children deserve one.'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 18, 2016",b'Press Release - African-Americans for Jeb',"b'This morning, Governor Bush rolled out his education policy which aims to give access to a quality education to every child, an issue he strongly believes is the civil rights challenge of our time.

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 18, 2016",b'Press Release - A Blueprint for a 21st Century American Education System',"b'Every individual in this country has the right to rise. Yet today, the American Dreamthe idea that anything is possible through hard workis threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success.Too many low-income students start kindergarten already years behind their more affluent counterparts. Only one-third of students graduate high school prepared for college or a good career. And our higher education system has become too expensive for many Americans to afford.To achieve equal opportunity and increased economic growth, we must provide every child the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy.As the nation honors Dr. Martin Luther King and his legacy today, I firmly believe that ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time.Achieving these goals doesn\'t require additional money or programs designed by Washington. That\'s why my plan is budget neutral and returns power to states, local school districts and parents. My plan requires a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students and is based on four conservative principles: 1) education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible; 2) choice of all kinds should be expanded; 3) transparency is essential to accountability; and 4) innovation requires flexibility.Understanding that many families invest in their children\'s education well before college, my plan allows for the conversion of 529 college savings accounts into Education Savings Accounts. These accounts would allow families and individuals to save tax-free for lifelong education, including for pre-K, elementary school, high school, college, job training, tutoring, summer school or online classes. We\'ll make charitable donations to the ESA\'s of low-income children tax-deductible.To give low-income children a stronger start in life, we will consolidate the roughly $22 billion annual federal dollars spent through 44 disjointed programs, and allow states to deposit $2,500 annual scholarships in the ESA of every low-income child under five so their parents can choose the type of education services and care their children need to flourish.To leverage the limited role of the federal government to improve all schools, we will take four main steps. First, we will dramatically expand choice by doubling support for charter schools; strengthening the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program; and making federal aid to low-income (Title I) and special needs students (IDEA) portable, so states can give scholarships directly to those students to attend the school of their choice.Second, we will require states to ensure every citizen receives a complete picture of student achievement, system progress and finances in their schools. Parents, teachers and taxpayers need information to evaluate their schools because transparency yields better results.Third, we will empower states with the flexibility to improve their schools, while ensuring the federal government does not interfere in academic standards, curriculum or content. Right now, too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources. We need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students.Fourth, we will focus on teachers. We will give schools whose teachers achieve good results for low-income students more money, incentivizing and rewarding success. And, we will foster excellent teaching by helping states reward the best educators, recruit new talent and improve professional development.To drive down college costs and ensure every student is getting value for the dollars invested in his or her education, we will also restructure our higher education system in four main ways.First, we will create state databases so every student can see the average unemployment rate, earnings, graduation rates and debt repayment rate of programs they are considering. We need students to be able to judge the cost and quality of programs so they can make better choices and hold schools accountable.Second, we will give colleges and career training programs ""skin in the game,"" putting them on the hook for a portion of the federal funds their alumni are unable to repay.This will incentivize them to reduce costs and ensure that students graduate with the skills needed to succeed.Third, we will expand access to innovative new providers based on their rates of student success. Innovation has the potential to transform higher education and dramatically increase access and drive down costs while giving students a wider variety of options that fit their needs and budgets.Finally, instead of the current burdensome federal loan system, we will give all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit through their Educative Savings Account (ESA) to pay for college and career training. For every $10,000 spent, students would repay 1 percent of their income for 25 years. This ensures affordable repayment, removes risk of default and protects students during periods of unemployment, while the ESA structure gives students flexibility and the incentive to be cost-conscious. In addition, low-income students would have access to an improved need-based Pell Grant through their ESA.To help borrowers with existing debt, we will allow them to transfer into the new income-based repayment system. And, for those who chose not to, we will make federal debt collection more transparent, simple and fair; allow private student debt to be discharged in bankruptcy; extend the debt repayment period; and ease transition into the existing REPAYE program.I know what needs to be done. As governor of Florida, I increased student achievement across the board, particularly for those most at risk, and as president, I will do the same.Making America\'s education system world class is not only an economic imperative, it is moral one as well.'"

Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 22, 2016",b'Press Release - Jeb: As President I will Move to Protect More Unborn Children from Abortion',"b'Forty-three years ago on January 22, the Supreme Court took the issue of abortion out of the people\'s hands in order to impose its own view. It swept away the laws of all fifty states, inventing a right to abortion that could not be found in the Constitution.Even many pro-choice legal scholars have criticized that decision, admitting that the Constitution clearly allows states to enact protections for the unborn. And so Friday\'s March for Life is also a march for democracy: for the right to use democratic means to advance justice.I applaud the marchers, and even more I applaud their noble cause.I strongly believe that we should build a culture that respects the dignity of all human life from conception to natural death.As president, I would move, through patient persuasion, toward protecting more and more unborn children from abortion. Many of my fellow citizens disagree with that goal, of course, but I think most Americans can agree that we should at least protect unborn children at 20 weeks of development, when they may be able to feel pain.In an age when parents and grandparents post sonogram pictures of their unborn children to their Facebook pages, and modern medicine allows doctors to save premature babies born earlier than we ever thought imaginable, most people understand that these are young lives worthy of our protection. Nearly all European countries protect children at this late stage of development, and it is time we joined them.I believe, as well, that taxpayers should not be the largest source of funding for the organization that performs the more abortions than any other entity in our country.When I am president, we will reinstate the rule that family-planning money goes to organizations that do not perform abortions. Americans who oppose Planned Parenthood should not be forced to fund it.I used persuasion and incremental change to build a culture of life in Florida. We banned partial-birth abortion and required parental notification before minors could have abortions. We forced abortion clinics to abide by basic health and safety standards for women.We required that women considering abortions after their first trimesters be allowed to review ultrasound images.We supported crisis pregnancy centers, so that pregnant women in difficult circumstancestoo often lacking support from the fathers of their childrenwould have the material and emotional help they need. Some of the funding for these groups came from Florida\'s ""Choose Life"" license plates: something I am proud to say I was the first governor to sign a law to allow. We ended Medicaid funding for abortion.All of these measures faced serious opposition, but had strong public support. And they helped us bring the abortion rate in our state down twice as fast as the national average. Meanwhile we more than doubled the number of adoptions in our state. And I ensured that we defunded Planned Parenthood in our state, too.On all these issues, Hillary Clinton has a different view. When Americans from both parties and both sides of the abortion debate came together to ban partial-birth abortion as a truly barbaric procedure unworthy of our country, she defended it. She said that the voters had no right to decide the issue.Today she opposes banning late-term abortions, again siding with the most extreme advocates of abortion. It is a stance that has recently won her the endorsement of the two biggest supporters of unrestricted abortion in this country, Planned Parenthood and NARAL.Her vow to keep taxpayer dollars flowing to organizations that perform abortionsa truly perverse example of cronyismsurely helped seal the deal. She says that government should not be involved in abortion, but she means the opposite: government must force all of us to finance it.Government exists first and foremost to protect our rights and our lives. That\'s the conservative philosophy. It\'s also the philosophy of our Declaration of Independence, which declares that we have God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.The order Jefferson chose was no accident. The right to life comes first because it is the most fundamental of our rights, the one without which we cannot enjoy the others.Thousands of people are marching in Washington, D.C., on Friday, January 22 because they understand that we must protect everyone, including the weakest and most vulnerable of all. They know that our country is better than abortion on demand.That is why they will succeed. And it is why I am proud to stand with them.Originally Posted on Fox News'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 23, 2016",b'Press Release - Jeb on Top Issues Facing Seniors',"b""Many older Americans are struggling under President Obama's failed leadership. Federal programs that serve seniors are not working and many are getting even worse without needed reforms. I have proposed a number of policies to fix these programs and improve the financial security and health of millions of our citizens.Preserve and Protect Social Security and MedicareMany retirees rely on Social Security and Medicare for critical health needs and financial security. Unfortunately, Washington politicians have put the Social Security and Medicare trust funds on a course to be drained as soon as 2030, at which point benefits will need to be cut. My detailed plan preserves and protects Social Security and Medicare by implementing a number of reforms, including encouraging private saving, valuing work, slowing cost growth, and giving seniors better choices when it comes to health care benefits. My plan will ensure that no current retiree, or senior approaching retirement, will see a cut in Social Security benefits and that many seniors will benefit from lower Medicare premiums. Honor Our Veterans The nation has a responsibility to care for former service members throughout their lives. Yet a series of deeply troubling revelations has shown the government is not keeping that commitment, especially to our older veterans. Under the Obama Administration, we have seen incidents of grave conditions throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care system. I have put forth a detailed seven step plan to restore faith with our veterans and improve the quality of care they receive. My plan includes overhauling the Veterans Health Administration, expanding choice, and improving healthcare for female veterans. For instance, currently, only certain veterans are allowed to choose their doctor. That number should be increased. If a veteran wants to see a neighborhood physician, he or she has earned that choice.Provide Tax Relief for SeniorsI have offered a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code so we can grow our economy, provide tax relief to more Americans and make it easier to start a business. An important element of my plan lowers taxes on employed seniors. Currently, working seniors who are eligible for Social Security must continue to pay 6.2 percent of their income (up to specified levels) to Social Security. This discourages seniors to stay in the workforce. My tax plan eliminates this tax for employees who have reached full retirement age.Promote Innovation in Health CareAmerican entrepreneurs have achieved transformational innovations that have greatly improved and prolonged our lives. Medical research remains on the verge of producing breakthrough treatments and therapies for serious ailments, but more investment is critical. For example, Alzheimer's is now the sixth leading cause of death in America and not only causes tremendous suffering but, in aggregate, burdens the nation with hundreds of billions of dollars in additional costs each year. As President, my health care plan will promote innovation by modernizing the morass of federal regulations that stifles new medical discoveries and increase the effectiveness of, and funding for, National Institutes of Health research."""
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 24, 2016",b'Press Release - Realigning the Courts with the Constitution',"b'The next presidential election will help to determine whether we move further away from constitutional government, or make a critical course correction. Most Supreme Court watchers agree that the next president will significantly influence the court\'s course for at least the next decade, maybe longer. With vacancies possible across the Supreme Court\'s ideological spectrum, and in the lower federal courts as well, the stakes are high. Nothing less than preserving the form of government our Founders gave uswith limited powers, and accountability to the peopleis at stake.My CommitmentAs president I will take an oath to ""preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Appointing judges who believe in the rule of law is a vitally important part of that job, and one that I intend to do to the utmost of my ability.Too often the Supreme Court has, in effect, rewritten the Constitution. Sometimes it has invented rights that are not found in the Constitution and used them to strike down legitimate laws with which five Justices disagree. At other times it has failed to enforce parts of the Constitution. When it does either of these things, the Court erodes our system of government and short-circuits the democratic processOur Founders gave us a limited government and divided its powers to protect liberty and accountability. They also gave us an amendment process to change the Constitution when needed. But because too many justices have viewed the Court as a kind of permanent constitutional convention, we have drifted far away from these wise arrangements.If the Court goes the wrong way, we face a troubling future. Our strong tradition of religious liberty, which is already under assault, could erode precipitously. The right to bear arms could be read out of our Constitution. School-choice programs that have given hope to children all over our country could be ended by judicial fiat. The states could be reduced to mere administrative sub-units of the federal government. Liberal dogma could be placed in the way of reasonable protections for unborn children, even when most people agree on them.I will do everything in my power to avert that fate. In my view, the federal courts have a vital but limited role in our national life. Their job is not to second-guess laws or to substitute their own judgment for the provisions of the Constitution. It is to apply the laws as written, and follow the Constitution above all. Because many cases present genuinely difficult questions, judges who share these convictions will not always agree with one another on how to apply the law in particular cases. But they will look to the text, original understanding, history, and structure of the Constitution for their answersnot to their own views about which public policies would be better, not to their sense of the zeitgeist, and not to what might win favor on editorial pages. They will defer to the elected branches on issues the Constitution leaves to them to resolve. But when laws conflict with the Constitution, they will not hesitate to strike them down.As president, I will search for nominees who agree with this job descriptionnominees in the mold of such Justices as Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomasand I will fight for their confirmation.We should not have any illusions about this fact: It will be a fight. Long gone are the days when we could count on Senate Democrats to accept conservative nominees who are well-qualified and have records that testify to their character and integrity. These days, their desire to have courts that will impose the liberal agenda they favor trumps such old-fashioned notions. A nominee with a record of applying the law as writtenthe kind of nominee I will selectis guaranteed to draw opposition from them, whether that nomination is for the Supreme Court or a lower appellate court. I am eager to have that debate when I am president, and I am confident that those of us who believe in judicial fidelity to the Constitution will win it. My RecordFor months now, I have been telling voters across the country that, as president, I would welcome the opportunity to nominate and fight for judges who will enforce the Constitution as an enduring document, not as a living document that constantly changes to accord with liberal fashions. Voters need not take my word for it, however. They can simply look to my record as a two-term governor of Florida.As governor, judicial appointments were one of my top priorities. When I took office, Florida\'s judicial selection process was subject to excessive influence by special interests. Together with the Florida legislature, I created a new process better geared toward filling the state courts with jurists who had a sound understanding of their limited, but important, role.My administration devoted substantial time to the vetting process and made appointments with the utmost care. I detailed publicly the criteria I would use to select people for the bench: humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. And then I scoured Florida for people who met that test. While the reforms did not give governors a free hand in appointing judges, I was able to make a dramatic change for the better in the state\'s courts.My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, are strong examples of my philosophy of judicial appointments in action. Both Justice Cantero and Justice Bell have earned reputations as the Florida Supreme Court\'s most consistent conservatives. I also looked to the future with my appointments: Two of the appellate judges I named, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court.I would approach nominations to the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court with the same rigor and care as I approached appointments to the Florida Supreme Court. My strategy:Assemble the broadest possible pool of candidates who meet the core qualifications.Scour their records and vet their references.Keep on the list only those people with a proven history of respecting both the limits of federal power and the will of the people.Identify those most willing to stand up for the law, even if it runs contrary to their own policy preferences.And fight to confirm the most qualified candidates who meet those criteria.The federal courts are at a crossroads. I want to ensure they go down the right path. We cannot afford to elect a president who will pack the courts with politicians in robes willing to subvert the legal process to advance their political agendas. We need a president who is committed to nominating people who clearly understand the difference between judges and legislators, and who have demonstrated records of respecting the Constitution\'s limits on federal authority. That is what I am committed to doing, that is the record I built in Florida, and that is how we will ensure that our courts are realigned with the Constitution.Notable Public Statements on Judicial NominationsLiberty University Speech: Judges must not ""mistak[e] themselves for elected legislators and impos[e] restrictions and rights that do not exist in the Constitution."" (Breitbart 5/10/15)Open Letter to Florida Bar Outlining Philosophy:""All else being equal, I will appoint judges whom I believe share such values as a belief in judicial restraint, limited government, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to the full application of the criminal law without equivocation."" (Florida Bar News 11/1/99)Statement on Appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court:""Increasingly, courts have seized control over policy decisions that are not theirs to make. I\'d prefer that judges distinguish themselves by their adherence to the fundamental principle of the separation of powers. I do not know of any Americans or Floridians who have consented to government by judiciary."" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)""The increasing power of courtsshould not come at the expense of institutions that have a more legitimate claim to govern our lives. As the courts grow ever more powerful, there is an even greater need for judges who are humble about the judicial role. Humble in the sense that they know courts are not mini-legislatures or governors."" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)""Courts exist to protect freedom. This includes the individual rights that each of us holds dear. But freedom also means the shared right of the people to govern themselves through their elected representatives in the Legislature and the Executive Branch. A healthy respect for the people\'s right of self-government, and a strong dose of humility, are absolute prerequisites for a good judge."" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)Courts as Protection for Individual Rights:""Judges have a really difficult job. They must balance judicial independence, which is a guiding principle for democracy, with a respect for the primacy of the legislative and executive branches as policymakers. They must guard our individual rights . . . but not at the expense of our collective right to self-government. And perhaps their greatest challenge is to resist the urge to substitute their own values and policy preferences for those embodied in the law."" (Florida Bar News 1/15/03)One of the most important responsibilities of the judiciary is to safeguard the individual rights that the people have enshrined in our Constitution. But that is precisely the point: a judge must enforce the Constitution that the people have actually adopted, not the Constitution that the judge wishes the people had adopted. It is only through faithful adherence to this principle that courts can respect both individual rights and the people\'s collective right to self-government. Problems arise when courts attempt to impose their personal values and policy preferences on the rest of us. This is the very definition of judicial arrogance. In all my judicial appointments, I have sought men and women with the humility and intellectual integrity to subordinate their own will to the rule of law.Jeb BushJanuary 12, 2003'"
Jeb Bush,R,p,"January 24, 2016",b'Press Release - Lindsey Graham: Jeb Bush is Best Choice for Commander-in-Chief',"b'With ISIS on the rise and radical Islamic terrorism threatening our homeland, America needs a strong and steady leader in the White House. I believe every American voter has an obligation to pick a commander in chief worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and someone with the experience, judgment and temperament to keep our nation safe.Jeb Bush is that leader. Jeb is ready to be commander in chief during these dangerous times.As a transformational two-term governor of America\'s largest swing state, Jeb Bush has been tested, time and again. In the aftermath of the9/11terrorist attacks, Florida\'s tourism-driven economy took a major hit. Jeb successfully brought Republicans and Democrats together in support of a series of economic reforms that jump-started Florida\'s economy and resulted in his state becoming the national leader in job creation and small business creation.Gov. Bush also set the gold standard for emergency management and disaster preparedness when he mobilized the Florida National Guard and led an unprecedented recovery effort after eight major hurricanes hit his state from 2004-2005.Jeb Bush knows how to make tough calls when under fire. This is why 30 retired admirals and generals and 12 Medal of Honor recipients, including South Carolinians Maj. Gen. James Livingston and Corp. Kyle Carpenter, have joined me in endorsing Jeb\'s candidacy.As a retired colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I know how important it is to have a commander in chief who is committed to rebuilding our military.Barack Obama\'s devastating defense cuts are undermining our national security. In a commanding speech before cadets at The Citadel, Gov. Bush outlined a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our military and ensure that our soldiers have the training and equipment they need to execute their missions successfully.Gov. Bush has also outlined a detailed strategy to destroy ISIS. Unlike many of the other Republican candidates, Jeb has been honest about the need to put more American boots on the ground in the Middle East to take out ISIS. He deserves credit for having the courage to tell the truth about what is needed to destroy ISIS. This will not be an easy fight, but it is one that America must lead to restore stability to the Middle East and to protect our homeland from terrorist attacks like the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.Gov. Bush also understands that American leadership is necessary to mobilize a coalition of our Middle Eastern partners and European allies to take the fight directly to ISIS. America must lead, but we cannot fight this war alone. The Bush strategy would embed our soldiers with the Iraqi military, arms the Kurds, re-engage with the Sunni tribal leaders and send a clear and unmistakable message to Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan that America is all in when it comes to destroying ISIS  but they must step forward as well.Gov. Bush recognizes that Bashar Assad, the butcher in Syria, must be toppled in order to take out ISIS and restore stability in Syria. Assad\'s brutality is a recruiting tool that ISIS uses to radicalize Sunnis in Syria. Donald Trump mistakenly believes that we can sit back and allow Assad, Putin and Syria to fight it out. However, he misunderstands the complexity of the region, what is needed to restore order and how to end the slaughtering of innocent Syrians that has led to one of the worst refugee and humanitarian crises in recent memory.Gov. Bush\'s Syrian strategy embraces many of the ideas that I have advocated such as establishing a no-fly zone to prevent Assad from barrel bombing innocent civilians.Gov. Bush would also create safe zones in Syria for refugees, and he would provide military and logistical support to moderate forces in Syria. Jeb knows that American leadership is also required after Assad falls to ensure that the country doesn\'t lurch deeper into chaos or fall into the hands of radical Islamists. After all, the infamous ""leading from behind"" foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton already led to the fall of Libya, and we cannot allow that to happen again.It is easy to talk tough on foreign policy and give sound bites about carpet-bombing the Middle East. However, it takes deep thought, humility and an understanding of how to project American military power to chart out a clearly defined strategy that will successfully destroy ISIS and protect America.Jeb Bush stands head and shoulders above the rest of the field in meeting the commander in chief test, and I encourage my fellow Republicans in South Carolina to join me in voting for him.Originally Posted on The Post and Courier'"

As a true believer, he would take the country on a scary step toward Armageddon in the Middle East. Cruz has the most conservative record in Congress and is disliked by virtually every one of his colleagues in the Senate, two remarkable accomplishments.Though Rubio is considered establishment, he is also a warmonger and wants to add a $1 trillion to the military. Not only is his rhetoric about America being in serious decline and ISIS constituting a threat to ""hundreds of thousands"" of Americans untrue, it is also tiresome. We\'re not interested in an Alarmist-in-Chief.Bush not only checks all the boxes for conservatives, on both fiscal and social issues, but unlike the front-runners who complain about how Washington doesn\'t work and will prove it once they get in, he is conciliatory by nature and has sensible plans on major issues like immigration.When asked at an editorial board at the Conway Sun whether he\'d conduct warfare more like his father or brother, Jeb said he\'d build a coalition like his dad\'s and take a measured approach, so unlike the warmongering we hear from the front-runners.Jeb Bush by nature and upbringing treats people with respect; thus, he\'s not particularly good at name-calling. As unimpressive as he looked trading insults with Trump, in person he\'s confident, thoughtful and likable, qualities that should not disqualify him as president.New Hampshire has the power to get a sensible Republican in the game and keep anti-establishment, far-right candidates from running away with the nomination.Much more than Iowa, New Hampshire reflects the body politic of American\'s tradition of governing from the center, and it is our responsibility to give one of the moderates a chance.Our choice for that role is Jeb Bush, a man who can reach out to minorities, women and center-to-right independents  people Republicans need to win back the White House.Originally Posted on The Conway Daily Sun'"
