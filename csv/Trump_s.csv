Donald Trump,R,s,"July 14, 2015",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump in Response to Hillary Clinton',"b'Download PDFDonald J. Trump Response to Hillary Clinton(New York, NY) July 14, 2015  Today Donald J. Trump released the following statement as a response to Hillary Clinton.Failing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said ""Mexico is sending""--- I\'m not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don\'t want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes. She is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about ""my tone"" and that\'s the problem with our country\'s leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It\'s not about being nice--- it\'s about being competent. Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition. The last person she wants to face is Donald Trump.'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 15, 2015",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on the Iran Agreement',"b'Download PDFDonald J. Trump Statement on Iran Agreement(New York, NY) July 14, 2015  Today Donald J. Trump released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration\'s agreement with Iran. The Obama Administration\'s agreement with Iran is very dangerous. Iran developing a nuclear weapon, either through uranium or nuclear fuel, and defying the world is still a very real possibility. The inspections will not be followed, and Iran will no longer have any sanctions. Iran gets everything and loses nothing. Every promise the Obama Administration made in the beginning of negotiations, including the vow (made at the beginning of the negotiations) to get our great American prisoners returned to the U. S. has been broken. This is a bad deal that sets a dangerous precedent. This deal sets off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which is the most-unstable region in the world. It is a horrible and perhaps catastrophic event for Israel.Furthermore, we should have kept the billions of dollars we have agreed to pay them. Any great dealmaker would know this is a perfect example of ""tapping along"" and because they have been unchecked for so long throughout this extremely lengthy process, I guarantee they are much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than they were at the start of negotiations. The fact is, the US has incompetent leaders and even more incompetent negotiators. We must do better for America and the world. We have to Make America Great Again.'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"November 11, 2015",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on Veterans Day',"b'November is a great month for Americans. In New York City, we get to look out on Central Park and see the leaves change as we move from the beauty of Fall to a magnificent city cloaked in the chill and briskness of Winter. What we Americans often gloss over is that November is a time for celebrating the very reason we enjoy the freedom, opportunity and prosperity found nowhere else in the world. The reason we are able to live like we do is due to the courage, dedication and sacrifice of those who serve in the armed forces of the United States and to those who have given the last full measure.This November we should pay particular attention to the world situation. All over the world, young men and women who have volunteered to serve this nation are standing watch to protect us from the evil that is focused on taking away all that we value. We have turmoil in the Middle East, unrest in Europe, aggressive expansion in the Pacific Rim and stateless terrorism that threatens every aspect of freedom all across the globe. At no time in history have things been so precarious. Yet, we are able to find the best among us to step forward and take on the traditions and values of generations past, humbly putting on the uniform of this nation. They do so to support and defend the Constitution, not the President, the Congress or even the flag. They swear to defend an idea and an ideal. As is so subtly stated in the Preamble of our Founding Document, they take on the task ""to secure Liberty for ourselves and our posterity.""On November 10th, the Marine Corps celebrated its 240th birthday. The Marines were, are and will remain unique in the world, a force that is first to fight and last to come home. The Marines have maintained the highest standards and ""once a Marine, always a Marine,"" captures the sense of duty and honor that permeates every pore of those who have worn the Eagle, Globe and Anchor.Today, we honor all veterans who are and have served in the armed forces. This day has special meaning to so many. Over the years, I have hired thousands of veterans and have found them to be among the very best. They bring no attention to themselves except in their extraordinary professionalism and dedication to whatever they choose to do. Quietly, humbly, and without fanfare, they go about their daily lives being great citizens, good moms and dads, and loving, devoted companions. Bearing up under the terrible damage of war, so many carry on with dignity and grace. We should be so proud of them and we should honor them every day. November is also the month we celebrate the Military Family. Too many of us have never had to be away from family and friends on holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. We have never been asked to risk life and limb in places we cannot even find on a map. We go about our daily lives enjoying freedom, most of the time without ever thinking about what it is like to have a loved one in harm\'s way. The sacrifice and strength of military families, those who also serve, is so important to morale and welfare of those so far from home.I have lived a full life and have benefited more than most from the opportunities found in this country. I have a loving, healthy family and I am running for President -- only in America. To be where I am, I thank God every day for those who stand on the ramparts of liberty with courage, strength, humility and dignity. So, this November, let\'s celebrate our veterans and their families and keep them in our prayers. Because of these dedicated Americans, we will be able to Make America Great Again!'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"December 7, 2015",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration',"b'(New York, NY) December 7th, 2015, -- Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\'s representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and 51% of those polled, ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won\'t convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.Mr. Trump stated, ""Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again."" - Donald J. Trump'"

Donald Trump,R,s,"December 17, 2015",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on the Budget Deal',"b'(New York, NY) December 17, 2015  ""If anyone needed more evidence of why the American people are suffering at the hands of their own government, look no further than the budget deal announced by Speaker Ryan. In order to avoid a government shutdown, a cowardly threat from an incompetent President, the elected Republicans in Congress threw in the towel and showed absolutely no budget discipline. The American people will have to absorb higher deficits, greater debt, less economic liberty and more corporate welfare. Congress cannot seem to help itself in bending to every whim of special interests. How can they face their constituents when they continue to burden our children and grandchildren with debts they will never be able to repay? Our government is failing us, so we must do something about it. Who knows how bad things will be when the next administration comes in and has to pick up the pieces? The only special interest not being served by our government is the American people. It is time we imposed budget discipline by holding the line on spending, getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and by taking on our debt. To do these things, we need a President who can lead the fight to hold Congress and the rest of government accountable. Together, we can Make America Great Again.""  Donald J. Trump'"

Justice Scalia was a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice, one of the best of all time. His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans' most cherished freedoms. He was a Justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the Constitution of our country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time."""
Donald Trump,R,s,"February 15, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump Responding to the Lies of Senator Cruz and Warns of Legal Action',"b'Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I\'ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William ""Bill"" Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it\'s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn\'t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don\'t they are in default of their pledge to me.I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.'"

Donald Trump,R,s,"February 18, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump in Response to the Pope',"b""If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn't see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant."""

The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.""'"

Trump issued the following statement today on a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies, based on U.S. Census Bureau Data, showing record immigration growth in the United States: ""Record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers. Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters - Democrats, Republicans and Independents - think immigration should be frozen or reduced. The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to middle-class stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Yet, Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates - a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate. When I am President we will listen to the people - not the special interests - and get immigration numbers under control, as the voters have demanded.""The report can be viewed here: http://cis.org/61-Million-Immigrants-and-Their-Young-Children-Now-Live-in-the-United-States'"

Likewise, I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin\' Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchmen and then pretend total innocence.

This endorsement represents a total rejection of the corrupt politicians who have allowed transnational gangs and cartels to terrorize American communities.The National Border Patrol Council is the official body representing America\'s front-line Border Patrol Agents who sacrifice every day, under intolerable political restraints, to keep America safe. America\'s 16,500 border patrol agents represented by the NBPC are the first line of defense for our nation. The NBPC provides the vital outlet to learn the truth - not the political spin from bureaucrats - about what is really happening on our border. And the NBPC has been the one outlet these agents have to prevent their voice from being drowned out by big money special interests.As President, I will work tirelessly with the NBPC and their rank-and-file agents to secure our border once and for all. I will ensure that every rank-and-file officer has the resources, tools and support they need to protect this nation and stop the influx of drugs, gangs and cartel violence. Together, we will save thousands of American lives, millions of American jobs, and billions of American tax dollars.I am deeply privileged to have the official support of America\'s border patrol agents, and will never let them down.This is our chance to make our country safe again, and ultimately, Make America Great Again.""'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"April 24, 2016",b'Press Release - Statement by Donald J. Trump in Response to Cruz and Kasich Campaigns',"b'It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination. Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance, which was a total disaster, he is in free fall and as everyone has seen, he does not react well under pressure. Also, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich. Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are. I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me. Because of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system. This horrible act of desperation, from two campaigns who have totally failed, makes me even more determined, for the good of the Republican Party and our country, to prevail!'"

Donald Trump,R,s,"June 7, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump Regarding Trump University',"b'It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one\'s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University\'s programs. For example:Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University\'s three-day seminar ""excellent"" in every category, but also praised Trump University\'s mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked ""how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals"", she simply stated ""[c]ontinue to offer great classes."" Once the plaintiffs\' lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers\' objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs\' motion, but allowed the case to continue. Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University\'s three-day seminar ""excellent"" in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would ""attend another Trump University seminar"" and even ""recommend Trump University seminars to a friend."" When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen\'s only suggestion was to ""[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in"" and make the lunch break 45 minutes. Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University\'s programs ""excellent"" in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided ""more comfortable chairs.""Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www.98percentapproval.com.For those students who decided that Trump University\'s programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multi-day program, whichever came later.Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial.I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  like Ford, Nabisco, Carrier  are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage.Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge\'s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge\'s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!Donald J. Trump'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"June 12, 2016","b'Statement by Donald J. Trump Regarding Tragic Terrorist Attack in Orlando, Florida'","b""Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen  and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term  and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans.

Donald Trump,R,s,"June 16, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on AFL-CIO Endorsement of Hillary Clinton',"b'Sadly with this endorsement of Hillary Clinton - who is totally owned by Wall Street - the leadership of the AFL-CIO has made clear that it no longer represents American workers. Instead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington, D.C. that benefits only the insiders.I believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.Hillary Clinton and her husband have made hundreds of millions of dollars doing favors and selling access to Wall Street, special interests and oppressive foreign regimes. As Bernie Sanders said, ""Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?"" They own Hillary Clinton and she will do whatever they tell her to.Bernie Sanders is also 100% correct when he says that Hillary Clinton ""vote[d] for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."" Hillary supported NAFTA and she supported the trade deal with China, Vietnam, South Korea  and if elected will implement the TPP she loves so much  guaranteed.While Secretary of State,\'Hillary Clinton racked up a $1 trillion trade deficit with China  all while China was funneling a small fortune to Hillary via speaking fees paid to Bill.On immigration, Hillary Clinton sides with Wall Street too. Bernie Sanders correctly warned that open borders ""would substantially lower wages in this country,"" and yet Hillary has put forward a plan that would completely open America\'s borders in her first 100 days in office.On energy, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the coal mines, block the Keystone pipeline, and destroy millions of good union jobs through executive action.Her massive proposed increase in taxes and regulations will also send millions of jobs overseas.Hillary Clinton will economically destroy poor communities, African-American and Hispanic workers on trade, immigration, crime, energy, taxes, regulation and everything else.Finally, union workers have long believed in having an open and free society. Yet Hillary takes money from regimes that support the murder of gays and the enslavement of women while pushing to bring people into America who want to do the exact same thing to our people. I only want to bring people into our country who will love and support everyone.Hillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had. I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has, and I will fight for their right to elect leaders who will do the same. I will be a president for ALL Americans.'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"June 23, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on Executive Amnesty Ruling',"b""Today's 4-4 Supreme Court ruling has blocked one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a President. The executive amnesty from President Obama wiped away the immigration rules written by Congress, giving work permits and entitlement benefits to people illegally in the country. This split decision also makes clear what is at stake in November. The election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country. Clinton has pledged to expand Obama's executive amnesty, hurting poor African-American and Hispanic workers by giving away their jobs and federal resources to illegal immigrant labor  while making us all less safe. It is time to protect our country and Make America Safe Again and Great Again for everyone."""
Donald Trump,R,s,"June 24, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump Regarding the British Referendum on E.U. Membership',"b""The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy. A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries  and our two peoples  are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first. They will have the chance to reject today's rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people. I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again."""
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 1, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on Continued Terrorist Attacks Against Israeli Citizens',"b'Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father, shot at by a Palestinian terrorist, was killed while driving his car and three of his children who were passengers were severely injured. As I did with regard to the brutal murder of Hallel Yaffa Ariel, I strongly condemn this attack and call upon the Palestinian leadership to completely end this barbaric behavior. I also call upon President Obama to recognize and condemn each and every terrorist attack against Israeli citizens. This cannot become the ""new normal."" It has to end.'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 1, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on Hallel Yaffa Ariel',"b'I am shocked by the heinous murder of 13-year-old Hallel Yaffa Ariel, who was attacked by a Palestinian terrorist while she was sleeping in her bedroom. I extend my deepest condolences to the Ariel family. The continuing incitement and preaching of hate by the Palestinian leadership, and the glorification of terror must end immediately. I call upon the leadership of the Palestinian Authority to condemn this murder and to take concrete steps to end this barbaric behavior.Donald J. Trump'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 4, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on False Accusation from Hillary Clinton',"b'These false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior, (showing an inscription that says ""Crooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever"") with anti-Semitism is ridiculous. Clinton, through her surrogates, is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband. The real questions are, why was Bill Clinton meeting secretly with the US Attorney General on her case and where are the 33,000 missing emails and all of the other information missing from her case - Why are there so many lies?'"
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 5, 2016","b""Statement by Donald J. Trump on Hillary Clinton's Bad Judgment and the Rigged System""","b""The FBI Director laid out today a detailed case of how Hillary Clinton compromised the safety of the American people by storing highly classified information on a private email server with no security. He confirmed that her email could easily have been hacked by hostile actors, and confirmed that those she emailed with were hacked.Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton, and this fact alone disqualifies her from service.It has also been revealed that Hillary Clinton lied when she said that she did not send classified information. The FBI Director confirmed that over 100 emails were deemed classified at the time they were sent, including emails classified as top secret.On top of it all, Hillary Clinton's lawyers wiped the servers clean to delete another 30,000 emails  hiding her corrupt dealings from investigators. She used the State Department for her personal gain, trading favors for cash, and tried to conceal the records. Also, she didn't want people to know the details about her botched decisions in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Egypt that destabilized the Middle East.But because of our rigged system that holds the American people to one standard and people like Hillary Clinton to another, it does not look like she will be facing the criminal charges that she deserves.Bill Clinton didn't accidentally run into the Attorney General on the airport tarmac last week in Phoenix. Hillary Clinton didn't accidentally sneak into the FBI during one of the country's biggest holiday weekends to testify on her illegal activities, something that wouldn't be afforded to others under investigation (and on a Saturday of all days). It was no accident that charges were not recommended against Hillary the exact same day as President Obama campaigns with her for the first time.Folks  the system is rigged. The normal punishment, in this case, would include losing authority to handle classified information, and that too disqualifies Hillary Clinton from being President.The final jury will be the American people, and they will issue the verdict on her corruption, incompetence, and bad judgment on November 8th."""
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 6, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on Atlantic City Record',"b""I have built a tremendously successful business, which has created tens of thousands of jobs. Out of the hundreds of businesses I have owned over the decades, and hundreds of deals and transactions, I have used the chapter laws of our country in four instances, much as many of our country's elite business people do (but nobody cares about). It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs. Nobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will. I want to bring jobs back to America, while Hillary Clinton wants to get elected to enrich herself with power at the expense of the people. I created thousands of jobs and made a lot of money in Atlantic City, which was what, as a businessman, I am supposed to do for my company and my family - and as President I will make America rich again, and Make America Great Again."""
Donald Trump,R,s,"July 8, 2016",b'Statement by Donald J. Trump on the Shootings of Police Officers in Dallas',"b""Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers  five of whom were killed and seven wounded - is an attack on our country. It is a coordinated, premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe.We must restore law and order. We must restore the confidence of our people to be safe and secure in their homes and on the street.The senseless, tragic deaths of two people in Louisiana and Minnesota reminds us how much more needs to be done.This morning I offer my thoughts and prayers for all of the victims' families, and we pray for our brave police officers and first responders who risk their lives to protect us every single day.Our nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like they've lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better. This isn't the American Dream we all want for our children.This is a time, perhaps more than ever, for strong leadership, love and compassion. We will pull through these tragedies."""
