Lincoln Chafee,D,s,"July 1, 2015",b'Press Release - Us-Cuba Ties: Embassies Re-open',"b'Today is a great day for Americans! President Obama and Secretary Kerry announced that the U.S. and Cuba have agreed to re-open U.S. Embassies that have been closed for over 50 years.As a Senator, I had the opportunity to visit Cuba and meet Fidel Castro in January of 2002. It remains one of my most vivid memories of my time in the Senate.Here is an account of the trip from my book, Against the Tide:In January 2002, I went to Cuba with Senator Arlen Specter. The land has a unique topography; flat, green, and fertile in the west, stretching east into the towering Sierra Maestra, where Castro and his guerrillas operated in the revolution. I was struck by how the 745-mile-long island seems lost in time. Everything I saw there was modest and humble, but not what I could call poverty-stricken. No one appeared hungry, homeless, or sick; indeed, the island has far better health care and education than many of its wealthier neighbors. But it was a strange experience to get off a modern jet at Jos Mart International Airport and then share the road with horse-drawn carts on the drive into Havana. Many motorists drove fifty-year-old Soviet and American cars that ran on parts fabricated in backyard machine shops. Most buildings look as if they have not been painted since 1959, when Castro overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and set up his own.At night, the busiest streets in Havana are dark or dimly lit by a flickering streetlight or two. It is so unlike other capitals, where commercial districts shine bright with the effects of globalization, the neon signs that advertise the American consumer franchises spreading rapidly around the world. There is nothing like that in Havana.In this totalitarian state, we were permitted to meet with leading dissidents working under the Varela Project, a movement to advance democratic political reform. They seemed a serious organization, but I wondered: Were they professional dissidents? Did the Communist government permit them to exist only as a public relations gesture to foreign critics?At a state dinner, our gray-bearded host in his trademark military fatigues touted his country\'s low infant mortality, its high number of doctors per capita, and the literacy of the Cuban people. My snap impression of Fidel Castro was that he is smart, quick with a laugh, and has charisma. At the same time, I am well aware of his ruthless history. Senator Specter meant to say something provocative at dinner. He asked the president, ""When are you going to have free elections here in Cuba?"" Castro shot back, ""You mean like in Florida?""In the course of a boisterous dinner that went on for hoursending at 3:00 A.M. I asked the Cuban president, mischievously, whether he supported calls for an end to the U.S. embargo. Even conservative senators from farm states were working to normalize trade with Cuba in the interest of opening new markets for their crops. Votes to end the embargo were increasingly close. Was it a given that Castro supported these efforts? I was betting he did not. Ending the embargo imposed in 1962 would change the way he had done business for almost his entire reign. He knew what I was getting at: The embargo works for him in a perverse way. Having a reason to lash out at the United States has been his meal ticket with the Cuban people for a long time.He dodged my question and zoomed off on a tangent that I no longer recall. But I was satisfied; by not answering my question, he had answered it.It was clear to me that day in Havana that the rest of the world is far ahead of us in planning for the end of the octogenarian president\'s rule. Nations in Europe, Asia, and Latin America were positioning themselves to take advantage of trade in the next Cuba. There was slight evidence of a robust foreign invasion at the time, but it was starting.'"

Lincoln Chafee,D,s,"September 24, 2015",b'Press Release - Fear: The Path to the Dark Side',"b'Friends,Today I\'d like to talk to you about Islamophobia and the grave dangers of fear informed policies. It\'s been on my mind recently, and I have a little bit to say. I hope you\'ll bear with me.Recently, you may have noticed that two presidential candidates, Ben Carson and Donald Trump, have taken heat over this issue. Dr. Ben Carson stated that he could not endorse a Muslim for president because Islam was incompatible with the Constitution and the values of this nation. He has since tried to qualify his stance, saying he\'d be fine with a Muslim who had renounced Islam and Islamic law, betraying his poor understanding of the religion and insulting Muslims around the world.For perhaps the first time, Donald Trump\'s shame stems from what he didn\'t say instead of what he did. During a campaign rally, Mr. Trump failed to correct a supporter who asserted both that President Obama was a Muslim, and that Muslims had training camps in the US preparing youth to destroy America. That supporter then asked, ""When can we get rid"" of all the Muslims. Mr. Trump declined to correct the man and instead stamped his statement with validation, saying lots of people had that concern and that he would look into it.The problem with these statements isn\'t just that they\'re wrong, ill-informed, and validating of prejudice, it\'s that they\'re indicative of something far more dangerous and deep-seated: fear. Fear shuts down communication and listening. It divides people. And it directly threatens the future of our world. Truly, the thing to fear is fear itself.Islamaphobia is at its greatest height since 9/11. You may have heard of the recent case of Ahmed, a 14 year old student, who built a clock and brought it to school to show his teacher. When the clock beeped in class, another teacher mistook the clock for a bomb and Ahmed was put in cuffs and arrested. But the school was not evacuated, the bomb squad was not called. The clock wasn\'t mistaken for a bomb, the Muslim boy was mistaken for a terrorist. We cannot forget the culture of fear that swept our nation after 9/11, and of the serious repercussions, both national and international, of that backlash. Recently, the Honorable U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) introduced legislation recognizing and honoring the many victims of post 9/11 fear who were discriminated against, abused, and murdered.This fear manifests itself not just in anecdotes like Ahmed\'s, but in real policy discussions happening right now. The refugee crisis in Europe, a most serious situation of a scale unheard of since WWII, now tests the founding principles of the EU and the international order. This massive humanitarian crisis demands nothing less than intensive international collaboration. But despite the relative generosity of some countries like Germany, a solution is stalled because many countries fear the possibility of refugees bringing crime and radicalism. Instead of helping the people who have been most victimized, abused, and exploited, conservative voices are making them into the other, the enemy, the threat, even vermin.Let\'s examine the elements of that fear of crime and radicalization. Crime is an easy one. Multiple studies have shown that the correlation between rising crime and illegal immigrants is pure myth. It is also an obvious mistake to equate high crime rates with race or ethnicity, when the real explanation lies in the inequity of the socio-economic order. Regarding radicalization, while scholars have not nailed down an exact predictive model for violent radicalization, the factors identified should not surprise us. President Kennedy famously said, ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make armed revolution inevitable."" A combination of economic exploitation, political repression, and violent subjugation produces a volatile cocktail. Anecdotal data reveals that those who feel targeted and wronged by society, left out of prosperity, and powerless to change their circumstances are the ones who find purpose in the seductive dogma of violent radicalization.Whose fault is this? Certainly individuals must own their actions, but those responsible for the structural factors, the incentivizing conditions and the provocations, must also reflect on their role. Let\'s look at an abridged history of the Middle East: 1) Britain and France carved up the territories of the defeated Ottoman Empire to claim themselves in a secret treaty in 1916 known as Sykes-Picot, drawing arbitrary borders that divided entire nations of people, like the Kurds, and forced others, like Iraqi Sunnis and Shiites, to live together under one unrepresentative political entity. 2) Years of colonial subjugation by western powers culminated in bloody struggles for independence. 3) Many newly independent countries found themselves lead by corrupt, secular strongmen dictators supported by the West for economic reasons as well as to serve as proxies in the power struggle of the Cold War. 4) Direct military intervention spearheaded by the United States after 9/11 casted the region into further disorder, coupled with a new global paradigm of discrimination and insecurity.In sum, European imperial subjugation transformed into brutal dictatorships supported by those same western powers for the purposes of economic and political exploitation. And then you have the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, drones flying everywhere, Muslims persecuted everywhere, and an overall paradigm of hostility: us vs. them. It\'s clear that Western antagonism, whether motivated by imperial greed or xenophobic fear, enabled, if not directly produced, many of the factors behind violent radicalization directed towards the West. The key is that more of it will inevitably produce the same.Not only do we have to fight Islamaphobia because it is wrong and stands against the best principals of these United States, but also because such fear leads to aggression which manifests itself in policies that end up making the United States less safe. Not to mention poorer and less legitimate.Violent radicalism can never work, and will only make more suffering. But that is the exact lesson we need to learn ourselves. I am indeed frightened terribly by the rise of the Islamic State. They horrify the entire world. We must act. But in our Age of Information, we cannot solve our problems with airstrikes or a McCarthy Inquisition. We must solve our problems by providing solutions that address the root causes. That means diplomacy, that means economic development, that means global cooperation. Fear and intolerance cannot accomplish such things, only inhibit them. Politicians who depend on scaring voters endanger our nation.Republicans would be wise to heed the words of the great Jedi Master Yoda: ""Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.""There are too many people scared. We must be courageous.Put your name down here to show you agree and that you stand for courage. Please share this message with coworkers, friends, and family. We all have a stake in this, and discussion is so important.'"
Lincoln Chafee,D,s,"September 25, 2015",b'Press Release - Chafee Proposes New Tax Bracket for Wealthy',"b'Calling for a balanced way to address income inequality, Democratic Presidential Candidate Lincoln Chafee today announced a plan that would add one more tax bracket to the current tax code.Building off the 2012 Taxpayer Relief Act, Chafee\'s proposal would initiate a new bracket with a marginal tax rate of approximately 45% on income over $750,000. Chafee\'s plan would preserve the long term capital gains and ordinary dividend tax preferences, but would increase the tax rate on preference income to 25% (from 20%) for those taxpayers with total income over $750,000.Chafee estimates the $41 billion in additional revenue generated by the new bracket would allow for a $1,000 increase in the personal exemption, which generally benefits lower income taxpayers. Under his plan, the current personal exemption of $4,000 would increase beginning in calendar year 2017.""We need to address income inequality in this country,"" said Chafee. ""This proposal does just that and would move us closer to the tax code generally applicable in industrialized European countries. The economy is ticking along,"" noted Chafee, ""we don\'t need a radical change to the tax code which would change economic behavior.""Currently, there are 892,000 returns in the highest tax bracket (39.6% maximum marginal rate for married joint filers with income over $464,850) and they pay $368 billion of the $1.2 trillion in personal income tax revenue; in other words, 0.6% of filers pay 30% of income tax revenue. Despite this fact the wealthy are thriving while low and middle income earners are struggling.Chafee indicated that he has an open mind on increasing the personal exemption even further by phasing out the personal exemption for filers with six-digit incomes. A phase out of the personal exemption already exists for taxpayers with income over $200,000.Chafee also supports an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over the next three years, thereafter indexed to inflation.'"
