Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 20, 2015","Press Release - Stop ISIS Terrorists Now, Before It's Too Late","America must show leadership and help defeat ISIS(The following piece first ran on CNN.com on June 27, 2014)As the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continues to capture and control more territory in Iraq and Syria, it is important to realize what is at stake in the region and for the American people.The challenge that ISIS poses is not just to Iraq's stability but also to U.S. security. ISIS is a terrorist group with their own army and bank account that has a clear and growing ability to conduct terrorist attacks against the Iraqi government, Americans and U.S. interests, and even the U.S. homeland.ISIS, although loosely affiliated with al Qaeda, is in many respects even more extreme in its methods and its brutality than the terrorists who plotted and carried out 9/11.Although until now ISIS has focused its military goals on Syria and Iraq, its ranks include thousands of jihadists who have streamed into Syria and now into Iraq from around the globe as well as known terrorists who have been released or freed from Iraqi prisons.ISIS's goal is to secure its hold over large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, to establish an Islamic state or ""caliphate"" that stretches across the heart of the Middle East.As we have learned in the past, terrorists seek safe havens from which to operate, often in failed or failing states. They use this territory to train and equip themselves, raise funds and plot attacks.In addition to the threat to the U.S. homeland, we also need to be concerned that if Iraq begins to fragment, the resulting chaos and instability will ripple throughout the region.ISIS has sown incredible instability in Syria and is now seeking to do the same in Iraq. If we allow ISIS to spread further, their next targets will be U.S. allies and partners already under sufficient strain from the ongoing conflict in Syria, such as Jordan and even Saudi Arabia.We have an imperfect partner in Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who has shown himself unable to govern inclusively. We need to make clear to Baghdad that significant U.S. assistance will not be possible unless a national unity government is formed that does not include al-Maliki.Iran has already entered the fight on behalf of the al-Maliki government in Baghdad. But if we delegate this problem to Iran, we are likely to see the creation of a Shiite rump state that would effectively become an Iranian proxy and extend Iran's reach and influence from the Gulf of Oman to the Mediterranean Sea.So, what should we do?First and foremost, we need to move now to degrade ISIS's capabilities. The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq. We know where these supply lines are, we should not hesitate to halt the ISIS resupply to their strongholds in Anbar, Ninawa and Salah ad-Din.Second, we also need to understand that our lack of an effective Syria strategy has allowed ISIS to take hold and flourish in the region.ISIS has been able to develop its capabilities, increase its ranks, and obtain combat experience for its fighters over the last 18 months in northern Syria.We need to begin to tackle the root causes of the problem in Syria by overtly arming the moderate Syrian rebels that are fighting ISIS in that country even as we simultaneously tackle the challenge they currently pose to Iraq.The U.S. and allies should consider additional counter terrorism measures in Syria, perhaps working with regional partners. This is all a response to the same problem, and must be part of a unified strategy.The President's long overdue announcement on Thursday of an overt plan to train and equip moderates in the opposition is a welcome development, but we need to do much more to finally deal with the threat that the Syrian conflict poses to regional stability and ultimately, to U.S. security.Third, as ISIS has gained ground in Iraq, its wealth and ability to make money have increased. We need to stop their ability to sell the Syrian and Iraqi oil they attempt to market to the outside world. We also need a new diplomatic strategy to counter ISIS funding and support.Unfortunately, some of our partners in the Gulf have contributed to this problem. Others in the region have turned a blind eye to foreign fighters flocking to the fight. This needs to end.Finally, our partners in the region need our support. Jordan deserves special attention and assistance. Jordan is already dealing with an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict in Syria. Jordan is a close partner of the United States and a likely target of ISIS's attention. In recent days, the group captured the border crossing between Iraq and Jordan.The United States should find ways to make clear that the United States will defend Jordan's security, including militarily if necessary.Some will argue that the challenges faced by Iraq or countries such as Jordan are none of our business. That we have spent too many years, lives, and dollars trying to make Iraq and the broader Middle East a better place.None of the options before us are ideal, but the question is whether we take action against ISIS now or deal with the consequences later here on U.S. soil.The stakes are too high for us to continue to ignore this problem."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 24, 2015",Press Release - DEMAND Better Treatment of Our Veterans,"We've all seen the news and read the startling reports, and there is no other way to say it the VA has FAILED our veterans, and is continuing to fail them every day.That's why Marco led the fight in the Senate last year to pass the VA Management Accountability Act. It was based on a pretty simple premise from the private sector  if someone isn't doing their job at the VA, they can be fired.Nothing could be simpler. We need to make sure those directly responsible for the terrible performance of the VA can be held accountable.Unfortunately, the VA isn't using the law as intended, and Senator Rubio is continuing to fight for more accountability and better results from the VA  because nothing is more important than taking care of our veterans!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 24, 2015",Press Release - Rubio: Tax System Clouds Our American Dreams,"Americans Spend 114 Days Of The Year Working For The Government, And That's UnacceptableWhile working long hours in his job as a banquet bartender, my father found motivation in the idea that his efforts would give my siblings and me the chance at a life better than his own. He knew every dollar he brought home would go toward providing a happier childhood and a better future for his children. For him, we were the ""why"" of his work.I believe every American has a ""why"" for the work they do each day. Every one of us can point to something  or someone  and say: that is why I get up each morning to tend this bar, or staff this reception desk, or work the floor of this factory. These motivators form the basis of our American Dreams.As much as these dreams vary from person to person, we can all agree that funding a growing government is not our primary reason for working hard. But this Friday, as we mark Tax Freedom Day, we have a jarring illustration of just how much time we spend working to finance government rather than our own dreams.Tax Freedom Day is the first day of the year people have earned enough to pay their full annual tax burden. As of Friday, Americans have earned a combined $4.8 trillion in income since January 1st  the exact amount of state, local and federal taxes we will owe for 2015.Read the full Op-Ed at The Daily Caller here."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 27, 2015",Press Release - These Are the Biggest Issues Facing Our Generation,"What kind of country will we be?At the turn of the 19th century, a generation of Americans harnessed the power of the Industrial Age and transformed this country into the leading economy in the world. And the 20th century became the American Century.Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century.If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace ObamaCare, the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.If we create a 21st century system of higher education that provides working Americans the chance to acquire the skills they need, that no longer graduates students with mountains of debt and degrees that do not lead to jobs, and that graduates more students from high school ready to work, then our people will be prepared to seize their opportunities in the new economy.If we remember that family  not government  is the most important institution in society, that all life deserves protection, and that all parents deserve to choose the education that's right for their children, then we will have a strong people and a strong nation.And if America accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this administration's dangerous concessions to Iran, and its hostility to Israel; by reversing the hollowing out of our military; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources, care and gratitude they deserve; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world; then our nation will be safer, the world more stable, and our people more prosperous.This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 27, 2015",Press Release - Rubio: Students Deserve More Transparency,"What will I earn with this degree at this college?In Waukee, Iowa this weekend, Marco Rubio reiterated his proposal to ensure students and their families get all of the facts about their degree of choice at a given college or university before they take out student loans:""I believe that before any of our young people take out student loans, that school has to tell you how much you can expect to make when you graduate from that degree from that school so people can decide whether it's worth borrowing tens of thousands of dollars to major in basket weaving.""Struggling to repay student loans is a challenge Marco knows about first hand:""Each semester I would sign the promissory note borrowing more money. I never sat down to calculate how much I could expect to make once I graduated and whether it would be enough to afford my loan payments. There was no source to provide me with that information either.""Finally, in 1996 I graduated from law school. I had a Juris Doctor in one hand and over $100,000 in loans in the other. Then a few months later, the bills began to arrive.""My first job paid well for a young attorney. I was making over $50,000, which was more than either of my parents had ever made. I thought I was rich. But I was living with my parents and paying them rent. I was trying to save for my wedding and hopefully to buy a house. And when the $1500 monthly bills for my loans started coming in, I realized I couldn't pay them.""So I did deferment. And forbearance. I paid only interest for a while. But the loans quickly became my single largest expense. I remember looking at the coupon book for one of them and realizing that at the pace I was paying these things, I wouldn't pay them off until I was over 50.""The problem is that we are trying to prepare people for the new economy using a higher education system built for the old economy. As a result, many high-skilled, high-paying industries suffer from a shortage of labor, while too many low-paying industries suffer from a surplus.In the coming decade, 63 percent of jobs will require postsecondary training.If current education trends continue, we will fall short of filling these skilled positions by 300,000 people per year.Nationally, majors such as business, liberal arts, and hospitality have underemployment rates at or above 50 percent.Engineering, health services and education all have underemployment rates less than 25 percent.Students and their families need to be equipped with the information necessary to make well-informed decisions about which majors at which institutions are likely to yield the best return on investment. This is why Marco has authored and championed the ""Student Right to Know Before You Go Act,"" which aims to give students reliable data on how much they can expect to make versus how much they can expect to owe.Summarized from remarks of Marco Rubio during ""Making Community Colleges Work"" at Miami-Dade College."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 28, 2015",Press Release - Marco Signs Pledge Not To Raise Taxes,"Hailed as leader of taxpayer protection movementEarlier today, Marco made a written commitment to the taxpayers of the United States that as President, he will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.As a state legislator and now as U.S. Senator, Marco has made  and successfully kept  the same promise before.Here's what leading anti-tax increase activist Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, had to say:""Senator Rubio is a longtime leader in the taxpayer movement. By signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to the American people, Senator Rubio continues to protect American taxpayers against higher taxes. Senator Rubio understands that government should be reformed so that it takes and spends less of the taxpayers' money, and will oppose tax increases that paper over and continue the failures of the past.""Just last week, during Tax Freedom Day, Marco highlighted ""the fact that the $3.3 trillion we will pay in federal taxes this year is still not sufficient to cover federal spending. Washington, D.C. will spend a projected $580 billion more than it takes in this year, which will be added to our already $18 trillion national debt.""This year, Americans worked 114 days to pay their federal, state, and local tax burdens.All elected officials face a choice: Should they reform government to cost less or will they raise taxes instead of...Posted by Grover Norquist on Tuesday, April 28, 2015"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 30, 2015",Press Release - Iran Nuclear Deal: Obama's Desperation is Showing. And It's Dangerous,"As the nuclear negotiations with Iran reach their final phase, President Obama increasingly finds himself at odds with reality. Although the United States has worked for years to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while limiting Tehran's attempts to be a regional hegemon, the president's desperation to secure a deal - at whatever cost - places both of these goals at serious risk.Rather than stand firm against Iran's regional expansionism and its constantly shifting nuclear redlines, the president has gone to great lengths to avoid alienating Tehran and repeatedly revised his own definition of success. The result is that Iranian demands and red lines are dictating the contours of the emerging deal, instead of the interests of the U.S. and our Middle East allies forging the way ahead.This was seen most recently in the White House response to Iranian demands that all sanctions be lifted on day one. Even though the Obama administration has long assured deal skeptics that sanctions would be lifted only on proof of good behavior, Obama's State Department reiterated that sanctions relief will only begin ""after Iran has completed its major nuclear steps."" This position is itself a concession that could provide Iran with significant financial relief within months even before it comes completely clean about its past illicit activities.Massive up-front relief like this would reward Tehran for its intransigence and rob it of any incentive to keep its word. It would obviate any remaining pressure to follow through on the deal's requirements while using that cash to fuel its aggressive expansion throughout the Middle East.Click here to read the full Op-Ed at FoxNews.com"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"April 30, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio: My Most Important Jobs Are Husband & Father,"In Iowa last weekend, Marco joined David Brody from CBN News for a wide-ranging interview, which included a conversation about how Marco prioritizes his family life. So what are Marco's most important jobs?""I believe that generally speaking. I believe that at home my most important job is to be a husband to my wife and a father to my children. If I can't do that right, I can't lead a nation. If you can't lead your family, you can't lead a country. So obviously, it's an important aspect of it. One day I will no longer be in politics. One day I will no longer be a senator or president or anything else. But, I will always be a father and I will always be a husband. It's important for me to do those jobs right first.""Click here to watch the interview."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 5, 2015",Press Release - We Can't Turn To The Leaders Of Yesterday,"You've seen ""A New American Century"" everywhere since I announced for President. But what does that really mean? Let me tell you.Families are working harder than ever, but living paycheck to paycheck. Students are doing exactly what we told them to do and getting a college education. Yet they are graduating with mountains of debt and a degree that has no career path.The news says evil is winning and we are less capable than ever to stop it.Is it decline? Is it the normal course of history?No.It's a direct result of our leaders who have trapped us in the past.Leaders from yesterday still believe in outdated economic policies. They have forgotten one of the timeless truths of our world: Jobs and prosperity are tied to our ability to compete internationally.Today we face a fundamental economic transformation that leaves us with a choice.We can embrace the future or be left behind by history.In the New American Century we will reform our tax code and update our economic policies to make America the best place in the world to work, start a business and cultivate innovation.It's time to leave yesterday behind."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 6, 2015",Press Release - We Must Stop the American Dream From Slipping Away,"This is the central challenge of our timeMuch of who I am can be attributed to my grandfather. As I visited him on his deathbed and as he slipped away, I held his hand and I made him a promise: I was going to study. I was going to make something of myself. I would not waste the opportunity I had to achieve my dreams. And he squeezed my hand as if to let me know he was at peace.Every day since that day I have worked to make good on my promise to my grandfather. Like everyone, I've made mistakes and I've fallen short. But, thanks to him, to my parents, and to the promise of the country they adopted as their own, I have be able to realize his dream for me. I have a wife and family that I love. I am privileged to represent the people of Florida in the U.S. Senate and have the opportunity to run for President of the United States. My life is blessed.What bothers me most about my country today is that there are Americans like me  Americans who have worked hard and tried to do the right things to get ahead  but whose lives aren't so blessed. Jennifer, a young woman in her twenties who lives in Miami, is such an American, an heir to the American Dream just as I am. But her life has not worked out as planned  at least not so far. She has done everything right. She has played by the rules. But she hasn't achieved her American Dream. She's starting to doubt she ever will.When Jennifer was growing up, her father always told her that an education was the key to a life better than his own. She took him at his word, worked hard and went to Florida International University. Four years ago, she graduated with a degree in public administration. She was the first in her family to go to college. Despite having paid for what she thought was the ticket to a better life, Jennifer has begun to wonder whether college was a waste of her time and money. The only job she can find has nothing to do with her degree. Her salary is barely enough to cover he monthly bills, let alone put anything aside to save for a h ouse of her own. To make matters worse, her father recently got laid off. And because she doesn't make enough to help him out, they've had to do what too many other American have had to do: form a ""multigenerational housing unit"". In other words, they've moved in with Jennifer's grandmother.A generation ago, Jennifer's current wage might have been enough for her to reach the middle class. But today, her monthly expense are prohibitive: $300 for her car payment, $200 for her car insurance, $200 for gas, $200 for food, $100 for her cell phone bill  just to name a few. She'd like to go back to school to earn a graduate degree, but she doesn't want the $50,000 in debt she would incur. She has none of the confidence, held by earlier generations of Americans, that investing in herself through education will pay off in the job market.Like me, Jennifer grew up in a country that has always prided itself on offering an equal opportunity for its people to get ahead  not a guarantee of equal success, but of an equal opportunity to go as far as your hard work and your wits can take you. People everywhere dream of better lives for themselves and for their children, of course. Yet for the vast majority of humanity, and for the vast majority of history, this simply wasn't possible. As my grandfather never let me forget, though, it is different in America. Here, so many people from humble or disadvantage backgrounds have achieved their ambitions that this universal hope has been given a name. It has come to be known as the American Dream.The American Dream still lives. But it is slipping further and further out of reach for millions of Americans like Jennifer, and this is the central challenge of our time. How we respond to this challenge  and whether we are successful  will determine whether we continue to be an exceptional nation. This is why I'm running for President of the United States."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 8, 2015",Press Release - This is Where Liberals Have Gotten Us,"Fewer Americans are working than at any time since Jimmy CarterFor conservatives especially, we are facing a defining moment. The failure of government-centered, command-and-control liberalism to lift the poor and sustain the middle class is apparent as never before. Whether we are able to step forward with our own solutions  and not simply rail against the expansion of the state  will determine our future as a movement.Our recent history in this regard is not encouraging. President Barack Obama was elected on a promise to fight for poor and middle-class Americas. During his campaigns for president, he talked directly to the American people about the girl who's worried she can't go to college because she can't afford it, about the dad who doesn't know if his wages will cover the winter heating bill, about the single mom who's stressed about what her children are doing after school while she's at work. Meanwhile, my party talked about tax cuts and waited for the American people to punish the president for the economy. They didn't. He won. We lost.And yet seven years into his presidency, struggling Americans are  by every measure  worse off today than they were before he took office. Why has a president elected as a champion of the disadvantaged failed so miserably at helping them? Because, like most liberals, he doesn't understand the real causes of the erosion of equal opportunity we are experiencing today. He has raised taxes, increased regulations and taken over health care  all according to the outdated liberal theory that Americans struggle when government doesn't tax the rich enough and spend on the poor enough. But the results, such as they are, speak for themselves. After seven years of old-school liberalism, fewer Americans are working than at any time since the Great Recession in the first quarter of 2014.It's getting harder for millions of Americans to get ahead, not because our taxes are too low or our government is too stingy. The poor and the middle class are struggling because while our economy is undergoing a dramatic and disruptive transformation, our policies have not changed with it. Our economy is no longer producing well-paying jobs, not enough people have the skills they need for better-paying jobs and the values needed for success are eroding at an alarming rate.It's time for A New American Century. Join our fight and help lead American in a new direction."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 9, 2015",Press Release - My Vision For Europe,"By Marco RubioAs seen in Politico on 5/8/2015Today is the 70th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe  a day that stands as one of the greatest triumphs of freedom over oppression, liberty over tyranny, and good over evil in the history of the world. It speaks to the power of free peoples and free nations uniting together to pursue shared security and shared prosperity.Even after 70 years, the U.S.-European partnership continues to play a vital role in global affairs. The defense of our people, the promotion of our interests, and the stability of an increasingly interconnected world all require us to cooperate closely, particularly given the renewed challenges we face.One such challenge is Russia's blatant attempt to overturn the post-World War II order in Europe. Handling this crisis will require innovative thinking from our alliance. Our goal should never be to needlessly antagonize Russia, but rather to ensure our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and rollback Russian aggression are coupled with a forward-looking agenda for Russia's own future.....A more robust response to Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine would reflect the same shared values that emerged victorious 70 years ago today. That victory was not just about the defeat of an enemy; it was also about the spread of a sacred ideal. As is written on the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C.: ""Americans came to liberate, not to conquer  to restore freedom and to end tyranny.""As we face our own challenges today, let us never forget the sacrifices made by our ancestors 70 years ago. Let us always remember that the freedoms we cherish now were preserved by those who came before us, and that just like the greatest generation, we have a duty to preserve liberty for all those in the transatlantic community and beyond.To read the article in its entirety, please click here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 11, 2015",Press Release - Strengthen Programs That Keep Americans Safe,"An Op-Ed by Marco Rubio as seen inUSA Today, 5/10/15.We must provide those we charge with protecting us every tool they need to do so.Today our nation faces a greater threat of terrorist attack than any time since Sept. 11, 2001. Because of the dedicated work of U.S. intelligence, military and law enforcement personnel, Americans have been largely kept safe for almost 14 years. A major contributor to this success has been the development and use of counterterrorism tools such as those authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Patriot Act.After the Sept. 11 attacks, the federal government mobilized to defend the country and prevent further loss of innocent life. This included the NSA's collection of bulk telephone metadata.Bulk metadata includes phone numbers, the time and duration of calls  nothing else. No content of any phone calls is collected. The government is not listening to your phone calls or recording them unless you are a terrorist or talking to a terrorist outside the United States.Despite recent court rulings, this program has not been found unconstitutional, and the courts have not ordered a halt to the program.In fact, this program has been found legal and constitutional by at least 15 federal judges serving on the FISA Court on 35 occasions.There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program. Internet search providers, Internet-based email accounts, credit card companies and membership discount cards used at the grocery store all collect far more personal information on Americans than the bulk metadata program.FBI Director James Comey warned last week that potentially, thousands of terrorist sympathizers in the United States are being self-radicalized online by foreign terrorists associated with the Islamic State who are urging them to conduct attacks against Americans in our cities and towns.Given these threats, now is not the time to end this program, which remains essential to our security. Congress has until the end of May to act before the current authorities expire. We must renew these authorities and provide those we charge with protecting us every tool they need to do so.View the article as it originally appeared here."

He'll outline his plan to ensure American leadership in the world in the 21st Century.The Rubio Doctrine consists of 3 pillars:American strengthThe protection of the American economy in a globalized worldMoral clarity regarding America's core valuesHere are some other previews of the speech:Rubio, 43, argues that the government must ""adequately fund our military,"" even in times of peace and stability.""Rubio Promoting A Strong Military As Part Of Foreign Policy,"" Associated Press""Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration,"" Rubio will say, according to excerpts of a speech he plans to deliver later on Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations.In the excerpts of the speech, which is scheduled for 3.30 p.m. EDT, Rubio outlined a more aggressive approach to world affairs than Obama has pursued at a time when China is attempting to assert greater control over the South China Sea, a vital shipping route, and Iran has threatened commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.""Presidential candidate Rubio vows to use U.S. power to guard economic interests,"" ReutersRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will propose the U.S. use force to defend American economic interests, including the ""disruption of economic activity"" caused by one country invading another or by ""disruptions"" in American shipping.""Marco Rubio: Use U.S. might to protect business,"" USA Today"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 13, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio: This Is How America Should Lead,"Marco Details His Foreign Policy VisionIn order for this to be a new American Century, we need a president who will answer the question ""how should we lead?"" with clarity and consistency. Marco will be that president.I'd like to begin my remarks today by quoting from the closing of another set of remarks  from a speech that echoes across history due to its proximity to tragedy, but that stands more importantly, more powerfully, as a testament to the bipartisan tradition of strong American leadership.On the morning of November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy spoke at the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce on the need for a strong and active America, and he ended with this:""I am confident, as I look to the future, that our chances for security, our chances for peace, are better than they have been in the past. And the reason is because we are stronger. And with that strength is a determination to not only maintain the peace, but also the vital interests of the United States. To that great cause, Texas and the United States are committed.""These were the final words of the final speech President Kennedy ever delivered. But the commitment to American Strength he spoke of lived on long after him  across decades, across both parties  eventually bringing about the conclusion of the Cold War and the emergence of America as the world's only superpower.President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what our current president does not: that American Strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it. And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American Strength has not. It has only grown more pressing as the world has grown more interconnected.In recent decades, technology has demolished barriers of travel and trade, transforming our national economy into a global one. The prosperity of our people now depends on their ability to interact freely and safely in the international marketplace. Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town. It can cause the cost of living to rise, or entire industries to shed jobs and crumble.Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy.Sadly, President Obama disagrees with that simple truth. He entered office believing America was too hard on our adversaries, too engaged in too many places, and that if we just took a step back, did some ""nation building at home""  ceding leadership to other countries  America would be better liked and the world better off.So he wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American Strength. He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels, our Navy at pre-WWI levels, and our Air Force with the smallest and oldest combat force in its history.He demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain. He criticized America for having ""arrogance"" and the audacity to ""dictate our terms"" to other nations. From his reset with Russia, to his open hand to Iran, to his unreciprocated opening to Cuba, he has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.In just the last two years, we've seen an emboldened Russia invade Ukraine. We've seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate. We've seen one of the most devastating humanitarian catastrophes in decades as hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant. We've seen the largest migration of refugees since World War II, bringing instability to an entire region and putting whole generations at risk of radicalization. We've seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas. We've seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations. We've seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people. We've seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.And most threatening of all, we've seen Iran expand its influence throughout the Middle East and threaten to annihilate Israel as it moves closer to a nuclear weapons capability. The president's proposed deal with Tehran will likely lead to a cascade of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and could force Israel to take bold action to defend itself, making war with Iran even more likely. President Obama's desperation to sign a deal  any deal  has caused him to elevate politics over policy, legacy over leadership, and adversaries over allies.The likely impacts of this deal, along with the broader unraveling of global order, underscore a truth we must never again forget: America plays a part on the world stage for which there is no understudy. When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place. And the result is chaos.I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops. It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one. It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military. It is up to our next president to restore our people's faith in the promise and power of the American ideal.We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration's foreign policy  a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst. The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.While America did not intend to become the world's indispensable power, that is exactly what our economic and political freedoms have made us. The free nations of the world still look to America to champion our shared ideals. Vulnerable nations still depend on us to deter aggression from their larger neighbors. Oppressed peoples still turn their eyes toward our shores, wondering if we hear their cries, wondering if we notice their afflictions.We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us. The question before us is not ""should we lead?"" but rather ""how should we lead?"" What principles should govern the exercise of our power?The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency  one who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world, and who will adhere to that doctrine with the principled devotion that has marked the bipartisan tradition of presidential leadership from Truman to Kennedy to Reagan.Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president.***My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.The first is American Strength.This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest. When America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.To ensure our strength never falters, we must always plan ahead. It takes forethought to design and many years to build the capabilities we may need at a moment's notice. So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military. This would be a priority even in times of peace and stability, though the world today is neither peaceful nor stable.To begin, we need to undo the damage caused by sequestration, which is why I've endorsed the National Defense Panel's recommendation that we ""return as soon as possible"" to Secretary Gates' fiscal year 2012 budget baseline.Adequately funding the military will allow us not only to grow our forces, but also to modernize them, which in turn will allow us to remain on the cutting edge in every arena before us  land, sea and air, but also cyberspace and outer space: the battlefields of the 21st century.By modernizing and innovating, we can ensure that we never send our troops into a fair fight; but rather always equip them with the upper hand. And when they come home, we will be as firmly committed to their wellbeing as they have been to ours.A strong military also means a strong intelligence community, equipped with all it needs to defend the homeland from extremism  both homegrown and foreign-trained. Key to this will be permanently extending Section 215 of the Patriot Act. We cannot let politics cloud the importance of this issue. We must never find ourselves looking back after a terrorist attack and saying we could have done more to save American lives.Some will argue that with all the fiscal challenges facing our nation, we simply cannot afford to invest in our military. The truth is we cannot afford not to invest in it. We must remember that the defense budget is not the primary driver of our debt, and every time we try to cut a dollar from our military it seems to cost us several more just to make up for it. This is because the successes of all our initiatives depend on the safety of the American people and the stability of the global economy.And that brings me to the second pillar of my doctrine, which is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.When America was founded, it took more than ten weeks to travel to Europe. In the 19th century, the steam engine cut that to around 12 days. In the 20th century, the airplane cut it to around 6 hours. Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone.Millions of the best jobs in this century will depend on international trade. It is more important than ever that Congress give the President Trade Promotion Authority so we can finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. These agreements will create millions of jobs and cement U.S. strategic partnerships in Asia, South America, and Europe.Those such as Secretary Clinton, who preach a message of international engagement and ""smart power"" yet are not willing to stand up to special interests and support free trade, are either hypocritical or fail to grasp trade's role as a tool of statecraft that can bolster our relationships with partners and create millions of American jobs.As president, I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space. This includes the economic disruption caused when one country invades another, as well as the chaos caused by disruptions in chokepoints such as the South China Sea or the Strait of Hormuz.Russia, China, Iran, or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration. Gone will be the days of debating where a ship is flagged or whether it is our place to criticize territorial expansionism. In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence.The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America's core values.We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims. America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.In recent years, the ideals that have long formed the backbone of American foreign policy  a passionate defense of human rights, the strong support of democratic principles, and the protection of the sovereignty of our allies  have been replaced by, at best, caution, and at worst, outright willingness to betray those values for the expediency of negotiations with repressive regimes.This is not only morally wrong; it is contrary to our interests. Because wherever freedom and human rights spread, partners for our nation are born. But whenever our foreign policy comes unhinged from its moral purpose, it weakens global stability and forms cracks in our national resolve.In this century, we must restore America's willingness to think big  to state boldly what we stand for and why it is right. Just as Reagan never flinched in his criticisms of the Soviet Union's political and economic repressions, we must never shy away from demanding that China allow true freedom for its 1.3 billion people. Nor should we hesitate in calling the source of atrocities in the Middle East by its real name  radical Islam.As president, I will support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce our alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, maintain a robust commitment to transparent and effective foreign assistance programs, and advance the rights of the vulnerable  including women and the religious minorities that are so often persecuted  so that the afflicted peoples of the world know the truth: the American people hear their cries, see their suffering, and most of all, desire their freedom.Those are the three pillars of my doctrine  American Strength, the protection of our global economy, and a proud advocacy for America's core values.This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it. It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls  one that is overseen by the White House but not micromanaged by it, and that will restore America's status as a nation that shapes global events rather than one that is shaped by them.**I want to allow plenty of time to discuss how this vision would work in practice. So let me close with one final thought.The president of the United States is constantly called upon to make difficult decisions in the defense of our nation, and these decisions come with a cost far greater than money.My greatest honor in serving in the U.S. Senate has been working with our men and women in uniform, our intelligence professionals, our diplomats, and our veterans. I have seen the tremendous sacrifices they and their families make, but I have also seen the tremendous impact those sacrifices have had on the world.I have talked to Filipino Typhoon survivors who knew that an American carrier over the horizon meant food, water, and survival.I have talked to Japanese and South Koreans who knew an enduring U.S. presence allowed their nations to prosper.I have talked to Europeans convinced that America's role as a security guarantor had prevented conflict on what had been a blood-soaked continent for centuries.I have talked to American business leaders who knew their ability to access millions of international customers and create thousands of domestic jobs has hinged on American Strength.Most personally, I have seen American freedom and security play out in the lives of my parents, my children and myself.But increasingly in recent years, I've also met people frustrated by the direction of American leadership:Cuban dissidents devastated by the President's concessions to the Castro regime for nothing in return  North Koreans disappointed by America's reluctance to speak out against modern-day gulags Arabs and Israelis worried about America's indifference to Iran's growing influence Syrians crushed that America failed to prevent their country from descending into chaos Afghans worried that America will leave them like we left IraqEuropeans anxious about Russia's bellicose rhetoric and actionsAnd many of our own people, concerned about their safety in an increasingly chaotic world.Of all the important duties of the presidency, and there are many, protecting our people and their interests  wherever those interests lie  is the highest honor, the greatest burden, and the most profound privilege. The first duty of the president, as written in the Constitution, is not ""taxer in chief"" or ""regulator in chief""  it is Commander in Chief.Every presidential candidate must be prepared to execute this duty. And any who advocates averting our eyes from the dangers of the world must be prepared to explain, against six years of counter evidence, how retrenchment and retreat will lead to a safer world. They will not.Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace. America led valiantly in the last century  from Truman to Kennedy to Reagan. And because of our leadership, that century became an American Century.Following World War II, Pope Pius the 12th noted as much when he wrote: ""America has a genius for great and unselfish deeds. Into the hands of America God has placed the destiny of an afflicted mankind.""I believe America still has that genius. I believe mankind remains afflicted, and that its destiny remains in our hands. And I believe America will continue to advance the cause of peace and freedom in our time.Because we will, America will remain safe and strong.And because we will, the 21st century will be another American Century."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 14, 2015",Press Release - Nothing Matters If We Aren't Safe,"The fundamental problem we have in America is that nothing matters if we aren't safe.The economy will always be a major domestic issue. It's the daily concern of millions of Americans, but it won't matter if we can't keep the people and processes that run it safe from foreign threats.From China, to Russia, to Iran, there are multiple threats to our national security at this very moment.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 20, 2015",Press Release - The Cuban People Deserve Freedom & Democracy,"Freedom is the GoalMay 20, 2015By Marco RubioAs we mark Cuban Independence Day this Wednesday, we must never forget that the only true form of independence for the Cuban people is freedom and democracy, and we must recommit our state and nation to the goal of helping them achieve that vital objective.I am the proud son of Cuban-American parents and was raised in a community of Cuban exiles. The trajectory of my life has been a product of their support, of true freedom, and of a uniquely American ideal: that where you come from does not determine where you can go or who you can be. Yet just 90 miles from the shores of our nation are men and women of my ancestry and heritage who still do not have freedom. Yet they look to this country for the hope that they someday will.I believe we must not fail them. In the last decade and a half, every single country in the Western Hemisphere has had a free and fair election at some point except for one: Cuba. The United States has always stood on the side of peoples around the world who yearn for freedom. But today, our president has decided to take a different approach. Not only has he forsaken our duty to advocate for oppressed peoples, but he has traveled many miles in the opposite direction: going so far as to pay homage to the whims of the very dictatorial regime that denies the freedom of the Cuban people.In defending his egregious concessions to the Castro regime, President Obama often makes the argument that if the embargo hasn't worked for 50 years, we should try something new. My question is: Why hasn't he tried making a similar argument to the Castro regime? For over 50 years, they've tried tyranny and Communism and it hasn't worked. The Cuban people today have a standard of living well below that of virtually every other nation in the hemisphere.Click here to read the full Op-Ed at MiamiHerald.com"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 22, 2015",Press Release - This is Why Hillary Clinton's Vision is Just the Lazy Politics of Yesterday,"An Op-Ed by Marco RubioOriginally published on Seacoastonline.comWhen Hillary Clinton arrives in New Hampshire today, her plan will be to play it safe. With no serious challengers in her party, she will feel no pressure to explain her vision, offer new ideas, respond to the concerns of voters, or even answer questions from reporters. Her approach will be to avoid high risk appearances, do the bare minimum required of a candidate, and continue coasting to her party's nomination. Those who lose under this strategy, unfortunately, are the people of New Hampshire.A campaign for president should not be seen as an inconvenient formality on one's long-planned journey to higher office. A campaign should be a vibrant contest of ideas in which voters run the show, ask the questions, weigh the proposals, and test the mettle of those who ask for the privilege of leading them. The trouble that comes when every interaction with voters is limited and carefully stage managed, and when every public event is rigidly scripted and rehearsed, is that the spirited discussions that should mark every campaign simply never happen.As a result, Hillary Clinton's ideas aren't just bad; they suffer from a dangerous lack of imagination and inspiration. Her reluctance to have meaningful interactions with the people she hopes to lead manifests itself in a vision that is tired, unoriginal and unresponsive to the concerns of the middle class or those hoping to reach it. Her ideas, to the extent she has even presented them, recycle old themes and old approaches from a century that is long over. They make no effort to grapple with the complexity of the modern challenges facing the American people.For example, rather than dream up exciting new ideas for revolutionizing higher education in this century  ideas that would bring a degree within reach of busy single moms, struggling young Americans, and everyone in search of a better job  she proposes pumping more money into the current unaffordable and inaccessible system. And rather than create fresh 21st century economic solutions that will empower every American with opportunity, she falls back on big government policies that will limit growth and stifle job creation. This is the lazy politics of yesterday, and it isn't leadership.Yesterday is over. As she visits New Hampshire today, I challenge Hillary Clinton to start having candid discussions with voters and the media. I challenge her to accept questions from the public about her ideas, and to explain how those ideas would confront the unique challenges of our globalized, post-industrial economy. I challenge her to answer to the widespread concerns regarding her tenure as Secretary of State and her cozy financial relationship with foreign leaders. If she believes that these are not issues voters should be concerned about, I challenge her to explain why.And as I spend more time in New Hampshire, I encourage everyone reading this to hold me to the same standard. Continue engaging me on my ideas and how they would apply to the challenges in your life. Come to our town hall meetings and roundtables and ask me tough questions on issues that concern you. That's what this campaign is all about. Only through dialogue, discussion and debate can we, together, decide on the future we want for our nation. I am confident that my vision will make a positive difference in the lives of Granite Staters and all Americans, and I am eager to make that case to everyone who will listen. I hope, for the sake of voters in New Hampshire and across America, that Hillary Clinton will adopt a similar outlook sooner rather than later. New Hampshire expects and deserves better.View article as it originally appeared here ."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 25, 2015",Press Release - Memorial Day Message: A Time To Put Aside Partisanship,"Memorial Day has always been a time of unity for our nation. It's a time when we put aside partisanship and politics, and come together to honor the memory of all those who have given what President Lincoln called ""the last full measure of devotion"" to America.As we remember the fallen this weekend, we are also reminded of their brothers and sisters in arms, and the many millions of veterans who have given so selflessly in service to our nation.Meeting our responsibility to them requires words as well as deeds.As president, I will devote the necessary resources to our national defense so that we equip our armed forces properly  with the latest and greatest equipment, but also with policies and strategies befitting the greatest nation on earth. I will ensure they never are sent into a fair fight, but rather are always equipped with the upper hand.I will be as equally dedicated to their well-being after they return home. Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs is buckling under the weight of its own bureaucracy, slowed to tragic levels of unresponsiveness, and still feeling the effects of scandal. I believe they deserve better, and better is what they will get when I am President.As we reflect this weekend on all those who have lost their lives in defense of freedom, let us reflect, too, on those who have returned home. Sacrifice does not end on the battlefield but continues on for a lifetime. To honor that sacrifice, we must come together to demand the dignity our Armed Forces and veterans deserve. And we remember with great admiration and pride, all those who have served our country and who we have lost  who gave their lives to build the single greatest nation in all of human history."""

Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 27, 2015",Press Release - This is What You Need To Tell Your Friends About Hillary Clinton,"You know we have to stop herWhen Hillary Clinton campaigns in South Carolina today, she will do so with the belief that it is her turn to be president of the United States. This will be apparent in the way she continues to do the bare minimum required of a presidential candidate, taking little care to explain her vision, offer new ideas, respond to the concerns of voters, or even sit for interviews with reporters. This approach may be convenient for her, but it does a grave disservice to the people of South Carolina and our nation.A campaign for president should be a vibrant contest of ideas in which voters run the show, ask the questions, weigh the proposals, and test the mettle of those who ask for the privilege of leading them. No one is entitled to the presidency, and no candidate has the right to skip the process of laying out a vision simply because he or she has the deepest connections in Washington or the most money in big-dollar donations. The office must always go to the candidate with the best vision for the future of America, as decided by the voters.The presidency, in many ways, reflects what is most special about America. In this country, what your last name is, what life you were born into, or how much money you have does not determine who you can be, where you can go, or what opportunities you can enjoy. I know this because I've lived it. I was blessed to be born in the one country on earth where my parents  a bartender and a maid  could give me all the opportunities necessary to become a candidate for the highest office in the land.This is not my story alone. It is our story. It is the story of the American Dream  a Dream that is not about wealth or power, but rather about having the opportunity to build a better life for yourself and your children. The question facing the voters of South Carolina and our entire nation in this election is this: Will we save and extend the American Dream to reach more people in this century than ever before, or will we become the first generation in history to leave our children worse off than ourselves?I am running for president not because America owes me something. It does not. I am running for president because I owe America a debt that I must try to repay. And the only way I will ever repay it is by ensuring that everyone in this nation enjoys the same opportunity that my family has enjoyed: the opportunity to earn better lives, better pay, and better futures for themselves and their children. That goal can only be achieved if we, together as one people, look to the future.Rather than attempt to bring back yesterday's jobs, we must create the better-paying jobs of the new century. Rather than cling to yesterday's higher education system, which was designed when only a small percentage of our people needed degrees, we must create a new system of higher education that is accessible and affordable for all our people. Rather than rely on yesterday's economic policies, we must embrace the promise and potential of our globalized, technology-driven economy.As president, I will look to the future because I believe with all my heart that it is even brighter than our past. Unfortunately, I am not convinced Hillary Clinton has even asked herself what might be required to secure America's future. From the looks of her campaign so far, she is too busy dreaming of her path to power to ask what she will do with that power should she attain it.During her visit today, I encourage the people of South Carolina to hold her to a higher standard, and I encourage Hillary Clinton to lay out a serious vision for her presidency. I look forward to continuing to do the same with each visit I make to the Palmetto State. The people of South Carolina deserve to know the choice before them in this election, which I believe is a choice between the past and the future."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 28, 2015",Press Release - This Won't Completely End Modern Day Slavery,"Last week, the Senate passed a bill I sponsored with Senator Shaheen called ""The Girls Count Act."" The focus of this bill is to support the rights of women and girls in developing nations by helping their countries establish birth registries.Ensuring that every child is acknowledged at birth by official records is a vital way to protect children from the dangers of exploitation and human trafficking, which devastate millions of young lives every year.More than 50 million children around the world were not registered at birth in the past year, most of whom were girls.In addition to leaving them vulnerable to horrific violations of their basic human rights, this also leaves them excluded from vital services in their countries, such as education and medical care.As Americans, I believe we are called upon to defend the rights of the vulnerable and oppressed whenever possible, and I am proud of the way this bill advances that cause."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"May 29, 2015",Press Release - The VA Has A Rotten Core,"An Op-Ed by Marco Rubio, originally published in the Orlando Sentinel 5/28/15This week, the doors opened at the long awaited Orlando Veterans Affairs Medical Center on the Lake Nona campus. This was a welcome occasion for veterans throughout Central Florida, who will now be cared for in this new state-of-the-art hospital.Although there is much to celebrate about this milestone, it also reminds us of the need for closer scrutiny of all that is going wrong at the VA. That includes all the problems encountered during the construction of this hospital, which finally opened three years later than originally promised and cost hundreds of millions of dollars over budget. This is not an isolated problem. Just last week, more problems emerged with the new Denver VA hospital project, which is already years overdue and had cost overruns of more than $1 billion.Questions need to be asked, and people need to be held accountable for what amounts to broken promises to our veterans that squander precious resources. In the coming days, I will formally request that the Government Accountability Office conduct a stem to stern review of what went wrong, as well as all that went right, with the Orlando project. It's critically important that the VA learn from its mistakes and apply these lessons as it embarks on a major nationwide wave of constructing new medical facilities in accordance with last year's VA reform legislation that I helped turn into law....It is fitting that the new VA hospital in Orlando was opened during the week when we observed Memorial Day. We were reminded of all the heroes we've lost as well as those who have returned home from war forever changed, physically and mentally, and in need of life-long medical care that the VA is uniquely positioned to provide.Let's honor their service by rooting out incompetence and mischief in the VA and making it a health system our veterans can believe in again.To read the article in its entirety, please click here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 1, 2015",Press Release - No More Blank Checks For The EPA,"Regulations cost us in economic growth and job creation because they are expensive to comply with. It is especially costly for small and new businesses that cannot afford the costs of hiring a lawyer to help them comply with complicated regulations These regulations, and the new ones that keep showing up, also create uncertainty.A prime example of these costly, unnecessary regulations is the EPA's Clean Water Rule. We want to know that our drinking water is clean, but this goes too far in trying to regulate bodies of water as small as ponds on private property.This hurts our farmers, small businesses and manufacturers who cannot bear the burden of another tax disguised as a mandatory regulation.One of the best ways I know to ease this burden on the American people is to force federal agencies to enact only those regulations that serve an essential role. There will be no more blank checks for regulators and the lawmakers who enable them."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 2, 2015","Press Release - We Need Our Leaders To Grow Paychecks, Not Bills","I couldn't make it to the Economic Summit in Florida due to an important vote, but I wanted to share my message about the economic future of our country.In this new century we are facing the most significant period of change since the Industrial Revolution. Instead of benefitting from new opportunities, our people are being held back by challenges. While our economy is transforming, our policies and leaders are not.The time has come for a new generation of leaders  leaders who will create a growing economy, not a growing government, more paychecks and not more bills.What we must change now is our leaders. If we can make our time the time of new ideas  we will be well on our way to A New American Century."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 3, 2015",Press Release - The World Has Changed And Here's The Proof,"The rise of dozens of developed economies means we have more competition for jobs than ever before. Yet our tax code makes it more expensive to invest in America in comparison to our competition. Rapid advances in technology and the globalization of the economy have meant that many of the jobs that once made the American Dream possible are now being outsourced or automated. Overall, our regulations are causing us to lose our advantage in innovation.Many of our low-skill jobs once paid enough to make it to the middle class. But now many of them pay wages that have not kept up with the cost of living. Today's better-paying jobs require higher education or skills training, but we have an outdated, expensive, inaccessible education system that fails to graduate students with skills that prepare them for work. Older students who have to work full-time and raise a family struggle to access a higher education system that wasn't built for them. And a college education has become more expensive than ever, leaving millions of young Americans with massive student loans.Underlying these economic changes are societal ones. To succeed in life, you don't just need skills and a good job. You need to have values like hard work, discipline and self-control. No one is born with these values. They have to be taught by families and faith. But today, we face a serious erosion of family life in America. Millions of children are growing up in unstable homes in which they are not taught the values necessary for personal and economic success.The result is a pervasive  and growing  sense of insecurity. Instead of adjusting to the realities of the new era, however, our leaders are doubling down on policies and institutions designed in the middle of the last century. Our taxes, our schools, our regulations, our immigration system and our poverty and retirement programs  they're all relics of the last century. They were conceived and created at a time when America faced limited international competition, at a time when, even with no formal education, you could find a low-skill job that paid a middle-class wage. But this is not the world we live in anymore.Liberals want to spend more money on the ideas of yesterday. Some conservatives want to keep the ideas of yesterday and just spend less on them, as if programs that aren't working will somehow be made to function if only their budgets are cut. But neither of these approaches will ever work.No matter how much we spend on the ideas of the last century, or how much we streamline some of them, they are never going to help us reclaim the American Dream for all.America needs leaders who understand the new world we live in and who will promote and implement new ideas for a new era. We can't solve our 21st Century challenges by simply investing into 20th century solutions."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 9, 2015",Press Release - Our Response To The NYT's Latest Attack On Marco,"Elitist New York Times calls Marco's Student Loan Debts ""A Deep Financial Hole of his Own Making""June 9, 2015Alex ConantThe New York Times today attacked Marco because he could not afford to pay for college, arrogantly describing his student loan debt as 'a deep financial hole of his own making.' The attack from The Times is just the latest in their continued hits against Marco and his family.First The New York Times attacked Marco over traffic tickets, and now they think he doesn't have enough money. Of course if he was worth millions, The Times would then attack him for being too rich, like they did to Mitt Romney.What The Times misses is that getting rich is not what has driven Senator Rubio's financial decisions. His goal at this stage in his life is to provide his four children with a good home, a quality education, and a safe and happy upbringing. As he wrote in his book,""The mark I make in this world will not be decided by how much money I make or how many titles I attain. Rather, the greatest mark I can leave is the one I will make as a father and a husband.""The Truth About Marco's Personal FinancesMarco has a single debt, the mortgage on his home.Marco has decided to send his four children to private Christian schools in Miami, and has created college savings accounts for each kid.Over the last several years, Marco has donated close to $150,000 to charity.Marco's monthly financial obligations do not put his family finances above the 43 percent debt-to-income ratio the federal government suggests is worrisome.Marco's paid off over $150,000 in student loans from his undergraduate and law degree."

Student Loans Provide Opportunity to MillionsIn the latest story about my background (""Struggles With Finances Track Marco Rubio's Career,"" June 9), the authors state that I began my career ""in a deep financial hole of [my] own making"" because I took out student loans to pay for college and law school.It's true that my parents weren't wealthy enough to pay for my higher education. Like millions of Americans, I had to attend college on federal grants and loans. When I graduated from law school I had close to $150,000 in student debt, which I've only paid off in recent years.Your article is accurate in its assertion that I do not come from wealth. My father drove the same 1973 Chevy Impala for 20 straight years, owned only two pairs of shoes, and wore the same Seiko watch until the day he died, even though the gold plating had worn off years before. Nonetheless, I truly believe I am a child of privilege, because my parents made it the purpose of their days to ensure that I could live the life they never could themselves, and I was born in the one country where you don't have to come from wealth or power to achieve a better life.This election is about ensuring everyone, regardless of the family they were born into, has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream in the 21st century. This will be achieved when our economy creates the good paying jobs of the future, and when our higher education system equips all of our people with the skills needed to fill them. That is the message of my campaign, and that will be the purpose of my presidency.Marco Rubio"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 16, 2015",Press Release - The Next Major Challenge,"Why the World Has Become a More Dangerous PlaceOriginally published in TIME, 6.15.2015This month, the Obama administration will begin the process of dismantling one such program that has helped to keep our people safe since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This so-called ""Section 215 metadata program"" authorized by the Patriot Act, which was closely overseen by Congress and the courts for more than a decade, has allowed us to thwart terrorist plots....Unfortunately, misinformation, fear-mongering and the allure of campaign fundraising all contributed to its expiration, its explicit prohibition in the future, and its replacement with a weaker and untested system that fails to require phone companies to maintain records that we may one day need to track terrorists. Rather than use what power remains in his bully pulpit, President Obama opted to be a bystander and let this program be killed, even though he had previously championed it. Even worse, the White House clearly sent the message to the heads of the intelligence agencies that they needed to stand down from advocating for the program. As a result, the American people are now less safe.......We need clear leadership from the commander-in-chief to confront the myriad of national security challenges facing the nation. It is increasingly clear that the task of ensuring that those we entrust to protect us have every tool they need for the job will fall to the next president. It is also apparent that through their demagoguery on this issue, through their support for abandoning these crucial programs or through their outright silence that some who aspire to that office are not up to the challenge any more than President Obama is.

Already, our campaign has made great progress in building teams on the ground and meeting with voters. Here's a quick snapshot of our work on the ground  made possible thanks to your support.Since launching our campaign in April, Marco has already made two visits to the Hawkeye State. Our state chairman, Senator Jack Whitver is leading a growing team on the ground and Marco is drawing larger crowds with every visit. In April, Jack hosted a house party in support of Marco at his home in Ankeny. Marco has made other visits to Ames, Boone, and Des Moines, and will be back in the state soon.Marco is in the Granite State today and will be participating in a veterans event and hosting a town hall meeting. In May, he spoke at the First in the Nation Summit, went door knocking with Dennis Green for his special election for state representative, and attended a house party in Manchester.In the Palmetto State, Team Marco continues to thrive  last week we announced two co-chairs for the state: Rep. Nathan Ballentine and Rep. Neal Collins. Last month, Marco spoke to a packed house at Cong. Jeff Duncan's SC Freedom Summit, met with faith and business leaders, and shook hands with voters at Greenville's Artisphere festival. All of Team Marco's thoughts are with the strong people of South Carolina as the state continues to heal and come together at this time.Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison leads our team in the Silver State, where Marco celebrated his birthday last month. During our most recent visit to Nevada, Marco met with grassroots leaders, hosted a roundtable with technology entrepreneurs, and attended a house party in Reno.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"June 26, 2015",Press Release - Court Decision Short Circuits Political Process?,"I believe that marriage, as the key to strong family life, is the most important institution in our society and should be between one man and one woman. People who disagree with the traditional definition of marriage have the right to change their state laws. That is the right of our people, not the right of the unelected judges or justices of the Supreme Court. This decision short-circuits the political process that has been underway on the state level for years.While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law. As we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood.The next president and all in public office must strive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions and millions of Americans whose faiths hold a traditional view of marriage. This is a constitutional duty, not a political opinion. Our nation was founded on the human right of religious freedom, and our elected leaders have a duty to protect that right by ensuring that no one is compelled by law to violate their conscience.I firmly believe the question of same sex marriage is a question of the definition of an institution, not the dignity of a human being. Every American has the right to pursue happiness as they see fit. Not every American has to agree on every issue, but all of us do have to share our country. A large number of Americans will continue to believe in traditional marriage, and a large number of Americans will be pleased with the Court's decision today. In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other."

My parents raised me to believe that in America, anyone can achieve anything.The election before us is a defining moment in our nation's history. It is the moment our generation must decide not just what laws we will pass, but also what kind of country we will be. This election is about honoring our history while embracing our future. It is about applying the principles of our founding to the challenges of our time, so we can extend the American Dream to more people than ever before. This can only be done by turning the page on yesterday and embracing a new generation of leaders.On this 4th of July, I wish you a happy, safe, and meaningful time with family and friends. As we reflect on the freedoms that make America unique, we must also reflect on the sacrifices that were the price of those freedoms. Let us keep all the men and women fighting for our country today, and their families, in our prayers. They are a reminder that our country is strong, our people are safe and free, and our future is bright."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 7, 2015",Press Release - 21st Century Jobs Plan,"Marco Rubio's remarks as prepared for delivery in Chicago, July 7th, 2016.It has now been fifteen and a half years since the American Century ended  a century in which our nation overcame depression, led the world against evil multiple times, and recorded some of the greatest advancements in human history: airplanes in the sky, boot prints on the moon, the world's knowledge first brought online. And all of this was possible because we built what no civilization had ever built before: a vibrant, stable, accessible middle class through which our people drove the affairs of the world.My parents, two immigrants from Cuba with little formal education, reached the middle class in that century. They did so through humble jobs, first at an assembly plant for lawn chairs; then my mother went on to work as a cashier, a maid, and a stock clerk at K-Mart, and my father as a bartender for hotel banquets.They never got rich, but they achieved the American Dream. Because through these modest jobs, they reached financial security, raised their family in a safe neighborhood, provided for our needs, and left their children with lives even better than their own.More people achieved this in America in the 20th century than at any other time and in any other place in human history. But today, many jobs like the ones my parents held no longer provide a viable path to the middle class.Their jobs assembling lawn chairs, or even the cashier job my mother held, have likely been replaced by machines. Other similar positions have been outsourced or have paid the same wage for a decade or more. Most of those impacted lack the qualifications to move into better-paying positions, and the higher education they need is too expensive or requires too much time away from work and family.The result is that the path to the middle class is narrower today than it has been for generations, and the American Dream so many achieved in the last century is in peril.This hardship is not the result of a cyclical economic downturn that will naturally correct itself. It is born of a fundamental transformation to the very nature of our economy, the disruptions of which have been prolonged and compounded by the failure of our leaders, our policies, and our institutions to transform accordingly.There are two primary forces behind this transformation. The first is radical technological progress  including the development of the Internet, information technologies, wireless and mobile capabilities, robotics, and more. The second has risen partly from the first, and that is globalization. From where you sit, you can sell a product to someone on the other side of the world almost as easily as to the person on your left or right. This has pulled us into competition with dozens of other nations for businesses, jobs, talent, and innovation.Over the last two decades, not a single industry has been untouched by these forces, and the disruptions have triggered a cascade of anxiety. Fewer Americans believe in the viability of the American Dream today than during the worst of the financial crisis in 2009. Many pundits and media outlets stoke these fears, painting a dreary picture of the future in which automation and outsourcing continue to shatter the American workforce.But history is not silent on this subject. It tells us the future is swayed by the actions we take, not the predictions we make. Generations of Americans before us have faced equally disruptive periods of transformation. In the Industrial Revolution, machines suddenly automated tasks people had built their lives around for centuries.Like today, the beginning was rough: jobs were lost, wages were static, and new wealth was concentrated at the top. Doubts and fears about the future were widespread. But then something changed. When our children learn about the Industrial Revolution today, they learn it was a period of progress. Yes, jobs were lost  but even more were gained, and the middle class expanded, thrived, and laid the cornerstone of the American Century.So how did that generation overcome its challenges? It wasn't through resistance: pushing back against new technologies or trying to resurrect old jobs. It was through adaptation: businesses integrating new technologies, workers learning new skills, and leaders leading in a new direction.Today's Technological Revolution carries extraordinary opportunities  even more, I believe, than the Industrial Revolution ever did. But we have not yet seized these opportunities, nor is it guaranteed that we will. Whether we do or do not will depend on the actions we take, the leaders we choose, and the reforms we adopt.For the first fifteen and a half years of this century, Washington has looked to the past. Our economy has changed, but our economic policies have not. And we have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work  that Washington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the '80s, it cannot raise taxes like it did in the '90s, and it cannot grow government like it did in the 2000s.The race for the future will never be won by going backward. It will never be won by hopping in Hillary Clinton's time machine to yesterday. She seems to believe pumping more of today's money into yesterday's programs will bring prosperity tomorrow. It will not. Nor will thinking small. Hiking the minimum wage by a few dollars will not save the American Dream; it will accelerate automation and outsourcing. Increasing taxes and regulations will not promote fairness or opportunity; it will snuff out innovation and crush small business.We need a new president for a new age  one with original ideas to unlock the two great doors to the future: the doors of innovation and education. Only through an innovative economy can we translate new technologies into new middle class jobs, and only through a revolutionized higher education system can we equip all our people to fill those jobs.Prosperity in our time is likely if we act now to embrace the future. We have opportunities that have never existed before, and a chance to seize them that will never exist again. I come before you today to discuss my ideas to spur American innovation onward, to ensure the rise of the machines will not be the fall of the worker, and to create a new American Century  propelled by a revitalized American Dream, and captured by a vibrant middle class.We know this much for certain: in the decades ahead, innovation will transform the world. Cars may soon drive themselves. Virtual reality, nanotechnology, robotics, and more will impact us in ways we can't yet imagine. Our devices will grow more powerful, bringing new capabilities to the masses. The question is not whether innovations are coming. The question is whether America will develop and produce them, and whether our people will share in the wealth they create.To build the most innovation-friendly economy in the world, we must build the most business-friendly economy in the world. Right now we have, quite nearly, the exact opposite. The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We have a tax code that punishes American companies for competing in the global economy, and a regulatory system that prevents small businesses  the primary engines of innovation and job creation  from competing against established players.The results of this approach are in: For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than being born. In the first quarter of this year, our economy shrank for the third time since our recovery began. And over the last decade, the U.S. has lost $179 billion worth of domestic companies through foreign takeovers.When I am president, I will empower innovators rather than punish them. I will cut our corporate tax rate to be competitive with the average of 25 percent for developed nations. If this had been done ten years ago, instead of losing $179 billion worth of American businesses, we would have acquired $590 billion worth of foreign firms.I will also establish a territorial tax system. Today, when an American company earns money overseas, it is taxed once in the country it is earned in and again if it is brought back to America. We are the only G8 country that levies that second tax, and the understandable impact is that many companies choose never to bring their money back home. Apple, for example, has $171 billion sitting overseas. That money would be an immediate economic boost, but because Apple would be punished for bringing it back, they choose not to.My tax plan will also allow immediate, 100% expensing for businesses. This means the more a company invests in creating jobs, the less they owe in taxes; and the more they pay their workers, the less they pay government.I will put a ceiling on the amount U.S. regulations can cost our economy. Just since 2008, federal regulations have cost us $771 billion. Many of these regulations are the result of an alliance between big business and big government.Hillary Clinton argues the economy is rigged in favor of wealthy interests  but what she won't tell you is that big government is doing the rigging. A massive regulatory apparatus inevitably becomes the instrument of those with the lawyers and lobbyists necessary to influence it.Government should work to empower and protect the private sector, not to control it. Just two months ago, I proposed a bipartisan plan with Senator Chris Coons to modernize our national lab system, which has long been a leading source of research in science, medicine, energy, and technology. Currently this research gets trapped in the public sector, but my legislation would increase the labs' flexibility to partner with private industry.We must also recognize the industries that need special protection in the 21st century. In its short life, the Internet has become one of humanity's greatest treasures, which is why it belongs in the hands of our people, not our government. In the Senate, I have fought to safeguard and reinforce Internet freedom and digital opportunity, and will continue that fight as president.I led a coalition opposing efforts to cede Internet regulatory power to the International Telecommunications Union. I also advanced a comprehensive wireless plan to expand unlicensed spectrum. Spectrum is the highway of the digital age, but the amount made available to the public is limited, and the result is a digital traffic jam. As president, I will reallocate spectrum for public use, which could create an estimated 350,000 jobs per 500Mhz.Finally, to win the global competition for innovation, we must win the global competition for talent. This requires reforming our legal immigration system to make it skill- and merit-based rather than family-based, which will protect American workers and attract more talent to grow our economy and create jobs.Innovation is the first door to the future. But even once we pass through it, a second door remains shut in front of us. Innovation will create millionaires and even billionaires, but we must also ensure it creates a vibrant middle class. And that can only be done through the modernization of our higher education system.As our technological capabilities grow, it is true that we will see more low-paying jobs replaced by machines. But that's only part of the story. With the innovation economy I just discussed, we will also see the creation of higher-paying, higher-skilled jobs that only humans can perform.History backs this up. When the power loom was invented, for example, many feared it would eliminate all textile jobs. The truth turned out to be the opposite. The loom increased production, and as production increased, so did demand, and as demand increased, so did the need for skilled laborers who could operate the machines and manage the factories. Jobs in the textile industry actually increased for 100 years.But these jobs did not immediately pay higher wages. Before that could happen, workers needed to learn marketable skills that could be standardized across the industry. Only then could the methods learned in one factory become useful in another, which increased the need for experienced labor and gave workers leverage to demand higher wages.The lesson of history is clear: to empower today's workers, we must equip them with today's skills. And to do that, we need our higher education system to innovate at the same rate as our economy.In the next ten years, 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will be created, but if our higher education system stays stuck in the past, 2 million of these jobs will be left unfilled. The same skills gap is felt across industries: nearly one out of every three American employers reports having difficulty finding skilled applicants.Yet we still tell students that to get a degree, they have to spend four years on a campus; tens of thousands of dollars on tuition, books, room, board; and hundreds of hours in a classroom, often learning subjects that aren't relevant to the modern economy.The result is that many young people are graduating with mountains of debt for degrees that will not lead to jobs, and many who need higher education the most  such as single parents and working adults  are left with few options that fit their schedules and budgets.The problems with higher education are many, but the ideas from Hillary Clinton and other outdated leaders are narrow and shortsighted. We do not need timid tweaks to the old system; we need a holistic overhaul  we need to change how we provide degrees, how those degrees are accessed, how much that access costs, how those costs are paid, and even how those payments are determined.As president, I will begin with a powerful but simple reform. Our higher education system is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of existing colleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the market.Within my first 100 days, I will bust this cartel by establishing a new accreditation process that welcomes low-cost, innovative providers. This would expose higher education to the market forces of choice and competition, which would prompt a revolution driven by the needs of students  just as the needs of consumers drive the progress of every other industry in our economy.Other reforms can hasten this transition. I will empower students to choose the right degree at the right price from the right institution for them. I've proposed an idea called the ""Student Right to Know Before You Go Act,"" which requires institutions to tell students how much they can expect to earn with a given degree before they take out the loans to pay for it.I will make student loans more manageable by making Income-Based Repayment automatic for all graduates, so the more they make, the faster they pay back their loans; and the less they make, the less strain their loans cause.This will reduce the risk associated with loans and ease the shadow of debt hovering over millions of graduates. But for future students, we can also create an alternative to loans that avoids the problem of debt altogether.I've proposed an idea called Student Investment Plans, which would let students partner with investors who would pay their tuition in return for a percentage of their earnings for a few years after graduation. It may result in a profit for the investor or it may not  but unlike with loans, none of the risk lies with the student.As president, I will also make career and vocational education more widespread and accessible. This can begin as early as high school so we graduate students not just with a diploma, but also with a certification to work as a mechanic, plumber, welder, electrician, or in any number of other good-paying occupations.And I will expand apprenticeship programs, which can provide on-the-job training and help standardize skills by allowing students to learn methods from experienced workers and spread them throughout the industry.This is not an exhaustive list of ideas. But I have seen how these can begin to open doors for our middle class. In Miami, I have seen high schoolers graduate certified to begin high-paying careers as BMW technicians. I have known single mothers whose hard-earned degrees have translated into long-sought financial security for themselves and their children. And I have seen higher education shape my own life  both in terms of the enormous costs we must remedy, and the enormous payoff we must extend to all.My innovation and higher education agendas form only a segment of the policy blueprint I have drawn up for my presidency, but my whole vision is built on a simple concept: New opportunities cannot be seized by old ideas, and the future must be embraced with enthusiasm and vision.In the 19th century, a generation of Americans did exactly that. They faced challenges similar to ours: the steam engine made the world smaller; the telegraph opened a new age of communication; new machines created new industries and upended a centuries-old economic status quo.Imagine what the world would look like if that generation had resisted these changes rather than embraced them. Imagine if they had refused to give up the old ways, and allowed the promise of the industrial age to pass them by. The loss would have been suffered not only by their generation, but every generation after. The American Century would never have existed.The stakes for our time are just as high. If we fail to capture the promise of this new age, we will be the first generation to leave a weaker America behind. But if we succeed, we will lay the cornerstone for a new American Century. We will not just recover economic ground, we will gain it. We will see the creation of higher paying, more fulfilling, more exciting jobs than ever before.There are those today, as there have always been, who say prosperity is impossible, that the future is lost. It seemed for a while that all you had to do to become a bestselling author was write a book predicting a post-America world, one driven by China or Europe. Many of these forecasts come from people who rarely leave Washington, D.C. If that city is all they see, it's no wonder they think America is in trouble.So I say to them: Go to Boston. Walk through Kendall Square, often crowned as the most innovative square mile in the world. There they can peer through the looking glass into a remarkable, revolutionary future for our nation and the world.I say to them: Go to Florida's space coast. See how an era of private and public partnership has put new adventures, new achievements, new discoveries within reach of humankind, and how suddenly an American flag on Mars has turned from impossible pipe dream to achievable American Dream.I say to them: Go to Reno, Nevada. See the data center being built by Apple, see the 1.2-million-square-foot distribution warehouse opened by Amazon, and see the $5 billion ""gigafactory"" being constructed by Tesla and Panasonic, which will transform the automobile in this century and create as many as 9,000 good-paying jobs in Nevada alone.I say to them: Go to New Hampshire. Visit Southern New Hampshire University, which is consistently named one of the most innovative organizations in the world  on a list with Apple and Google  for how it pushes against the odds and against the naysayers to bring higher education into the 21st century.And I say to them: Come to Chicago. Visit 1871, this 50,000-square-foot facility that serves as an incubator for digital innovation in the Midwest, providing entrepreneurs with mentorship, training, programming and educational resources, potential investors and a community of fellow dreamers dedicated to pulling American business into the new age.These examples are not outliers. They are a pattern. Anyone who sees these things will understand: nothing has changed about our people. We are the inheritors of the American spirit, of the American Dream, of the American Century. In our veins flows the blood of men and women who refused to accept the burdens of their pasts, or to resign to the old ways of doing things.Just as we pay respect to the Americans of the Industrial Revolution, so will the verdict on our time be written by those who have not yet been born.Let them write that we did our part  that in the early years of this century, we turned the corner on the past  we elected new leaders for a new time  we adopted policies that encouraged Americans to invent the products of tomorrow, manufacture them, and sell them throughout the world  and we designed the higher education system that allowed our middle class to perform the great work and reap the great rewards of this century.Time has brought us to the doorstep of the future. But whether we turn the knob and push, whether we step across the threshold of the new age, whether we embrace this century with its challenges and its opportunities, its adventures and its dangers, is a decision that is ours alone to make. I say we have lingered long enough on the future's edge. I invite you to step forward with me, together."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 10, 2015",Press Release - Life Is A Definitional Issue,"Being a candidate for president, I give a lot of speeches on a lot of issues  and they are all important political and policy issues that confront our country. But the issue we are here to discuss today  the issue of life  is not a political issue, nor is it strictly a policy issue.It is a definitional issue  an issue about what sort of society we want to have.And the reason I am so honored to speak here today is because I believe the issue of life gets to the heart of what this election is all about. I'll explain why in a moment.But first, I often begin by telling people about my parents. The reason I do that is because I believe their story is emblematic of the larger American story, and it serves as a reminder to me of why this country is so special.My parents were born in a society like most in the world, where your potential was determined by factors outside of your control. It was determined by your last name, by what jobs your parents held, or by the whims of government. So my parents came to the one society on earth dedicated to the idea that every human life is equal, every human life has potential, and every human life deserves a shot at success.My parents were given their shot in America, and they made the most of it. They never got rich, but they found good jobs  my father worked as a bartender at hotel banquets, and my mother as a maid, a cashier, and later a stock clerk at K-Mart. And through these jobs, they earned comfortable wages, raised their children in a safe neighborhood, provided for our needs, retired with dignity, and most important of all, left their children with lives even better than their own.These achievements are universally sought after, but they are achieved so often in America  and so seldom in most other places  that they have come to be known around the world by a new name: the American Dream.Today, there are too many Americans who feel as if this Dream is out of reach, as if they lack the ability to reach their full potential. And so connected to the issue of the innate value of every human life is the question of how we help everyone achieve their God-given potential in 21st century America. And the answer involves all sorts of political and policy issues. I am running for president to address these, to ensure everyone has a shot at achieving the same Dream my family has achieved.But inseparable from the effort to reclaim the American Dream are the efforts of those of you in this room. And here's why: because it is fundamentally impossible to live a free, successful and fulfilling life in America if you do not have a life in the first place. And it is fundamentally impossible for America to reach her destiny as a nation founded on the equal rights of all if our government believes an entire segment of the human population doesn't have a right to exist.And that's why the issue of life is more than political or policy-related. It is a definitional issue about the kind of country we want to be. In a world where life is increasingly not valued, where people are summarily discarded, America must stand for the belief that all life is worthy of protection, because all life comes from God.Our nation has strayed from this purpose. Our government  ever since a historically, egregiously flawed Supreme Court decision  has condoned the taking of innocent life on a massive scale. And particularly under our current president, America has declined to stand on the side of life around the world.The White House needs an occupant who values and prioritizes life. And so my pledge to you is this: if you send me to that place, I will not forget this place. I will bring our advocacy to the White House, and we'll get things done. We will advance the cause of life at home and around the world.Sometimes in contemporary American life, we come to believe that all the great causes are over, that past generations fought all the important battles: abolition, the civil rights movement, women's suffrage. But it's not true. In fact, one of the most important battles is the one you're engaged in now.You can judge a cause by the arguments made on both sides. And I rarely meet anyone who's willing to say they're pro-abortion. They'll say they're pro-choice, but almost everyone I've met says they personally disagree with abortion. That alone tells us a little about the basic common sense this issue is built on.But when you call upon someone to defend their support for abortion rights, they'll make some arguments that, in my opinion, are truly indefensible. For example, they may start by saying: It's an unwanted child  if a child is going to enter life and not be wanted by his or her parents, it's somehow ""for the best"" that the child never be brought into the world in the first place.But this simply cannot be the justification for abortion. Because, sadly, there are a lot of unwanted children born around the world. They're orphaned, they're born disabled, they're born to families that cannot afford them. No advocate for abortion would ever say those children lack the right to life. And so when you ask them about that, they quickly move away from that argument because it's indefensible.Then they pivot to the idea that a woman has a right to do anything she wants with her body. And let's recognize right now that there is a fundamental right to control your body. But there is also another right: the right to life. Put another way, the child also has a right to his or her body.And so what we have are two rights in conflict with one another. Yet immediately the other side will say, ""Well, our right to choose is more important than the right of an embryo to live, because it's not a person."" Then my question becomes: if it's not a person, what is it? Because if you left it alone, that's the only thing it can become. It can't develop into a pony!Next they'll argue, well, okay, maybe it is a person, but it's not a life. It cannot be a viable human life if it cannot survive on its own. But by that logic, a one year old isn't a viable life either. Nor are many of the sick or injured or disabled or elderly  all of whom have potential, all of whom have value, all of whom are loved by God and deserve the protection of our laws.From conception to natural death, there are only a few things that change about you  among them are your age, your level of dependency, and your environment. That someone can be killed based on any of those factors is, I believe, an indefensible position for any society to hold, but especially a society built on the idea that every human life has inalienable rights from God.But as important as the intellectual side of this debate is, it's just as important to step back and remember that the greatest argument for the pro-life cause is already in the heart of every human being. There is an innate understanding in all of us of just how precious human life is, and appealing to that is ultimately how I believe our cause will triumph.I'll share with you my personal experience, but I'm sure this is true for all of you who are blessed to be parents. From the first instant Jeanette and I found out we were expecting children, they were ours. They were not grainy ultrasound pictures. They were not inhuman collections of cells. They were children, and they were our children. Long before we knew their genders or their names or their personalities, we dreamed about their futures, and we knew God was watching them and caring for them just as we were.Every single person alive today was once that grainy ultrasound picture. And it is deeply disturbing for us to think of anyone  whether a parent, or a politician, or a Supreme Court justice  having a debate about our own viability as a person, at that stage or any stage. For our cause to triumph, we must help people extend that understanding of innate value to those they cannot see.But this requires a great deal of love and care. For we know that the decision facing so many women and young girls is achingly complicated  the 15 year old with her whole life ahead of her, the young single woman who struggles to provide for herself and can't imagine handling the costs of a child, the mom and dad faced with the knowledge that their child will be born with unique challenges.So as fundamental as the knowledge of life's value is to every person, it would be unfair to assume that the decision is always simple. And this is where the definitional issue of life meets the political and policy issues of the American Dream. We must find a way to ensure that every parent in this circumstance  and every child brought into the world  has the hope of overcoming their challenges to fulfill God's plan for their lives.I'm reminded today of a speech I gave almost a decade ago, back when I was designated Speaker of the Florida House. I was to address my colleagues on the job before us. But I wanted to do more than tell them what we would do. I wanted to tell them why we needed to do it. I wanted to explain the stakes of public policy and public service. So I gave the example of a hypothetical young woman. Here's what I said:Today, somewhere in Florida, a young single mother will give birth to her first child. Maybe she comes from a broken home, or maybe, even worse, she has grown up bouncing from one foster home to the next. In either case, she's probably grown up in poverty, trapped in failing schools. She reads at a low reading level. She never graduated high school. Lost and alone, she has spent the better part of her young life in search of someone to love her. And, in that quest, she has been in and out of a series of relationships with irresponsible and abusive men, including the now absent father of her new child. While she receives a significant amount of public assistance, it has done little to improve her life. She is trapped in poverty. Up to this point in her life, little has gone right for her. But today, her life has changed forever. Today, she held her firstborn child in her arms for the first time. And at that moment, she was no different than parents all over the world, rich and poor, privileged and disadvantaged alike. Today, when she looked into the eyes of her child for the first time, she saw what your mother saw in your eyes and what my mother saw in mine. She saw all the hopes and dreams she once had for herself. And in her heart burns the hope that everything that has gone wrong in her life will go right for that child, that all the opportunities she never had, her child will.A lot of people at the time told me not to include that section in my speech, but I'm glad I did. Because public policy and public service aren't about abstract ideas, they are about human lives.And at play in the scenario of this mother and child are two equally important issues affecting life. The first is the most fundamental: and that is the right of that child to be born. We fought that fight during my time in the Florida legislature. The second issue is this: to fully defend the dignity of that child's life, we must bring the hope of the American Dream  the hope of pursuing God's plan  within reach of every child and every parent in every circumstance. And I'm proud to say we fought that fight as well throughout my time as Speaker.And the reason I recount this to you today is because this is also the cause of our time on the national level. Today, that hypothetical child I spoke of would be almost 10 years old. I believe we made a difference in his or her life during my time in the Florida House. But the work is not done. Bringing the American Dream within reach of that child and that mother must remain the work of our time.We must create the high-paying jobs of this new century. We must bring an affordable and accessible higher education within reach of both mother and child so they can get the higher-paying jobs our economy will create. We must implement a pro-growth and pro-family tax reform that encourages marriage rather than punishes it, and that provides the mom with an expanded child tax credit so she can keep more of what she earns. And we must defend the values that will give that child a shot at succeeding in society, and at one day starting a successful and rewarding family of their own.This is far from a complete list of what we must do. But let me just close by saying this: the goal of reclaiming the American Dream  which is itself about defending the potential of every human being  can never be complete if we do not succeed in defending the basic right of every human life to exist. These causes must be joined. No candidate who fights for one without the other can claim a complete agenda.We often hear at conferences like this that an unborn child can't vote and can't speak. It's an important point, but I'd like to argue that it's actually not true. They can speak. They speak through you.In this competition between two competing sets of rights, you are the voice of children who cannot speak for themselves, of lives that may never have a chance to contribute to our society and make a difference, of the unknown names of millions of children whose contributions to our world will never happen because the right to life was not respected. You vote for them when you vote.And that is why your work is so important to reclaiming the American Dream, and why our nation needs you to remain active in this election.God bless you for your work, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 14, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio's statement on President Obama's dangerous Iran deal.,"I have said from the beginning of this process that I would not support a deal with Iran that allows the mullahs to retain the ability to develop nuclear weapons, threaten Israel, and continue their regional expansionism and support for terrorism. Based on what we know thus far, I believe that this deal undermines our national security. President Obama has consistently negotiated from a position of weakness, giving concession after concession to a regime that has American blood on its hands, holds Americans hostage, and has consistently violated every agreement it ever signed. I expect that a significant majority in Congress will share my skepticism of this agreement and vote it down. Failure by the President to obtain congressional support will tell the Iranians and the world that this is Barack Obama's deal, not an agreement with lasting support from the United States. It will then be left to the next President to return us to a position of American strength and re-impose sanctions on this despicable regime until it is truly willing to abandon its nuclear ambitions and is no longer a threat to international security."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 16, 2015",Press Release - I'm Sickened By The Planned Parenthood Video,I am sickened by the complete disregard for innocent unborn life evident at Planned Parenthood.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 17, 2015",Press Release - Hillary Clinton Is Not Ready For The Iran Challenge,"Published on Breitbart on 7.14.15After years of negotiations and repeated concessions, the Obama administration has now concluded an agreement that leaves Iran, the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, as a nuclear threshold state.The accord concedes a vast enrichment capacity; punts on the question of previous military experimentation with nuclear technologies; accepts both a heavy water plant as well as a hardened underground enrichment facility; and envisions a ramped up Iranian research and development program.In several years, Iran could be free of a multilateral arms embargo just as its terrorist agents are flush with cash and expanding their illicit efforts around the globe.The agreement has a limited duration and once it expires (if Iran has not already cheated) Tehran can dash to the bomb. If I am elected President I will abrogate this dangerous agreement and force Iran to permanently end its nuclear ambitions.For decades, Republican and Democratic presidents have consistently attempted to deter our adversaries and persuade our allies not to pursue sensitive nuclear technologies. The Obama administration's flawed deal with Iran contravenes almost seven decades of U.S. nonproliferation policy and takes the world in the opposite direction from President Obama's 2009 aspiration in Prague of ""a world without nuclear weapons"" toward a highly proliferated Middle East and a more dangerous world.As President, I would strive for the closure of Iran's nuclear program as opposed to the mere conditioning of its nuclear activities. Iran would be forced to stop subverting its neighbors and threatening Israel. Human rights would assume a higher place in any negotiationsas part of any agreement Iran would have to honor international norms on treatment of its citizens.When I enter the Oval Office, I will act quickly to undo this agreement. I will reinstate the principle that has long guided American policy, namely that Iran cannot have mastery of dangerous nuclear technologies. I will reimpose the sanctions waived by President Obama and work with Congress to impose new crushing sanctions on Iran's leaders for their brutal human rights abuses and ongoing support for terrorism.I will invite our European allies to join us in this effort, but at the end of the day American security is not determined in Brussels or Vienna. Americans expect our leaders to do what is right for their safety and that of their children and grandchildren regardless of what the international backlash may be.I will give Iran a choice: change your behavior, or face the collapse of your economy due to U.S. pressure. Despite its inflammatory rhetoric, Iran's clerical dictatorship has immense vulnerabilities. Iran's economy continues to suffer from inflation and unemployment while rampant corruption plagues the state at all levels.A strategy of pressure will not just focus on Iran's economy but also its regional position. For Iran's leaders to make painful concessions they have avoided thus far, they need to feel that the walls are closing around them. The U.S. should undertake a systematic effort to isolate Iran in the Middle East. The Islamic Republic, its clients and proxies, should find no sanctuary in the region. The U.S. must do all it can to counter Iran's nefarious plots in places like Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria or Yemen.Perhaps most importantly, we need to stop neglecting the fact that the principal victims of this despicable regime are the Iranian people. It is they who have to bear the burden of the mullahs' repression and misrule. In our quest for an arms control agreement, we have given the regime a pass on how it treats its citizens. As President, I will continue to speak loudly on behalf of the Iranian people and support their desire to be free.Iran's people are the most pro-American public in the Middle East, and they should know that the United States will always stand up for their rights. One of the great tragedies of the Obama/Clinton record on Iran has been the silence. Silence during and since the Green Revolution that nearly overcame clerical despotism in June 2009. Silence for fear of offending the very officials that oversee abuse and terror that Obama administration officials now proudly praise as ""patriots.""It is clear that Secretary Clinton is no more ready for this challenge than President Obama was. She and her team started the secret diplomacy with Iran that led to this deeply flawed agreement. Within hours of the deal's announcement she hailed it as ""an important step.""In the end, this should have been a confrontation between a superpower and an illegitimate third-rate autocracy. Instead, the Obama/Clinton team settled for trading carrots and sticks and hoping for elusive signs of moderation from cruel theocrats. President Obama's capitulation has made it more difficult, but not impossible, to prevent a nuclear Iran.Only a determined strategy of coercion by the next President can still ensure that the Islamic Republic abandons its quest for nuclear weapons and rolls back Iranian hegemonic ambitions in the Middle East. The immediate challenge for Congress is limiting the damage until January 2017."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 27, 2015",Press Release - Clinton's Energy Agenda Is Stuck In The 1990s,"Hillary Clinton's energy and climate agenda is a throwback to yesterday, before the 21st Century energy revolution that is making America the world's greatest energy producer.Clinton would do nothing to stop the EPA's assault on energy, choosing instead to defend job-killing rules from the Obama Administration. Her plan ignores common-sense solutions like approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would create thousands of jobs. Her plan would continue wasteful and inefficient energy tax subsidies. Perhaps worse of all, her plan completely fails to embrace innovative technologies that have lowered energy costs for millions of Americans.Hillary Clinton's energy ""vision"" is more of the same: outdated policies that pick winners and losers, grow the federal government, and make energy more expensive for Americans. Marco believes in a 21st Century energy agenda that embraces all forms of energy, including oil, coal, natural gas, and renewables, and that cuts burdensome regulations from Washington that are standing directly in the way of American innovation."

So how can we usher in a 21st Century energy agenda? We can start by eliminating government-imposed barriers to energy production and economic growth.A prime example is the outdated ban on exporting crude oil, which was imposed by President Nixon in the 1970s. Lifting the ban could create hundreds of thousands of jobs, boost wages, and lower gas prices in America. It would also strengthen our national security by asserting our global leadership and undercut dangerous regimes like Iran and U.S. foes like Russia that use energy as a weapon against America's allies.I believe we must immediately lift the bureaucratic crude oil export ban, as one component of a 21st Century, pro-growth energy agenda that embraces America's energy revolution and gets government out of the way of innovation.-Marco Rubio"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"July 29, 2015",Press Release - Lessons From Obama's Deal With Iran,"Originally published on FoxNews.com (7.29.15)In April, President Obama announced the framework of a deal that he said would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.""We only have three options for addressing Iran's nuclear program""  cutting a deal with Iran, ""starting another war in the Middle East"" or ""hope for the best.""In deploying his favorite rhetorical device, the president reaffirmed to the world he only really saw one option: cutting a deal with Iran no matter the cost.If after witnessing six years of President Obama's weak and feckless foreign policy wasn't enough to embolden the regime in Tehran, President Obama's comments in April must have convinced the mullahs they had the American president right where they wanted him.The price for President Obama's penchant for negotiating from weakness is now clear. The deal announced with much fanfare by the White House two weeks ago comes nowhere close to the deal President Obama promised the American people he'd get....President Obama's capitulation has made it more difficult, but not impossible, to prevent a nuclear Iran. He has failed with Iran because he has failed as president. This may be the best deal that a weak president can achieve, but a strong, trusted and respected America can do much better.Those who aspire to lead the greatest nation on Earth cannot wait until 2017 to begin making the case for a new approach toward this critical issue to the American people, and the world.To read the op-ed in its entirety, please click here."

Over the next ten years, it will increase by an average of 5.8%, despite President Obama's claim that the massive law would ""bend the cost curve"" down.President Obama was wrong, and so is his failed health care law. It is a job-killing disaster filled with new spending, taxes and mandates that are increasing the cost of care, stifling innovation, and busting the budget.It's not too late to start over. As President, I will repeal Obamacare and replace it with consumer-centered reforms that not only lower health care costs for millions of Americans, but get federal spending under control. Doing so will not be easy, but it is necessary to restore health care choice, competition, and fiscal responsibility in America. Marco Rubio"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 3, 2015",Press Release - Planned Parenthood Gets Over $500 Million in Tax Dollars. De-Fund It Now,"Originally published on LifeNews.com (8.3.15)As Americans we live in a nation founded on the idea that our rights and freedoms are God-given and that government's fundamental role is to protect them. But our government today falls tragically short of this duty by failing to protect the rights of the most defenseless in our society: unborn children.Each year, over half a billion dollars in taxpayer money is given to Planned Parenthood, an organization responsible for over 300,000 abortions each year. While the provision of taxpayer money to such an organization has drawn its share of criticism over the years, the most recent revelations of Planned Parenthood's actions reveal a new low for the organization.Millions of Americans, myself included, have been outraged by the recently released videos showing Planned Parenthood officials matter of factly describing the harvesting and sale of limbs and organs from unborn babies in graphic detail and with a callous and cruel disregard for human life. The videos also raise serious questions about potentially criminal and unethical practices at Planned Parenthood clinics. The videos clearly indicate that these practices are not contained, but endemic to the organization....America is the freest and most powerful nation on earth, and we have done more to advance the rights of all human beings in our brief history than any society before or since. The Planned Parenthood videos, and the behavior and culture they reveal, are anathema to our very identity as a nation and run counter to the great sacrifices generations of Americans have made in the defense of human dignity here and abroad. We cannot fulfill our promise as a nation by simply turning the other way when we are confronted with difficult realities.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 12, 2015","Press Release - Here's How We Modernize Our Antiquated, Broken Higher Education System","Hillary Clinton wants to reform higher education using the same failed approach that has been tried in Washington for decades: she wants to raise taxes and pour more money into the current outdated system rather than take the initiative to modernize it.Our higher education system is antiquated and broken in multiple ways. It is too expensive, too time consuming, and too inflexible for busy single parents and working adults. At a time when higher education is a requirement for most high-paying jobs, too many Americans do not have the time or money to earn a degree, and too many degrees do not lead to jobs.Allowing every American the opportunity to earn an affordable degree that equips them for a modern high-paying job will be a top priority of my presidency. We cannot restore the American Dream if we fail in this task. So what is Hillary Clinton's solution to this generation-defining challenge? To raise taxes and pump $350 billion into the current outdated system without making any fundamental changes to increase accessibility, competition, or choice.In fact, not only would Hillary Clinton's plan fail to solve the underlying problems, it would actually make the underlying problems worse. As history clearly shows, whenever government increases higher education spending, schools happily raise tuition since they know the federal government will foot the bill. One study found the impact of increased government funding on rising tuition rates was as high as 65 percent. So Hillary Clinton's proposal will likely cost taxpayers even more than its initial daunting price tag.I will take a different approach. Rather than spend more to maintain the current flawed system, I will fix higher education by promoting choice, competition, greater access, and lower costs. I have proposed specific reforms that will achieve these goals throughout my time in the Senate, and I will enact them as president.Chief among these reforms is my plan to fix accreditation, which is the process by which institutions become certified to provide degrees. This process is currently controlled by a cartel of established colleges and universities, which use their power to block competitors from emerging. This is why flexible online degrees often cost just as much as traditional on-campus education: because brick-and-mortar schools don't want to compete with more accessible options.To read my full plan, please click here."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 14, 2015","Press Release - America Must Lead Through Strength And Example, Not Weakness And Concession","Marco's speech at the Foreign Policy Initiative in New York City on August 14, 2015As we gather here today, two historic events are in progress. The first is the arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry in Cuba. The second is President Obama's continued campaign to secure Congressional approval for his nuclear deal with Iran.While numerous crises around the globe will require the attention of America's next president, I would like to focus my remarks today on these two dangerous developments with Iran and Cuba, as I believe they represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic, moral, and economic notion that has driven President Obama's foreign policy, and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world.These deals demonstrate with jarring clarity how this administration has failed to anticipate impending crises, ignored the realities of the globalized economy, and sought to make America liked rather than respected; the way it has placed politics before policy, adversaries before allies, and legacy before leadership; the way it has confused weakness for restraint, concession for compromise, and  most simply of all  wrong for right.To fully understand what we're dealing with in regards to Iran and Cuba, we have to understand who we're dealing with.In Iran, we face radical Shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under Islam and believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the West; leaders who have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in the last decade, who continue to lead chants of ""Death to America"" each week, and who refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill Americans and wipe Israel off the map.In Cuba, we face proudly anti-American leaders who continue to work with nations like Russia and China to spy on our people and government; who harbor fugitives from American justice; and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people, preventing democratic elections, and depriving their nation's economy of freedom and opportunity.The world has missed having an American President who speaks honestly about the world in which we live. In the eyes of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the Cuban people are suffering because not enough American tourists visit the country, when the truth is the Cuban people are suffering because they live in a tyrannical dictatorship.View the full remarks here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 18, 2015","Press Release - We Must Stop ""Waters of the U.S."" Regulations","As I return to Iowa this week, I remain deeply concerned with the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers' ""Waters of the U.S."" rule, which will greatly expand the federal government's control over the economy. Iowa is home to more than 88,000 farms, and unless it is stopped, unaccountable bureaucrats will soon have far-reaching control over bodies of water on many of them. This rule will force farmers and ranchers to spend time and money complying with confusing and costly permits, instead of expanding and creating jobs.In the Senate, I'm proud to have supported efforts to stop the devastating Waters of the U.S. rule. As president, I'll hold regulators accountable and ensure that we grow the economy, not the power of the federal government at the expense of our nation's vibrant agricultural sector. Marco Rubio"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 18, 2015",Press Release - Repeal Obamacare And Replace It With This,"To help more of our people achieve the American Dream, we need to make affordable, quality healthcare accessible in the 21st century. Unfortunately, President Obama's one-size-fits-all, big government approach has failed to achieve this goal. Since ObamaCare's passage, many Americans have seen the law transition from a political mess to a personal disaster. Some have lost access to their doctors or the insurance plans they were happy with. Many have been forced to pay higher premiums and higher deductibles. Others have lost their jobs or had their hours cut. And the American economy as a whole has labored under the negative effects of Obamacare's $1.2 trillion tax hike.A law that was sold on the claim that it would lower healthcare costs has instead caused them to dramatically increase for many American families. Now, a new IRS regulation could force small businesses to pay fines of over $36,000 per employee per year if they choose to make a financial contribution to their employees' health coverage.ObamaCare is fatally flawed not just because it is poorly constructed, but because it relies on the outdated philosophy that the federal government can solve our problems through more spending, more taxes, more regulations, and more bureaucrats. The American people have been forced to be the test subjects of President Obama's one-size-fits-all, big-government experiment, and have paid dearly for it.For all of these reasons and more, I have fought against ObamaCare since I got to the U.S. Senate. I led the charge to stop its taxpayer-funded bailouts of the insurance industry and, fortunately, was successful in blocking them from taking place this year. But more must be done, and when I am president, repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be an urgent priority of my administration. Instead of relying on an outdated, big-government approach, I will utilize modern, consumer-centered reforms that lower costs, embrace innovation in healthcare, and actually increase choices and improve quality of care.My plan includes three primary components:First, I will work with Congress to create an advanceable, refundable tax credit that all Americans can use to purchase health insurance. The value of these credits should increase every year, and we should set the tax preference for employer-sponsored insurance on a glide path to ensure that it will equal the level of the credits within a decade. This will prevent large-scale disruptions and reform a provision in our tax code that has been driving up health costs, hurting those who are self-employed, and preventing Americans from having truly portable health insurance plans that travel with them regardless of where they work.Second, I will reform insurance regulations to lower costs, encourage innovation, and protect the vulnerable. Those with pre-existing conditions should have access to affordable care through mechanisms such as federally-supported, actuarially-sound, and state-based high risk pools. Americans should be able to purchase coverage across state lines so they can seek out affordable coverage regardless of where they live. And consumer-centered products like Health Savings Accounts should be encouraged and expanded. Finally, under no circumstances should taxpayers be asked to bail out an insurance company that loses money, as is currently the case under ObamaCare.Third, I will take up the difficult work of saving and strengthening Medicare and Medicaid by placing them on fiscally-sustainable paths. Without reforms, these programs will eventually run out of money. We must move Medicaid into a per-capita block grant system, preserving funding for its recipients while freeing states from Washington mandates. While current seniors on Medicare, like my mother, should see no changes to the program, future generations should be transitioned into a premium support system. A premium support model will empower seniors with choice and market competition just like Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D already do.While other measures may be necessary to undo the damage done by ObamaCare, I believe these three concepts are the core of a plan to lower costs and put patients and families back in control of their healthcare decisions. Unlike ObamaCare, my reforms will not be forced through Congress in the dark of night without accountability. They will not stretch the Constitution to its breaking point or rely on questionable Supreme Court decisions to survive. And, perhaps most importantly, they will not raise taxes on the American people.ObamaCare's failures should be all the proof Washington needs that the time has come for a new direction  one that empowers the American consumer, expands choices, and reduces the role of the federal government in healthcare. It's time to set a new precedent in Washington by sending a new president to Washington. I believe I have the experience and vision necessary to improve our healthcare system and make this the next American century."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 20, 2015",Press Release - Building A New American Economy,"The New American Economy is not built on a single change, but on change itself. It's built on the fact that numerous transformative innovations have come in the last five years, and even more will come in the next five. These constant advances in technology are replacing old jobs with new ones, and have turned our economy from national to international.While America's economy is built on change, it is increasingly controlled by a federal government that is resistant to change. Other nations are adapting to the new economy while Washington is clinging to the ways of the old economy. As a result, America is no longer the obvious best place for the Henry Fords of today to create the businesses of tomorrow. And while innovations keep transforming our world, our economy is struggling to translate them into opportunity for our people.This election is a choice about what we do next.Hillary Clinton believes the way to win the race for the future is to drive in reverse  to revert back to more regulations, higher taxes, and bigger government.It's not.The way forward is to embrace the future and modernize our government. If we once again make America the best place in the world to create jobs, and empower every American to fill those jobs, then our generation will embrace The New American Economy and lay the foundation for A New American Century.Read my full plan for a New American Economy here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 25, 2015",Press Release - This Is How We Serve Our Veterans,"At the first Republican debate this year, I was caught a bit by surprise when the moderators asked me about how I feel God has spoken to me . . . and if I could find a way to link that to veterans' issues.But it wasn't so hard, since our men and women in uniform are one of God's greatest gifts to America. It's an issue I'm always glad to talk about, because it's so important and because there's a lot I would like to see done to serve our vets better.Last year, as new scandals at Veterans Affairs hospitals were uncovered seemingly every day, I fought to make sure that the VA secretary had the authority to fire senior employees who weren't doing their jobs.At first, Bernie Sanders, who's running for the Democratic nomination, blocked this basic accountability measure, as a favor to government-employee unions. But we managed to get it into law, alongside measures to improve health care choices for our nation's veterans.Still, that didn't go nearly far enough. I've also introduced a measure that would give the VA the ability to fire any employee that is doing his or her job poorly or covering up failure. I appreciate my friend Jeb Bush's support for this proposal.The House passed that bill this summer, although President Obama has threatened to veto it. As President, I'd keep fighting to give vets more choices, protect whistleblowers, and modernize the system.Treating our vets right goes beyond the VA. There are many reasons why I will reverse the harmful sequestration cuts made to the military over the past few years. But one is that reversing them would be a good thing for those serving us in uniform: A stronger military budget means our troops can remain the best-trained and best-equipped in the world, aren't overstretched, and aren't getting pink slips when we need them to confront the national security threats we face."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 25, 2015",Press Release - We Need A Plan To Stop The Islamic State And End Assad's Regime Now,"One year after the initiation of military action against the Islamic State, progress is far from sufficient. The Islamic State continues to draw recruits from around the world and holds significant territory in Syria and Iraq. Assad remains in power, backed by Russia and Iran, even as his forces commit atrocities against the Syrian people on a daily basis.U.S.-led efforts to train Syrian rebels, Iraqi Army soldiers, Kurdish Peshmerga, and Iraqi Sunni tribesmen to retake territory in Syria and Iraq have run into significant challenges. Barely more than 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria have been trained.The Obama administration has failed to effectively train and support anti-Islamic State fighters in both Iraq and Syria. We need to lift the self-defeating restrictions that prevent U.S. personnel from calling in airstrikes to support Iraqi military operations and embedding with the units they have trained.To enable military success against the Islamic State, we must first have in place a political strategy to mobilize significant Sunni Arab opposition to this terrorist group, both within Syria and Iraq and in the broader region.As yet another August comes and goes in this conflict that now has generational implications for global security, U.S. strategy remains an incoherent mess. Reversing the gains that both Iran and the Islamic State have made as they have sought to fill the void left by American disengagement will be difficult.Ending Assad's reign of terror once and for all will be, too. And both will be much more difficult than if we had acted at the outset of the civil war in Syria, as some of us urged President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But it is still not impossible.View the full op-ed as it appeared on ForeignPolicy.com (8.25.15)"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"August 28, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio on China,"Today I'd like to discuss China's rise in global affairs and what I'll do as president to ensure it doesn't undermine American interests. If there were any doubts about the importance of this topic, the financial events of the past week put them to rest.On Monday, due in large part to a crash in China's stock market, our own markets suffered their worst day in four years. Insecurity and anxiety about the future  already high for America's families  climbed even higher.It was a jarring illustration of how our economy has changed. In the 21st century, what happens across the world can impact American families as much as what happens across town. The affairs of foreign nations are increasingly our business, whether we like it or not, and this is especially true of China.In this new century, China presents both opportunities and challenges for our people.Trade with its growing middle class has opened our businesses to hundreds of millions of new customers. South Carolina can attest to this. In 2013, China consumed $4.2 billion of goods and services produced in this state  more than any other country. That supports thousands of South Carolina jobs. And because of good policies from your governor, textile jobs once taken by China are now returning.But as we've found this week, the negative effects of China's economic meddling are severe. The Chinese government's efforts to devalue its currency and rig global trade are a rising threat to our economic interests.China is also a growing danger to our national security. Earlier this year, it was behind the largest cyber-attack ever carried out against the United States. Its current ruler, Xi Jinping, is trying to convince his country's 1.3 billion people that the way to reestablish Chinese greatness is to undermine the United States and enhance China's influence at our expense.To this end, he is asserting control over the East and South China Seas, through which more than half of global commerce passes each day. This is Beijing's way of gaining leverage over the world. It has unilaterally declared an ""air defense identification zone"" over international waters and the Senkaku Islands, which are the territory of our ally Japan. In the South China Sea, Beijing has dispatched ships and planes, moved oilrigs, and even constructed artificial islands in an attempt to strengthen its position militarily.Under Xi Jinping's rule, China has intensified its campaign to push America out of Asia, denouncing our long-standing alliances with other democracies like Japan and the Philippines, developing weapons that threaten our bases and naval assets, and declaring that Asian affairs should be left to ""the people of Asia."" China aims to make it so costly and difficult for America to get involved in the region that we won't bother.In short, China is doing everything it can to make the 21st century a Chinese Century.But if you want to know what a Chinese Century would look like for the world, look no further than how the government treats its own people. In just the last year, it has rounded up human rights advocates and thrown them in prison, torn down churches and oppressed Christians, forced parents to get abortions and sterilizations, detained political dissidents without trial or legal recourse, undermined the autonomy of Hong Kong, and tightened controls on the Internet.This is a disgrace, and we must stand against it. America holds nothing but goodwill toward the people of China. I believe the moment they finally attain true freedom will fundamentally alter the course of human history, and will benefit the economic and strategic interests of the United States.Freedom for the people of China must be our goal; but it has not been the goal of President Obama. He has only appeased their oppressive leaders, staying silent in the face of their human rights abuses. He has failed to respond adequately to the unprecedented breaches of our corporate and government computer networks. And he has given our allies reason to doubt our commitment to their security. And the fact that China is growing more assertive by the day suggests that its rulers share the same doubts about American resolve.President Obama has hoped that being more open to China would make them a more responsible nation. It has not worked. We can no longer succumb to the illusion that more dialogue with China's current rulers will narrow the gap in values and interests that separates us. That is why, while I do not believe we should cancel Xi Jinping's visit to Washington next month, I also do not believe we should roll out the red carpet for him. This is an opportunity to speak bluntly to this authoritarian ruler, not to treat him to a state dinner.It is up to our next president to correct the errors of our current one. This is one of many reasons Hillary Clinton must not become our next president. One of her first actions as Secretary of State was to reassure China's rulers that cooperation on climate change, of all things, was more important to her than calling Beijing to account for its violations of human rights.While her tenure as Secretary of State was a disaster, we can be sure she will run on it in the general election. We have to put forward a nominee with the experience and record of judgment necessary to take her to task. Our Party's nominee must understand the global challenges we face in the 21stcentury.If I am our party's nominee, Hillary Clinton will not be able to lecture me on foreign affairs. From Libya to Syria to Ukraine, and yes, to China, I have consistently called for the appropriate courses of action before they were popular.Asia has been a region of particular interest to me. In the last Congress, I was the Senate Republican responsible for overseeing US policy towards Asia. And last year, I visited multiple allies in East Asia to highlight the importance of our partnerships.Our nominee must have a plan to correct U.S.-China relations, and that is what I will offer today.As president, my approach toward China will adhere closely to the three principles of my foreign policy that I outlined at the beginning of this campaign. My goals will be to restore our national security and defend our strategic interests, protect our economic wellbeing, and advance the cause of freedom and human rights.The first goal will require restoring American Strength to ensure the United States remains a Pacific power.While China has increased its defense spending by another 10% this year, the Obama administration has cut defense spending by nearly a trillion dollars over a decade. Our Navy is now smaller than at any time since before World War I, our Army is headed for pre-World War II levels, and our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. And make no mistake, numbers matter. Our planes and ships cannot be in two places at once. If elected, I will end defense sequestration and restore the Pentagon's budget to its appropriate level.Doing so will allow us to neutralize the threat posed by China's rapidly growing forces and capabilities. We'll ensure that our carrier fleet is sufficient to support forward deployment of a second carrier to the Pacific. We'll build Virginia-class submarines at a rate of two per year, construct new long-range precision strike systems, protect our satellites and space capabilities from attack, and we'll deploy advanced missile defense systems to where our men and women are stationed throughout the region.Restoring our military strength in Asia will also require strengthening our alliances. Our treaty allies and partners depend on the weight of their friendship with America to keep China off their doorstep.When I am president, instead of inviting China to military exercises, we will conduct joint freedom of navigation patrols with our partners in East and Southeast Asia to challenge any attempts to close off international waters or airspace. We will seek enhanced access across the region and deploy additional air and naval assets to contested areas. We will confront Chinese propaganda in Asia by highlighting U.S. resolve and the flimsiness of China's territorial claims. And if China continues to use military force to advance its illegitimate claims, I will not hesitate to take action.We will also promote collaboration between our allies and partners. America cannot and need not bear the full burden of counterbalancing China's power. Enhanced coordination between Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, and Mongolia, among others, serves our interests. Promoting democracyaround China is an important way to promote democracy within China. Taiwan, for instance, provides a powerful model for how traditional Chinese culture can coexist with democracy.My second goal in relation to China is of particular relevance this week, and that is protecting the American economy. Until recently, China has experienced impressive economic growth by copying parts of the capitalist economic model and enjoying the stability afforded by U.S. power. At the same time, it has damaged other economies, including our own, by bending and breaking the rules of international trade to achieve its own ends. It has subsidized exports, devalued currency, restricted imports, and stolen technology on a massive scale.As President, I would respond to China's economic misconduct not through aggressive retaliation, which would hurt us as much as them, but by reinforcing our insistence on free markets and free trade. This means immediately moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements that strengthen strategic ties with our partners in Asia.We will not build exclusionary trading blocs, but nor will we allow China to reap the full benefits of American-led commerce unless it fundamentally changes its attitudes and its policies.In the 21st century, economic security and national security depend on cyber security. No longer will China hack our corporate or government servers with ease and without consequence. I will fortify our cyber defenses. I will work with other nations to pressure China to halt its use of commercial espionage as a tool of statecraft. And I will coordinate international efforts to identify and punish any Chinese nationals who violate this.In addition, we will impose sanctions and other penalties on Chinese companies that can be shown to have profited from pirating our software or movies or music or any other intellectual property. We also must restrict Beijing's access to strategically sensitive technologies. We can no longer afford to enable the growth of Chinese military power in pursuit of short-term economic gain.Our third goal in relation to China concerns not just what we do, but who we are. We must stand on the side of freedom and human rights, both inside China and on its periphery. It is our moral and strategic imperative.The Obama administration has had little to say about the absence of political and religious freedom in China, or about the deteriorating human rights situation that has accompanied Xi Jinping's rise. Systems of government built on repression are like houses built on sand. The fragile social foundations of the Chinese economy are one reason for the crash we saw this week. Helping the Chinese people achieve freedom and democracy is not just our moral duty as a free people  it will have a profound effect on global prosperity and our security.When I am president, Beijing will not receive a free pass on human rights. I will instruct all U.S. officials meeting with their Chinese counterparts to list political prisoners by name and press for their unconditional release. I will impose visa bans and asset freezes on Chinese officials who violate human rights. I will do all I can to empower Chinese citizens to breach what has been called the Great Firewall of China, and gain access to news and information online about their country and the world.Finally, I will understand that the presidency is the most visible office in the world, and that it comes with an ability  and a responsibility  to lead by example. The president can send powerful messages through simple actions, such as visiting the underground churches and unofficial houses of worship throughout China to show his support for religious freedom.And I will send a message to the world before I even take the oath of office. I will invite Chinese dissidents and other freedom fighters around the world to be honored guests at my inauguration. I'll personally engage religious rights activists and others such as students in Hong Kong, beleaguered lawyers, dissidents on the mainland, and persecuted Tibetan monks and nuns, who, like the American people, value basic human dignity and liberty.These will one day be the leaders of a democratic China. These are the leaders worthy of a red carpet welcome in Washington, DC. And giving them that honor will set an example to the world.Let me just close by saying that, despite the challenges we face in regards to China, the opportunities are even greater.In our international economy, the ability to trade is greater than it has ever been, the ability of students to travel abroad and learn is greater than it has ever been, the ability to innovate through cooperation as well as competition is greater than it has ever been. China and America are the largest economies on earth. If our people are allowed to cooperate on their economic futures, it can only change the world for the better.Next Wednesday presents us an important chance to reflect on that fact. It is the 70th anniversary of the allied victory in the Pacific, which effectively ended World War II. Since then, look what economic cooperation has brought millions of people in the Asia Pacific region  from South Korea to Japan and even many parts of China  who just decades ago lived in poverty and despair, but now live in the middle class, and whose children have an opportunity to live an even better life.That's an extraordinary achievement, but one that would have been impossible without the stability American leadership has offered the region since World War II, through freedom of the seas, established international norms, and the military power to back them up.The American Century showed us what can happen when freedom overtakes oppression, when democracy overtakes totalitarianism, when economic opportunity overtakes a stifling authoritarian economy. We cannot walk away from everything we have achieved in that regard.And we must not overlook the fundamental truth about America's relationship with China: What is at stake is nothing less than the type of world we will leave our children and grandchildren. In the world we leave behind, what nation will be the dominant example for the world? A country like modern China, or a country like ours?That's what's at stake in the years ahead, starting with this election. I know we will make the right choice.Thank you."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 2, 2015",Press Release - How To Seize America's Energy Potential In The 21st Century,"Today I will be visiting Oklahoma City to meet with some of the leaders of America's energy revolution. Developments in shale-oil production such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up new and exciting possibilities for a secure energy future for our nation. Yet this week, President Obama traveled to Alaska to talk not about seizing our energy potential, but about limiting that potential through environmental policies that grow government and raise costs. I believe this is an outrageous misalignment of priorities.It is hard to think of a single industry that has a more direct impact on Americans' financial well-being than the energy industry. Our energy resources truly sustain our human resources. Our businesses need to be able to operate affordably and efficiently in order to create jobs and grow our economy. Our families need reasonable gas and electric bills in order to reach financial security. Working moms and dads need to be able to commute to work without breaking the bank.Yet despite the importance of this industry, our outdated government has made energy one of the most politicized and regulated aspects of our economy. It picks winners and losers through subsidies and higher taxes. And while some of the environmental concerns influencing regulations are legitimate, others are seriously overblown. A small but vocal minority, with some very highly paid lobbyists, has successfully pushed for restrictions that result in higher prices and fewer jobs for our people in exchange for minimal environmental benefits.I believe that the vast majority of Americans  both Democrats and Republicans  are very reasonable when it comes to balancing ecology with the economy. And I believe it is conservatives, not liberals, who ultimately have the more sustainable and forward-looking agenda. This is because the true path to an economically and environmentally secure energy future is not through regulation, but through innovation.Click here to read the rest of the op-ed on NationalReview.com."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 2, 2015",Press Release - My Plan for Capturing America's Energy Potential,"Thank you. I want to spend most of our time today taking your questions, but I'd like to begin with a few short remarks.As many of you know, I've based my campaign for president on the question of how we can make the 21st century a New American Century. And the topic we're here to discuss today is a crucial component of my plan to achieve that goal.The energy industry is central to our future in every way  in terms of our economic growth, in terms of the financial security of our families, and in terms of our strength as a global leader.The fortunate truth is that America is uniquely blessed with energy resources, more than we realized we had even ten years ago. There are multiple nations on earth with a great deal of oil and natural gas. There are multiple nations with access to important oceanic and hydroelectric resources. There are multiple nations with lush forests and tillable land. But there is no nation that has all of these at the same time and to the same extent that America does.The fact that we have the greatest energy potential of any nation on the planet is an enormous advantage for us in this century. It is hard to think of a single industry that has a more direct impact on the financial wellbeing of everyday Americans than the energy industry.Our energy resources truly sustain our human resources. Our businesses need to be able to operate affordably and efficiently in order to create jobs and grow our economy, our families need reasonable gas and electric bills in order to reach financial security, and working moms and dads need to be able to commute to work without breaking the bank.Yet despite its importance, our outdated government continues to make energy one of the most politicized and regulated aspects of our economy. Washington continues to lean on the notion that handing out subsidies to favored companies while imposing new mandates and taxes on others is the way to seize our energy potential. But this didn't work yesterday, it isn't working today, and it's not going to work tomorrow.Many regulations are concerned with protecting the environment, and some of these are important. We all want clean air to breath and clean water to drink. We all want to preserve the natural beauty of our land. But while many of the environmental concerns influencing regulations are legitimate, others are seriously overblown.As a result, we have a small but vocal minority, with some very highly paid lobbyists, who have successfully pushed for regulations that result in higher prices and fewer jobs for our people in exchange for minimal environmental benefits.I believe that the vast majority of Americans  both Democrats and Republicans  are very reasonable when it comes to balancing ecology with the economy. And I believe it is conservatives, not liberals, who ultimately have the more sustainable and forward-looking agenda.This is because the true path to an economically and environmentally secure energy future is not through regulation, but through innovation. And innovation comes from less government involvement, not more.It is private innovators, not government officials, who are best suited to discover cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient ways to access our resources. It is private innovators, not government officials, who are best suited to find affordable fuel alternatives, or to continue developing substitutes such as electric and battery powered vehicles.America's energy future must be entrusted to our businesses and scientists, not our bureaucrats. And finding ways to empower our energy producers to capture our energy potential should be a priority for every presidential candidate.Unfortunately, what we hear from Hillary Clinton are more of the same ideas from yesterday  and that's when she speaks up on the issue at all. For the most part, she resorts to empty rhetoric that refuses to chart much of a course in either direction. This is no way to treat one of the most important issues of our time.I will be rolling out a detailed plan this fall for capturing our energy potential. But I'd like to give you a short preview of that plan today.One of the first things I will do as president is immediately lift the ban on crude-oil exports. This ban is a perfect example of just how outdated Washington has become. President Nixon signed it into law in the 1970s  long before the economy was transformed by technology and globalization, long before the hydraulic fracturing and shale revolutions launched a new era for American energy.Lifting the crude-oil export ban will be an immediate boon to our economy. It will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and promote growth across every industry. It will help make America a net energy exporter within a few years. It will strengthen our national security interests by stabilizing global energy markets and reducing the leverage of oil-rich anti-American governments.Here's another common-sense step I will take as president: I will stop the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which, if enacted, would have a devastating impact on affordable energy in exchange for little to no environmental benefit.It would result in the closure of coal-fired power plants around the country. It would kill thousands of jobs. It would jeopardize the reliability of our national power grid, threatening power shortages and even blackouts. It would truly be one of the most expensive and costly regulations ever created. Yet Hillary Clinton has pledged to make defending and expanding it a ""top priority.""As president, I will immediately stop this massive regulation. I'll pursue a sweeping overhaul of the regulatory system to make sure costs and benefits of new rules are accurately accounted for and that localities, states, and industries can meet the timelines I set forward. The days of arbitrary, damaging rules like the Clean Power Plan and the so-called ""Waters of the U.S. mandate"" will come to an end.And that brings me to one final step I'd like to preview today, which is the work I will do as president to empower states to regulate energy production within their own borders. Senator Lankford has been a bold leader on this issue.As he'll tell you, Washington is currently on a crusade to take control of energy production away from the states. For example, the Bureau of Land Management is pursuing new, duplicative restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments are far better equipped than Washington to oversee energy production and balance environmental concerns.Not only that, but anyone and everyone running for president needs to understand a basic truth: the Constitution grants very specific powers to the federal government, and if something isn't on that list, it falls under the purview of the states. So when I take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, I am going to take that oath very seriously  and that will include allowing the states to control their own energy futures.Oklahoma is proof of the ability of states to achieve their own energy potential. It is now the 4th largest natural gas producer in the U.S., and the entire energy industry led to $65 billion in gross state product in 2013 and supports more than 465,000 jobs. That's a staggering 20 percent of the state's labor force.Oklahoma has been at the forefront of the shale revolution, which has helped turn America into the number one oil and natural gas producer in the world. Nationally, lower energy costs driven by new technologies have already helped America become competitive again in sectors where we had begun to lag, such as manufacturing.This growth and revival can continue across all industries, and it will continue if we unleash our energy potential, and it must continue if we want to make the 21st century an American Century."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 8, 2015",Press Release - 10 Things That Every American Should Be Concerned About In The Iran Deal,"President Obama has resorted to a disgraceful campaign of fear to try to sell his flawed Iran deal to the American public and skeptical members of Congress. His reliance on threats of ""this deal or war"" and his denigration of deal skeptics as ""the crazies"" indicate the weaknesses of the agreement itself. Last month, the Obama administration released an annotated version of the deal. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Kerry delivered a speech in Philadelphia once again outlining the deal's parameters and claiming that no alternative existed other than an unraveling of the sanctions regime and potentially, war.But far from offering comfort, an in-depth review of the text of the deal and the administration's arguments only drive home the deal's flaws. There are many things to be concerned about by Obama's failed diplomacy with Iran. But here are the 10 things that should worry Americans the most.1) Secret Side Deals (Article 14; Annex I)Iran struck two secret deals with the IAEA, the international body responsible for overseeing compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. First, the White House refused to acknowledge them. Then, it said was aware of the contents. Finally, Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz admitted that they hadn't read them at all. If our chief diplomat and the administration's top nuclear expert haven't reviewed documents crucial to defining the inspections, what kind of confidence can we have in the deal? The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act specifically requires all associated agreements to be submitted for congressional review, something which has yet to occur despite leaks indicating that Iran may essentially be allowed to ""self-inspect"" a key former nuclear research site.2) No Transparency on Past Nuclear Weapons Programs (Article 14; Annex I)The secret IAEA agreements reportedly address two topics: inspections at the Parchin military base where Iran tested components of a bomb, and the degree to which Iran must reveal its past weaponization efforts. Without full information, including access to the individuals involved in Iran's illicit activities, inspectors can't truly know whether Iran is keeping its end of the bargain and whether, in fact, Iran has completely halted these activities. In fact, press reports have indicated that Iran will turn in its own samples from Parchinlike letting known steroid-using baseball players provide their own urine samples. Iran's officials, including its nuclear negotiators, continue to falsely claim that Iran's past nuclear activities were entirely peaceful. If Iran is not willing to be honest about its past activities, why should we believe their assurances about their activities in the future?3) Shoddy Inspections (Article 15; Annex I)What happens if inspectors suspect violations at an unmonitored location? They can request a visit, kicking off a 24-day process that can stretch even longer if Iran stonewalls and the issue is eventually referred to the UN Security Council. The Obama administration says this is enough time to catch a violation that involves nuclear material. But Iran can still conduct other activities, from computer modeling to explosives testing, that it could easily hide in that time period. And leading experts say that Iran could easily move a small plant of advanced centrifuges without a trace. Meanwhile, a series of senior Iranian officials have said that the agreement will not require to Iran to provide access to military facilities, directly contradicting the Obama administration's assertions and the IAEA is struggling to get physical access to the suspected nuclear weapons research site at a military facility at Parchin, which does not bode well for access to other suspected sites in the future.4) Sanctions Relief Is Not Tied to Iranian Behavior (Articles 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; Annex II)Instead of lifting sanctions based on regular, rigorous assessments of Iranian compliance, the agreement front-loads relief. After Iran implements its initial requirements, it will not only receive upwards of $100 billion but also will receive increased access to the global economy and renewed investment from abroad. That means Iran can pocket all of those gains, violate the deal, and use its newfound wealth to thwart any U.S. attempt to reimpose sanctions. In the words of Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif, ""Once the structure of sanctions collapses, it will be impossible to reconstruct it.""5) ""Snapback Sanctions"" That Will Never Be Imposed (Articles 36)The process for reimposing sanctions in the event of a violation by Iran is determined by a commission in which Washington relies on Europe to vote with it. If a European country sides with Iran, there will be no sanctions. What's more, the deal allows Iran to break off the agreement in response to any new sanctions. A violation would have to be large and obvious for the P5+1 to risk blowing up the pactand Iran has mastered the art of cheating on the margins. The administration claims that incremental violations will be punished but it is unclear how the United States and its partners will do so without provoking an Iranian withdrawal from the agreement. Indeed, Iran's lead negotiator told the Iranian parliament that ""sanctions can be re-imposed on Iran only in case of serious violation of its obligations and not in the case of small-scale violations"" and foreshadowing how delicate the deal's understandings are, within weeks of the agreement being concluded, Iran accused the United States of being in ""material breach"" of the agreement due to comments made by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.6) The Grandfather Clause and Non-Nuclear Sanctions (Articles 26 and 37)If Washington somehow detected a violation and snapback sanctions were eventually invoked, it is unclear what the economic impact would be. That's because under the deal, the text appears to imply that all existing contracts signed by Iran with foreign companies are grandfathered in and would not be subject to new sanctions. That could shield billions of dollars from sanctions. The Obama administration claims that there is no grandfather clause but Secretary Kerry has written yet to be publicly released letters to his European and Chinese counterparts reassuring them about how their national companies will be affected by any reimposition of U.S. sanctions. When asked in private meetings for their interpretations of the so-called grandfather clause, European officials have expressed conflicting interpretations to Senators. The agreement also states that the United States will ""refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions"" and notes that Iran states that reimposition of sanctions on entities or individuals removed as part of the agreement would lead to an end to the agreement. This severely limits the ability of the United States to target Iranian entities and individuals involved in terrorism or human rights abuses, as many of the financial institutions and some of the individuals currently set to receive relief continue to be involved in other illicit activities. The Obama administration claims that Article 26 does not preclude reimposition of sanctions for other purposes. Yet administration officials have been unwilling to commit to extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, which expires at the end of 2016, highlighting the sensitivity of this issue for Iran.7) Iran Keeps its Nuclear Facilities and U.S. Helps Defend Them (Articles 5 and 6; Annex III)The Islamic Republic will keep and operate multiple nuclear facilities for a theoretical civilian nuclear energy program, which experts agree it has no need for. This dangerous precedent for the global nonproliferation regime will eventually allow an internationally-endorsed industrial size enrichment program in one of the world's most unstable regions. Iran will be allowed to continue to operate facilities that were developed in secret for military purposes, including Fordowa fortified nuclear facility constructed in a mountain. That, and much more: the agreement doesn't require Iran to shutter a single installation. Alongside new research and development permitted by the deal, this surviving infrastructure will, in just over a decade, allow Iran to enrich enough uranium for a bomb in mere days. Meanwhile, the United States and the P5+1 have pledged to ""strengthen Iran's ability to protect against, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage,"" undermining one of the most effective tools that has been used to slow Iran's nuclear program over the last decade.8) Arming Iran and Assisting Its Ballistic Missile Program (Annex II)In five years, the deal will allow Iran to buy advanced Chinese and Russian armsarms that will likely make their way to Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran's other terrorist proxies and be used to threaten Israel and American personnel in the region. The deal does nothing to halt Iran's ballistic missile program and three years after the arms embargo expires, restrictions on international assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program will also end. In five years, Iran can menace the region with new arms; in eight years, it can get international help for its efforts to make missiles built for only one purposedelivering a nuclear weaponthat will eventually be able to strike America.9) With Billions in Sanctions Relief, Iran Will Boost Terror and Threaten the Middle EastFlush with cash and arms, Iran will have even more opportunity to expand its influence across the Middle East and threaten its neighbors. As the Arab world deals with the aftermath of the Arab Spring, an empowered and enriched Iran will have an easy path to expanding its ambition and deepening the discord tearing the region apartdiscord that directly threatens our interests. Even since the deal has been signed, Iranian-backed terror cells have been discovered in several Gulf countries and weapons have continued to flow to Hezbollah. This deal will result in the deaths of more Americans and Israelis and greater instability. President Obama has tried to threaten that the only alternative to this deal is war. The reality is that this deal makes conflict in an already unstable region, more, not less likely and makes any eventual military conflict to prevent a nuclear Iran more difficult.10) Deal Sunset Guarantees a Nuclear Iran and a Polynuclear Middle East (Preamble and General Provisions)Although certain elements of this deal last longer than fifteen years, the key restrictions on Iran's centrifuge research and development will begin to be lifted after year eight of the agreement, allowing Iran to ramp up its enrichment capacity by year fifteen, when the remaining restrictions on enrichment disappear. This ensures that Iran will have an industrial-size enrichment capability after the deal concludes, putting Iran on the threshold of a nuclear weapons capability. By paving a path to Iranian nuclearization, the Obama administration has also paved a path for a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world. Saudi officials, for example, have already warned that they will try to match the capabilities we have permitted Iran, and other countries may followputting unstable adversaries a hair trigger away from a bomb and creating an uneasy standoff between multiple nuclear armed power, something the world has never had to deal with since the dawn of the nuclear age.These are just ten problems with this fundamentally flawed deal. There are many more. This deal will provide the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism with upwards of $100 billion to use at it sees fit just as Iran is expanding its support for terror and instability throughout the Middle East. This deal endorses an eventual industrial-scale enrichment program that Iran has no peaceful use for and will likely lead to a cascade of proliferation in the Middle East. It establishes a shaky verification regime that does not require Iran to fully come clean regarding its past illicit activities. Iran's leaders will be allowed to continue to lie to their people and to the world about their past activities. It abandons Americans who have been unjustly detained by the Iranian regime. It does nothing to alleviate the clerical regime's repression of the Iranian people. The only people who benefit from this agreement are those radicals in the Iranian regime who wish Americans and our allies such as Israel harm. If Iran successfully exploits this deal over the next fifteen years, our children and grandchildren will suffer the consequences as they face a nuclear-armed foe dedicated to the destruction of America and Israel.These are the facts that Obama administration officials continue to obfuscate and respond to with the offensive assertion that the agreement's critics are making common cause with Iranian ""hardliners"" who have American blood on their hands. This deal empowers one of America's most dangerous enemies and fundamentally weakens our security. If President Obama proceeds without congressional support and I am elected President, I will reimpose sanctions on Iran on day one and ensure that this deal is discarded on the ash heap of history where it belongs."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 14, 2015",Press Release - America's Education System Needs A Disruption,"Our current higher education system is outdated and fundamentally broken. It is too expensive, too time consuming, and too difficult to access. Unfortunately, the ideas President Obama offers does nothing to deal with the underlying problems in the current system. Instead, they would double-down on Washington's failed strategy of spending more taxpayer money on the same outdated model. This will not be good enough.While higher education was merely an option for most Americans in the last century, today it is a necessity for nearly everyone. This is because our economy has fundamentally changed. Technology has replaced many low-skilled jobs, and the higher-paying jobs of tomorrow require more advanced skills than ever before. To make the 21st century an American century, we must bring higher education within reach of all.With so many new ways to share and access knowledge, there is no reason our people should still have to spend tens of thousands of dollars and four years on a campus to earn degrees. It's time for Washington to embrace the 21st century. As president, rather than attempting to simply cover the symptoms of high tuition rates, I will fundamentally overhaul higher education to change how we provide degrees, how those degrees are accessed, how much that access costs, how those costs are paid, and even how those payments are determined.First, I will reform our accreditation system to welcome low-cost, innovative higher education providers, which are currently being blocked by the existing institutions that control accreditation. This will transform higher education by exposing it to the market forces of choice and competition. The needs of students will become the primary driving force. As more affordable and accessible providers enter, existing colleges and universities will be forced to lower their prices to stay competitive.Next, I will help students and families earn the right degree at the right price from the right institution for them. I'll require schools to tell students how much they can expect to earn with a given degree before they take out the loans to pay for it. I will open financial aid programs that allow working students to go to school at night, online, and on weekends. I will make career and vocational education more widespread, even allowing high school students like those President Obama will be speaking to today to graduate with a certification to instantly enter a good-paying career.I will create new alternatives to student loans. I will also tie traditional loan repayment to each graduate's income, enabling those who earn more to pay back their loans faster and those who earn less to make smaller payments over a longer period of time. This will dramatically reduce the financial risks of earning a degree.If we take these steps to transform higher education, families won't struggle as much to afford college  and the government won't have to spend as much, or tax as much, to help them pay. While President Obama's plan would spend $60 billion to provide free access to community college, my plan would ensure students have multiple affordable options so they don't feel pressured to pick the one government will pay for. While President Obama's plan would double down on outdated methods of earning degrees, my plan would allow students to combine what they already know with faster and more affordable pathways to a degree.Higher education is only one of the outdated institutions I will modernize as president. Its failings demonstrate how 20th century institutions cannot be used to access 21st century opportunities, and President Obama's adherence to the old way of doing things demonstrates the need for a new president with new ideas. Embracing the future with enthusiasm and vision is the only way to create a new American century.(Op-ed originally appeared in the Des Moines Register on September 13, 2015)"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 15, 2015",Press Release - Why We Can't Tolerate President Obama's Iran Deal,"Over the weekend, just after forty two Senate Democrats did President Obama's bidding and blocked a vote on his flawed Iran deal in the Senate, Iran's Supreme Leader again threatened the United States and Israel. His official Twitter account linked to an online video that ominously references the deaths of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan and depicts Iranian speedboats about to crash into a U.S. Navy vessel. Khamenei's video ended a week in which he told an audience in Tehran that Israel would not exist in twenty five years.Yet, despite the vivid threats and the evidence of chaos as Iran sows instability throughout the Middle East, President Obama and his enablers in the U.S. Senate continue to claim that their deal will not benefit Iran's terrorism apparatus and that it is in our national interest.Despite the willingness of Democrats to provide cover for the White House, we still have an opportunity to put the Senate on record. Instead of just giving up and conceding defeat, I've argued that we need to try everything in our power to prevent a flawed deal that will have devastating consequences for American security from taking effect.Read more about how we can do so here."

Here, he will find people who are uniquely free.We Americans are free to give our opinions and make our voices heard. We work in a free enterprise economy that, for over 200 years, has lifted countless individuals above the circumstances of their birth to achieve their God-given potential. We have been an exceptional country because, here, people are free to practice their faiths and worship God.And we have enshrined in our founding documents and promoted the fundamental truth, all around the world, that the rights of all men, women and children  not simply Americans  come from God.? . . .Our brave men and women have made many sacrifices in just wars to defeat the forces of evil. We have exported our greatest values: freedom and opportunity, which have lifted millions out of poverty. At home, these values allow Americans to use their God-given potential and make their dreams reality. For this reason, we are truly blessed, and I am excited for Pope Francis to see this firsthand.This month, the Pope also visits a country that is close in distance from the United States, but far from free.In Cuba, His Holiness won't find a government that protects its people and their God-given rights. Instead, he will find a regime that oppresses people and hinders progress, both socially and politically. He will meet with a regime that is solely responsible for the Cuban people's plight over the past 56 years.Read the rest of Marco's CNN op-ed here."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 21, 2015",Press Release - Putin Is Expanding His Power in the Middle East  We Must Counter Him,"An Op-Ed by Marco Rubio(Originally published on NationalReview.com 9.21.15)Ever since thensecretary of state Hillary Clinton announced a ""reset"" of relations with Russia in 2009, the consequences of six years of failed U.S. policy toward Russia have played out in the annexation of Crimea and the battlefields of eastern Ukraine. This policy has also helped prolong the humanitarian and strategic nightmare that Syria has become.Somehow, as the evidence of failure grows, President Obama still can't seem to understand Vladimir Putin's goals. Putin wants nothing less than the recognition of Russia as a geopolitical force. He has already achieved this in Europe, and he is now pursuing the same goal in the Middle East, exploiting the vacuum left by President Obama's ""leading from behind"" approach.Since the outbreak of the revolt in 2011 against Russian ally Bashar al-Assad, President Obama and his aides have tried to involve Putin in a negotiated solution. Rounds of negotiations in Geneva produced a theoretical framework for a ""transition"" process in Syria that did not require Assad to step down. Time and again, Russia has defended Assad at the United Nations and prevented meaningful actions to hasten the end of the conflict.Even U.S. efforts to work with Russia to rid Syria of its chemical weapons have failed. Obama worked with Putin to negotiate a deal whereby Assad agreed to give up his chemical weapons in return for an American commitment not to bomb him. The result was a deal that Assad did not fully honor. There has been ample evidence in recent months that the regime and now ISIS forces continue to use chemicals as weapons of war.Despite all of this, President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have remained naively optimistic that Russia can be part of the solution in Syria. On July 14, the day he announced a disastrous deal with Assad's Iranian patrons, the president told the New York Times: ""I was encouraged by the fact that Mr. Putin called me a couple of weeks ago and initiated the call to talk about Syria. . . . That offers us an opportunity to have a serious conversation with them.""Yet despite that ""serious conversation,"" in recent weeks Russia, which already has a naval base in the Syrian port city of Tartus, has been building up its military forces in Syria. The Russians are constructing an air base and bringing in troops, including veterans of their dirty war in Ukraine, along with aircraft to help prop up Assad at a time when regime forces have been losing ground.Despite a flurry of desperate telephone calls from several Obama-administration officials to their Russian counterparts, Putin, perhaps hoping to distract attention from the continued chaos in eastern Ukraine, has not suspended Russia's buildup in Syria. Reportedly, some administration officials even hope to cooperate with the Russians against ISIS in Syria, just as President Obama has tried to cooperate with another U.S. enemy, Iran, in Iraq.In the absence of American leadership, Syria has now become a playground for malign, anti-American forces such as ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Iranian Quds Force  and now Russia. The situation will only get worse until the U.S. provides leadership to counter the forces of extremism: We must work with moderate elements of the opposition and step up training of rebels to fight not only ISIS but also Assad.As for Russia, we need to recognize that the ""reset"" has failed and that the U.S. must confront Putin's assault on international security. The U.S. and the European Union have already imposed some sanctions on Russia, but we need to do much more to bar Russian firms, especially state-owned firms, from Western markets.The U.S. also needs to help the victims of Russian aggression by providing arms, not just ""nonlethal"" supplies, to the democratically elected government of Ukraine.And NATO should station more than token forces in member states bordering Russia, because Putin must learn that he cannot get away with doing to the Baltics what he has already done to Ukraine. We need to make clear to Putin that we do not welcome Russia's assistance in the fight against ISIS. Russian support for Assad's slaughter of the Syrian people is only laying the groundwork for more decades of conflict and instability in an already fractured Syria. If Russia does not halt and reverse its military buildup in Syria, the U.S. should sanction the Russian defense companies and the individuals involved. Countries surrounding Syria that enable these actions by allowing Russian military overflights also need to know there will be a price for enabling Putin's expansionism.We also must increase our cooperation with our Middle Eastern partners to reassure them that the U.S. is not going to cede regional influence to Russia. Putin's Syria play is in part an effort to sow the perception that the U.S. is disengaged from this vital region.In sum, we need to replace a policy of weakness with a policy of strength. We need to restore American leadership and make clear to our adversaries that they will pay a significant price for aggression. President Obama's policies of retreat and retrenchment are making the world a more dangerous place. The ObamaClinton Russia policy has already undermined European security. We can't let Putin wreak even more havoc in the Middle East.View op-ed as it originally appeared here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 23, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio's Plan to Restrain Out-of-Control Regulation,"Federal regulations are out of control. With hundreds of billions of dollars in new costs imposed under the Obama administration, we have a system of regulations and rules that strangles job creation, holds downtake-home pay, and puts unelected bureaucrats in charge of huge sectors of our economy.In 2014, Marco proposed a National Regulatory Budget, which would set a cap on the costs federal regulations could impose on the economy.For everydollar in costs regulators want to impose, they have to find a dollar in existing costs that they'll repeal.Marco's proposal would also impose a cap on each agency, so that Congress would be able to limit new regulation unless agencies, like the EPA, were willing to provide dollar-for-dollar relief.The budget would limit the costs regulators can impose on the economy, boost wages and job creation, and limit unelected regulators' power to interfere in the economy.Marco's proposal has received praise from conservatives andbusiness organizations.The Competitive Enterprise Institute:A regulatory budget could help incentivize other reforms like cost analysis and sunsets. It would also allow Congress to allocate regulatory cost authority among agencies and to distinguish among categories like economic, health and safety, and environmental regulations. . . . Congress should pass the National Regulatory Budget Act.The National Association of Manufacturers:The National Regulatory Budget Act of 2014 is an innovative reform measure that would provide an incentive for federal agencies to reform our regulatory framework and eliminate unnecessary burdens that impede economic growth.The National Small Business Association:The National Regulatory Budget would impose strict, enforceable constraints on the ability of the federal government to impose regulatory costs on the public. . . . Reining in excessive regulations will provide a boost to, and certainty for entrepreneurs as they work to compete, expand and create jobs.Avik Roy, Forbes:Conservatives are really good at complaining about what they're against. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) is taking a different tack: he's laying out a thoughtful reform agenda that explains what Republicans could be for. . . . Rubio's [National Regulatory Budget] tackles the largest, and least-covered, drag on the U.S. economy. . . . It's high time we did something about this problem, and Sen. Rubio is to be saluted for bringing it to the public's attention.A National Regulatory Budget  a reform that other countries have successfully used to restrain regulatory overreach  is exactly the kind of reform Marco will put in place to help the American economy compete in a global economy, and make this century a New American Century."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 25, 2015",Press Release - Here's What Marco Is Proposing to Help Working Families,"Today, Marco is announcing a plan to support families who need time off from work to care for a newborn, to help an ailing relative, or support a family member serving our country abroad.Here's how it'll work:Marco's Plan Will Encourage Paid Family Leave Without Pricey, Harmful Government MandatesExpanding access to paid family leave is part of Marco's pro-family, pro-growth agenda. The status quo too often forces workers  especially new mothers  to quit their job permanently when they need time away from it, making it harder to return to work one day. Done right, policies that encourage paid family leave can help Americans keep their jobs while focusing on their most important responsibilities: welcoming new life, caring for an ailing loved one, or supporting family members deploying to serve our nation. Democrats like Hillary Clinton believe outdated, costly federal mandates coupled with new tax increases are the right approach, but we can do better in the 21st Century. Another one-size-fits-all burden from Washington is wrong for America's diverse, dynamic workforce and middle-class families, especially when our country is struggling under the weight of Obamacare and other new costly regulations. The big government approach to paid family leave will cause employers to end or reduce more generous plans and make it harder for women to enter the workforce, while creating an expensive new entitlement. Efforts to encourage paid family leave should support workers  not hold them back.To help businesses expand access to paid family leave, Marco is proposing:Tax Relief for Employers Providing Paid Family LeaveThe plan: A 25% non-refundable tax credit for businesses that voluntarily offer at least four weeks of paid family leave, limited to twelve weeks of leave and $4,000 per employee each year.Marco's plan is:Adaptable to all employee arrangements, including part-time work.Available for new parents; caretakers of sick parents, spouses, and children; employees with serious illnesses; and military families.Based on the Strong Families Act, introduced by Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Angus King (I-ME).Marco's proposal is part of his broader effort to strengthen middle-class families and grow the economy.For instance, he also supports proposals to expand workplace flexibility by allowing employers to provide workers with a choice between receiving monetary compensation or paid leave for working overtime. And Marco's comprehensive tax reform plan will:Create an additional $2,500 Child Tax Credit to provide relief to middle-class families.Eliminate the marriage penalty.Cut taxes for businesses of all sizes to no higher than 25%.Create millions of full-time jobs, increase investment, grow the economy, and boost wages, according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 25, 2015",Press Release - Marco on O'Reilly: Democrats Are Desperate,"Marco was on The O'Reilly Factor on Thursday night, September 21. We've posted some quotes below.Marco on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's attempt to smear a Republican supporter as a Nazi sympathizer:It didn't surprise me, I've been watching Debbie Wassermann Schultz for years in Florida. . . . It is a despicable attack. . . .Even liberal media outlets have criticized her for doing that. Don't expect an apology they just move on, they don't feel like they are accountable to anybody for it.But I think it is also indicative of the levels of desperation that have now entered the Democratic party. Their frontrunner is in a lot of trouble, as we've been seeing in the news over the last few days. This is further sign of the sort of desperation that they're now facing  panic, really.On what he thinks we need to see from the Republican nominee:We need to have someonewho is a serious person, someone who is serious about the future of our country,someone who understands the challenges we face. This election isn't about any of us individually. It'sabout the United States of America at one of the most critical times in its history, both geopolitically and domestically here with our economy. We need someone who has real thoughts and depth on these issues that our country's facing."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 25, 2015","Press Release - Why We Need Strong Families, and How to Support Them","One of the fundamental beliefs that drives my views on public policy is the idea that we cannot have a strong country without strong people, and we cannot have strong people without strong families. Too often in recent years, through both economic and social policy, Washington has tried to compete with families rather than support and defend them. As president, I will reform our government in a way that empowers our families to thrive in this new century, and a major component of this will be reforms to family leave policy.First, I'd like to explain why I think this is so important. Even though I didn't come from a wealthy or powerful family, I believe that I come from extraordinary privilege  not just because I was born in the greatest country on earth, but because I was born to two parents who were able to be a constant presence in the lives of their children. It wasn't always easy for them. My parents' jobs often required them to leave home before dawn and come back after bedtime, and they were often called to work on weekends and holidays.Yet despite the challenges, it was an enormous advantage for me that they were able to be with me when I needed them most  for example, in the earliest years of my life, when my mom stayed home with me while my dad worked; the time I needed surgery, when my dad made sure he was there by my side; and all the smaller moments, too.Read the rest of Marco's op-ed on Medium."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 28, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio: President Obama Has Strengthened Putin in the Middle East,"Marco was on NPR's Morning Edition on Monday, September 28. Listen here:Onhow he sees Russia's role in the Middle East and President Obama's failure in the region:Here's the argument Russians are making: The United States broke the Middle East. . . . They invaded Iraq, then they left too early, and the place collapsed into chaos. And, now that they broke it, they're leaving, and they're leaving us with this mess. So we meaning the Russians we're going to step in and provide the leadership this region needs. And we're a much more reliable than the United States is.This is the argument they're making to multiple countries in the region. This president has fallen into that, he's in fact strengthened Putin's hand.If I were president, the argument would be the reverse: We would provide a clear strategy to deal with ISIS; we would have done so already. Those nations would prefer to work with us, but if left with a choice between Russia and nothing, they're going to choose Russia."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 29, 2015",Press Release - Check Out How Huge Marco's Crowd Was on Monday,"Over 1,000 people were in the Villages, Florida, a key Republican campaigning stop, last night to hear Marco Rubio's vision for a New American Century. The crowd filled not one but two overflow rooms.Local NBC affiliateWESH-TV reports: Senator Rubio got a rousing standing ovation when he took to the stage, then again when he talked about national security.  Rubio scored his longest, loudest applause of the day when he referred to a portrait in the Eisenhower Recreation Center, of the former president and general, saying it's time we increased the size of our military. ""In the face of all of this danger, we are reducing our military and we know history proves, and the things on this wall prove, that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military force on this planet,"" Rubio said. Rubio went on to say, ""If I am ever blessed to be President of the United States, hopefully in about a year, not only will we have the strongest military in the world, but our allies will trust us and our adversaries will respect us,"" Rubio said.The Tampa Bay Times:""We cannot simply promote the next person in line or the most familiar name,"" Rubio said, warning that without new leadership the country may leave the next generation with less opportunity than had been left for the current generation. He talked broadly about cutting regulations, expanding domestic energy production, beefing up the military, repealing Obamacare and putting greater emphasis on promoting vocational education.Some individuals who were impressed with Marco:Mike Fleming says that he's supporting Marco because he's the outside who can change in Washington. Fromthe Associated Press:Mike Fleming, 60, who is originally from Michigan and retired to The Villages a year ago, supports Rubio because he sees him as ""an outsider"" who ""is the kind of change we need in Washington.""Saundra Cilibertosays that need Marco represents the GOP's best hope of winning back the White House.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 29, 2015",Press Release - Read What Marco Had to Say to a Huge Gathering of Social Conservatives,"Marco spoke at the Value Voters Summit in Washington, D.C., last week, to an audience of thousands of conservative activists. He talked about the importance of strong families and strong values, and announced a plan to encourage employers to support families by offering paid leave, without new taxes or mandates.You can watch Marco's remarks here, or read them below:The Family Research Council's Value Voters Summit, September 25, 2015Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.Well, thank you for having me. There's four bottles of water here. Isn't that a bit much?I'm really honored to be with you. Thank you very much. It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you here today  exciting times for us in terms of the future of our country. We face extraordinary challenges but also some real opportunities, and that's what I wanted to talk about today. In fact, I wanted to announce a couple of policy initiatives today I haven't discussed before, so I actually put it in writing, and the good news is I finally was able to retrieve them from my email system.Anyway, thank you so much. I'm really honored to be here with you today, with all of you who are motivated to participate in the public square because of our values. And this is important, because we've always had this debate about, well, what role should faith play in your life, and what role should faith play in politics. That's a silly debate. For starters, our country was founded on a spiritual principle, on the idea that every human being has rights that are given to you by God, not  not by your government, not by the king. It was a revolutionary idea.And second, as a Christian, I am taught from the earliest days of my life that I'm supposed to model Jesus Christ, God made man, and that means I'm supposed to care for the less fortunate. That's supposed to mean that I'm supposed to try to be humble, that there's strength in weakness, that the meek shall inherit the earth, that my job is to care in love for my fellow man because there's never been a person who God didn't love. And so people better hope that my faith influences the way we govern, because these are important values. And unfortunately, they're eroding in our country.And I'm honored to be able to run for president. It's an extraordinary opportunity and one that I'm grateful for the blessing to be able to do.It's been over five months now since we started this campaign, and you know, at virtually every event that we do, I'll meet someone or I'll see something that reminds me of my parents, even here today, for my father worked a banquet bartender in rooms just like this, and he did that job well into his 70s.Many of you probably know this by now, but both my parents were born on the island of Cuba to poor families. And they were born into a society like most, if not almost every place outside of America, where their future largely depended on what their parents did.My mother was one of seven sisters who was born to a father who, because he was disabled by polio as a child, he struggled his whole life to find and keep jobs that allowed him to provide for his children. My father actually had it even tougher. His mother died when he was only nine. And the day after her funeral, at nine years of age, he had to go work in the streets of Havana with his father. He had to leave school. He would never go back to school, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life.After my parents were married in Cuba, they wanted something better for themselves and their own children. And so in 1956 they came to America, to the one place on earth where people like them could have a chance. And their early years in America were not easy either. But you know that in time they found good jobs. My father worked, as I said, as a bartender. And my mother had all kinds of jobs. She was a cashier. She was a maid. She was a stock clerk at KMart.They earned enough money to buy a home and raise a family and retire with security. And even though their jobs often required them to leave home before dawn and come back after bedtime, they were able to be there in the most important moments of their children's lives, to provide for our needs and to teach us the values that we needed to be successful.When I tell that story, I'm often reminded by people that I don't come from privilege. And the truth is if by privilege they mean wealth and power, that's true. I didn't inherit any money from my parents. But I nonetheless believe that I actually do come from extraordinary privilege, because I'm a citizen of the single greatest nation in all of human history  a nation founded on the fundamental belief that every person has a God-given right to go as far as their talent and their work will take them; a nation who says to us that even the son of a bartender and a maid could have the same dreams and the same opportunities as someone who is born into wealth and into power.But I was also privileged because I was raised with something that's become increasingly rare. I was raised in a stable home by a mother and a father, a man and a woman who were married who loved each other, who loved their children, who were an active presence in our life, and who raised me and us to believe that if we lived with the right values and with the faith in an almighty God, there was nothing that we could not accomplish.Today that American dream that my family achieved is slipping out of reach for far too many. Our economy has fundamentally transformed since my parents' time. In fact, it's very different than the one I grew up in. Rapid advances in technology have replaced old jobs with new ones, and globalization has forced us into competition with dozens of other nations for jobs and innovation.And yet while our economy is transforming, our government policies are not. We have unfortunately a political class in this country that refuses to toss out its old and outdated ways of thinking when it comes to our economy, the way of thinking that says we need guardians in government to protect us from ourselves, that to help someone climb up the economic ladder, we have to pull someone else down, and that government, not the family, is the most important institution in society.Our outdated leaders fail to recognize the changes that it will take to seize the promise of this new economy. And as a result, that promise is passing us by. Today businesses are dying faster than they are forming. The cost of everyday life is soaring while wages remain the same. And too many parents feel as if the longer and harder they work, the further they and their children are falling behind.I want to be clear about something. Even with our many challenges, America is still the best-equipped nation on the planet to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this new century. Ask yourself this: Is there any country on earth you would rather be? Is there any country you would trade places with? Or here's another way to think about it: When was the last time that you read about a boatload of American refugees arriving on the shores of another country?So America is still special. But recent years have proven that our exceptionalism is not self-sustaining, that we didn't become special by accident, and we aren't going to stay that way without effort. We're not going to stay that way by looking to the same leaders and the same ideas that have led us to this point.I believe what the American people are looking for at this moment in our history is clear. They are looking for leaders who understand the changes that have occurred in our economy, who understand the unique challenges that are facing our families in this century, who will come here to this city and fight the status quo that is holding us back, and in its place offer clear alternatives for the future.Now, the political class sees this sentiment and they try to make sense of it all. But they can't, because never before, certainly in my lifetime, has the political class of our country, or the mainstream media that covers them, for that matter, been more out of touch with the American people than they are right now.Look at the deal with Iran, which is basically just a series of concessions to an enemy of the United States. The American people realize how bad the deal is. They oppose it by an overwhelming two-to-one margin. And yet Washington still can't and won't stop it. And the issues like this are numerous. They're so big. They're so consequential. These issues are so generational that people cannot help but ask, how can it be, how can it be that we sent a Republican majority to Congress and yet they're still not able to stop our country from sliding in the wrong direction?And we'll see how things progress. Just a few minutes ago Speaker Boehner announced that he will be resigning. And with all due respect to people that serve in government, it is important at this moment with respect to him and the service that he's provided to our country  it's not about him or anybody else and I'm not here today to bash anyone  but the time has come to turn the page. The time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country.And that extends to the White House and the presidency as well. And that's why, after just four and a half years in the Senate, I decided that I would run for president, because I realized that none of the problems I got elected to solve are going to be solved if we keep promoting the same people to higher and higher ranks within our government.Here's the simple truth: To set a new precedent in Washington, we need a new president in Washington. We need a president who understands that this economic transformation we've undergone is a perfect chance to embrace and reinvigorate the free-enterprise economy, not to abandon it; a president who will fight Washington's special interests in both parties, not be coopted by them; who will take clear and even unpopular positions to confront the greatest threats to our nation.And most of all, what we need is a president who, on their first day in office, will put the left hand on the Bible and their right hand in the air and promise to uphold the entire Constitution, including the right of religious liberty, including the right to bear arms, and including the God-given and inalienable right to life.Sadly, it's been almost eight years since we had a president like that. But if I have the opportunity to serve in the highest office in the land, I promise you that I will live by that creed and I will live by that pledge, because when I'm president I will empower our people rather than our government. And I will do that by recognizing that you cannot have a strong people without strong families.The truth is that what happens in our house, in your house, what happens in my house, is, more often than not, just as important for the future of our country, if not more so, than what happens in the White House. But too often, especially in recent years, Washington has tried to compete with the family rather than support it. In fact, it's tried to redefine family. It's persecuted and now even prosecuted those who do not agree with the new direction that those seek to take us. It has punished marriage, the foundation of family life, by taxing married couples more than singles. It has made it harder for parents to keep what they earn and it has challenged the values and supplanted the faith organizations that have provided the centuries of empowerment to our people.I have a plan to reform our government in a way that empowers families to thrive in the modern economy. And a major component of this will be reforms to family leave policy that I'd like to introduce for the first time here today. Now, I said a moment ago that one of the reasons why I'm so privileged is that I was born to two parents who were married and who were able to be a constant presence in our lives. This was an extraordinary and enormous advantage for me growing up. And that's why now, as a parent, I struggle with the demands of public life  the public life that I've chosen. It pains me every time that I have to miss a volleyball game or a football game or a field trip, even though I know that I'm doing this for them. And this struggle is not unique to me. It's a problem that almost every parent in America faces today. And the reason this hurts is because we know the greatest gift parents can give their children is the time we spend together, the values that only parents can teach, the love only parents can provide, the encouragement only parents can offer.And it cannot come via text or cellphone calls sometimes, at least not completely. It has to come through time spent together. And that's why one of the greatest threats to family today is that there are too many Americans who have to choose between being there for their children in times of great need or meeting the basic financial needs of their family. And like so many fundamental problems, this one can be traced back in part to the outdated policies from Washington, D.C.Our current law mandates that employees offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers with certain family or medical issues, like a newborn child in need of care, an elderly parent with declining health or a personal health crisis. But this has proven insufficient because taking unpaid leave is simply not a viable financial option for many American. Now, most of our current leaders, including Hillary Clinton, stick to this outdated way of thinking. They say that the only way to solve this problem is the way they think we can solve every problem: raise taxes, grow government, and place crippling requirements on private companies.I don't need to tell anyone here why that wouldn't work. It's the same reason Obamacare hasn't worked. Our policies should help workers, not cost them their jobs. And I believe we can fix this problem by creatively applying our free enterprise principles in a way that encourages businesses to choose to offer more family paid leave. To do this, we should provide a limited 25 percent, non-refundable tax credit to any business that offers between four and 12 weeks of paid leave. For instance, if you're offered $1,600 in paid leave for four weeks while you take care of your newborn child, which would be the equivalent of about $10 an hour, your employer could claim a tax credit of $400. This won't solve every scheduling conflict between work and family life. No policy can do that. But it will help ensure that our people don't have to sit behind a desk while the most profound moments of their lives pass them by. And it will help our businesses expand and create new jobs by allowing them to keep more of their money rather than send it to be wasted here in Washington.Conservatives, by the way, are already fighting hard on this issue. Senator Deb Fischer has been a leader on family leave reform and I'm glad to join her in her efforts as one way to address the problem. Now, unfortunately, our current president prefers not to sign legislation that's common sense. So these efforts will likely be something that we will need to take up if, God willing, I'm president. Doing so will be a step towards reclaiming the American dream in this century, but it will only be one step.Of course, people cannot be concerned about family leave if they don't have a good paying job to take leave from. So we need our next president to recognize an important fact that no one in Washington today seems to understand: Politicians don't create jobs. The American people create jobs. We need a president and we need leaders at every level of government who stop placing our people's faith in our government and start placing our government's faith in our people. So one way we'll know that I've done the right things as president, is that by the end of my term we won't be talking that much about Washington. We'll be too busy discussing the extraordinary achievements of everyday Americans. By the year 2020, this is what I hope we will be able to say: That we made our business tax code globally competitive, that we repealed and replaced Obamacare, that we placed a cap on regulations, and that we made our country the best place in the world to create jobs, and that as a result our people are creating thousands of businesses, millions of new high-paying jobs, and their innovations are once again driving the progress of the world.In the year 2020, we want to be able to say that we reformed our higher education system, we made it more affordable and more accessible to every American. And as a result, our people are earning degrees that empower them to move from jobs that pay $10 an hour to jobs that pay $70,000 a year, that millions are beginning to emerge from the shadow of student loan debt, and that high schoolers are graduating with certifications to immediately enter good-paying careers.In the year 2020, I want to be able to say that we've secured our borders first, that we've reformed our legal immigration system so that people come to this country based on what they can contribute to our economy, on the basis of whether they want to become an American, not simply live in America, not whether they have a family member living here. And that we've done what we needed to do to save Social Security and Medicare without having to make any changes for people currently on it. And that as a result of these changes, our people are growing our economy at a historic rate, our deficits are finally beginning to dwindle, and the national debt is being brought under control so that it no longer is threatening to take away everything that makes our country so special.In the year 2020, I want to be able to say that we have defended religious liberty. That we have supported  that we have worked hard to support the right of our people not just to hold traditional views, but to exercise them, to express them. That we've reformed the tax code to encourage marriage rather than punishing it. And that we made it easier for parents to afford the cost of raising their children, and that as a result our families have found financial security, that they're raising strong children with strong values, and that they're instilling in their kids all the hope in the future of America that our parents instilled in us.That's what I want to be able to talk about in 2020  the accomplishments of our people, not of Washington. But there's one more important point that needs to be made, one that transcends policy and politics altogether. No candidate for president can claim to stand on the side of our people if they do not believe that every person has a right to exist. And that's why the issue of right to live is more than political or policy related. It is not a political issue  it is a human rights issue. It is a definitional issue about what kind of country we want to be. In a world where life is increasingly not valued, where people are summarily discarded, America must stand for the belief that all life is worthy of protection, because all life comes from God. And so by the year 2020, I hope we will be able to say that abortions after 20 weeks are illegal, that no taxpayer money is used to fund abortions here or abroad, and that Planned Parenthood doesn't receive a penny from the federal government.So let me just close  my time is up  and so let me just close by saying this: For many of us, for me, for most of you who that were born and raised in this country, it's sometimes easy to forget how special America is, because this is all we've ever known. But I had one more blessing. I was raised by people who knew how special America was because they knew what it was like to lose a country, because they knew what life was like outside this country, because they understood how different America was from the rest of the world.My parents, my grandfather, they taught me by word and by deed that what makes America great is not that we have more rich people than anybody else  every country has rich people. What makes America great is that the dreams that are impossible everywhere else are possible here. And why is that? Well, it's because of the choices that the people before us made.Almost every other country in the world chose to have a government run their economy. In those countries, people who can influence the government, they're the ones that keep winning, and everybody else stays the same. The employee never becomes the employer. The small business can never compete with a big business. And no matter how hard your parents work or how many sacrifices they made, if you weren't born into the right family in those countries, there is only so far you can go.But the Americans before us chose something very different. They chose individual liberty. They chose limited government that exists to protect our rights, not to decide them or to grant them. And yet there are still people in American politics, sadly in both parties, who cling to the belief that America is better off adopting the economic policies of the countries that people come here to get away from.Now, look  this is a free society. People have a right to believe whatever they want. But I don't have that option. You see, I'm just a generation removed from a very different life. My parents came here with virtually nothing  no knowledge of English at the time, no money, no friends. The only thing they had was the strong determination to provide their children all the opportunities they themselves never had. And in America they were never rich or wealthy or influential, but their hard work opened doors for their children that had closed for them. Everything that I've accomplished  everything I will ever accomplish  I owe to God, to my parents' sacrifices, and to the United States of America.For me, my parents' story is the essence of the American Dream. It's a story that's rare in the world, but so common here. Because the truth is, it's all our stories. Here in this nation, we are all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. And so now it is our turn. This election is a generational choice about what kind of country, what kind of America we are going to leave for our children, and what kind of country we will be in the 21st century. The final verdict on our generation is going to be written by Americans who have not yet been born. Let us make sure that they write that we made the right choice  that in the early years of this century, faced with troubling and uncertain times, there were those who believed that the great American story had run its course, but we did not agree. Fear did not lead us to abandon our liberty. We fought for and held onto those things that made us exceptional. And because we did, there was still one place on Earth where the individual was more important than the state. There was still one place on Earth where where you come from does not determine how far you get to go. Because we made the right choice, because we did, we didn't just restore the American Dream, we expanded it and extended it to reach more families and more people than ever before. And because we did, for at least one generation more the American miracle lived on.So thank you for the chance to speak to you today. God bless all of you. Thank you."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 30, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Explains Why the U.S. Isn't Trusted Around the World Anymore,"Marco was on Hannity last night, September 29, and talked about new developments in the U.S.-Russia relationship.A couple things are happening with Russia under Putin. One is this kneejerk reaction: They're going to be against whatever America wants. But the second is he wants to reposition Russia as a geopolitical force equal to the United States. . . .He's going across to the counties in the Middle East and he's saying, look, the Americans broke the Middle East and now they're leaving,and they're unreliable. So we're going to step in and we're actually going to fight ISIS, we're really going to do it.But his real goal is to protect Assad keep Assad in power and increase his leverage in the region. Andthat's exactly what he's achieving by what he's done now over the last 48 hours: not just repositioning military assets within the territory of Syria, but also going to the United Nations and saying to the world that Russia, under Vladimir Putin, they're going to be the ones that lead the anti-ISIScoalition.It really diminishing America both geopolitically in the region, but ultimately in the eyes ofalliesand others around the world."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"September 30, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Perfectly Predicted Russia's New Aggressive Action in the Middle East,"Two weeks ago today, on September 16, Marco said this at the presidential debate in California about what Russia is up to in Syria:It's pretty straightforward: He wants to reposition Russia once again as a geopolitical force. He himself said that the fall of the Soviet Union, the destruction of the Soviet Union, was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century. And now he's trying to reverse that. . . . He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.Here's what you're going to see in the next few weeks: The Russians will begin to fly combat missions in that region  not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.The news today:CNN International, September 30, 2015Marco's recent characterization of Vladimir Putin as a ""gangster"" drew a . . . less than convincing response from the Russian president on Sunday, too:60 Minutes, September 27, 2015More on Marco's prediction:Fox and Friends, October 1, 2015Marco has long called for the U.S. to take a larger role in the Syria crisis, to prevent the situation from becoming an opportunity for ISIS and al-Qaeda to flourish, a chance for Russia to expand its influence, and a humanitarian disaster:He has also detailed specific actions he would take to counter Russia's aggression, and will have more to announce soon:For more on Marco's plans for the situation in Iraq and Syria, see his recent pieces in National Review and Foreign Policy."

Earlierthat day, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov appeared in a joint press conference at the U.N. to discuss working together on the Syria situation.September 30, 2015MEGYN KELLY:It was just two weeks ago that Senator Marco Rubio . . . [predicted] that Russia would launch air strikes in Syria, sparingISISterrorists potentiallybut targeting those who opposethe Assad regime  a prediction we saw unfold earlier today. . . . Senator, you nailed it, that's exactly what we're now seeing. How did you know that was going to happen?MARCO RUBIO:Well, it was quite predictable. . . . They may conduct some operations against ISIS, but this is not about ISIS. It's about propping up Assad, who is a client state of both Iran and Vladimir Putin. And it's about something even broader, and that is showing the world that Russia is now a power broker in the Middle East. The message they're sending isthey're actually more reliable than America under Barack Obama. So this is a multifaceted plan by Vladimir Putin. . . .MEGYN KELLY:How big a set back is this to the United States?MARCO RUBIO:Well, it diminishes America's importance in the eyes of the world. We're beginning to look like a junior partner under Barack Obama. You saw that this week play out at the United Nations. Nations in that region  Saudi Arabia, Egypt,Turkey, Jordan, and others  look and say, ""you know, America, we've had a tough time getting them under Barack Obama to do anything meaningful.

Unfortunately, in the cases of mental illness, or the case of someone who just wants a gun to commit a crime, they're not going to follow the law. . . .We need to start examining why it is people are taking violent action, not what they're using to commit the violent act. We have two issues in this country: One is mental illness, which we need to begin to address more seriously,as opposed to stigmatizing or it in some cases trying to put it aside. That's a societal thing we need to confront as a society and a country.The other of course is why have we become so violent as individuals. What is it that's leading people in this country who are not mentally ill todo the sort of drive-by shootings and things that we've seen? . . .The guns are what they're using to commit the violence. In many cases, the laws that are actually being proposed would not have prevented them."

Number 2, to stem some of this flow of migrants that are leaving the region and going into Europe. If they had a place they could stay safely, they wouldn't make that journey.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 6, 2015","Press Release - How Marco Wants to Let Uber, AirBnB, and the Rest of the 21st Century Economy Flourish","Remarks as prepared for delivery, October 6, 2015. Civic Hall, New York City.I'm here today not just to tell you my ideas, but to listen to yours. I think that's a big part of what campaigning is all about. No one understands the needs of the on-demand economy as well as those of you who are building it.Coming into this discussion, here's something I can state with absolute confidence: If there's one thing that matters in the 21st century economy, it's innovation. In order to be the leading economy on earth, America must be the most innovative economy on earth. It's that simple.And whenever we talk about innovation, what we're talking about is problem solving. We're talking about finding ways to do things more efficiently, more affordably, and more conveniently than ever.So I want to begin today by telling you about a problem I had earlier this year that American innovators, including many of you in this room, are attempting to solve. And then I want to tell you something you already know, which is that government is getting in your way of solving it.My problem was this: A few months back, my refrigerator at home stopped working. It just died on us. And with four growing kids home for summer break, you can imagine I was facing some pressure to get it fixed. So I googled appliance repair companies in Miami and made some calls.First of all, it was frustratingly difficult to get anyone to take me off hold or call me back. And when I finally got in touch with a real person, they told me, ""No problem, we'll have someone out to your house in three days to take a look at it.""That just can't be how our economy works in the year 2015. Other things that took three days in the old economy now take three minutes  or three seconds. What struck me in that moment was the following realization:Inevitably, somewhere not far from me, there was someone capable of repairing appliances who was just as eager to make some extra money that day as I was to have a functional refrigerator. The only problem was that this person and I had no way of finding each other.That is a problem that will not exist within a year or two, at least not if American innovators have their way. And the reason is because of the on-demand economy.This is a revolution happening right before our eyes. Also known as the ""sharing economy"" or ""gig economy,"" the on-demand economy is allowing millions of professionals across multiple industries to connect directly with consumers.The most obvious examples are companies like Uber and Airbnb. But just last week it was announced that Amazon and Google would be entering the on-demand market. And right behind these giants are thousands of small, innovative startups. If you haven't heard of them yet, just wait.The on-demand platform is one example of an important truth facing us in this election, which is that the American economy is fundamentally transforming. Uber didn't even exist when our current president was sworn in. Today it's worth $51 billion.And it's not just the fact that the economy is changing; it's the fact that it's changing faster than ever. It took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took CandyCrush one year!Yet while our economy is changing, our government is not. And both parties are to blame. Never before  at least not in my lifetime  has the political establishment in this country been more out of touch with the American people than it is today.The result is a worsening friction between our mid-twentieth century government and our rapidly changing 21st century economy. Nowhere is this friction more apparent than in the on-demand economy. Here, innovative companies are running up against an antiquated tax code, burdensome regulations, and numerous outdated politicians.And that's not all. These companies are also the victims of a coordinated attack from established businesses, which influence the political process to pass new regulations that block competition. We've seen this play out with taxi companies lobbying to stop Uber. And here in New York, the government is spending millions to try and stop Airbnb from threatening hotel chains.I want to give you another example today. I want to tell you about a growing company based here in New York that, like all businesses in the on-demand economy, is facing unnecessary challenges as a result of our outdated government.It's a company called Handy, and its CEO, Oisin, is here today.Handy is an online platform that allows consumers to connect directly with home cleaners, handymen, plumbers and other home service professionals. It's quickly growing, now operating in 37 cities with over 11,000 professionals registered to use the platform.Handy is groundbreaking for consumers for obvious reasons. It provides simple booking at the tap of a finger, a rating and review process that helps them find the best contractor for their needs, and an easy online payment system that eliminates haggling over prices.But it isn't just great for consumers. One of the things I love most about the on-demand economy is the way it promotes upward mobility for the professionals who use it.Through Handy, workers without the resources to start their own cleaning business, pay for their own advertising, or manage their own books can now have all the independence of self-employment and"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 7, 2015",Press Release - Marco Draws Huge Crowds in Iowa,"October 6, 2015Marco's campaign is gaining momentum, and it was easy to see this during his swing through eastern Iowa toward the end of last week, drawing packed crowds in three different cities.Marco Rubio takes pitch to restore the American Dream to Cedar Falls, Iowa.A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on Oct 1, 2015 at 4:51pm PDTMarco got a standing ovation for his talk, about the American Dream, his plans to restore American strength, tax reform, and more.On Friday, it was off to Dubuque, where he also drew a big crowd. The Dubuque Telegraph Herald reports:Marco Rubio shared his vision for ""a new American century"" during a stop in Dubuque today, saying the U.S. is ""still a great country, but it is on the road to decline.""""Change is not going to come from the Democratic Party, at least not the kind that we need,"" said Rubio, a first-term Republican U.S. senator from Florida. ""And it will not come from the Republican Party if we do not turn the page and open it up to for new generation of leadership with new ideas that are relevant to the 21st century.""Rubio attracted an audience of more than 200 people at Grand River Center.After the event, Marco took some questions from reporters, and he was asked what he thought of President Obama's suggestion that the mass shooting that morning in Oregon should prompt politicians to push new gun control policies: I don't think that the solutions he's proposing will create a solution; I don't think it solves the problem. Again, this is a complex issue that may not have a federal solution. We need to learn more facts about this specific shooting, but in general, the question is why are people committing acts of violence, irrespective of what instrument they are using.I think there are deep societal issues involved here  for example, values. No one is born with values, they have to be taught and instilled in you at a young age. And when you have a breakdown of the family, it has an impact on the society at large. That might very well be a leading contributor to some of these.What can the federal government do to make parents better parents, or better husbands, or better wives? Not much, other than to ensure that we're not doing anything that [undermines] the families or the institutions that instill values in our families. This is a much deeper thing than some law we can pass. Not every problem before America has a federal solution.Then, that evening, Marco headed to Cedar Rapids for a forum hosted by Americans for Peace, Prosperity, and Security, a local national-security group. With Russia stepping up its operations in the Middle East just last week, it was a great opportunity for Marco to highlight his understanding of the issues at hand and his specific plans to address them. A couple pictures from the event, courtesy of the Cedar Rapids Gazette:   Missed Marco on this trip? He'll be back to the state soon!"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 7, 2015",Press Release - How Marco Will Boost Innovators Like Uber,"If there's one thing that matters in the 21st century economy, it's innovation. In order to be the leading economy on earth, America must be the most innovative economy on earth. It's that simple.And whenever we talk about innovation, what we're talking about is problem solving. We're talking about finding ways to do things more efficiently, more affordably, and more conveniently than ever.One innovation entrepreneurs have come up with in recent years is the so-called ""sharing economy."" Companies like Uber and Airbnb enable workers and consumers to provide or purchase the goods and services when they want, how they want. Unfortunately, government can get in the way, and outdated labor regulations, new taxes, and other harmfulpolicies can prevent new, innovative businesses and technologies from ever being able to get off the ground.Here's a few of Marco's proposals to protect innovators and consumers, and ensure that we can create a New American Century:Protect Innovation from RegulatorsFederal regulators usually provide cost-benefit analyses for proposed regulations. But the status quo neglects the important question of whether the proposed rule will be an impediment to innovation, cause industries to consolidate into just a few firms, reduce consumer choice, or otherwise inhibit genuine competition. Agencies need to look at how their rules will affect the free-enterprise system. Marco will direct the agencies to issue a Competition and Innovation Analysis for all major rules. Any rules that will hurt the innovative, competitive system will be sent back for revision or rejected.Stop New Online Sales TaxesCurrently, state and local governments can tax only those businesses with a physical location, such as a storefront or warehouse, within their boundaries. Proposals such as the Marketplace Fairness Act would massively expand their taxing powers, potentially subjectingonline retailers to thousands of different tax systems and audits from those jurisdictions. The Act would impose huge compliant costs and new taxes on online retailers, which would fall particularly hard on smaller businesses. The more resources online retailers have to put into mandates like this, the less they can devote to growing their businesses and creating jobs. Marco is opposed to the creation of an online sales tax and will veto any attempts to raise taxes on businesses.Prevent Burdensome Taxation of Digital Goods and ServicesToday, if a consumer downloads a song or app while traveling in another state, the state the consumer is visiting, the state housing the server providing the song, and the consumer's home state could all claim the authority to tax the same transaction. Marco supports providing clarity for the taxation of digital goods and stopping multiple taxes from being imposed by numerous state and local tax authorities. Consumers shouldn't have to worry about incurring additional taxes based on server locations or where they are when they make their digital purchase, and sellers shouldn't be burdened with complex calculations about which jurisdictions they must collect taxes on behalf of. Marco supports limiting tax jurisdiction over digital goods to a single address.Reallocate Wireless Spectrum to Meet Commercial NeedsMarco supports reallocating wireless spectrum controlled by the federal government,to shift it towardcommercial wireless services, and supports increasing transparency about how the resource is allocated and improving the federal government's wireless infrastructure. Smarter use of the wireless spectrumwill boost innovation,lower costs for consumers, and broaden the range of wireless services available.Vigorously Defend Internet FreedomPresident Obama's Net Neutrality takeover of the Internet, whichsubjects21st-century technology to an early-20th century regulatory system, will hamper innovation and raise costs for Internet users. Marco will repeal it as president.The existing governance system for the Internet has allowed the technology to flourish and incredible innovation to occur. Marco will build off unanimous support of a resolution he passed in the U.S. Senate to fight proposals from foreign governments to gut current multi-stakeholder governance of the Internet.On VideoSpeeches & Op-EdsMarco on how to get government out of the way of the 21st century economy.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - This Is Why America Needs to Stand By Israel Right Now,"October 8, 2015Over the past month, Palestinians have staged a series of riots and terrorist attacks targeting Israelis. Last week, a Palestinian terrorist stabbed two Israelis to death in Jerusalem and injured two others, including a two-year old boy. Several days earlier, a terrorist ambushed an Israeli family driving through the West Bank, murdering two parents in front of their four children, ages four months to nine years. Those attacks were only the start. On Wednesday alone, Palestinians reportedly staged over 100 rock attacks, 35 fire bombings, and another series of stabbings.This terrorism follows weeks of growing violence against Israel, from firebomb attacks on Israeli security forces at the Temple Mount to Palestinian rock throwers, who stoned a Jewish driver in Jerusalem, forcing him off the road and killing him. Reminiscent of the days when Yasser Arafat talked peace in English and jihad in Arabic, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas  a man President Obama regularly hails as a peacemaker  is inciting the bloodshed. ""Every drop of blood that has been spilled in Jerusalem is holy blood as long as it was for Allah,"" he recently declared on Palestinian television. ""Al-Aqsa is ours and so is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre... [Israelis] have no right to desecrate them with their filthy feet.""Abbas has used such anti-Semitic language to promote lies that Jews are defiling the Al-Aqsa mosque area and attempting to alter the status quo, in an attempt to take it over. He followed this incitement by declaring at the United Nations last week that he was no longer bound by peace agreements with Israel. The very next day, Fatah claimed responsibility for the brutal terrorist attack in the West Bank  an attack which killed an American citizen.And what has been the Obama administration's response to weeks of official Palestinian incitement, anti-Semitism, and violence?Click here to read the rest of Marco's op-ed on Medium."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - This Fundamental Right Is Under Threat,"One of conservatism's highest priorities must always be to defend the timelessness of our people's fundamental rights. The right to life, the right to religious liberty, the right to bear arms  these rights have no expiration date. Instead, their importance increases with the passage of time. Sometimes, because it is so rarely discussed, it is easy to forget one of the other basic rights our government was established to defend, and that is the right to property.Though it may not make headlines as often as other issues, the fundamental right to private property has been under assault for years through our government's abuses of eminent domain. Eminent domain is the authority vested in government to force the sale of private property. While this authority can be a necessary evil in rare cases related to public development, such as the building of crucial infrastructure, its modern use far exceeds this limitation. Today, it is often wielded by crony capitalist politicians to benefit wealthy and powerful private developers.One of my proudest accomplishments as a public servant was leading the effort in Florida to pass both a law and a constitutional amendment to keep private developers from using eminent domain to take property away from private owners. This effort became necessary after the egregiously flawed Kelo v. New London Supreme Court decision made private use of eminent domain legal unless states banned it. In the years since, the legislation I passed in the Florida House has become a model for states across the country.Read the rest of Marco's op-ed at Hot Air."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - Here's What Marco Will Do for Vets,"Men and women who have served our country deserve our everlasting gratitude, and better treatment than they're getting right now. The VA system is outdated and broken, and far too many veterans are homeless, unemployed, or impoverished. Marco has led bipartisan Congressional efforts to reform the VA: He introduced legislation with House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller allowing secretaries of the VA to fire senior executives at the VAthat are not doing their jobs, which was signed to law. Beyond the VA, Marco has helped put in place stronger financial protections for veterans targeted by scammers, promoted efforts to ensure that veterans have additional educational and employment options after their service, and expanded patient-centered health care options for veterans with service-connected disabilities.By reforming and modernizing the VA, opening up educational and job opportunities that will help veterans, and strengthening the military, as President Marco will make sure our veterans get the treatment they deserve.VA ReformMarco has introduced legislation allowing secretaries of the VA to remove any VA employee based on performance or misconduct. Without the basic accountability this measure offers, we'll never have a VA that works for veterans rather than bureaucrats. Similarly, competition will push the VA to provide top quality care. If veterans don't feel like the Veterans Health Administration suits their needs, Marco supports giving them the option to use the exact same funds to see an approved private sector provider of their choice.Marco will also fight to streamline and reform the VA bureaucracy and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.Education That Works for VetsMarco's plans for higher education reform will offer veterans more flexible, up-to-date options for higher education, including an emphasis on vocational training.With reforms to higher education likeaccreditation reform, for instance, veterans will have new andbetter professional and educational opportunities after leaving the service. What a soldier has done in the military  say, driving a truck or running a logistics operation  should help count toward education and professional certifications here at home.Restoring Military StrengthMarco's plans to strengthen the military will ensure that our servicemembers will go into battle with the best training and equipment we can offer. Reversing sequestration will mean that veterans aren't coming home to pink slips. Military benefits systems also need to be examined and updated to make sense in the 21st century economy, to ensure that pensions and other compensation are attracting the very best to the military.Speeches & Op-EdsMarco will stand with POW/MIA families and veterans.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 9, 2015",Press Release - The Wall Street Journal Loves This Idea of Marco Rubio's,"This week, the Wall Street Journal's editorial board offered high praise for an important part of Marco's plan to modernize and overhaul higher education: his proposal to reform the outdated accreditation system that determines which colleges and universities are eligible for federal financial aid.As the editorial explains, fixing accreditation will allow the creation of innovative and more affordable higher-education options and offer a boost to unconventional institutions shut out by the current system.The Journal editors write:Feigning outrage that college is too expensive is a bipartisan pastime, so it's refreshing to see a presidential candidate taking the cost-drivers seriously. Senator Marco Rubiois highlighting an obscure network of higher-ed busybodies known as accreditation agencies, and more politicians should study up on how to reform this racket.""Our higher education system is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of existing colleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the market,"" Sen. Rubio said in a speech this summer. Last week he introduced a bill with Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) that would test a voluntary certification process for vocational and nontraditional education.Six regional accrediting groups deputized by the Education Department determine whether a college is eligible to receive federal aid dollars, and a coterie of outfits bless specific programs like, say, engineering. The regional agencies appeared in the 19th century to distinguish rigorous institutions from diploma mills, but since the 1960s have morphed into wardens of billions in handouts and subsidized student loans.Read the rest of the editorial here.Read more about Marco's plan for higher education here."

Today, the Afghans are fighting against a brutal foe bent on imposing yet another tyranny on the Afghan people.Afghanistan has marked many victories in the years since 2001  a new constitution, five national elections, the inauguration last year of a pro-Western president, and a tripling in the size of the economy.Even as there has been progress in some areas, enduring challenges remain.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 12, 2015",Press Release - Some Republicans Are Trying Revive This Crony-Capitalist Boondoggle,"Earlier this year, the Export-Import Bank, an 80-year-old federal government institution that subsidizes loans to certain American companies selling products abroad, expired for the first time ever. Marco and other conservatives fought hard to block the Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization, because it is exactly the kind of government intervention America doesn't need if we want to build a 21st Century economy.We want American companies to export as much as possible, but a crony-capitalist New Deal-era subsidized bank, which dished the lion's share of its loans to huge corporations that didn't need the help, isn't the way to do it.Ex-Im fans like to claim it's a free lunch, but economists agree that subsidizing exports isn't a path to job creation or long-term economic competitiveness. Ex-Im's beneficiaries make themselves well known, but there are many, many more losers: domestic companies that don't get Ex-Im's special handouts, American consumers, and the taxpayers who are underwriting the loans.Ex-Im was a bad idea all along, but it started looking even worse this year as news broke about corruption at the bank, sloppy accounting practices, and lack of transparency that made it even more indefensible.Yet some members of Congress are pushing to revive the Bank later this month. It's a bad idea, and Ex-Im should stay a thing of the past.Marco wants to build a New American Economy to compete in the 21st Century, but government intervention like the Ex-Im Bank doesn't help. In fact, more government is exactly what's holding us back."

His mother was a maid at Imperial Palace, his father a bartender at Sam's Town, but he says he did grow up privileged.""MARCO RUBIO: ""I grew up with two parents and a stable home who loved each other and their children and who taught us that we lived in a country that even a son of a bartender and a maid could be anything he or she wanted to be.""GERARD RAMALHO: ""Many groups belong to unions who support the Democratic Party. On immigration, Rubio says his stance is tough but fair.""MARCO RUBIO: ""My position on immigration is pretty straightforward. We have to be responsible but reasonable about how we deal with it. I think it begins by enforcing our laws better. Until we bring illegal immigration under control, we are noting going to make progress on immigration it in this country; it's just that simple.""GERARD RAMALHO: ""Like other Republicans in the race, Rubio says if elected, he'd like to repeal Obamacare, as for the economy there would be changes as well. The President, if you listen to his cabinet, he'll tell you the economy has improved. We've created jobs. We're in a much better position than where we were. What is your take on that and do you think you could improve upon that if elected?""MARCO RUBIO: ""It's true we're technically near full employment but those jobs don't pay enough and you have record numbers of people that have dropped out of the work force. You have to account for both of those things. The new jobs that are being created don't pay enough and you're measuring that percentage against a smaller pool of people, you have people that have dropped out of the labor market and both of these things are disastrous for the country."""
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 12, 2015",Press Release - Read about Marco's Recent Trip to Nevada,"October 12, 2015Marco started off his recent trip to Nevada with a 1,200-person rally in Summerlin on Thursday, which you can read about here. He certainly kept up that momentum throughout the trip, as you can see in this local news report:On his second day in the area, last Friday, Marco spoke at a Christian Businessmen's Network lunch in Las Vegas, where the room was absolutely packed and staff from the kitchen came out to hear him speak about the American Dream. As Rubio addressed a business lunch in Vegas, a chef and waiter came out from the kitchen to listen and record video on their phones.

There was a crush at the door and people standing on chairs in the dining room to try to get a glimpse of him  and though it's pretty hard to knock the Florida senator off his stump speech script, the crowd managed to do that. ""They're handing out mojitos in the middle of my speech, I love it,"" Rubio said in slight amazement as he toggled between the fading American Dream and the need for entitlement reform. ""I promise that has never happened before.""Marco did tons of local media during the trip, including a sit-down with the local CBS station that included some talk about Nevada issues:Later that day, Marco became (so far as we know) the first presidential candidate to attend a ribbon-cutting-by-samurai-sword, for Rick Harrison of Pawn Stars' new retail complex. Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison (Marco's state chairman) and Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman were on hand for the event, too. The Las Vegas Review-Journal has the story of how Harrison came to back Marco:Rubio and Harrison became fast friends earlier this year. After meeting at a political fundraiser, they happened to be in Los Angeles at the same time a couple months later and had breakfast. ""We sat around for close to two hours,"" said Harrison, ""and he never once asked me for money and never once mentioned what's best for the party,"" said Harrison.On Friday, Marco also had a meeting with the editorial board of the Review-Journal:Nevada is a state we intend to spend a significant amount of time in for multiple reasons,"" Rubio said in an editorial board meeting with the Review-Journal on Friday. ""Number 1 is obviously, I have an affinity to it, having lived here for a long time.""University of Nevada  Reno professor Eric Herzik told the paper that right now Marco is the most organized candidate for the Nevada caucuses:""It's not a surprise that Rubio is out of the gate first,"" said Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno. ""He's probably the best organized in the state, certainly among Republicans."" . . . ""He also sees Nevada as a real opportunity for him to score big, stressing his roots in Nevada, the fact that he's Latino, that he can talk to both conservatives and traditional Republicans. This is his kind of state.""Saturday morning, Marco did another packed town hall in Boulder City, where he got the endorsement of several local elected officials, and talked about unleashing America's energy potential:Marco comes 2 Boulder & gets the endorsement of Mayor Woodbury & former Mayors Tobler,Ferraro & Councilwoman Leavitt pic.twitter.com/Cj07QPhnvn Jeremy Hughes (@jeremybhughes) October 10, 2015Rubio tells a crowd in NV that taking advantage of natural gas can ""lead the way"" to a ""manufacturing Renaissance."" pic.twitter.com/NUYh6ZHZ1n Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) October 10, 2015Over 300 in Boulder City for Saturday morning rally with @marcorubio! pic.twitter.com/CvSTsag6YM Alex Conant (@AlexConant) October 10, 2015Later Saturday, Marco attended a town hall meeting hosted by the LIBRE Initiative, where he told supporters that he learned a lot about the American Dream in Nevada.

Restaurants sell tacos. Bars advertise soccer matches. Conversations sound distinctly Mexican. The Florida senator says he feels right at home. He's speaking at the Catholic school he attended ""for a month"" before pleading with his parents to go back to public school with his friends.

NBC News reports that he was received ""very well"" throughout the whole trip:First off, on Tuesday, Marco stopped by a backyard party in Bedford, N.H., with more than 200 attendees, where he told voters he was the candidate with fresh ideas, and outlined his vision for a New American Century. The Boston Herald reports: ""This election is about going in a different direction,"" Rubio said in the backyard of a farm. ""If we just keep electing the same people with the same ideas, nothing is going to change. ""We must now turn the page as a party and as a country,"" he added. ""The time has come to open the way to leaders with new ideas that are relevant to the discussions, the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century.""Here's a recap of Marco's visit from local station WMUR:On Wednesday in Manchester, Marco visited with employees at Dyn, an online infrastructure company, where he shared his vision for a New American Economy in the 21st Century.The Concord Monitor reports: Speaking in an updated Manchester mill building to employees at one of New Hampshire's most well-known tech companies, Marco Rubio said government needs to modernize its policies to help startups and the ""sharing economy"" grow Wednesday. ""We want to make America the easiest, the fastest and the best place in the world to come up with a new idea and turn it into reality in the business world,"" the Republican candidate for president told employees at Dyn. ""Today, in this globally competitive economy, we have some policies that are making it harder, not easier.""Marco also visited with the New Hampshire Union Leader, the state's biggest paper:More laws, such as tighter background checks, would not have prevented the murder of nine at a community college in Oregon last week, Rubio said in an interview Tuesday with the New Hampshire Union Leader. ""This is a deep societal issue,"" he said. ""It's not what people are using to kill people, it's why are they doing it? That's the issue."" The U.S. senator from Florida said mental health issues are real and must be addressed. But he said the problem of gun violence is linked to a crumbling of values that are first instilled and then reinforced by strong families and communities.That night in Dover, at a town hall meeting, Marco told the audience about his plan to cut taxes, replace ObamaCare, and reform our education system.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 13, 2015",Press Release - Here's What Marco Would Do for American Farmers,"America's farmersand ranchers arean important source of our country's prosperity. Marcowillget government out of the way of agriculture so that American farmers and ranchers can build their businesses, compete as exporters, and create jobs.As President, Marco will:Repeal Burdensome Regulations on Farmers and RanchersMarco will undo the Environmental Protection Agency's Waters of the U.S.Rule, that will dramatically expand federal control over ponds, ditches and streams. Further, he will fight President Obama's carbon mandatesand excessive application of the Endangered Species Act, which can, when misused, deem huge swathes of productive land off-limits for agriculture or other beneficial development.Permanently End the Punitive Death TaxMarco's comprehensive pro-growth, pro-family tax reform will permanently end the death tax and allow farmers and ranchers to immediately write off the cost ofnew machinery and equipment. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the plan would raise wages and boost investment dramatically. Read more about his tax plan here.Oppose New Taxes on EnergyAs President, Marco will fight the establishment of a cap-and-trade program or carbon tax, which would act as a new national energy tax on agriculture producers and raise costs for consumers. In addition, Marco will push for other reforms to unleash American energy production and bring down energy costs for farmers. Read more about Marco's energy plan here.Open New Markets for Farmers and RanchersMarco supports Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which asserts Congress's role in critical trade negotiations and paves the way for the creation of agricultural jobs. Marco willalso push for timely completion of trade agreements to boost exports for American farmers and ranchers. Curb OverregulationFarmers and ranchers deal with huge costs imposed by the federal regulations, which interfere in labeling procedures, land use, and more. Marco has proposed a National Regulatory Budget that will cap the costs federal regulations can impose on the economy, including a limit for each individual agency. This will prevent regulators from imposing costly new rules on the agriculture sector at a whim, and give Congress the ability to rein in regulators. Read more about the idea here.Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota  a rancher, farmer, and small business owner  had this to say about Marco's strong support for farmers:As President, Marco will make sure we support our farmers and ranchers. He will carry out a conservative agenda that gets the federal government off the backs of small businesses. He supports repealing the death tax that hit our family when tragedy struck and will reform our tax code to create jobs across America.Marco has also promised to take a stand against environmental regulations perpetuated by the Obama administration that target farmers, including the controversial ""Waters of the U.S."" land grab. He will stop regulators from using the Endangered Species Act to further their influence and control. He'll replace bureaucracy with a common-sense approach, making institutional changes that limit the cost of regulations and save you money.Read more of what Rep. Noem has to say about Marco here"

Marco's plans will help workers who have suffered during the Obama Administration's anemic economic recovery.If the American Dream is to be preserved and expanded to more people than ever before, we need comprehensive economic reforms to help American workers. Marco proposes to:Empower American WorkersAs a Senator, Marco has pushed for updating outdated labor regulations and throwing out rules that empower unions rather than create opportunities for workers. As President, he'll continue that fight. He plans to:Lift Union-Imposed Pay Caps on Millions of American Workers: Marco is fighting for the Rewarding Achievement and Incentivizing Successful Employees (RAISE) Act, which removes union-imposed obstacles to pay increases for millions of workers.Expand Options for Workers: Marco supports allowing employers to provide workers with a choice between receiving monetary compensation or paid leave for working overtime.Worker Choice: Marco supports giving all workers the choice over whether or not they join a union.Reform the NLRB: Marco supports reforming theNational Labor Relations Boardto ensure that it acts as a neutral arbiter, not an arm of Big Labor to punish the private sector and workers.Reverse the NLRB's Disastrous ""Joint Employer"" Decision: The NLRB's ""joint employer"" decision will hurt small businesses, especially franchises. Marco supports reversing this disastrous decision and returning control to small businesses.Pass Tax ReformMarco has a comprehensive tax reform plan that will cut taxes for working Americans, jumpstart investment, and slash corporate taxes to boost wages.The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that it will raise wages for all taxpayers and create millions of jobs.

Read about his energy plans here.Limit Regulatory OverreachMarco has proposed a National Regulatory Budget, which will set a limit on the costs that can be imposed by federal regulations overall and by rules from each federal agency.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 13, 2015",Press Release - What You'll See Tonight at the Democratic Debate,"Ever since I launched my campaign for president, I've argued that the election before us is a choice between the past and the future. Tonight, we'll get to see exactly what the past looks like by tuning into the Democratic presidential debate. There we will see five candidates who call themselves ""progressive,"" yet who advocate policies that stand directly in the way of our nation's progress.We will see outdated politicians who believe new economic innovations should be stifled by more regulation. For example, they believe companies in the on-demand economy, such as Uber and Airbnb, are a threat rather than an opportunity. They believe a revolutionary technology like hydraulic fracturing, which has unleashed American energy and created thousands of jobs, is a risky practice that must be stopped. They believe the Internet needs more government oversight in the form of net neutrality.We will see a group of 20th century politicians who believe the way to fix our outdated institutions is to pump more money into them rather than reform them. They believe we can spend more on the higher education system of the 1950s without updating it for a new century. They believe we can lean on retirement programs from the 1930s without saving them for future generations. They believe expanding the safety net programs of the 1960s will be enough to help the struggling escape their circumstances.And the sad irony is, while they consider outdated ideas of the past to be progressive, they consider timeless ideas of the past to be regressive"

Here's what Bill Clinton said about Marco:""We've got to DESTROY HIM before he gets off the ground.""Why are the Clintons  and Democrats in general  so worried about Marco? The source of this latest report, Ed Klein, explained on Fox this morning:ED KLEIN: [Bill Clinton] went down the entire list of the Republican candidates, and came to the conclusion that Marco Rubio would present Hillary with the greatest challenge, because of his age, generational change . . . he could be a very formidable challenger.STEVE DOOCY: So, your source says Bill Clinton feels that Marco Rubio is the one they need to take out?ED KLEIN: Exactly. Not my opinion  it's Bill Clinton's opinion and I take Bill Clinton's opinion on those kinds of things.We've known for months now that Marco is the Clinton campaign's #1 target on the Republican side. But now we know that the fear of facing Marco next November goes straight to the top and they're going to do whatever it takes to ""destroy"" Marco.When the Clintons promise to ""destroy"" someone that means only one thing: the full force of the Left's attack operation will be trained directly on Marco and our campaign.Click here right now to help us fight back against the Clinton machine."

First of all, it's pretty clear that what she told us and what happened are two very different things. Second, it goes to the issue of competency: These emails, by the secretary of state, were the prime targets of foreign intelligence agencies. As soon as the news came out that she was using a private server, one of the first things I said was, those emails were vulnerable to the Chinese, to the North Koreans, Iran, you name it . . . And of course now we're seeing reports that that was the case.It shows that she was both incompetent but quite frankly was not being [honest] with the American peopleandplaying games with words.It goes to the issue of whether you can trust someone or not, the credibility issue."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 15, 2015",Press Release - Rubio: The Obama Administration Needs to Stop Blaming Israel for Palestinian Terror,"October 15, 2015By Marco RubioAs Palestinian terrorists continue to murder and maim Israelis, the Obama administration is spreading malicious falsehoods about the attacks. On Wednesday, administration spokesmen continued to blame ""both sides"" for the violence, as if the Israeli victims were themselves somehow culpable.Indeed, speaking at Harvard on Tuesday, Secretary of State Kerry imputed responsibility to the Israelis. ""There's been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years,"" he said. ""Now you have this violence because there's a frustration that is growing."" This is false. There has been no massive increase in settlements, and his statement ignores the campaign of incitement based on the lie that the Israelis are seeking to displace the Muslims from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.By lying about the true causes of the violence and falsely blaming the Israelis, Kerry brings dishonor on the United States. By providing a Palestinian leadership with cover for its support for terrorism, he rewards incitement.For her part, Hillary Clinton is no better. She refuses to even say the words ""Palestinian terrorism."" Her statement on Monday fails to identify those guilty of stabbing women and children. It avoids criticizing those who for weeks have exhorted Palestinians to murder and wound Israeli civilians  namely, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, his Fatah Party, and Hamas. It does not even endorse Israel's right to defend itself.The United States, however, must defend Israel's right to fight terrorism as if its own rights depended on it. Indeed, they do. History shows that the excuses for terror that are hurled at Israel today will be hurled at us tomorrow. Speaking the truth about Israel under siege is our first line of defense."

Yet today  more than a year after scores of veterans died while stuck on secret wait lists  mountains of backlogged disability claims, wide-scale construction overruns and a serious lack of accountability continue to plague the agency.Instead of being given the benefits they have earned, veterans' disability applications have been shredded, while whistleblowers who expose this corruption face retaliation. Time and time again, too many senior VA officials have proven incapable of serving those who have served our country. . . .The incompetence at the VA is unacceptable. Negligence continues to go unpunished while our nation's heroes are dying. We must stand together as a nation to ensure that our veterans receive the care they deserve. It's why earlier this year, House VA Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., and I introduced the VA Accountability Act of 2015, a commonsense reform bill to end the culture of unaccountability by giving the VA secretary additional authorities to remove or demote any VA employee based on performance or misconduct. . . .As President Lincoln said, our nation has a duty ""to care for him who shall have borne the battle."" The House companion to the VA Accountability Act has already passed there, and it should become the law of the land. Shockingly, President Barack Obama has issued a veto threat, leaving just one question: Are we going to stand with our nation's veterans or the VA's inept bureaucrats?Read the full op-ed here."

(And neither could my husbandhe thought I was joking!)Q: What was your favorite moment of the first debate?A: To choose a favorite moment in the debate is tough  the whole experience of attending the debate in person was so amazing and surreal! However, one of memories that stands out was at the beginning of the debate, when Bret Baier asked the candidates to pledge that they would support the eventual nominee of the the Republican Party and not run as a third-party candidate. The entire audience erupted into cheers and applause, which really set an electric tone for the remainder of the debate, and seemed to intensify the camaraderie and excitement of the Republicans in the arena.Q. What surprised you most about being in the audience for the debate instead of watching on TV?A: My daughter and I both loved to watch the candidates during the commercial breaks. It was so interesting to observe them as they interacted with one another and with others during those break. We felt like we learned so much about the various personalities and temperaments of the candidates during those unscripted moments when the cameras were off.Q: What would you say to anyone thinking about entering our Colorado Debate Contest?A: Definitely do it! The Marco Rubio campaign team treated us to the experience of a lifetime that we will never forget and will forever be grateful for. This election is proving to be historic on so many levels, and we encourage everyone to be a part of it by registering to win a trip to the next debate!I don't want to end without saying that my support of Marco Rubio was completely solidified by the experience of attending the Cleveland debate. I cannot describe how compelling it was to see Marco live and in person as he demonstrated his in-depth knowledge of the issues and his love of America.We left the debate that night more convinced than ever that Marco Rubio is, without a doubt, the most qualified candidate to lead our country during this crucial time!Want to have an experience just like Nicole's?

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 19, 2015",Press Release - Here's What Marco Will Do about Washington's Spending Addiction,"Washington's addiction to irresponsible spending is the result not of necessity but of a stubborn resistance to reform. Our $19 trillion debt is not just a problem for government; it is a problem for the American people. It is hurtingour economy today and will shackle future generations.Our $19 trillion debt amounts toover$150,000 per taxpayer. Our families and our children are on the hook for this. The bill might not come in the mail, but if we do nothing to change course, it will come in the form of higher taxes, cuts to our safety net, fewer jobs, and fewer opportunities to achieve the American Dream.For those reasons, the federal government needs to cutits spending, now. As a Senator, Marco has fought to restrain spending to protect taxpayers: Hesuccessfully blockedthe massive taxpayer-funded insurance bailouts in ObamaCare and voted against budget bills filled with wasteful spending and crony capitalist giveaways. He has been named a Taxpayer Super Hero by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste and a Taxpayers' Friend by the National Taxpayers Union.Some of Marco's ideas to get spending under control:Fight for a Balanced Budget Amendment and force Washington to live within its means without raising taxesRepeal ObamaCare and cut trillions in spending on the job-destroying lawPush for line-item veto authority to cut wasteful spendingPermanently ban pork-barrel earmarksReduce the size of the federal workforce in WashingtonPrevent massive, irresponsible spending billsAllow states to use wasteful federal funds to pay down the national debtOppose corporate welfare like the New Deal-era Export-Import BankReform budget rules to provide taxpayers with the true costs of government spending and the benefits of pro-growth policiesReform and save Medicare and Social Security for future generations without impacting those in or near retirementOp-Eds & SpeechesMarco on how to let states refund unused spending to pay down the national debt.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 19, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Explains Why His Faith Makes Him Believe So Fervently in Free Enterprise,"At a recent New Hampshire town-hall, Marco discussed how his faith guides his personal and politicaldecisions.My faith has a huge influence on me. I hope it does, because my faith teaches me to care for the less fortunate. And obviously, thefirst thing I learned from my faith is that the most important job I have is husband and father. The most influential job I will ever have is the 16, 15, 17 years I have to influence my children and who they become and not just by what I say to them, but by what they see me do.In public service, it influences me in a lot of different ways. First of all, our nation was founded on a spiritual principle, on the notion that we're all created equal because we'reendowed by our creator with certain rights: life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the only reason we have a government isn't to grant those rights, it's to protect those rights. I believe that every human being has God-given rights that it is the job of the governmenttoprotect. So that influences me deeply.Beyond that, I would argue that it's one of the reasons why I've come to be a strong supporter of free enterprise because it's the only economic model in the history of the world where people can achieve their potential even if they aren't born into great wealth or privilege.If you travel around the world, here's what you're going to find: The more the government dominates the economy, the more that people who influence government win at the expense of everybody else. And so when you go around the world, here's what you're going to find: You're going to find societies where the same rich families and the same big companies have dominated those countries decade after decade. Only in free enterprise can an employee become an employer. Only in free enterprise can someone that's born into a family that isn't [rich] or connected, through hard work, discipline, self-control, and talent, achieve a better life for themselves in fact, maybe even put their former boss out of business because you're better at it than they are.That's why I love free enterprise, that's why I'm a strong supporter because I thinkit's the best system to eradicate poverty. The only way to eradicate poverty is toallowpeople to find better-paying jobs, and free enterprise does that better than any other economic model in the world.So my faith has influenced me to care about the less fortunate. I do support a safety net; I don't thinkfree enterpriseworks without a safety net, to help catch people that are having a tough time. But I also know that the safety net cannot be a way of life, cannot become a lifestyle, and in fact it's become that for many people. And my faith also teaches me that that's not good for the soul, it's not good for people, it's not good for their aspirations for the future.So, for all those reasons, I'm glad my faith influences my role in government as well asthe way I try to govern myself and my life."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 20, 2015",Press Release - Utah Is Excited for Marco,"Last night, Marco Rubio was in Salt Lake City, Utah where over 400 people came out to hear him speak about his vision for a New American Century.Support continues to grow for Marco in the western states. This trip followed a recent campaign stop in Nevada, where 1,200 people came out to his town hall in Summerlin, a happy hour in Las Vegas and a rally in Boulder City. Marco also chatted in-depth about what it was like to spend part of his childhood in Las Vegas.Below are some highlights from Utah.At a rally at the Utah State Fairgrounds, the Salt Lake Tribune reports that Marco outlined his vision for a New American Century and for preserving the American Dream. ""This election is not a choice between Republicans and Democrats alone,"" he said. ""This election is a generational choice, and here's the choice: What kind of country are we going to be in the new century? We'll either be the first Americans who leave our children worse than ourselves, or our children will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever.""Marco also touched on his plans for a New American Economy for the 21st Century. As the Associated Press reports: Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pitched himself as a fresh face in his party's crowded primary contest during a Monday night campaign stop in Utah. The 44-year-old Rubio spoke about outdated government policies that haven't kept up with disruptive technologies like ride-hailing company Uber.Additionally, the Deseret News reports that Marco listed his proposals for creating a vibrant 21st Century. He offered a long list of proposals for improving the economy, including allowing high school students to learn a trade so they can be prepared to work upon graduation, promising to be the ""vocational education president."" Rubio drew applause and cheers for a number of stands he took, including for repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law and replacing it with a plan that allows people to purchase their choice of plan with a refundable tax credit.Finally, the Salt Lake Tribune notes that Marco's speech was well received as supporters chanted ""Rubio! Rubio!"" The Florida senator then hit on a laundry list of topics  from energy policy to national security to vocational training and economic policy  during his 40-minute stump speech, drawing a handful of ovations and chants of ""Rubio! Rubio!""THE FRONT PAGES ...pic.twitter.com/60CI0P37bc Robert Daniels (@DanielsRobertD) October 19, 2015Very enthusiastic crowd in Salt Lake City tonight! #TeamMarco pic.twitter.com/iWLO2wsVHC  Brooke Sammon (@BrookeSammon) October 19, 2015"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 21, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco's Dire Warning about What May Happen if We Let Afghanistan Collapse,"Marco appeared on Fox News on Friday, October 16, to discuss Afghanistan and Israel.On the situation developing in Afghanistan:Here's what's clear: The Afghan national forces still do not have the capability to control the country and fight off these insurgents. And as a result, if the numbers [of U.S. troops in the country] get too low, Afghanistan could collapse, and it could become the next Syria, the next prime operational spacefor ISIS, which as you correctly pointed out is growing its presence there, obviously for the Taliban, and ultimately for al-Qaeda as well. These radical groups need operating spaces, they need vacuums, and the collapse of the Afghan government, which is what will happen without significant support from the United States, will lead to the creation of an additional vacuum in that region of the world."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 22, 2015",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio Explains How the Benghazi Tragedy Is the Perfect Example of Hillary's Failed Foreign Policy,"Breitbart,October 22, 2015Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi about her role in the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya that resulted in the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens, the first U.S. Ambassador in 35 years to be killed in the line of duty. Three other Americans, Sean Smith, Ty Woods, and Glen Doherty, were killed as well.Americans deserve to learn the truth about Clinton's actions as Secretary of State in the days and weeks before the death of these brave Americans.Yet the debate about Clinton's precise role in the Benghazi disaster should not obscure a broader point that is obvious to most observers: Hillary Clinton's failed record as Secretary of State, like the Obama administration's disastrous foreign policy, has made America less safe at home and abroad.In the case of Benghazi, despite her advocacy of the intervention that resulted in the fall of a brutal dictator, Clinton appeared to show little interest in the deteriorating situation in Libya.Read the rest of the op-ed on Breitbarthere."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 23, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Explains Exactly Why Hillary Clinton Covered Up What Really Happened in Benghazi,"Marco joined Sean Hannity on October 22ndto discuss the House hearing on Benghazi.We need to focus on this very carefully. Benghazi was a very dangerous city. The Red Cross had already pulled out of Benghazi at the time. The Brits had already pulled out of Benghazi at the time. Our own facility had already been attacked with a firebomb previously to that. And despite all of this, the State Department made a decision to leave that consulate in Benghazi open. I would say that, that right there is a red flag. They should have known that they shouldn't have been there.But let's suppose they decide to stay there. If you decide you're going to stay there, then you have to ensure that you have sufficient security for that facility. Again, they failed to do that. The attackers breached it very quickly and happened to catch the Ambassador there and killed him, and of course, three other people lost their lives as well, as a result of that.So they had insufficient security for the facility. In fact, they had outsourced the security to Libyan militias. And then, on top of that, there was no plan in place of extraction. In fact, if there was an attack, they did not have military assets nearby to respond quickly and save lives.It was a massive incompetence at every level, and the buck stops at the top. If Hillary Clinton is going to go around taking credit for her time as Secretary of State, then she must take responsibilities for failures that happen at the State Department under her watch, and this was the costliest of all in terms of human lives and American lives."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 24, 2015",Press Release - Hillary Clinton Is Scared of Marco Rubio  That's Why She's Trying to Mislead about His Position on Puerto Rico,"Marco opposes Chapter 9 bankruptcy for Puerto Rico and believes it should only be a last resort.But Hillary Clinton, liberal politicians on the island and their allies in Congress want it now, because they refuse to make tough choices to cut spending and end job-killing policies.Marco reviewed the bankruptcy option, which many suggested was as the only way out of Puerto Rico's financial mess. He disagreed and challenged the island's leadersto get serious about pursuing fiscal reforms first.By the time Puerto Rico bankruptcy legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senateon July 15th, Marco had already decided not to support it and was never one of its co-sponsors.OnSeptember 4th, Marco visited San Juan and made his views on bankruptcy clear in a local media availability and an op-ed published in Spanish in El Nuevo Dia and in English onMedium, where he also laid out other ways he would serve the 3.5 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico.Hillary Clinton and her allies know that Marco is the best candidate to take her on and defeat her in a general election. That's why they are attempting to distort hisconservative, pro-growth agenda for the U.S. and its territories.In sum, Marco's only position on this issue has been to notsupport Chapter 9 bankruptcy legislation. And his decision not to co-sponsor the bankruptcy bill was made in early July  well before what Hillary's attack dogs now claim.Marco's top priorities for Puerto Rico's future are to:EncourageSan Juan to cut spending, rein in out-of-control big government and eliminate job- killing tax and regulatory policies.Make low-paying work more attractive through conservative reforms to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that make it a wage enhancement paid throughout the year and apply it equally to U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico.Achieve pro-growth, pro-family tax reform that, among other things, creates a new $2,500 Child Tax Credit for every child and applies it equally to U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico.Repeal and replace ObamaCare, end the federal government's disproportionate treatment of Puerto Rico under Medicare,and implement health reforms that treat Puerto Rican consumers as they would mainland U.S. consumers.Support a federally sponsored vote in Puerto Rico to resolve its status and, should a majority support statehood, do what's necessary to admit them as the 51st state.Oppose Chapter 9 bankruptcy in the absence of serious fiscal reforms."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 25, 2015",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio's Plan to Protect Small Businesses,"Small businesses are the engines of the American economy, driving innovation and creating the bulk of new jobs. Entrepreneurs and family business owners need to be free from overbearing government policy to grow and innovate. Only in a place like America can employees go to being employers, and it's a healthy culture of free enterprise and small business ownership that makes that possible.Unfortunately, American small businesses, like the broader American economy, are struggling. In recent years, more businesses are being destroyed than created. Breaking out of economic stagnation requires reviving American small businesses and enabling them to do what they do best: create good-paying jobs and new opportunities for American workers. Marco plans to do that by restoring sanity to labor law, cutting taxes for small businesses, keeping regulations and costs low, and more.In the Senate, Marco has received 100% ratings from the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. He has fought against ObamaCare, tax increases, and other policies that would harm small businesses and their workers.As President, Marco will:Enact Comprehensive Tax Reform that Protects Small BusinessesMarco supportscomprehensive tax reform that will:Cut taxes for small businesses to 25%;Let businesses immediately expense new investments;Permanently repeal the death tax.Demand Full Repeal of ObamaCare and Its $1 Trillion of Tax HikesRepeal ObamaCare in full, including the $1 trillion of tax hikes on workers and employers, in particular the job-destroying employer mandate and obstacles to hiring full-time workers;Support consumer-centered reforms that lower costs and provide flexibility to businesses. Read more about Marco's plan for health care here.Fight for Accountable Regulatory PoliciesEstablish a National Regulatory Budget to hold unelected regulators accountable;Let Congress vote up or down on regulations that have a major impact on the economy;Expose the true costs of regulations on the American economy and small businesses;Dramatically increase small business input in the regulatory process.Pursue Policies that Lower Energy Costs, Fight Policies That Raise ThemExpand responsible production of American-made energy, including oil, coal, natural gas, and renewables;Immediately approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline;Fight cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, and new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency that act as a national energy tax.Establish a Common-Sense Balance Between Worker and Employer RightsProtect the secret ballot for workers during union elections;Prohibit unions from siphoning off worker dues for political activities; andRemove union-imposed obstacles to workers receiving pay increases and bonuses."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 29, 2015","Press Release - Marco Talks About His ""Stellar"" Debate Performance","Take a look at highlights of Marco on the morning news circuit discussing his stellar debate performance.FOX News' FOX & FRIENDSThe Democrats have the ultimate super PAC it's called the mainstream media. The mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. ABC's Good Morning AmericaI'm the one that's shown the best judgment and best understanding on the foreign policy threats before our country in the 21st Century.NBC's Today ShowIt's an incredible honor to serve in the United States Senate. I enjoy very much to serve the people of Florida. For me, we serve real people every day. The veteran who has to fight for his disability benefits and prove he's disabled even though he's missing both legs in combat, or the elderly couple who experienced tax fraud. I enjoy that very much and we're going to continue to do it.CBS This MorningMy campaign is not going to be about attacking anybody else. My campaign is going to be who I am and what is important for our country and the future of America and that's what I'm going to continue to focus on and it isn't going to change my feelings toward Jeb or anyone else in the race, I'm not running against them, I'm running for President.CNBC's Squawk BoxOne of the issues that is confronting our country today is that we have millions of people that are struggling, wages really really haven't climbed in this country fast enough, and the cost of living over the last 10 or 15 years have increased primarily because there's new costs associated with the 21st Century. For example, in 35 out of 50 states, child care is more expensive than going to college. So what are we going to do to raise wages in America? It's has to be the combination of making us the easiest and best place in the world to create the best paying jobs of the 21st Century, and combine that with allowing people to acquire the skills they need for the better paying jobs. We have a massive disconnect in this country between the skills the 21st Century requires for higher paying jobs and what many of our people have.CNN's New DayI would just say that when it comes to this issue of Social Security and Medicare, these programs enjoy strong support in the Republican Party. Even among our most conservative members. They understand it is now a reality that people depend on, and you can't just yank it away from them ... But ultimately, in order to get these things passed, we've got to be able to work with people to get it done. What I'm not going to do is raise taxes or ignore the problem, or tell people, you know, at the end of the day there's no problem with this. Anyone who says you can leave these programs exactly the way they are is not being honest. There's going to have to be changes for future generations if we want to keep it exactly the way it is for current beneficiaries."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"October 30, 2015",Press Release - Think the Chinese Government Is Easing Up on Its Brutal Anti-Child Policies? Think Again,"The Chinese government announced this week that it would be changing its infamous, brutal ""one child"" policy, to allow Chinese parents to have two children if they wish. Unfortunately, this change from authoritarian Beijing is but a tiny improvement, Marco said today, and the new policy will be just as cruel and despotic as the old one.The horrible consequences of the existing policy are clear: ""For over three decades, China's barbaric one-child policy has condemned approximately 37 million Chinese girls who the policy deemed as unwanted or 'surplus'  to abortion, infanticide, abandonment and human trafficking. It has resulted in an unprecedented gender imbalance that will have lasting consequences,"" Marco said.But the new policy will have much the same results, Marco said: ""While the decision to allow Chinese couples to have two children is a modest improvement, the policy is still repressive. The fact remains that when couples conceive a third child, the Chinese government will force them to eliminate him or her, by any means necessary.""A two-child policy is as indefensible and inhumane as a one child policy, and it would be a mistake to assume this change in anyway reflects a newfound respect for human rights by Beijing. The U.S. must continue advocating for the complete elimination of government-forced population planning as well as the fundamental rights of all Chinese citizens, including the unborn, to live up to their God-given potential.""Read more coverage of the event here at LifeNews.The one-child policy is just one of a range of inhumane policies that the authoritarian government in Beijing imposes on the Chinese people  including political repression that has increased in recent years.Marco has proposed a comprehensive policy to confront China as president, that involves specific steps to stand up for human rights, rebuild American strength, especially in East Asia, and protect American economic interests.

And I think the strategy has to involve more coordination with the Kurds and also with Sunnis. We're not going to defeat ISIS, a radical Sunni movement, without a robust anti-ISIS Sunni coalition. So I do think it's an important tactical step forward, but it needs to be backed up with increased air strikes and so forth. So I don't have a problem with the tactics of it the numbers might even haveto be larger at some point but the bigger issue is, can they arrive at a strategy? And that's what I think the administration is still struggling with.On what he sees as the dutyof the President:The job of a President is to craft a vision for America's future to put the right people in the right positions and hold them accountable for carrying out your agenda, but also to rally the people behind big causes. Entitlement reform is a huge undertaking; it'll never happen without presidential leadership. Not to mention national security the role of commander-in-chief is the most important job of apresident. In the context of Barack Obama, he has now been president for seven years,he has significant executive experience, and he's still making mistakes, in my opinion."

Rubio: GOP leadership has ""forced down our throat"" the budget deal""  and Iowa crowd here murmurs in agreement. pic.twitter.com/KEfmAPEW0x Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 31, 2015During the first stop, in Sioux City, Marco pointed out the challenges facing our country, starting with the skyrocketing national debt. The Des Moines Register reports: ""We must turn the page,"" he told a crowd here. ""For 30 years, for 20 years at least, we've struggled to solve any major issue in America.""""For those who say there's no bipartisanship in Washington, it's not true. There is. This debt is bipartisan debt, rung up by both parties,"" Rubio said in Iowa. ""It's irresponsible and it's reckless. And still, nothing changes.""Florida senator @MarcoRubio speaks to a crowd of 200 in Mason City IA, and throws in a joke about wearing a sweater pic.twitter.com/twWoOy45qz Mackenzie Ryan (@Mackenzie_Ryan) October 31, 2015Then it was off off to Mason City, where Marco laid out the priorities he'd focus on as president. The Mason City Globe reports: Saying ""the time has come to turn the page,"" Sen. Marco Rubio set several priorities Saturday that he would have as president. Among them are elimination of the Affordable Care Act, rejection of the nuclear agreement with Iran.ObamaCare: Rubio said he would abolish ""Obamacare"" and establish a program that empowers Americans to make their own health care choices from companies nationwide, allowing competition to reduce prices. ""The people should be making these choices,"" not the government,"" he said.Iran: Rubio said the most important role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe  and the government has failed to do that in recent years. ""We're about to give Iran $150 billion. They won't use it to build highways,"" he said. ""They'll use it to build nuclear weapons. On my first day in office I will cancel that deal. ""Radical Islams are not going away,"" he warned. ""Someday they will be coming after us. We must fight them. What's the alternative? We either defeat them or they defeat us.""Education: On education, he said there has been an unfair stigma on vocational training when it should be promoted. . . . He said the problem with education at four-year colleges and universities is the high cost and that students are borrowing money to pay for educations that aren't leading to good-paying jobs.Sen. @joniernst stopped by @marcorubio tent @ IA GOP's ""Growth & Opportunity Party"" to say hi, welcome him to Iowa. pic.twitter.com/HqhpzzSSEL Alex Burgos (@BurgosGOP) October 31, 2015The weekend concluded with a stop at the Republican Party of Iowa's first ever ""Growth and Opportunity Party,"" at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in West Des Moines, where Marco spoke to a crowd of over 2,000 Iowans. One young voter called Marco a ""nice contrast"" to Hillary Clinton, the Des Moines Register reports: Karsen Kredit, 19 of Sioux Center, agreed, saying Rubio makes for a good contrast to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. ""She grew up with a silver spoon,"" Kredit said.Make sure you catch Marco on his next trip. He'll be back in Iowa soon!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 3, 2015",Press Release - Cory Gardner Endorses Marco Rubio!,"Senator Cory Gardner joined CNN's New Day to discuss his endorsement of Marco Rubio.I think Marco Rubio represents the best opportunity for the future. He's somebody who understands that, as I did in my campaign, this race is about someone who's going to be accountable to the next generation. There's a lot of people in this campaign who understand the past. There's a lot of people, especially Hillary Clinton, who understand the economies and politics of old, but they don't understand the future. And that's what this race is about."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 3, 2015",Press Release - This Latest EPA Power Grab Is Going to Be a Disaster,"Today, I will take another stand against the disastrous ""Waters of the US"" mandate from the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers. The rule will embolden Washington regulators by giving bureaucrats the authority to regulate private bodies of water like small streams and ponds.This would be especially harmful forfarmers, whocouldlose control over their land and be forced to comply with expensive permitting requirements. For example, the Iowa Farm Bureau estimates that 97% of Iowa could be covered by the rule.I am opposed to this power grab, plain and simple, and I want to thank my friend Joni Ernst for leading the fight against it. A federal court recently blocked the rule temporarily, but I believe WOTUS should be stopped forgood. That's why I've proposeda detailed planto limit the costs that regulators can impose on the economy.We must pursue policies that reduce government burdens onAmerican farmers, not increase them. Stopping WOTUS is a good first step."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 4, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Explains Why America Is at a Generational Point,"Marco joined George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America to discuss the campaign and how this election is a generational choice. Watch the interview below:I'm running for president. It's a big office. It's an important position  the most important political office on the planet. We knew it would be difficult, but we're going to continue on our message. We'll certainly answer questions and address falsehoods or anything people say, but I'm going to remain focused on the future of America, which is what this election needs to be about because this nation is at a generational point where it needs to choose what kind of country it's going to be in the 21st century.. . .I'm going to continue to run a positive message for America's future. If there are policy differences between them, we should discuss them, not just with Jeb, but anybody on the field. But I'm not going to attack other Republicans  that would be doing Hillary Clinton's work for her."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 4, 2015",Press Release - I Know What It's Like Living Paycheck-To-Paycheck,"Marco on FOX News' America's Newsroom.I own one home. It's the only debt I have in the world is the mortgage on my home. And, actually, I think it would be good for this country to have a president that knows what it feels like to have your house lose its value because of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Fannie and Freddie, by the Federal Reserve. I think it would be good for this country to have a president that knows what it's like to owe money and student loans like I once did. Someone who grew up paycheck-to-paycheck. That's why I look forward to that debate with Hillary Clinton. How's she going to say that I don't understand the plight of people that are struggling in America when I myself  through my parents and our upbringing  lived it? So I am proud of where I come from. My parents weren't rich people, but I am proud of what they left us with  which is the chance of a better life and we've been able to achieve that. So I look forward to that debate, especially with the Democrats.""...""I think it's good for our country to have a president that knows what it's like, for example, because of Fannie and Freddie because of the Federal Reserve and this irresponsible behavior, what it's like, despite the fact you did nothing wrong, to see your home lose its value. Millions of Americans have gone through that. The same with student loans. We have young Americans out there who owe thousands of dollars in student loans, often for degrees that don't lead to jobs. And I think that experience, having lived through that, is what makes me so passionate about fighting on behalf of Americans who today are struggling. Millions of working Americans who open up the newspaper and read how Wall Street is having record years, how these cronies that are close to the Clintons are doing so well economically, but they continue to struggle despite the fact they work harder than ever.""...""We now have a choice to make about who is going to be the leader of this country in the 21st century. And I am confident that if we can continue to communicate who we are, what we'll do if given this chance, we are going to continue to improve. These polls will go up and down. And, as I said, historically we know that these polls the week before the election can change dramatically. So, we are going to continue to do what we are doing. That's all I can control is my campaign and what we talk about. We're going to continue to talk about our vision for America's future and our plan to get us there. And I have confidence the voters are going to choose us in the end.""..."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 4, 2015",Press Release - Marco Represents The Next Generation Of Conservatism,"Montana Senator, Steve Daines endorsed Marco this week! Listen to his interview with Hugh Hewitt below:The stakes are so high for this next election. All conservatives know that. And I really think that Marco really represents the next generation conservatism who can truly unite and inspire this country.""...I really think we need a president  I think Marco reflects this  who understands the unique challenges facing our people in this century. Look at his story  daddy was a bartender, his mom stocking shelves at K-Mart on night shift, working as a housekeeper for a hotel. If anybody understands the working class of this nation, it's Marco Rubio. Also, you think about his story of parents who are Cuban immigrants. This is a great American Dream story. And I've watched Marco up close here in the Senate. He is the kind of guy, both when the cameras are on, and importantly when the cameras aren't, he's approachable. You can work with him. He's a humble guy. There's a lot of character in Marco Rubio, and I'm honored to endorse him."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 6, 2015",Press Release - Hearing about Marco Rubio's Credit Cards? Here's What a Nonpartisan Fact Checker Had to Say,"Washington Post, November 6, 2015""People need to understand what they're talking about. It wasn't a credit card. It was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the [Republican] Party. Bills would be mailed to me at home. Every month I would go through it. If there was a personal expense, I paid it. If it was a Party expense, the Party paid it. Now I recognize in hindsight I would do it different to avoid confusion. But the Republican Party never paid a single personal expense of mine personal expense. This is unfortunately when this was initially reported in the press, it was made into something bigger than it actually is. I wouldn't do it the same way again to avoid all these stories but the Republican Party never paid any of my personal expenses.""  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), interview on ""Good Morning America,"" Nov. 4, 2015Rubio's handling of his state Republican Party-issued corporate card is under renewed scrutiny, as he emerges as a leading candidate for the GOP nomination. In a recent appearance on ""Good Morning America,"" Rubio addressed questions over his corporatecard usage.His answer gave us pause. His explanation seemed to rebut many of the claims we have read in recent media coverage of the credit card controversy. Was he rewriting history? We decided to dig into his explanation and the series of events that unfolded since the storybroke in February 2010. And we found, for the most part, his story matches up.Read the rest of the Washington Post piece here."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 7, 2015",Press Release - Here Are the Facts about Marco Rubio's Credit Cards,"Earlier today, we released 22 months of previously unreleased statements from Marco's Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) American Express. The newly released statements cover the period from January 2005 to October 2006. In all, Marco had an RPOF American Express for approximately four years, from January 2005 to December 2008.January 2005  October 2006Newly Released Statement Period (January 2005  October 2006):Total Charges: 484Total Amount Charged: $64,777.82Number of Personal Charges: 8Amount of Personal Charges: $7,243.74Total Four-Year Period (January 2005  December 2008):Total Charges: 1,307Total Amount Charged: $182,072.55Number of Personal Charges: 73Amount of Personal Charges: $22,003.19Marco paid his personal charges directly to American Express. The Republican Party of Florida did not pay for any of Marco's personal expenses. Further, taxpayer funds were not used for any political or personal charges on the card.In fact, earlier this week, the Washington Post fact-checker reviewed the previously released credit card receipts and determined ""the information released so far, a mountain's been made out of molehill, by the media and Rubio's opponents.""In addition, the Florida Ethics Commission thoroughly investigated Marco's use of the American Express card and other false attacks against Marco, and dismissed them.Further, an independent audit committee of the Florida GOP did its own investigation and determined that Marco did nothing wrong, stating, ""We reviewed all of the credit card charges that were incurred by or on behalf of Mr. Rubio on his RPOF American Express Card between 2007 and 2009. We asked to obtain additional information from Mr. Rubio about certain charges. Mr. Rubio provided us with that information and a sufficient explanation to allow us to confirm that the charges we questioned were, in fact, related to RPOF business"" (""The Report of Investigation to the Republican Party of Florida,"" Alston and Bird LLP, 9/11/2010).Additional BackgroundBetween 2005 and 2006, Marco Rubio served as speaker-designate of the Florida House of Representatives. During this time, he led the Florida House's Republican campaign operation (the equivalent of the National Republican Congressional Committee), which included an aggressive travel and fundraising schedule.Between 2007 and 2008, he served as Speaker of the Florida House. During this time, he continued fundraising for the state party, and also traveled around the state advocating for the major policy initiatives in his agenda  for example, property tax reform.Throughout this entire four-year period, he was one of the state party's chief fundraisers and party builders, and the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) provided him and other top party leaders and officials with an American Express card to pay for expenses.According to the RPOF: ""Using the card for personal expenses was not explicitly prohibited, but personal expenses 'were expected to be paid through a reimbursement, or in some cases directly to American Express,' Betta said. There was no written policy on the use of the cards, Betta said."" (Statement By RPOF Spokeswoman in Politifact, 3/11/2010)Nonetheless, despite the fact that Marco paid for his personal expenses, he has acknowledged that, ""It was a mistake. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it very differently.""As he wrote in An American Son, ""Nevertheless, in hindsight, I wish that none of them had ever been charged. When the statements were later leaked during my Senate campaign, they invited press skepticism, confused some of the public and allowed an opponent to suggest the party had paid for personal expenses. As often as it is remarked, it always bears repeating: in politics appearances are as important as reality.""Specific Credit Card ChargesFrom newly released 2005-late 2006 statements:Las Vegas Trip: There were two personal charges on this trip  one for hotel, the other for car rental. Rubio was in Nevada for political business and extended his trip for personal reasons, given that he has relatives living there. He paid American Express directly for his portion of the charges he incurred on the trip. These charges were made during the billing period that closed on August 16, 2005, and paid by Rubio during the following billing period. ?Rubio paid $1,745.00 in the following billing period while the RPOF paid the $3,343.58 for days he stayed at the same hotel for party business.Iberia Tiles: The largest charge from the previously unreleased statements was a charge of $3,756.24 made on October 16, 2005. A personal payment for this full amount was made the following month by Rubio to American Express on November 15, 2005. Rubio has already written about this charge in 2012. This charge was made during the billing period that closed on October 16, 2005 and paid by Rubio during the following billing period.?Rubio paid $3,756.24 to cover the expense in the next billing period.Braman Honda: There were two personal charges to Braman Honda, a full service auto dealership and repair shop near Rubio's West Miami home. The first was in the amount of $500 on May 12, 2006; a personal payment was made in this exact amount to American Express within weeks on June 3, 2006. A second charge of $99.45 was made on May 19, 2006 and paid soon thereafter as well.Hoop It-Kick It-Let: On December 7, 2005 Rubio charged $180 to this children's sports activity center; the following month, a personal payment for this full amount was made by Rubio to American Express on January 14, 2006.Our campaign is providing copies of the receipts to media who request them."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 7, 2015",Press Release - Hear What Marco Was Saying in New Hampshire This Week,"I will not tire in my efforts, and I will not flag in my optimism for the future. Our nation has great reservoirs of strength we have not yet begun to tap: a dynamic and resilient people, a creative economy our adversaries cannot hope to match, and friends and partners all over the world who are waiting for us to recover our confidence.""  Marco RubioIt's official! @marcorubio at NH State House just now #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/lKP6RrQG6G Brooke Sammon (@BrookeSammon) November 5, 2015According to the Union Leader, Marco got up close and personal at St. Anselm's New Hampshire Institute of Politics' ""Life of the Party"" event on Wednesday. When he isn't campaigning or taking care of his family, Rubio says he is a big Miami Dolphins football fan, and that his sons are following in his footsteps and playing football themselves. The sport, according to Rubio, teaches great life lessons such as working with others and accountability.As NPR reports, during a town hall in Nashua, Marco stressed that this election is a generational choice about what kind of country America will be in the 21st century. He highlights his belief that, at 44 years of age, he sees the world differently than older candidates. ""This election is not a choice simply between Republicans and Democrats,"" Rubio said at a town hall at a college in Nashua, N.H., Wednesday night. ""This election is a generational choice about what kind of country will America be in the 21st Century. That's what we're being asked to choose.""On Thursday, Marco filed for the New Hampshire primary ballot. As New Hampshire Public Radio reports, he said running in the NH primary is an ""unbelievable experience."" Dozens of people holding ""Rubio"" signs filled the hallways of the State House, as they chanted the candidate's name. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said being able to file for president is an "" unbelievable experience"" for him. ""To actually be here and aspire for the highest office of the land, when just two decades ago my father was standing behind a small portable bar behind the back of a banquet hall, is to me a testament to the greatness of America,"" he said. ""It's why I'm running for president: because I want it to remain that kind of country where stories like that are possible for more people.""In a defense speech at Granite State Manufacturing on Thursday, the Washington Examiner reports that Marco talked about his plan to modernize the military by repairing damages caused by sequestration and advancing cybersecurity technology and missile defense. The Florida senator talked extensively about the modernization of various aspects of American defense, including doing away with the cuts put into place by sequestration and beefing up the military, advancing cybersecurity technology and in missile defense. ""We have today leaders at the highest levels of our government who believe that the world would be better off with a weaker, less engaged America,"" Rubio said. ""Leaders who make national security decisions based on politics rather than on strategy; and leaders who fail to recognize that in today's global economy, foreign policy and domestic policy are truly and increasingly inseparable."".@marcorubio getting mobbed after his town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire tonight pic.twitter.com/gYqWzGw4NL Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) November 5, 2015NOW  @marcorubio live in studio with @JackHeathRadio before heading to Concord to officially file #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/J7OR0YsoSz Jim Merrill (@JimMerrillNH) November 5, 2015Enjoyed meeting a few NH voters on the trail this afternoon! pic.twitter.com/cClkMthY9s Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 5, 2015Didn't see Marco on this trip?He'll be backin New Hampshire soon!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 8, 2015","Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Explains Why Obama's Defense Cuts Have Been So Reckless, and What He'll Do About It","November 8, 2015Marco discussed his campaign, his plan for the military, and his tax plan on Maria Bartiromo's Sunday Morning Futures.MARIA BARTIROMO:Let me talk about your military plan. You unveiled this late last week. Basically what you're saying you want to begin to undo that $1 trillion of indiscriminate cuts to the defense budget.MARCO RUBIO:Because defense spending is not the reason why we have a debt. It is not the driver of our national debt. Our national debt, especially long-term, is driven by mandatory spending programs that need to be reformed. These reductions in defense spending with not just unsustainable, they're dangerous, reckless. Every time this country has undertaken massive reductions in defense spending it had to come back later and undo them and it cost a lot more money. So we're on par to have the oldest and smallest air force ever. The oldest navy since the end of World War I, World War II. An army that is about to cut another 40,000 positions. There is a budget out there, it is called the Gate's budget, it was basically a bipartisan commission that looked at the defense needs of this country and said this is what we should be spending money on. What I argue is that we need to get back to that. We need to get back to funding our defense needs because it is the most important thing the federal government does.MARIA BARTIROMO: When you look at national defense, and sort of what we're fighting out there, what do you think would be the biggest threat on a foreign policy or a national defense status?MARCO RUBIO: We face three major threats. One is rogue states like North Korea and Iran, who either have acquired or are on the verge of acquiring a nuclear capability that could eventually reach the United States. The second is non-state actors like ISIS, terrorist groups who continue to spread their reach. They're now very involved in Libya, that's why news about a Russian jetliner should not be surprising to us because ISIS is very active in Libya and they use it as an operational ground in the Sinai into Egypt. And the third are state actors like China and Russia, who in different ways are trying to crowd America out and our influence. In the case of China in the Asia Pacific region, in the case of Russia in Europe and now in the Middle East. All are very significant threats. We need to confront all three of them. A strong national defense is critical to that."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 9, 2015",Press Release - Here's What Conservatives Are Saying about Marco Rubio's Plans for College Affordability,"The set of reforms Marco has been pushing for several years to overhaul and modernize higher education focus on empowering students to know what they're getting out of the degree they're paying for and opening up the market for new providers and innovators  in other words, harnessing free-market forces to bring down the inflated cost of higher education.It's no surprise, therefore, that conservatives have embraced his ideas. Here's just a sampling of the praise:The Wall Street Journal editorial board (October 5, 2015):Feigning outrage that college is too expensive is a bipartisan pastime, so it's refreshing to see a presidential candidate taking the cost-drivers seriously. Senator Marco Rubio is highlighting an obscure network of higher-ed busybodies known as accreditation agencies, and more politicians should study up on how to reform this racket.""Our higher education system is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of existing colleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the market,"" Sen. Rubio said in a speech this summer. Last week he introduced a bill with Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) that would test a voluntary certification process for vocational and nontraditional education. . . .Reihan Salam writing in National Review (May 10, 2013):Kelly Field of the Chronicle of Higher Education reports on [Marco Rubio's] bipartisan Student Right to Know Before You Go Act of 2013, which aims to provide students and parents with reliable information on earnings by program of study and state of employment, cumulative debt levels, transfer rates, and graduation rates at U.S. colleges and universities. The higher education lobby has fought similar measures in the past on the grounds that a federal ""unit record"" system threatens the privacy of students, and so students and parents have no reliable way of knowing, for example, how many Pell Grant recipients at a given school actually graduate within five years. This data can be anonymized, and so the privacy concerns are almost entirely a canard. But the widespread availability of reliable data on student outcomes would, for obvious reasons, represent a grave threat to colleges and universities that offer a substandard education and that leave many students with heavy debt loads and little else. . . .Preston Cooper of the Manhattan Institute's Economics21:On Monday, Hillary Clinton rolled out her proposal to make college more affordable, which aims to allow students to pursue a ""loan-free"" education at public colleges and universities. The plan, which offers federal incentives to states which guarantee their students a debt-free education, is hideously complex. It also does not address the central problems in America's higher-education system.In contrast, Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate from Florida, has sponsored a number of bills that would enable students to take advantage of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), publicize information about graduation rates and potential earnings at different institutions, and make it easier for individual lenders to invest in students so that they would be able to avoid taking out college loans. . . .America has a choice. . . . Clinton is setting up the college-finance debate as a question of how much we should be spending. Senator Rubio is asking how we can make what we are spending work better.The Center for College Affordability and Productivity's Richard Vedder:Senator Marco Rubio [has] proposed some very specific ideas on higher education that deserve serious consideration. . . .Yuval Levin in National Review:More than most of the presidential candidates, Marco Rubio tends to make a point of talking about higher education reform in his stump speech. He mentions rising costs and loan burdens, and talks about making college more affordable by breaking down the barriers that restrict competition and by allowing parents and students to know more about job prospects for graduates of particular schools and majors (a reference to the ""Know Before You Go"" act, to make more data that's held by the federal government available to the public, which Rubio has sponsored with Ron Wyden). . . .I actually think the kind of approach to higher-education policy that Rubio, among others, is suggesting is in fact exactly what liberal [arts] education in America requires. . . .The Conservative Reform Network (October 9, 2015):Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) recently introduced the Higher Education Innovation Act with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO). Rubio's legislation would create an alternate, voluntary system for accreditation and would make a program's outcomes a greater emphasis during its accreditation review. When releasing his program Rubio said, ""This alternative accreditation system we've proposed is built on higher quality standards and outcomes than the current accreditation system and would mark an important first step to shake up a higher education system that leaves too many people with tons of student loan debt and without degrees that lead to good paying jobs."" . . .We applaud Sens. Lee and Rubio's efforts to reform our outdated accreditation system.George Leef of the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy in Forbes (February 27, 2014):When it comes to higher education, most politicians are ""cheerleaders."" They're content to speak the usual pieties about the importance of college and never do anything that could upset the status quo.In a recent speech at Miami-Dade College, however, Florida Senator Marco Rubio suggested several higher education changes that might seriously upset the status quo. . . .The American Council of Trustees and Alumni's Avi Snyder:It is long past time higher education reform got this kind of attention from Washington. Politicians from both parties are realizing that higher education is in crisis, and that only increased transparency and accountability can change it for the better. Bravo to Senators Rubio, Wyden, and Lee. We hope many more in Congress will join your fight.The American Enterprise Institute's Jim Pethokoukis:New reforms proposed by GOP senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio attempt to deal with the college cartel and the related issue of how to make higher-ed more market-like. What their ideas have in common are a variety of market-based approaches to improving educational opportunity. . . ."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 9, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Explains Exactly Why President Obama's Disrespect for Israel Is So Foolish,"Originally published on Medium, November 9, 2015By Marco RubioPresident Obama's foreign policy is teaching us a timeless lesson: An America that fails to support Israel is an America that undermines its own vital interests. When President Obama receives Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, it will be the first meeting between the two leaders since the Iran deal was finalized.Hardly a day goes by without new incidents that underscore Iranian hostility to the United States, all with little to no response from the White House. Since the Iran deal was concluded, Iran has detained more Americans. In recent weeks, Iran launched cyber attacks against senior American officials and last month it conducted a ballistic missile test in flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929. Iran has doubled down its effort to prop up Syria's Bashar al-Assad, sending additional troops to aid a Russian-backed offensive against moderate opposition forces. Meanwhile, the mullah's threats against Israel continue on a regular basis. At every turn, the Obama administration has ignored or downplayed Iran's provocations.Allies and enemies alike are watching, and what they have learned from the administration's attacks on Israel and its indulgence of Iran is that antagonism toward America goes unpunished while friendship goes unrewarded. The visit of the prime minister of Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, offers the President an opportunity to begin to counter these perceptions.But I have no illusions. Barack Obama is not interested in countering the prevailing perception of America and will likely use the meeting to address narrow, bilateral issues, such as weapons sales, rather than to address the real problem: America's lack of credibility in the world.As President, I will restore respect for America in the world. Just as the Obama administration's intentional degrading of our alliance with Israel signaled to friends around the world that the United States was not a reliable ally, reviving our alliance with Israel is central to reassuring our friends that the America they relied on for the last seventy years has returned. I will make restoring the U.S.-Israel relationship a top priority.My administration's foreign policy will be conducted with the understanding that defending Israel, like defending other democratic allies, is a form of American self-defense  an idea with which the Obama administration obviously disagrees. When the administration falsely suggested, for example, that Israel was using excessive force in response to a wave of terror attacks, it undermined the legitimacy of America's fight against terror. After all, our forces follow almost identical rules of engagement and are routinely subjected to the same false claims of targeting civilians and wielding disproportionate force.Instead of criticizing Israel's fight against terror, my administration will support it  morally and diplomatically. I will not force Israel to make compromises for peace when there is no viable partner on the other side of the table. The consequences are too great for the United States to force Israeli leaders to make deals with Palestinian officials who are only interested in inciting violence instead of actually achieving progress for their people.To Israel's north, Iran has armed the terrorist group Hezbollah with over 100,000 rockets and missiles capable of striking targets throughout Israel. We will partner with Israel in cracking down on arms smuggling to Hezbollah and intensify our joint R&D; on the next generation of missile defense, drawing on the successes to date of Arrow, Iron Dome, and David's Sling systems  technology that can be used to defend the United States and other allies as well.However, I will not follow the Obama precedent and pretend that enhancing Israel's military hardware is the sole sign of true commitment to its security. Maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge is indeed vitally important, but Jerusalem doesn't need better planes so much as it needs better American strategy. I will therefore never suggest, as some Democrats are suggesting today, that the nuclear deal can somehow be reconciled with a policy that truly meets the full challenge that Iran represents. The nuclear agreement strengthens Tehran economically, diplomatically, and militarily. It is ludicrous to argue that we can strengthen Iran with our right hand and yet contain it with our left.Terminating the Iran deal, therefore, will be a top priority of my administration. The United States and its allies will not be safe until Iran dismantles its nuclear program and allows intrusive inspections  the ""anytime, anywhere"" inspections the Obama administration repeatedly promised before caving to Tehran. And, finally, Iran must cease threatening its neighbors and promoting terrorism. Unlike the current administration, my administration will not treat Iran as a legitimate state while it acts like a terror state.The task of dismantling the Iranian nuclear program will not be easy, but doing so is a prerequisite for bringing stability to the Middle East. President Obama's failure to back Israel has undermined American credibility, American defense, and American interests. As the Israeli prime minister arrives in Washington, let us all pause and remember a time, not long ago, when American presidents needed no tutorials to understand that the United States can only achieve the peace and security we seek by standing with our friends and standing up to our enemies."

Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 6, 2015This isn't just about Keystone, as Marco pointed out: It's about President Obama's entire dysfunctional energy policy, which has put political pandering ahead of new jobs and lower prices for Americans.As President, Marco will pursue a completely different set of policies, which he's laid out over the course of his campaign. A 21st century energy plan will keep government out of the way of innovators and energy producers, allowing coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables to compete with each other on a level playing field.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 15, 2015",Press Release - We Won't Be Able To Take More Refugees,"Marco discusses Syrian refugee crisis on ABC's This Week.The problem is not the background checks. The problem is we can't background check them. You can't pick up the phone and call Syria. And that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees. It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't. Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria. Who do you call and do a background check on them?The bottom line is that this is not just a threat coming from abroad. What we need to open up to and realize is that we have a threat here at home  home-grown violent extremists. Individuals who perhaps have not even traveled abroad, who had been radicalized online. This has become a multi-faceted threat. In the case of what's happening in Europe, this is a swarm of refugees, and as I've said repeatedly over the last few months, you can have 1,000 people come in, and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. If that's the case, you have a problem, and there is no way to vet that out. There is no background check system in the world that allows us to find that out, because who do you call in Syria to background check them?"

It'd better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed.If I'm our nominee,how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?

That's silly. The truth is, my finances especially maybe not anymore, but certainly the first 10, 15 years of my marriage looked a lot more like the people I represent than the people I serve with.And so, instead of looking at that, and understanding why that makes me so passionate about the issues facing the American people, they focus on, why didn't I follow the advice of some financial adviser who analyzed my finances and thought I should have done this instead of that.The truth is I've invested everything we've made into my children: All four of them have their college paid off for the first four years, so they don't have to take out student loans. Today the only debt I have is my homein Miami, which is four blocks fromthe house that I grew up in. That's the true analysis. . . .

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 17, 2015",Press Release - Why Was Ted Cruz Pushing for Weakening Our Anti-Terrorism Programs Just Earlier This Year?,"As Marco has repeatedly stated, America is at war with radical Islam and faces new threats to our security in the wake of the brutal attacks in Paris. Our intelligence agencies are on the front lines of that war. So we should be making sure they have the tools they need, not weakening our intelligence programs, right?Marco Rubio thinks so.That's why he opposed efforts by President Obama and Harry Reid in the last two years to weaken the critical intelligence programs that are used to monitor and catch terrorism suspects and disrupt attacks before they happen.But some Republican senators including Ted Cruz led the effort in Congress to weaken the intelligence community.They pushed a bill that putbureaucratic roadblocks in intelligence officers' way, handed over national security decisions to the courts, and more.Despite the efforts of Marco and other national security conservatives, the bill passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama earlier this year.At a forum last night, Marco highlighted the consequences of weakening our defenses at such a dangerous time.""We are vulnerable,"" Marco said. ""What happened in Paris could happen in a major American city at any moment, at any time. There [are], in fact, elements that seek to strike us here in the homeland and have the capability to do so. It's just a question of whether they can carry it out.""And it's not just that the threats are significant and growing  they're also exactly the kind of threats we need intelligence tools to confront. These programs have been weakened by Cruz's efforts.""The danger is multi-faceted,"" Marco said. ""It is external operators who could be sent here, or have been sent here, for a specific purpose. And it's also lone actors. This is the other facet of the external operations of ISIS. Lone actors that gain inspiration and tactical advice online, from publications put out by ISIS about how to conduct an attack to inflict maximum casualty. . . . That's why our intelligence programs are so important. ""We have weakened the U.S. intelligence gathering capability through a combination of disclosures by a traitor, Edward Snowden, and also through the weakening in our own laws of important programs that now are being phased out, and as a result, will cost us the ability to gather actionable intelligence against elements operating in our territory,"" Marco concluded.The Cruz bill was supported by President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and liberal Democrats like Harry Reid. The American Civil Liberties Union praised it too, calling it the ""the most important surveillance reform bill since 1978."" It was called ""a resounding victory for Edward Snowden.""Meanwhile, conservative national security experts slammed it: Former NSA director Michael Hayden and former attorney general Michael Mukasey said the Cruz bill was ""exquisitely crafted to hobble the gathering of electronic intelligence.""Now that we've been reminded of the threat ISIS and other radical Islamists represent, why would anyone still be proud of their efforts to dismantle the programs that keep Americans safe?"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 18, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Calls Out President Obama's Latest Dangerous Plan to Put Politics Ahead of National Security,"November 18, 2015By Marco RubioToo often, President Obama has been more interested in the politics of war than in the execution of it. That's why for seven years the United States has not had a coherent detention and interrogation policy, hindering the fight against radical Islamist terrorism around the world.Now, President Obama is putting legacy politics above national security in a desperate attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. This is shameful, and I oppose his ongoing transfers of detainees from Guantanamo. These transfers are reckless and risk returning hardened terrorists to the fight.Closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and returning terrorists to the battlefield or even worse, bringing them to the United States, will not make America safer or convince those who hate us and our way of life to give up the fight.As President, I will focus America's detention policy exclusively on protecting our national security, keeping dangerous terrorists off the battlefield, and ensuring our military and intelligence professionals have the authorities and tools they need to obtain valuable intelligence from captured terrorists and prevent attacks on our homeland. The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay will remain an option for the detention of captured terrorists. Enemy combatants suitable for trial will be tried in military tribunals. And Guantanamo detainees will not be brought to the United States for trial in our courts.President Obama and Secretary Clinton want to return to the failed pre-9/11 law enforcement approach to counterterrorism. But as the attacks in Paris show us, America remains a nation at war. If we are going to win this war, we need a President who understands this fundamental reality.That is why on my first day in office I will rescind President Obama's actions to close Guantanamo and issue an Executive Order keeping the facility open."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 18, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Defends Support of Anti-Terrorism Program,"Marco continues to defend his record of supporting American counterterrorism measures  in contrast to Senator Ted Cruz, who voted to weaken our anti-terror intelligence programs earlier this year.As Politico reports, Marco emphasizes this is about the core responsibility of the President of the United States:On Tuesday, Rubio and his team went all in, painting Cruz as weak on national security, an attack line that seizes on growing unease in the United States since the Paris attacks. In brief remarks after a closed Senate Intelligence Committee briefing on the Paris attacks, Rubio stood by his comments the night before that Cruz and a number of other GOP senators had voted to ""weaken"" national security and intelligence gathering.""It eventually undermines our ability to collect information and to monitor those who seek to harm the United States,"" Rubio said.Asked why he singled out Cruz among the 67 senators who ultimately voted for the reforms, Rubio replied: ""We have a race for commander in chief, and the most important obligation of a president is to keep our country safe.""Remember: The bill Cruz led through Congress to weaken our anti-terror programs was pushed by President Obama and Harry Reid. Marco's decision to stand with national security conservatives, rather than pushing the Obama-Reid bill with Ted Cruz, is being praised:[T]here was evidence among senior senators that Rubio's aggressive posture on national security and foreign policy is working.""People who have extensive experience on national security issues and intelligence issues right now are going to have an advantage,"" said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). ""Marco has sort of staked out for some time pretty strong positions on those issues, and I think he's well-positioned to make the arguments.""Added Sen.

The bill was put forth by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla), who is running for president, and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). The legislation would let the administration sanction any banks that knowingly work with Hezbollah or supporters of the group. It would also require the administration to hand over a report detailing foreign financial institutions that are aiding the terrorist group or supporters. Rubio said that the legislation would help ""guarantee that our government is focused on eliminating this terrorist group."" ""We cannot afford to jeopardize our national security by letting Iran's leading terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, continue to pose a direct threat to us and our allies including Israel,"" he added. ""It is time for us to reveal the expansiveness of its dangerous network.""(The Hill)The legislation will go before the House of Representatives in the coming days.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 24, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Reacts to Turkey Shooting Down a Russian Plane (Just the Kind of Chaos He'd Predicted),"After Turkey reportedly shot down a Russian jet in Turkish airspace today,Marco Rubio said that, while he has differences of opinion with the Turkish government, the U.S. must stand by its allies, and that doing so will deter aggression from foes like Russia.""Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance,"" he said. ""If the NATO alliance is to remain vibrant then we have to live up to our commitments in that alliance.""Marco noted that he does have concerns about the direction of the Turkish government: [Prime Minister] Erdogan has taken that country in a more radical direction. They have broken from a long standing good relationship with Israel. You have seen him kowtow to some of the more Islamist elements of their political party in their country, so there is deep concern about what is happening internally within Turkey. And quite frankly, a little bit of lack of cooperation on their part in the fight against ISIS up until very recently.But he warned that letting chaos unfold in Syria would have exactly this consequence:It's the reason why I warned about having Russia in the Middle East . . . . I warned exactly, specifically this could happen, that there could be an incident with Turkey, a NATO ally. . . . So what would a confrontation look like? Well first of all, you are already seeing it. What will the Russian response be? This is a critical moment: If Russia believes that they can respond and retaliate against Turkey because NATO is not going to do anything about it, what they are basically doing is making the argument that NATO is no longer viable, that it is a feckless alliance.So what can the U.S. do? Back up our allies if it comes to that, Marco says:My sense is that in fact if we were true to our word and showed that we were going to be supportive of Turkey in this engagement, my sense is that the Russians would not test it. . . .I don't think Russia, so at end of the day, although Vladimir Putin is a gangster and a criminal, he is also a geopolitical actor who makes decisions on a cost benefit analysis. He will have to do something to save face but ultimately he is not going to test the alliance if he believes the alliance is going to stand up to him, because he will lose in that confrontation."

Because God is telling us no matter what happens it it's part of my plan. I will give you the strength to endure it whether you like it or not. And so every time we fear, every time we're anxious about something, what we're basically saying is I know that God is very powerful but this problem is so big that not even God can solve it, it's going to be up to me to solve it . . .If we did take more time to do that, to stop, and ask for that guidance, which, you're not going to get the answer that you want. That's not what we pray for, we pray for peace, and we're ordered to have peace. . . .In the daily occurrences of everyday life, when your faith is being tested, you're constantly reminded that you should be turning to God in all things, the big and the little. . . .Because the question was, how could God allow these bad things to happen, and it always challenges us to understand that God's ways are not our ways. What we may interpret as bad and what most certainly is in the case of Paris or 9/11, even that is part of a broader plan for the universe and our lives that we're just not going to know the answer to.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 24, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio's New Television Ad Perfectly Captures the Meaning of the American Dream,"November 24, 2015Marco's first television ad set to air in early states premiered on the Today show this morning.It tells the story of Marco's father and how his hard work fulfilled his American Dream, to provide a better future for his children.MARCO:I remember the sounds of his keys jingling at the front door of our home, well past midnight, as he returned from another long day at work. When I was younger, I didn't fully appreciate all he did for us, but now, I more fully understand.You see, my father was grateful for the work he had. That was not the life he wanted for his children. He wanted all the dreams he once had for himself to come true for us. He wanted all the doors that closed for him to open for me, and so my father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that I could stand behind this podium in front of this room and this nation.That journey from behind that bar to behind this podium, that's the essence of the American dream. I'm Marco Rubio and I approve this message.""In Marco's book American Dreams, he mentioned the same memory, of how hisfather worked to ensure that his children would have opportunities he never did:My father worked as a bartender well into his seventies, long past the time he should have retired. Many of the banquets he worked were on Friday and Saturday nights. So many late nights I recall hearing the jingle of his keys at the door, well past midnight, as he returned from another ten-hour day at work.I didn't fully appreciate it then, but I know now that the sound at the door wasn't just the sound of keys. It was the sound of the unfulfilled dreams of my father's youth. It was the sound of a father whose entire life was now about making sure I would never have to go through what he went through. It was the sound of his American Dream.Today, Marco's campaign is focused on making sure that today's parents will have the same chance his father did, to secure a better life for their children."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 25, 2015",Press Release - How Marco Rubio Stopped Obama's Attempt at a $2.5 Crony Capitalist Bailout  and Is Fighting to Do It Again,"ObamaCare is failing. One of the nation's largest insurers, UnitedHealthcare, says it's losing so much on its ObamaCare customers (despite skyrocketing prices and taxpayer subsidies) that it's considering leaving the market. So, naturally, insurance companies want a taxpayer bailout, and the Obama administration wants to give it to them.But Marco has led the fight to stop this outrageous bailout for two years.In fact, insurers would already be receiving a gigantic bailout this year  if Marco hadn't stopped them in Congress, saving taxpayers $2.5 billion.There is a provision in the gargantuan health care law for an insurer bailout, called ""risk corridors,"" thatessentially allows the federal government totransfer money tohealth insurers if they're losing too muchon ObamaCare.It was supposed to be paid for with a tax on insurers that were making money off of ObamaCare, but not enoughwere, so the White House resorted totrying to transferother taxpayer money to pay for the bailout.Marco exposed the plan, and the liberal left and insurance companies went wild attacking him for it.Then, when the White House tried to get funding for the bailout into last year's budget, Marco led the fight to keep it out for at least one year. That saved taxpayers $2.5 billion. Now Marco is leading the fight to stop the bailout again  only this time the stakes for taxpayers, and the potential savings, will be even bigger.Here's what Marco had to say when he successfully got his idea into law:For over a year, I've fought to protect Americans from having to fund massive bailouts to protect the profits of the insurance companies that helped write Obamacare. While there is much in this massive spending measure that is simply bad for America, at least the provisions protecting against a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies are a step in the right direction. While the Obama administration can still administer the risk-corridor program, for one year at least, they won't be able to use taxpayer funds to bail out insurance companies.The program will be around for another two years. With ObamaCare failing, insurers will be back next year, too, so Marco is working to end the possibility of a taxpayer-funded bailout permanently. Of course, ObamaCare needs to be repealed entirely and replaced with reforms that will allow Americans to get affordable health care coverage without resorting to bailouts of insurance companies. Marco has laid out his plan for repealing and replacing ObamaCare here."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 27, 2015",Press Release - This Presidential Contender Is Leading the Fight to Kill Obamacare,"Marco led the fight to stop a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare before. Now he's calling on Republican leaders to prevent the bailouts for good.Breitbart News talked to Marco this week about how the Obama administration wants to bail out insurers taking part in Obamacare.Marco stopped the bailout once in 2014:For years, Rubio has pressed leaders in his party to repeal the ""risk corridor"" provisions in Obamacare that would allow the federal government to effectively bail out insurance company losses from participating in the program. Thanks to a policy rider in the 2014 omnibus bill inspired by Rubio, bailout payments from the federal government are currently being choked off.Now the same insurance companies that spent millions lobbying in favor of Obamacare are asking Congress to fund a bailout for them.Marco is now urging Republican leaders to prevent them once and for all:""Why should American taxpayers be bailing out insurance companies, many of whom cooperated with, conspired with alongside the Obama administration to get Obamacare passed?"" he asked. ""And now they want to come with their lobbyists and basically force the American taxpayer to put money into a fund that bails them out for having lost money on the Obamacare exchanges.""Marco has led the fight against ObamaCare bailouts for years.If he succeeds in ending them permanently, it'll be a huge win for taxpayers, and could be a big part of ending ObamaCare for good."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 28, 2015","Press Release - On Small Business Saturday, Here's What Marco Rubio Would Do to Keep the Engine of the American Economy Going","Today is Small Business Saturday, when Americans are encouraged to shop at their local retailers and small businesses.Marco knows that small businesses are a key piece of American prosperity: They grow the economy, keep our communities vibrant, and offer ordinary Americans a chance to pass a living onto the next generation.Unfortunately, the torrent of new taxes and regulations enacted in recent years have made it harder and harder for small businesses to get by and compete with their larger competitors.Marco will take a number of steps to help make businesses competitive again, especially through reforming our outdated, burdensome tax code and our cumbersome system of federal rules.He has a plan to limit the overall cost of federal regulations, which disproportionately impact small businesses. New rules from ObamaCare and the EPA in particular are forcing employers to spend their hard-earned money on compliance, instead of hiring new workers and expanding.He'll also reform our tax code so that it's optimized for growth, and no longer taxes small businesses at a higher rate than larger corporations. Under Marco's plan, no business will pay more than 25%, and job creators will be able to immediately expense the cost of investments like equipment and machinery.As President, Marco will fight for small businesses. The American economy couldn't have become what it is without them  and we won't be able to compete in the 21st Century without them, either."

Here's part of what he had to say:A lot of people think 'peace' means like, ""peace"" [displays peace sign], like the hippie peace, or peace like no one's shooting at each other, or peace like everything's happy. That's not peace. True peace is it doesn't matter what's happening. The winds could be swirling and Jesus is asleep on the boat, not worried about a thing, that's peace. The peace is in knowing that two things are going to happen anytime you face adversity. One is God is going to shield you from the adversity.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"November 30, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Slams President Obama's Climate Negotiation Plans: Just Another Terrible Deal from This Administration,"Today, President Obama meets in Paris with leaders from around the world to discuss what he and other leading Democrats consider possibly the gravest threat to our national security. Not ISIS, or Russia, or Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon, or China's aggressive posturing in international waters, or even North Korea's nuclear weapons but climate change.While international dialogue is an important step in addressing global challenges, President Obama is proposing to give away the store in order to reach an agreement that will have no meaningful effect on climate change.For starters, the president's promise to reduce U.S. emissions is based on the enactment of the illegal Clean Power Plan, which will increase energy costs and kill jobs throughout the country. He has also committed billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to the ""Green Climate Fund,"" which developing nations will ostensibly use to mitigate the effects of climate change but which has no serious checks on how the money is used. And in return for wasting taxpayer money, killing American jobs, and stunting our economic growth, President Obama is likely to get a deal that allows China and other developing nations to continue polluting for years, with emissions caps that aren't legally binding on the signatories. Of course, this is not surprising coming from the administration that negotiated the disastrous Iran deal.Like the Iran deal, President Obama seems intent on signing onto a flawed agreementwithout buy-in from the American people. That is why I have joined with several of my colleagues in calling on President Obama to submit any climate agreement reached in Paris to the Senate for its constitutional advice and consent. We also requested that the lead U.S. negotiator make clear to his counterparts that Congress does not support President Obama's position, and will not approve any funds related to the agreement without the opportunity to ratify it.As president, I will undo Obama's illegal carbon mandates, ensure that any climate agreement impacting the American economy is approved by Congress, and promotethe responsible development of American energy resources to power our economy and provide affordable energy for consumers while protecting our environment."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 1, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio: 'We Need to Understand Who ISIS Is',"December 1, 2015In an interview Monday with New Hampshire Now's Chris Ryan, Marco outlined his plan to keep Americans and our allies safe.In part, he said, it's about understanding the enemy:We need to understand who ISIS is  they're an apocalyptic jihadist group, that believes that they're being called to defeat the West in an apocalyptic showdown, they even name the city where it's gonna happen. They're not going to stop fighting until they're defeated. They're not going to go away, they're not going to melt away, they're not going to go into another line of work. Their goal is a global caliphate . . . .I continue to believe the most effective way to defeat them is local forces. A Sunni Arab fighting force, a fighting force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs, will have to defeat them militarily and reject them ideologically. They will need our help, and that includes increased airstrikes, more special operators on the ground, more logistical and intelligence support and coordination, but ultimately they must be defeated on the ground by a fighting force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.Marco has put forward a detailed plan to defeat ISIS. He also discussed what can be done to combat mass shootings and violence in the United States.I think as a country we need to be more serious about how we address mental health. There's a bill working its way through Congress, that's something we should look at. I also think we should look at our society at large, why is it these things are happening, I think it will lead you back to a societal breakdown being a major contributor to some of the problems we face in this country. Not every problem in America has a federal government solution to it; a lot of them lie in our own homes, our own neighborhoods, our own communities.Finally, Marco discussed his plans to make the U.S. economy as competitive as it can be.It is the private sector that creates not just new jobs, but hopefully better paying jobs. In a 21st Century economy that's globally competitive, we have to put in place policies that allow us to be globally competitive. We have policies in place on the federal level now, tax policies, regulatory policies, energy policies, Obamacare, not allowing ourselves to fully utilize our energy resources, that act as an impediment, to not allow our private sector to be competitive.Marco has outlined bold policies that address the changing economy, as well as a plan to bolster small business job creation."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 1, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Explains How Other Republicans Have Sometimes Backed Obama's Dangerous National Security Policies,"November 30, 2015On Fox News tonight, Marco slammed President Obama's emphasis on climate change as a national security issue:But even some Republicans are going along with the President's efforts to gut the military and weaken our intelligence programs.One example: Ted Cruz, who led an effort just this year to take certain important powers away from U.S. intelligence agencies. Here's what Marco had to say about it:I can tell you my position and that is: I stand strongly on behalf of the ability of this government to gather intelligence on our adversaries and our enemies, especially terrorists, but also other nation states. Those [intelligence programs] keep us safer.There are Republicans, including Senator Cruz, that have voted to weaken those programs. That is just part of the record, it is nothing personal.The fact of the matter is that, today, we do not know as much as we once did about potential adversaries.Read more about that fight  where Marco stood up for national security first  here."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 1, 2015",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio Explains Exactly What's So Worrying about Russia's Aggression in the Middle East,"By Marco RubioDecember 1, 2015Turkey, our NATO ally, deserves the full backing of the United States after the shoot down of a Russian military plane last week. This event was just the latest manifestation of the dangers of allowing Russia to fill the vacuum left by President Obama in the Middle East.Aside from its violation of Turkish airspace, the downed Russian plane was apparently targeting Turkmen-populated pockets of northern Syria rather than territory controlled by ISIS. Most Russian military strikes since the end of September have been non-ISIS targets, including many civilian areas, revealing that Russia does not share our interest in confronting and defeating ISIS but instead is intent on propping up the Assad regime.It is farcical to think, even after the terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, that the United States and Russia can work together in resolving the crisis in Syria. We simply do not share common interests, let alone values, with Russia. President Vladimir Putin, a veteran of the KGB, leads one of the most corrupt, kleptocratic, and authoritarian regimes in the world.Transparency International ranks Russia very low in its corruption perceptions index (136 out of 175 countries).A recent Reuters report revealed how Putin's daughter and her husband have holdings worth some $2 billion. And Putin himself is estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars.Corruption is Putin's greatest export, but it is not the only problem we face from his rule. Putin resorts to any measures necessary to stay in power, and critics and opponents wind up harassed, imprisoned, and even murdered.The human rights situation in Russia under Putin is the worst it has been since the collapse of the USSR. And given the dreadful way he treats his own people, it should surprise no one that Putin supports like-minded authoritarians, including Syria's Bashar al-Assad. He invades his neighbors to prevent their deeper integration with the West. He fabricates the myth that the West and NATO enlargement are threats to Russia, when the reality is that Russia's most secure and stable borders are with countries that belong to NATO.Putin has described the Turkish downing of the Russian military plane as a ""stab in the back."" But Putin has been attacking Western countries for years by, for example, use of energy cutoffs and trade embargoes against neighboring states; the cyber attack against Estonia in 2007; the invasion of Georgia in 2008; the invasion and ongoing aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea (the first such annexation since World War II); military and diplomatic support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria; planned delivery of advanced missile defense systems to Iran; and dangerous flyovers by Russian military aircraft of NATO member states' territory.Putin exploits weakness in his Western counterparts, and he has seen plenty of that from President Obama and Secretary Clinton over the past seven years. He only understands strength and will back down if presented with a challenge. Some of my fellow Republicans naively think they can sit down and develop a good relationship with Putin. They think they know how to strike deals with him  that's what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton thought, too, and we all know what a disaster their ""reset"" policy has been for Europe's security and America's standing in the world.This latest incident with Turkey should also renew conversations within the alliance about whether NATO as an institution should be involved in the response to the terrorist attacks on Paris and the broader fight against ISIS. The civil war in Syria has threatened the security of Turkey for years and now the fallout from this conflict has spilled over to threaten all NATO allies on both sides of the Atlantic. Bringing NATO into the fight in concert with regional Arab partners and local forces on the ground would bring some much needed firepower and coordination to a war that we are not currently winning.Steps to avoid a repeat of what happened last Tuesday are worth pursuing to avoid a further escalation in tensions, but if another Russian military plane violates Turkish airspace, it too should be warned first and shot down if it ignores those warnings.Eventually, Putin will get the message. He needs to understand that there are serious costs for invading neighbors, propping up a murderous dictator like Assad, and violating the airspace of and threatening other countries.To be sure, Turkey presents its own challenges to our interests in the Middle East. For several years, it did little to counter the festering extremism on its borders, giving ISIS freedom to maneuver and import recruits. After agreeing to join the fight against the terror group this past summer, Turkey has targeted it sparingly, directing most of its efforts towards the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) and other Kurdish groups. Meanwhile, at home, President Erdogan has clamped down on the press and harmed freedom of expression.These issues are important, and the United States must raise them. But unlike with Russia, the United States can do so within the context of our NATO alliance. Maintaining the integrity of that alliance is crucial  not just for the security of the Middle East, but also for the security of Europe. Were we to opt out of defending Turkey, Putin may conclude that he can bully our other NATO partners as well.I believe strongly in speaking truth to power. We should not sugarcoat one of the most corrupt, abusive, and aggressive leaders in the world today. We need to show greater solidarity with our allies and friends around the globe and demonstrate a willingness to stand up for our principles. The days when Putin called the shots should have been over long ago. They certainly will end if I become president."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 2, 2015",Press Release - LISTEN: Marco Rubio Explains Why He Blocked the Obamacare Bailout Once -- and Why Congress Needs to Do It Again,"December 1, 2015Marco discussed his successful effort to stop the Obamacare bailout on The Michael Medved Show today. The key quote:The only way Obamacare can exist is if the American taxpayer bails out insurance companies. And we should not be bailing out insurance companies.His full comments on the issue:Well, I never felt there should be a bailout. So we were successful last year, I was successful at getting that bailout fund eliminated from last year's budget document. And the result is that this year the companies came for their money and there was $2 billion missing. And the reason why there was $2 billion missing from that fund was because we X'd it out. In essence, we said no we were not going to put any taxpayers' money. As a result of that, one of the biggest companies selling Obamacare is United. They have stopped marketing their plan and are threatening to pull out of the whole program. And that will begin the steady unwinding of the exchanges, which of course leads to the unwinding of Obamacare.And it proves our point: that Obamacare is a loser for these companies. The only way Obamacare can exist is if the American taxpayer bails out insurance companies. And we should not be bailing out insurance companies. We are going to have a fight again this month, in December, and I hope my colleagues all once again rally around us to get the bailout fund defunded this year.Marco's stand has earned him praise from conservatives. Just today, Fox News reported that he's getting ""a surprisingly big boost"" from his work to fight the bailout."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 2, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio is Fighting the Return of the Obamacare Bailout,"For too long, under both Democrats and Republicans, Washington and big businesses have teamed up to rig our economy to their benefit, often at the expense of everyday Americans. Perhaps the most outrageous example of this in recent memory is the attempt to force taxpayers to bailout the health insurance companies that have taken a hit under ObamaCare.As ObamaCare has crashed and burned over the last few years, the big health insurance companies that had originally lobbied in its favor have been suffering major financial losses. Just recently, UnitedHealththe nation's largest insurerhas announced that it will likely withdraw from the exchanges entirely. Naturally, Washington's solution is to send taxpayers the bill for its own mistakes.In 2013, when few were talking about this issue, I saw that ObamaCare was on a crash course and predicted that bailouts would be the preferred big government solution once the law failed. I instantly began the fight to stop these bailouts by getting rid of ObamaCare's blank check ""risk corridor"" provision. Ultimately, against the wishes of the insurance lobby and many politicians in Washington, I passed a measure that blocked the bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion.Some have called this one of the biggest legislative blows to ObamaCare yet. I'm proud of this important win for taxpayers, but it isn't enough. The insurance companies are already fighting back. They've hired teams of lobbyists  including some of the Washington insiders who originally forced ObamaCare through Congress  and they're pushing hard for a new bailout.Read the rest of Marco's op-ed at Hot Air."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 3, 2015",Press Release - This Candidate is Getting Headlines for His Battle Against the Obamacare Bailout,"For the past two years, Marco has been leading the fight against the Obamacare bailout.Marco is committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare, but one thing makes him unique: He figured out a way how to fight the law and protect taxpayers, and he's winning."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 3, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Explains How He Saved Taxpayers $2.5 Billion by Stopping Obamacare Bailout,"Marco explained on Fox News today how he saved taxpayers $2.5 billion by stopping the Obamacare bailout once before.We had these exchanges. What people don't realize is under Obamacare there is something called a high-risk corridor, it is a bailout fund. What it basically says that if these companies participate in the exchange, and they lose money, they can go after taxpayer money to bail them out for their losses. Last year, I was successful in getting language at the end of the year in the budget bill that took that bailout money away. Because I was able to achieve what we did last year, we saved the American taxpayer 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayers' money.Marco opposes corporate welfare for any industry, health care included. He explained how he'd repeal and replace the law:We need to replace it with a system that allows every American whether it is through refundable tax credit or their own employers giving them money to buy any health insurance they want from any company in America across state lines that is willing to sell it to them. That is a much better way to help people get insurance than a plan that requires the American taxpayer to bail out private insurance companies who have decided to cozy up to the Obama administration.Marco will continue leading the fight against any effort to bring back the Obamacare bailout, but the only way to ensure that the whole law is done for good is to elect a conservative President."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 3, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Blows Away Audience with Speech on His Commitment to Israel,"Below are Marco Rubio's remarks to the Republican Jewish Coalition on December 3, 2015, as prepared for delivery.Thank you. I'm glad to be back here today.Each time I return to this gathering, the urgency of the topic at hand has increased since the year before. That's true this year more than ever. The threats facing both our country and Israel have grown dramatically in recent months, in large part because our president has placed his own legacy ahead of our mutual security.But of course, when we gather here a year from now, we'll have a new president-elect. And depending on who it is, we'll have either taken a significant step toward reviving American leadership in the world and advancing Israel's security, or we will have slid even further toward weakness and disengagement.I think one thing that's become obvious over this last year is the devastating cost of a foreign policy that lacks moral clarity.Moral clarity means that we stand by our principles and our commitments. It means we speak up for what's right, and speak out against those who are wrong  even if that opens us to criticism. It means our allies trust us, and our adversaries respect us.It is common sense that American leadership should look like this. Presidents across both parties have led with moral clarity, from Truman to Kennedy to Reagan . . . until now. Now we have a president who leaves our allies feeling betrayed and our adversaries feeling emboldened. And there is no better example than what is happening in the Middle East.In the entire region, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democratic nation: the Jewish state of Israel. America has strong ties to Israel on a personal, cultural, political, and economic level. It is everything we want the Middle East to look like in the future: free, tolerant, democratic, peace-loving, and desirous of a better future.And today, Israel stands on the front lines of our civilizational struggle against radical, apocalyptic Islam. That term, Apocalyptic Islam, is not an attempt at being provocative; it is rather a description of the true beliefs of the leaders of both Iran and the Islamic State: that they are living in the end times and that mass genocide is their way to honor God.This enemy hates our two nations  both liberal democracies, both products of the Judeo-Christian tradition  for the exact same reasons. And the first requirement of fighting for our common security is standing together. We must not separate the threat to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv from the threat to Paris, or London, or New York, or Miami.I can think of no nation whose security is as closely tied to our own. For anytime there is daylight between America and Israel, it emboldens Israel's enemies to take action  first against the Jewish state, but then against the rest of the free world. Last month, we saw how quickly terror can spread from the Middle East into the heart of Europe.Many in Washington fail to understand this. They wonder why we should trouble ourselves with a small country thousands of miles away. They fail to see its connection to our national security and our moral character. They fail to understand the danger of sending a message to the world that America is an unreliable ally. And so they argue we should distance ourselves from Israel  abandon it to its multitude of eager enemies.I believe that, deep down, those who wish for this know what it would mean. It would mean we leave Israel's citizens to face alone the terror of rockets falling on their homes; the existential threat of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, which President Obama has exacerbated; the death march of the Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, on Israel's northern border; and Iranian-backed jihadists who indiscriminately kill Israelis on the streets of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv  and yes, in Judea and Samaria.Those in Washington who wish America would abandon Israel also understand something else: the threat of physical violence is not the only threat Israel would be left to face alone; there is also a growing political and diplomatic threat.In one international forum after another, Israel is attacked by despotic regimes and even free nations throughout Europe that should know better given their histories. It is singled out for condemnation relentlessly  a bullying to which no other nation is subjected.Normally, the United States stops these attacks and shames the attackers. Normally, the United States speaks with confidence and clarity against the regimes that hijack international bodies to distract the world from their own wrongdoing.Normally. But not under Barack Obama.President Obama  and, I'm afraid, Hillary Clinton  have a different policy. They call it ""engagement,"" but what it should really be called is ""abandonment."" Instead of standing up to those who single out Israel, the Obama administration takes the path of least resistance. It throws up its hands and says, in essence, ""not our problem.""Consider this: Just weeks ago, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas began a speech to a UN body by asking, quote, ""For how long will this protracted Israeli occupation of our land last? After 67 years, how long?""As we all know, sixty-seven years ago was 1948, the year of Israel's creation. So the man who is supposed to be Israel's ""partner for peace"" has just said that all of Israel is illegitimate and that the Jewish state is an ""occupation"" of someone else's land.Now, this isn't unusual rhetoric from a Palestinian leader  but what matters is that it should have provoked a harsh condemnation from the United States. But our president said nothing. By his silence, our government emboldened those who seek Israel's destruction and made itself a bystander to a poisonous lie.Similarly, over the past three months of Palestinian terror attacks, our administration refused over and over again to do anything more than call on both sides for restraint  as if there were no difference between aggression and self-defense. The Palestinian attacks are being incited by lies knowingly promoted about Jewish threats to the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, and spread through a vicious campaign of anti-Semitism in Palestinian media.Or consider the European Union's recent approval of a new trade rule that requires special labeling of products produced in what the EU considers ""Israeli-occupied territories."" The goal of this is to encourage Europeans to boycott goods from Israel. The rule applies to no other country  not to Russia, which invaded Georgia and Ukraine, nor China, which occupies Tibet. The EU is singling out only Israel.Let's take a step back and realize what this means. Discriminatory laws that apply only to Jews are now being written into European law for the first time in more than half a century.I believe we need a president who is not afraid to call this out for what it is: anti-Semitism. I will be that president.I will take a very different approach to the United Nations. There will be no more complicity in attacks on Israel. Dictators, rogues, and terror sponsors will be publicly shamed. The United States will leave and defund UN entities that attack Israel or promote anti-Semitism.I will also speak out against anti-Semitism here in America.One important example is the movement that calls itself ""BDS""  for boycott, divest, and sanction. This coalition of the radical left thinks it has discovered a clever, politically correct way to advocate Israel's destruction. BDS couches hatred in the language of human rights and social justice.But the movement reeks of hypocrisy. Boycotters do not seek to punish Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, or Russia  all actual human rights violators. Their campaign is aimed only at Israel. They make wild, false accusations in the hopes of inciting so much hatred of the Jewish state, especially on our campuses, that eventually support for Israel will become politically taboo.As president, I will call on university presidents, administrators, religious leaders, and professors to speak out with clarity and force on this issue  the same way they speak out against racism and other forms of bigotry. I will make clear that calling for the destruction of Israel is the same as calling for the death of Jews.I will bring moral clarity to the White House, but I will also back it with strategic and military strength. When I am Commander-in-Chief, I will fortify our alliance with Israel. In doing so, I will send a message to our friends and enemies alike that America is back  that we will never again confuse adversaries for allies or allies for adversaries.Let me be loud and clear about how I will begin: I will immediately shred this president's disastrous deal with Iran. News reports out of Vienna this week indicate that Iran will not even be required to come clean about its past nuclear weapons work. This makes a bad deal worse. And those who are now rushing to do business with Iran need to know that upon taking office, I will re-impose the sanctions that President Obama plans to waive over congressional objection.The days of giving the ayatollah of Iran more respect than the prime minister of Israel will be over. I will hold Iran accountable for the American hostages it has taken, and for its arming and funding of terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. I will impose crippling sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.When I am president, I will speak out against Palestinian terror in no uncertain terms, and will never confuse the victim and the victimizer. This means, as part of rebuilding our alliance with Israel, I will put the peace process in perspective. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have made it the defining feature of the relationship between our two countries. It should not be for the simple reason that Israel currently has no viable partner for peace.In fact, the ""partner"" that this administration claims is interested in peace rewards Palestinian terrorists up to $3,500 for every month they spend in an Israeli prison, which is more than five times as much as the average Palestinian in the West Bank makes per month. They get tens of thousands more upon their release from prison, and the entire level of payment is tied to the number of Israelis they have killed. Does this sound like a group interested in peace?Some in our own party actually question Israel's commitment to peace. Some in our own party actually call for more sacrifice from the Israeli people. They are dead wrong, and don't understand the enduring bond between Israel and America.Generation after generation of Israelis have struggled and sacrificed to find peace with an enemy seeking only war and death. I know and honor those sacrifices, and reject those who believe that Israel is the impediment to peace.Let me be crystal clear: there is no moral equivalence between Israel and its enemies.I will say it again. There is no moral equivalence between Israel and those who seek to destroy her.Understanding that fundamental truth is essential to being the next Commander in Chief. This is not a real estate deal with two sides arguing over money. It's a struggle to safeguard the future of Israel.As President I will challenge the real impediments to peace in the Middle East, and stand up for Israel.Instead of pressuring Israel to make unreciprocated concessions, I will work with its prime minister on areas of mutual interest. I will finally move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I will help ensure that Jerusalem remains the Jewish state's undivided and eternal capital. I will revive the common-sense understandings reached in the 2004 Bush-Sharon letter and build on them to help ensure Israel has defensible borders, including through its continued control of the Golan Heights.This is only the beginning of what I will do as president in support of Israel, but it is far from the beginning of my efforts on this issue as a public servant. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked to strengthen and deepen our alliance.I've passed new sanctions against Hezbollah, passed a budget amendment to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and fought to require Iran to recognize Israel's right to exist. I've proposed crushing sanctions on Iran for its ongoing support for terrorism and human rights abuses.As Speaker of the Florida House, I pioneered what became a national effort by requiring the Florida pension program to divest from companies linked to Iran's terrorist regime. And earlier this week, I introduced a resolution with Senator Kirk to ensure that states like Florida can continue to divest from Iran.I've also led efforts in the Senate to pressure the Palestinian Authority to end its partnership with Hamas, attempted to defund UN agencies that attack Israel, and supported legislation to force Europe to stop its despicable anti-Semitic boycotting of Israeli products. I have been a staunch supporter of our military assistance to the Jewish state, especially the Iron Dome system that has saved countless lives. These programs have ended up benefitting America by leading to technological innovations now used by the U.S. military.In choosing a president, we need to look at what candidates do, not just what they say. Just a few short years ago, many in my own party were trying to derail the postwar consensus about America's role in the world. They will never call themselves isolationists, but that is exactly what they are.I believe those who speak about their pro-Israel views but carelessly support a gutting of our international affairs budget, including assistance to Israel, or who vote against legislation funding U.S.-Israel defense programs, need to check their priorities. You cannot be pro-Israel while also attempting to eliminate assistance that Israel uses to defend itself.I'd like to leave time to take your questions, so let me just close with this point.One thing that inspires me the most about Israel is that, in the face of so much adversity, no nation wants peace more. No nation has shown greater restraint toward its enemies.And even as the current administration has turned its back on them in recent years, no people have stood by our nation, on issue after issue, more than the people of Israel.I'd encourage all of you to go back and look at the United Nations roll call votes. Time and again, when the interests of America are challenged, Israel is one of the few countries that votes with the United States.Like our own country, the state of Israel is an extraordinary story in the history of the world. I believe our nations share a moral foundation and a moral destiny. And so let us stand with them as they have stood with us. Let our nations, together, serve as beacons of light in an ever-darkening world."

Beyond it, you must destroy ISIS. You have got to be clear that we're at war with ISIS. We're going to destroy their ability to spew propaganda, to put out their online publication, to inspire people to attack us. We are at war with radical apocalyptic jihadists. We need to put an end to their ability to conduct operations or to inspire people to conduct operations. That is why ultimately we must defeat them. They must be defeated in Syria, in Iraq, in Libya, where they put out this propaganda from.As the threat of ISIS-linked terrorism in the United States continues to grow, Marco has led the fight to give our intelligence community the tools they need to keep us safe."

Starting in New Hampshire with former Senator Scott Brown, Marco packed the place.SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, it was unbelievable . . . .Marco was over 500 [attendees]. And they were literally packed in like, I'll be honest with you, they loved him. He took the time, answered every question thoroughly, thoughtfully. He has a wide range of knowledge.In South Carolina, Marco spoke as part of the College of Charleston ""Bully Pulpit"" series, and outlined his view of this election.REPORTER: He calls it a 'generational choice.' Rubio went on to say this election will help determine what path the country takes. He says it will determine the fate of future generations and the success for them.Finally, Marco drew a huge crowd in Guntersville, Alabama, where attendees braved the rain to see him speak.All across the country, momentum continues to build for Marco's campaign, and these latest events are proof of that."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 4, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Talks About Gun Violence on CBS This Morning,"Marco was asked on CBS's This Morning about gun violence and his recent votes against new gun control legislation. New laws won't stop criminals intent on committing violence, Marco said:None of these crimes that have been committed, or in this case, what I believe was a terrorist attack in California, would have been prevented by expanded background checks. The fact of the matter is, these individuals would've passed expanded background checks . . . .None of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them. In fact, many of them existed despite the fact that local jurisdictions had gun laws even stricter than what you find in other jurisdictions. We have a violence problem in America, and we should be concerned about the violence . . . .If you look at it more broadly, I think the fundamental question needs to be, why is there so much violence in America? It is a combination of cultural changes that have occurred in our country, and mental health issues as well.Marco supports efforts to strengthen our mental health system and more vigorously identify and combat homegrown terrorism. He opposes efforts to target law-abiding gun owners."

First of all, from the very first instance after this happened, they, like most people on the left, immediately jumped on this whole gun control argument without knowing any of the facts about this case  just immediately jumped on that. And they have continued banging the drum of gun control up until today when as every hour went by the indications were greater and greater that this was a terrorist act. And we now know that it was, irrespective of whether the White House or not has acknowledged it yet.Marco also pointed out that the left has ignored how irrelevant their proposed gun control measures are to stopping tragedies like this one.They immediately jumped on it as another example of another mass killing, and this is why we need gun control, completely ignoring that none of the laws that they are proposing would have done anything to prevent this shooting or any of the previous shootings that they have cited or pointed to.Marco has been relentless in rejecting the left's attempts to use the San Bernardino attack to push gun control, always standing up for the right of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 5, 2015",Press Release - A Top New Hampshire Conservative Says 'It Has to Be Marco Rubio'  Here's Why,"NH @UnionLeader runs piece by former editorial page editor @DrewHampshire backing Marco Rubio https://t.co/qz91koW5Kk Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) December 4, 2015Drew Cline, former editor of the editorial page of New Hampshire's most influential newspaper, the Union Leader, is backing Marco Rubio for President.No candidate for President has worked harder to understand the most important issues of the day, domestic and foreign, than Marco Rubio, and it shows. Take Obamacare. While all candidates talk about getting rid of it, Marco Rubio is the only one who has actually damaged it. He led the fight to deny extra subsidies for Obamacare exchanges, and the provision he fought for passed into law. As a result, insurers are pulling out of the exchanges because the administration cannot take money from other programs to prop up the failing exchanges.Republicans want a leader who will get things done, not just talk. Rubio is that leader. What's more, he understands where this country needs to go. Domestically, his opportunity agenda is exactly what the country needs. On foreign policy, no one has a more impressive grasp of the facts and the strategy necessary to enhance our security by reclaiming our position as the leader of the free world.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 6, 2015",Press Release - You Won't Believe What's Getting in the Way of the San Bernardino Terror Investigation,"The Associated Press dropped a bombshell report today: Because of new restrictions on intelligence agencies passed into law earlier this year, authorities investigating the San Bernardino terror attack earlier this weekcan't get the suspects' phone call records from the NSA.The U.S. government's ability to review and analyze five years' worth of telephone records for the married couple blamed in the deadly shootings in California lapsed just four days earlier when the National Security Agency's controversial mass surveillance program was formally shut down.Under a court order, those historical calling records at the NSA are now off-limits to agents running the FBI terrorism investigation even with a warrant.Instead, under the new USA Freedom Act, authorities were able to obtain roughly two years' worth of calling records directly from the phone companies of the married couple blamed in the attack. The USA Freedom Act the law that's restricting intelligence agencies going forward was passed with the support of some Republicans, who joined with President Obama and Democrats to weaken our counterterror capabilities.Here's what Marco had to say today about the report:Because too many in Washington have failed to grasp the nature of this enemy, we have less access to intelligence information now than we did just days ago. In the wake of Wednesday's attack on innocent Americans doing nothing more than going about their daily lives, we must act swiftly to reverse the limitations imposed on these critical intelligence programs. Radical jihadists are trying to kill as many Americans as they can. Our law enforcement and intelligence professionals need access to this information. Failing to give them the tools they need to keep Americans safe is dangerous and irresponsible.Marco warned about the risks of weakening our intelligence agencies before the new rules went into effect this week. Here's what he had to say about it several weeks ago:And here he was on Fox News earlier this week:The lesson is clear: We can't afford to be weakening our capabilities to fight terror when the threat is growing so rapidly, and hitting us here at home."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 7, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Lays Out How the President Should Be Responding to Terror Attacks at Home,"Marco appeared on CNN's State of the Union and outlined how the President should respond to the latest terrorist attacks.For example, our intelligence gathering capabilities have been significantly diminished just in the last four, five days. For example, yesterday we learned through the Associated Press that the phone records of these two individuals that carried out this attack in California, we only have access to the last two years. It doesn't give us a complete picture of, for example, the US citizens' involvement from the last five years.So I hope that the president will work with us to reverse that so the intelligence agencies have access to a full picture. He has also issued a series of presidential directives that have weakened our ability to gather intelligence against potential adversaries. So I hope that will be changed as well . . . .Then when it comes to ISIS around the world: they are a growing threat in multiple countries. They are beginning to pop up in Yemen. They are growing their influence in Afghanistan. They now have a very significant influence in Libya as I have pointed out for months. And of course Iraq and Syria. By the way, I think Jordan is very concerned about attacks within Jordan that are potentially imminent at any moment. We have a growing crisis here on our hands in the Middle East with ISIS.So I think it is important that the president begins to outline how they are going to be defeated. Airstrikes alone are not going to do it. Certainly not the limited airstrikes that are happening now. Apart from airstrikes, there must be a ground force put together to confront them. And it must be a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs from the region, including Iraqis and Syrians, but also a contribution of troops from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE has already expressed some willingness to provide ground troops to such an effort. This is a radical Sunni group, they need to be defeated by Sunnis themselves on the ground. Marco has consistently called for restoration of vital intelligence capabilities, and has laid out a clear plan to defeat ISIS."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 7, 2015",Press Release - Watch Marco Rubio's Response to President Obama's Address on ISIS,"December 7, 2015Marco responded to President Obama's address on ISIS last night in an interview with FOX News' Bret Baier. BAIER: Your thoughts on this address from the president about ISIS, the threats, and how they're evolving.MARCO: Well, let's begin by understanding the mood of the country. People are really scared and worried. Last night I ran into a couple that often travels abroad or to other parts of the country for New Year's Eve. For the first time in a decade, they're not traveling anywhere this year because they're so scared. I ran into someone else who said they're avoiding stadiums and malls this holiday season because they're scared. They're scared not because of these attacks, but the growing sense we have a president that's completely overwhelmed by them.This is the president that called them the JV when they first emerged, ISIS did. Just on the eve of the Paris attacks, basically argued they were being contained. Called the attacks in Paris a setback, as opposed to a widespread terrorist attack that showed real progress on the behalf of ISIS. After Paris, by the way, the only emotion the president ever showed on his overseas trips is when he was attacking the GOP on the debates we were having here about what to do with the Syrian refugee program.Nothing that happened in the speech tonight is going to assuage people's fears. First of all, we heard tonight that the same strategy that's brought us to this point is the strategy he's going to continue with. He honestly believes that there's a coalition fighting against ISIS. This is absurd. There's no such coalition. A lot of countries have put their names on a piece of paper, but the reality of it is we continue to conduct very limited air assaults and you can't just defeat them from an air perspective, and we can talk more about that in this interview I suppose. Beyond that tonight, he announced nothing new other than we need gun control, even though it would have done nothing to prevent the attack in California. We need to prevent people on the no-fly list from buying these weapons, even though there are people that work for DHS that are on the no-fly list?By the way, these individuals that conducted this attack would not have been prevented from accessing their weapons. And then the cynicism, the cynicism tonight to spend a significant amount of time talking about discrimination against Muslims. Where is there widespread evidence that we have a problem in America with discrimination against Muslims. And the refusal to call this what it is, a war on radical Islam. I am very disappointed tonight. I think not only did the president not make things better tonight, I fear he may have made things worse in the minds of many Americans.Marco has laid out a clear plan to defeat ISIS and ensure the continued safety and security of America and our allies."

There is not a single credible military official either active or inactive that would say that we can simply defeat them from the air. It will have to be confronted on the ground. It must be a coalition of which the bulk of it is made up of Sunni Arab, obviously the Kurds are doing a great job in the Kurdish areas. We should even empower Christians to defend themselves in their areas and their families but the bulk of that ground force needs to be Arab Sunnis that reject ideologically and defeat militarily ISIS and they will need our help. We will have to increase the number of Special Operators to call in those air strikes. We will need more logistical and intelligence support and we'll need more support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the UAE, other Kingdoms that are immediately impacted by ISIS' presence in the region. But they must be defeated on the ground. We will not be able to defeat them simply with air strikes. Marco has consistently laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and protect Americans and our allies."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 10, 2015",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio Lays Out His Vision for Fixing the VA (Alongside His Green Beret Brother),"Following are Marco's remarks as prepared for delivery to a Concerned Veterans for America event in Des Moines, Iowa, on December 10, 2015.Less than two months from today, here in this very state, we'll begin the process of choosing the next president of the United States. And after 7 years of Barack Obama, it's helpful to remind ourselves exactly what that means.The president's job is not to micromanage the private economy. It's not to make your healthcare decisions. And it's not to try and change the weather. The first job of our president  as stated in the Constitution  is actually the last thing President Obama seems interested in doing, and that is serving as Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States.So in just two months, we'll begin choosing the person who will be in charge of the world's greatest military, the person responsible for protecting the safety of your children and mine. And with that honor comes another extraordinary duty: That of representing those who put their lives on the line for freedom.Now, as a state that sees its fair share of politicians, you'll know that it's in vogue to pay lip service to our veterans and troops. But you'll also know that talk is cheap, and that candidates must be judged not just on what they say, but on what they do. So today, I'll tell you exactly what I've done for our service men and women over the years, and exactly what I'll do to uphold my duty to them as president.I believe our Commander-in-Chief's duty to our men and women in uniform comes in two parts. The first is to honor our troops while they're serving; the second is to honor them after they come home.Honoring them while they're serving begins with reducing the likelihood that they will be pulled into conflict. The way to do that is not to ignore threats  it's to project American Strength abroad, to stand beside allies such as Israel, stand up to enemies such as Iran, and engage strategically around the world.Throughout our history, presidents from both parties have understood that strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it. To restore strength, I will reverse the defense cuts that politicians in Washington, including some Republicans now running for president, have fought to keep and even deepen. The military will no longer be used as a pawn in budget negotiations.While I agree with those who argue that the Department of Defense, like every agency, must eliminate financial waste, I also understand that defense is the reason we have a federal government in the first place. Our nation cannot function without security. This is why every time we try to cut a dollar from defense, it seems to cost us several more just to make up for it.I will return strength to our military as the first means of honoring our troops. But there may be times when that is not enough to deter conflict, when evil marches forward and tests us anyway. It is in these times that the president of the United States is faced with his most difficult decision.Choosing whether or not to send troops into combat is one of the greatest burdens of any office in the world. It impacts not just the mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, who go into conflict, but also the family and friends who spend so many sleepless nights praying for their safety.If you've ever seen the videos where a member of our armed forces surprises their family by coming home early, you know how emotional those reunions can be. They're emotional just to watch, because we all inherently understand the burden and sacrifice the families of our armed forces carry, and we understand that sacrifice should never be called on lightly.If I must make this difficult decision as Commander-in-Chief, I will recognize that I also have a duty to be the Communicator-in-Chief. And I will speak directly and honestly to the American people about exactly why our national security interests are at stake and exactly why military engagement is the best or only option to address the problem.And I will also make this pledge here and now: I will never send our men and women in uniform into a fair fight, but will always equip them with the resources and strategies to keep the upper hand. Any candidate proposing that we keep the defense cuts imposed under sequestration cannot make that promise.Finally, our troops will also be backed by something else they've been missing under our current president, and that is a full commitment to victory. Our military will never again doubt their Commander-in-Chief's support for their mission, nor will they question America's commitment to winning.Those principles will guide my duty to our active service members. But what about the second part of every president's duty to those who serve? It's been too long since Washington has properly cared for those who have cared for us. We will change that when I'm president.Before I explain how, I want to pause for a moment and introduce you to someone who traveled all the way from Florida to be with us today. That's my brother, Mario Rubio.Mario joined the Army in July of 1968, the month after he graduated high school, and he served in the Army's 7th Special Forces Group  the Green Berets  until April of 1971, which happened to be the month before I was born. In fact, one of the first things he did when he returned from duty was drive my mom to the hospital to have me.All throughout my childhood I looked up to Mario. He had been a football star in high school, which was already enough to make him a legend in my mind. But most importantly, I remember it being a tremendous source of pride for my family, especially for my parents and grandfather, that he had risked his life for the country that had given us so much.But today, like many thousands of other veterans, Mario is struggling to get the care owed to him for an injury he suffered during his service. He was hit in the mouth while in jump school, bending his front teeth back in a way that became an orthodontic nightmare. He was driven to the dentist at Fort Benning where they did some initial work to correct the damage, but the Army never made an official record of the visit.So today, he needs more orthodontic work as a result of his injury, but the VA won't cover it. He's had to file a claim and wait for a hearing, which could take anywhere from 18 months to three years. Meanwhile, he's stuck waiting for the procedures he needs.Mario is going through the exact same bureaucratic nightmare every other veteran in his situation has to go through. And like so many of them, he will tell you how confusing it has been, how even the forms he has to fill out seem almost intentionally complicated. He's often met with the same charm and efficiency at the VA that the rest of us find at the DMV.My brother, like all of our veterans, deserves better. When I am president, they will have better.Here's what the media doesn't want you to know: One of the reasons the VA is so incompetent is that union bosses have rigged the system, making it almost impossible to fire VA employees no matter how bad they are.This is why I worked in the wake of the VA scandal to change the law to allow the VA secretary to fire any corrupt or negligent bureaucrats. It wasn't easy. I had to take on Bernie Sanders, who actually tried to block my bill. I took on the Unions. I took on every one of them to put the interests of veterans above the interests of bureaucrats, and I succeeded.But even with this success, little has changed. Few have been fired. Corruption still runs rampant.For example, two VA officials were recently found to have defrauded the department of $400,000. But they weren't fired; they were merely demoted. And even that didn't last. Just last week, the VA rescinded the demotions. The examples like this are numerous. And all the while, our veterans languish.I recently read a story about the mother of one wounded Army veteran in need of care. President Obama had written to her in 2009 promising to do all he could to help. But this year she decided to sell that note out of desperation to pay for her son's care. As she put it, ""Something good might as well come out of that. It is doing no good lying in my drawer.""It's for reasons like this that I'm taking action again. I've filed a second bill that goes even further, allowing us to fire more than just the managers but also the lower level employees who are neglecting their duties. Yet the truth is we'll never be able to completely overhaul the system until we have a new Commander-in-Chief.Hillary Clinton wants to be that Commander-in-Chief, but she refuses to admit there's a crisis, saying problems at the VA aren't as, quote unquote, ""widespread"" as has been reported. On this issue, like virtually every other, Hillary Clinton would keep the status quo the status quo.I, on the other hand, will not just reform Washington; I will transform it.My principles for transforming the VA are simple.The first is accountability.Accountability is the radical concept I just discussed  so radical that no one in Washington seems to have any clue what it is. And that is that any corrupt and negligent workers at the VA should be fired.Now, let me be clear: there are a lot of good people at the VA. Many are veterans themselves. And the other side of accountability is that, if you're doing a good job, you should be recognized and valued for your hard work. But those who are not doing a good job will be fired when I am president.My next principle is transparency.We need transparency in order for accountability to work.One reason we're not seeing the results we wanted out of our first effort at reforming the VA is that we simply have no way of verifying what's happening. I'd love to be able to give you a specific number of people who have been fired as a result of my law, but no one knows what that number is. The VA is claiming it's in the hundreds, but the fact checkers have laughed that off. They estimate it's in the 20s. Others say it's in the single digits. But no one knows. And this is how bureaucrats at the VA get away with it all.When I am president, we'll know what's happening. I will require the VA and VHA to report publicly on all aspects of its operation, including quality, safety, patient experience, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness. And with that information, we'll be empowered to make decisions and make lasting changes to the system.My third and final principle for transforming the VA is choice.When I'm president, benefits are going to follow the veteran; the veteran is not going to have to follow the benefits. That means if the local VA doesn't provide efficient and high quality care but the hospital around the corner does, you will be able to take your VA benefits and go to that hospital. Veterans facing health problems of all kinds, including mental health issues, need to have the option to seek care from private providers in a way that also preserves traditional VA services.This, by the way, is important for Mario because he needs periodontal work done but there isn't a periodontist with the VHA anywhere near him. To get the care he needs, he'll have to go to a private provider.These three principles I've discussed  accountability, transparency, and choice  have the power to truly transform this and any system.I've given you the ""what"" and ""how"" of our president's duty to our men and women in uniform, but I want to close by giving you the ""why."" Because I believe the ""why"" of America's military might, more than anything else, is what has been missing for the past seven years.Let me start with this personal note.When Mario and I were kids, even though we grew up years apart, we both were greatly influenced by our grandfather. He lived with my family for most of our childhoods. Mario shared a room with him. And years later, I would sit with him for hours on our porch, sometimes discussing whatever fascinations occupied my attention at the time. But most of all, I would listen.I would listen to his stories of growing up in Cuba, stories of the pain of losing his country. And I would listen to him speak about the leaders and ideas that inspired him. He revered Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan, detested communism, and believed with all his heart that the United States was destined to be the defender of human progress throughout the world.Our lessons took place against the backdrop of the Cold War. It's easy to forget today just how tense those times were for America  the nuclear drills in school in the '60s, the worried reports on the evening news, the frenzied debates about communism that dominated campaigns.In some ways, what we're going through today is similar  not just with a resurgent Russia and other traditional powers, but also with our civilizational struggle against radical Islam. Like the Cold War, this is a clash of ideologies, and we have to win.To win against Soviet-style communism, presidents from Truman to Kennedy to Reagan knew we needed to couple America's military might with an equally mighty defense of her values, not just as right for America but as right for the world.Truman once said: ""God has created us and brought us to our present position of power and strength for some great purpose.  It is given to us to defend the spiritual valuesthe moral codeagainst the vast forces of evil that seek to destroy them.""Reagan understood this concept, too  better than most. He inspired a belief in it in both our citizens and our military. And because of him, the Cold War was won.But today, in this time of mounting turmoil, our president believes something different.He believes America has been a bully for too many years  that we should be more accepting of other values, even when they violate the God-given rights this nation was founded on. We see this in his dealings with Cuba and Iran, and his indifference to Israel. We see it in the way he lectures Christians not to get on a ""high horse"" in condemning radical Islam.There is no doubt in my mind that his weakness, both moral and strategic, has led to the discord we see around the world today. This, in turn, has endangered our people as well as the men and women in uniform who are called to defend them.As president, my cause will be peace, and I will understand that the only means of achieving it are strength of arms and strength of values. That is the lesson of history.My grandfather's lessons all those years ago were true. And he inspired in both Mario and me a desire to serve this extraordinary country  the country that gave us all the chances in life that he never had himself. Mario served in the noblest way of all. I strive to serve, too  though I will never completely repay the debt I owe to America.But I pledge this: As president, in all that I do, I will honor the two centuries of veterans who have defended this exceptional nation and the values it represents, and I will honor the brave men and women in uniform who carry on that legacy today. I will honor them by defending their dignity in Washington, by proudly advancing the values many have died to defend, by uniting our people around the common cause of liberty, and by promoting the security our nation needs to thrive in our time and for all time."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 11, 2015",Press Release - READ: These Three Young Conservative Senators Get exactly What We Need to Do to Keep America Safe,"December 11, 2015Today, Marco joined with Senators Joni Ernst and Tom Cotton to call for restoring the intelligence programs that expired just last week.In Independent Journal, they write: Now, more than ever, we need the intelligence gathering tools necessary to uncover plots and identify our enemies. That is why we are sponsoring the Liberty Through Strength Act IIlegislation that will give our intelligence community the capability to protect the American people.Earlier this year, President Obama unfortunately pushed for and Congress passed the ""USA FREEDOM Act,"" which greatly curtailed the ability of our intelligence professionals to identify and track terrorist communications. Many voted for this flawed bill because at the time, it was the only alternative to a complete expiration of important terrorist surveillance tools. However, doing so greatly compromised other programs that are vital to our fight against radical Islamic terrorism.Worse, it wasn't just President Obama and Congress  some Republicans joined in with that effort to weaken our defenses.These programs, such as the ""metadata"" program, don't involve snooping on Americans, no matter what you've heard:By definition, metadata are non-content data. Metadata consist of phone numbers dialed, as well as the date and duration of calls, not the calls themselves nor even the names associated with the calls. The metadata program was useful not because it allowed the intelligence community to listen in on conversations, which was not possible under this program, but because it allowed the NSA to connect the dots. Searching for the number of a suspect reveals the phone numbers the suspect called and when, and the numbers which those people called. This allowed the government to map terrorist networks. The actual identity of the individuals are not known until after the numbers were passed to the FBI, who in turn uses its normal investigative processes for identification.The metadata collected by the NSA were also far less sensitive and extensive than the information that supermarkets, Internet and credit card companies, and others in the private sector collect on Americans on a daily basis. The metadata program placed stringent privacy controls on the use of this data. Any official that failed to follow the law was subject to discipline and prosecution, but there was not a single documented case of intentional abuse of the program during its entire existence.Marco, along with conservative allies like Senator Ernst and Senator Cotton, is going to keep fighting to restore these crucial capabilities  we need them now more than ever."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 11, 2015",Press Release - New York Post: This Republican Candidate 'Has Already Cut Obamacare's Throat',"The New York Post highlighted Marco's efforts to stop the Obamacare bailout, which is nothing but corporate welfare for big insurance companies:One gimmick might keep insurers in the game: The law's ""risk corridor"" provision allowed Washington to tax profitable exchange plans to prop up unprofitable ones.But even in Year One, there weren't enough profits to cover the losses  so Team Obama transferred money from elsewhere.This subsidy was entirely distinct from the law's support for lower-income folks: It was a bailout for the companies. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put a stop to that last year, passing an amendment that prevents these back-door bailouts.Without the extra taxpayer dollars, the administration can only deliver about 13 percent of the bailout cash needed this year. So it can't save the money-bleeding nonprofit ""co-ops"" the law set up either. More than half these nonprofits have failed already.Marco pinpointed the problem with Obamacare years ago: It simply won't work unless we bail out the insurance companies that bought into the doomed law.. Marco stopped the bailout once, and now he is leading the fight to end these bailouts for good."

About all of us who feel out of place in our own country. A government incredibly out of touch and millions with traditional values branded bigots and haters.

It's yet another key moment for our campaign. Marco's emerged from the first four debates the clear winner, and we expect big things from him again tonight.Despite the tone of the election season so far, Marco has succeeded by running a positive campaign. But don't be surprised if other candidates on the stage tonight get desperate and go on the attack.That's not what Marco is there to do tonight. Of course, he will draw on his exceptionally strong record and contrast it with other candidates if he has to:how he has a record of not just opposing ObamaCare but actually landing a significant blow against the law by blocking President Obama's attempted bailouthow he has offered a clear, strong vision for the United States' role in the world in the 21st Century, which means standing up to Islamic terrorism and terrorist regimeshow he's fought to keep Americans safe at home, by keeping our intelligence programs strong and funding our military at the level it needshow he has a detailed agenda to revive our economy here at home, through reforming taxes, regulation, health care, labor rules, and energy policyThat's the conservative record and vision you'll hear him talking about tonight. Debate viewers, and the thousands who've seen him on the campaign trail just this month, have liked what they've heard so far.Here are highlights from Marco's first four debate performances:Tune in to CNN at 8:30 Eastern tonight, and follow along on our Debate Dashboard!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 15, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Takes a Tough Line on Vetting Immigrants in a Time of Terror,"Marco joined Sean Hannity last night to talk about the unacceptable state of America's national security.Here's what he had to say about reports that visa applicants don't have their social media screened for radical leanings:This is why the American people increasingly have zero confidence that this administration has any idea how to keep our country safe.We know, for example, that one of the early indicators of radicalization is what people are doing online. That is what ISIS is using.To not look at that as a factor . . . just defies all explanation.He calledfor much tougher screening of immigrants whose backgrounds aren't known to authorities:You have someone that's arriving [in America] for the first time, who we know nothing about, that's someone you're going to have to take a little bit more time to look at a little more carefully, and err on the side of caution.That's the kind of approach we can take, instead of this notion that somehow our immigration system needs to be a place in which we play political messaging games. . . .If it's an eight-year-old child who's an orphan, you can vet that. But the vast majority of people that are trying to come are people that we just don't have information on. You can run their name on the database a thousand times, nothing's going to pop up, because there's no databases for people coming from Syria.This is an issue that you have to be right 100 percent. You cannot afford to be wrong on even one, because if you're wrong on one, that could be an ISIS killer, who comes to the U.S. and carries out a terror attack. There's no margin of error when it comes to this."

Darrell Issa, former chairman of the House Oversight Committee, respondedto anerroneous media factchecktrying to undermine Marco's leadership on undermining a critical part ofObamaCare:Marco was the first to identify this bailout provision in ObamaCare, the first to introduce legislation to stop it, the one who rallied conservative groups and members of Congress, including me, to make it a priority, and the one who pushed then-Speaker Boehner to make it a priority in cromnibus negotiations.Marco was essentially the general manager of the effort to stop the ObamaCare bailout that saved taxpayers $2.5 billion last year. He built the team of conservative groups and leaders, and he led them to success.I read the attempt to rewrite history and laughed because it's such typical Washington insider smallball to argue about whose computer was actually used to write the words that made it into a bill, whose paper was it printed on, or who hit send on the final email.The bottom line is that stopping the ObamaCare bailout of health insurers was Marco's idea.Marco set the agenda on this, got others to buy into his agenda, and make it part of theirs.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 16, 2015","Press Release - READ: The Reviews Are In, Marco Rubio Shined at the Vegas Debate","Marco stood out on last night's debate stage, as he has this whole campaign season, for his clarity of vision and command of the issues  especially on the question of how to keep Americans safe.Here's what Iowans woke up to this morning:Marco stood strong last night on a couple crucial national security questions: He laid out the importance of the intelligence community's metadata program that Senator Cruz voted to dramatically curtail just this year, and made it clear that he wouldn't be content to work alongside anti-American dictators.In Nevada, one of the state's most respected political correspondents, Jon Ralston, said Marco beat back attacks from Senator Cruz and Rand Paul:Rubio outdid Cruz in the early rounds . . . What I found most interesting, though, is that Rubio came under sustained assault from Cruz and Paul and did not lose his cool.That was good. Rubio won first round. Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) December 16, 2015Yes. https://t.co/myP5QENoLF Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) December 16, 2015Elsewhere in Nevada, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported that grassroots activists were impressed by Marco's strength:""I thought that Rubio bested Cruz throughout the entire debate,"" [Kim Bacchus, president of Washoe Republican Women] said. ""I don't think Cruz came across as strongly as he needed to to justify his second place position in Iowa.""Conservative leaders were impressed, too. Here's what National Review editor Rich Lowry had to say:The debate was defined by several substantial and intense exchanges between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. I'd score it for Rubio on points, but it was close and both senators are obviously exceptionally skilled. I think Rubio had the better of the argument on the NSA on the merits and on the question of whether or not ISIS can be defeated from the air (it can't).The Weekly Standard's Steve Hayes saw it the same: Marco triumphed on the substance.I think Rubio is right on the merits and his view is probably more in line with where Republican primary voters are, particularly given the rising anxiety about terrorism after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. I'd give the exchange to Rubio on points.The Wall Street Journal's editorial board struck a similar note:Perhaps the most revealing exchange came on the powers of the National Security Agency, where Senator Marco Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich in particular squared off against Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Messrs. Paul and Cruz were among the few Senate Republicans to vote for the USA Freedom Act this summer that barred the bulk collection of telephone records.Mr. Rubio has been hitting Mr. Cruz's vote on the campaign trail, and he rightly pointed out that ""now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorist that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we would have had access to five years of his records so we could see who he was working with.""Later, when it came to immigration, Marco stoody by his long-held position on the issue, while Senator Cruz was roundly panned for flip-flopping:Cruz misleads on his position on immigrant legalization. Tried to strike path to citizenship, but not legalization. https://t.co/xVE3GzLwIp Brit Hume (@brithume) December 16, 2015Ted Cruz says he does not ""intend"" to support legalization  a giant escape hatch if he needs it Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) December 16, 2015The reviews for Marco's vision for American strength were positive all around:Marco Rubio has the only coherent geopolitical narrative on this stage.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 17, 2015",Press Release - READ: This Republican Candidate Has a Plan to Make American Manufacturing Competitive Again,"On December 17, 2015, Marco Rubio delivered a policy address to Iowans at Weiler Manufacturing, in Knoxville, Iowa, about how he'd reinvigorate American manufacturing. Weiler produces cementpavers. Here's his speech as prepared for delivery:Thank you to Pat and everybody at Weiler Manufacturing for hosting us.I want to speak today about the future of manufacturing in America. It's a future I believe can be very bright. But to make it so, we have to embrace the economic changes of our time  something few in Washington seem willing to do.When my parents came to America in 1956, our country's manufacturingstrength was unchallenged. It was common to find a job at a local factory right out of high school that paid enough to buy a home and a car, send your kids to college, and eventually retire with security.This industrial economy peaked around 1980, when roughly 20 million Americans held manufacturing jobs. This fluctuated and declined slowly over the next two decades, but it wasn't until around the turn of this new century that something dramatic happened. In just one decade, between 2000 and 2010, America lost about 6 million  or over 35 percent  of itsmanufacturing jobs.Families found themselves out of work and slipping out of the middle class. Entire cities and towns once booming with industrial might saw their factories shuttered and buildings abandoned. Only a small portion of the jobs lost during this period have been regained today, and many are left to wonder whether we'll ever be an economy that makes things again.Many in Washington recognize this sentiment, and they seem to view it as a political opportunity. They make soaring promises about returning American manufacturing to its glory days. But most of their ideas aren't worth the paper they're written on. Many would only worsen our challenges. And all fail to grapple with the primary cause of our manufacturing troubles.These troubles aren't a mere byproduct of the recession; they began long before that. And they aren't just the result of bad policy-making, though that's contributed to the problem. The primary cause of our decline inmanufacturing has been a fundamental restructuring of our economy.Over the last two decades, technological advancements have led to machines replacing workers; globalization has led to factories moving overseas; and the rise of information technology has led to a shift in demand away from producing products and toward performing services.Our economy and our way of life have fundamentally changed, but here's one thing that hasn't: to be the leading economy on earth, we still need products conceived by American minds and built by American hands. And we need to sell those products throughout the world.American manufacturing can thrive again in this century, but not in the same way as it did in the last. The products we build, the way we build them, and the skills required to do so will be different than in our parents' time. We will never restore American manufacturing by attempting to wish away the economic changes that have occurred, as Hillary Clinton seems to propose; we will only do so by embracing those changes.The first change that must be embraced is the decrease in demand for unskilled labor and the increase in demand for skilled labor. As president, I will start by revolutionizing higher education and skills training.The low-skilled manufacturing jobs that have been outsourced or automated in recent years aren't coming back. But in their place we've gained higher-skilled and higher-paying jobs. For example, as technology has been integrated into factories, the need for technicians and support staff to manage that technology has soared. And there continue to be many jobs, such as welding, that benefit from human skill.But today, we rely on a higher education system that looks down its nose at skilled trades. It tells our kids that if they grow up to work with their hands instead of a computer they're somehow less accomplished. We need a president with the courage to change this perception.I was glad last year when President Obama pointed out at an event in Wisconsin that manufacturing pays more than art history. But, predictably, the art history majors came after him; and, predictably, President Obama scrambled to apologize for offending them. He shouldn't have. I did not apologize  and never will  for saying in a recent debate that welders make more than philosophers. I got a lot of angry calls about it. It may have cost me the all-important philosopher vote, but that's a price I'm willing to pay!I promise you this: I will be the vocational education president. I will make skills training more widespread, more accessible, and more affordable. I'll expand apprenticeships so education can come out of the classroom and into the real world. I'll allow students to begin learning a trade as early as high school, so they can graduate ready to enter a good paying career without taking on mountains of student debt.For example, I'll help establish more programs like the one in Cleveland where high schoolers can work at GE's manufacturing plant to gain practical experience and mentoring. The graduation rate for these students is 95 percent, compared to just 60 percent for Cleveland public schools.We must equip today's workers to fill today's manufacturing jobs. But we also need to ensure new manufacturing jobs are created tomorrow, including at facilities like this one.To do so, the next economic change we have to embrace is the fact that Pat and the rest of our leaders in manufacturing don't just have to compete with each other, they now have to compete with the entire world. Such is the effect of globalization.Today, we have a tax code and a regulatory environment that puts ourmanufacturers at a significant global disadvantage. In Canada, the marginal effective tax rate for manufacturing firms is 25 percent lower than it is in America. It's 12 percent lower in China, 11 percent lower in the UK, and 14 percent lower in Mexico, and so on for the majority of countries. These nations are becoming more appealing to job creators while we're becoming less.Our approach to regulation is just as bad. Every year, small manufacturersin the United States spend an average of almost $35,000 per employee just to comply with government rules. That's $35,000 that could have gone toward a raise for that employee, or toward a new job, or toward research and development.Pat will tell you about how he spends months and has to hire lawyers simply to figure out how to implement a new regulation. And sometimes, he gets a year down the road and finds out that Washington changed its mind on how to implement it. Our bureaucrats are wasting the time and money of our manufacturers, often on the whims of environmental lobbyists. At the same time, other countries are deregulating.Let's be clear: The global economy is an opportunity, not a burden. It will drive us to be smarter, faster, and to sell our products to more people than ever before. But first we have to get Washington out of the way of the real drivers of our economic progress: our businesses and our workers.As president, I'll take the first step with comprehensive tax reform. I will lower our corporate tax rate from 35 percent to around 25 percent, and I'll level the playing field between large and small firms. I'll allow businesses to write off 100 percent of their capital expenditures, which will empower firms to invest in R&D; and job growth. And I'll create a territorial tax system, which almost every other developed economy already has, so that money earned overseas is not double-taxed when it's brought back home.I'll limit regulations, too. I'll do so by instituting a national regulatory budget, which will cap the amount regulations can cost our economy. Bureaucrats will no longer have free reign to impose whatever arbitrary rules they please. Checks and balances will be restored to over-eager agencies like the EPA.For years, the EPA has held us back from our energy potential. The shale oil and natural gas revolution is one of the best things to happen to American manufacturing in the last 100 years, and we'll remove the shackles Washington has placed on it when I am president.Finally, in order to revitalize American manufacturing in this century, we'll need to embrace the rise of new technologies, including robotics. For so many workers, automation is a source of insecurity and uncertainty, and I want to speak to that today.It's important to realize that we're not the first generation to confront the often-disruptive forward march of industrial technology  and just like generations before us, we will find that the positive impacts of these new innovations far outweigh the negative.When the power loom was invented during the industrial revolution, many feared it would eliminate all textile jobs. The truth, however, turned out to be the opposite. The loom increased production, and as production increased, so did demand, and as demand increased, so did the need for skilled laborers who could operate the machines and manage the factories. Jobs in the textile industry actually increased for 100 years.In the near future, as robots become increasingly capable and sophisticated, it is true that we will see more low-paying jobs replaced by machines. But that's only part of the story. We will also see the creation of higher-paying, higher-skilled jobs that only humans can perform.When they no longer need as many lower-paid workers, Americanmanufacturers will be able to reclaim certain tasks that had been passed to nations with low labor costs. And if America can succeed in building the best bots in the world, we will gain a significant global advantage. As these machines become more affordable, they will also help level the playing field between large and small firms.Embracing the rise of robotics is also important because of the new products our manufacturing sector is called to produce. In the 21st century, we don't want to be the country known for manufacturing toothbrushes and toys, we want to be known for manufacturing the rockets of SpaceX, the newest airplane engines, the next big thing in consumer electronics, and cutting edge machinery like what's manufactured in this facility. This will increasingly require the precision and affordability provided by advanced robotics.We need a president who will empower our innovators to design both the products of tomorrow and the machinery that will help us build those products; and we need a president who will empower our workforce to gain the skills needed to work in the manufacturing facilities of the future. I will be that president.Saying goodbye to the old economy is difficult, but it must be done before we can fully capture the promise of the new economy. And that promise is too grand to let slip away. In this century, we're going to make things again  and some of them are going to be things we can't even imagine today. By making them, we're also going to expand the hope of a better life to more people than ever before.Manufacturing will play a crucial part in the prosperity of this century, but that part will be different than it was fifty years ago. And that's okay. Because there is no one formula for achieving the American Dream. The routes our parents took to the middle class won't necessarily be the routes our people take today.65 percent of Americans now work at information jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago. And 25 years from now, jobs will be prevalent that don't exist today. It won't be our next president who creates these jobs, but it will be our next president who determines whether business leaders like Pat and so many others have the space they need to innovate, to grow, and to win the global economic competition that will define this century.Thank you."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 17, 2015",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Explains Why Ted Cruz Has Been Flip-Flopping on Immigration,"On The Kelly File last night, Marco talked about his views on immigration, and Senator Ted Cruz's inconsistency on the issue.Here's what Marco had to say:[Senator Cruz] clearly was a supporter of legalization and the amendment [to the comprehensive immigration bill allowing legalization], and he wanted the bill to pass. He said, I wanted immigration reform to pass. Basically, the argument he was making is we can pass immigration reform but we can't do citizenship. Let's just do legalization, and if we do that this bill has a chance of passing. He doesn't mention that in the speeches in Iowa. He obviously mentioned that at the time because that's what he wanted. And now of course, in this campaign, he is looking for a political advantage so he tries to obscure the lines on it.This isn't personal, Marco emphasized:I want to be clear, I like Ted personally very much. These are important differences, particularly on the defense stuff that we should talk about. On the issue of immigration, look, in 2013, I live in a state that is deeply impacted by immigration and I said I want to try and make a difference. Now, I know that Harry Reid controls the Senate, so let's do the best we can in the Senate. Hopefully the House can make it even better and let's see if we can make some progress. Because after 30 years this problem was only getting worse, not better. Now I realize that we are not going to be able to do anything on immigration until you bring illegal immigration under control.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 21, 2015",Press Release - Hillary Said We're 'Where We Need to Be' in the Fight against ISIS. Here's What Marco Rubio Had to Say about That,"At the Democratic debate on Saturday, Hillary Clinton said ""we are where we need to be"" in terms of fighting ISIS  even as the group expands its reach across the Middle East and inspires attacks in America.Here's what Marco had to say about that:It's one more example of how government, Washington, and particularly the Democratic party completely out of touch with reality and out of touch with the American people.The vast majority of Americans understand that this threat is not under control; in fact, it continues to grow in both scope and sophistication. She's talking about how we have a plan  how is that plan any different from the plan we had in place a month ago, or two months ago, when the president was claiming that ISIS was contained, and then a few days later they attacked Paris, and less than a month later . . . they had this terrorist attack in San Bernardino.So it's just another example of how out of touch they are, and how clueless they are, and quite frankly how dangerous their foreign policy has become for the national security of this country."

And guess what? Gary thinks the best candidate in the Presidential field is . . . Marco. Here's what he had to say:For me, Sen. Rubio is the ""Uber candidate."" Not only has his determination and passion for conservative principles led him to be a popular and effective senator and trending presidential candidate, but he is also the only Republican candidate on the stage who fully realizes our economy is always evolving and creating new opportunities.For Sen. Rubio, supporting disruptive innovators like Uber, Lyft and AirBnB is a win-win  these services create new jobs, allow average Americans to make money and lift our economy. Each year, more than 150,000 people come to Las Vegas for CES, to see the new job-creating innovations. Our trade show and our industry, indeed our nation's future, depend upon a free market welcoming innovation and allowing anyone a shot at the American Dream. Marco Rubio champions innovation and the American Dream.More than any other candidate  Republican or Democrat  Marco has laid out a clear vision for unleashing American economic growth in the 21st century."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 21, 2015",Press Release - Marco Rubio Was Asked about Ted Cruz's Inconsistent Views  Here's What He Had to Say,"December 21, 2015Marco was asked Sundaymorning on Face the Nation about Ted Cruz's unclear views on immigration.He pointed out that it's not just immigration where Senator Cruz has told voters one thing and then done another:There are multiple issues on which he's tried to do these sorts of things. For example, when the free trade agreement was up, he wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, he wrote it with Paul Ryan. And just three days later, he flipped on it, after I don't know why  he got some pressure on the fast track authority. He's done it on votes on farm issues. In fact, changed his vote on the floor of the Senate. So there is always some of that, because new facts are presented. But I think my concern is the voters: If you're going to attack someone on a policy issue, you need to be clear where you stand on the issue, and where you stood in the past. . . .I think when you spend your whole time telling people you are a clear talker and you say what you mean, and everyone else is a sellout, but you're the only purist, I think it is fair to say hold on a second. Here is where you have been in the past on some issues, and here is where you are now. The truth is everyone running on the Republican side supports strong, conservative positions. "
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 21, 2015",Press Release - This Texas Legislator Narrowed His Presidential Pick Down to Two. Then He Thought About Winning in November.,"Texas State Representative James Frank put a lot of thought into whom he wanted to endorse for President in 2016. Here's what he told his constituents:While I spend the vast majority of my time on state level issues, I have spent considerable time over the past four months trying to determine who to support for President. It would be much safer politically to stay out of this race (as there is a very good chance that I will make some people angry). That being said, I believe that this Presidential election is too important to spend it on the sidelines out of fear. . . .All of us should be paying attention for three reasons:Importance of the Presidency  we must have someone who understands, desires and works for a government that is both limited in its scope and as local as practical. Unfortunately, the President has significantly more influence on the rules, regulations and budget of the state than I ever would have imagined.Choose the right candidate and we win  if Republicans choose one of the qualified, electable candidates, we will win the election. Texas will play an important role in picking the Republican candidate while Texas is almost certain to elect a Republican in the general election, the PRIMARY is where we can actually have the biggest impact on this election. He had it down to two conservative senators:While there is an amazing amount of talent in the Republican primary field, my final choice of who to support for the Republican nomination came down to two very strong candidates: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. These two men are similar in many ways. Not only are they articulate and smart, but they are both first-term senators that have personal stories that are woven from the very fabric of America. In the end, though, Frank found it an easy choice. One candidate clearly has a better chance of taking the White House for conservatives in November.In my final analysis, I have chosen to support Marco Rubio as I believe he has a much stronger chance than Cruz of beating the Democratic nominee in the general election due to his high likeability and his location in the critical electoral state of Florida.Here's what he had to say about Marco's record:Marco Rubio's voting record is a good indicator that he will lead the country in a way that decreases the size and scope of government. In his time as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives he demonstrated his appreciation of the proper role of state government and federalism. I have no concerns about the job Rubio would do as President and I have no concerns that he would beat Hillary Clinton in a general election. He is young, charismatic, intelligent and has a compelling personal story. He is highly telegenic and has shown a knack for self-deprecation that comes in handy on the campaign trail. Frank, of Wichita Falls, is a small business owner who's helped bring over 100 new jobs to Texas.Representative Frank, welcome to Team Marco!"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 29, 2015",Press Release - These Members of the House Intelligence Committee Say the Latest Jeb Super PAC Ad Is Dishonest,"December 29, 2015The super PAC supporting Jeb Bush launched a dishonest ad this week attacking Marco for allegedly missing important congressional hearings. Two members of the House Intelligence Committee are backing up Marco: They say the Jeb ad is misleading and that Marco has been a strong leader on national security.Rep. Mike Pompeo from Kansas:I'm proud to stand with Marco  he will be an outstanding commander-in-chief. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a veteran, there is no doubt that Marco has shown great national security leadership in the Senate. The claims by Jeb Bush's Super PAC are misleading and reflect a deep misunderstanding of Marco's critically important record working to keep Americans safe. This is a great reminder of why I support Marco Rubio. He is the one conservative candidate looking toward the future and having consistently demonstrated effective leadership on these most important issues.Rep. Chris Stewart from Utah:As a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a former Air Force pilot, I'm proud to support Marco who understands more than any other candidate the threats facing our country, knows how we can defeat ISIS, and is ready to be commander-in-chief. It's disappointing that Jeb Bush's Super PAC decided to discard clear facts for political gain.

Find Out Why.,"December 30, 2015Yesterday in Iowa, Marco announced support for a Convention of States, to put new constitutional limits on the reach of the federal government and reduce power in Washington.The Convention of States is a less well-known way to amend the Constitution. Marco supports establishing a Convention of the States with the sole purpose of passing amendments to limit the power of the federal government: like implementing term limits, requiring a balanced budget, and sending power out of Washington, back to the states.The sheer scale of the overreach of the federal government demands a solution that's big enough for the problem.The Des Moines Register picked up on Marco's plan:""It is something we feel very positive about. I think it is the only way that you are ever going to get term limits, and the only way that you are ever going to get a balanced budget amendment,"" Rubio added.Asked if he had concerns about opening up the Constitution to a convention, Rubio remarked, ""I think you would have to limit the convention, and that is what they are proposing: a very limited convention on specific delineated issues that they would talk about  like term limits and a balanced budget amendment.""Author and radio host Mark Levin highlighted the effort:Rubio endorses Convention of States! Will the other GOP contenders support it as well? https://t.co/lQBnkPyBOU Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) December 30, 2015Conservative Senator Tom Coburn also took notice:Former GOP Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a supporter of the Convention of States Project, praised Rubio for his comments.""Marco Rubio knows that the answers to American's lack of confidence in Washington can only be fixed through an Article V Convention of States, restoring power to the states and the people by limiting the scope and power in Washington; placing term limits on politicians, forcing honest accounting and balanced budgets,"" Coburn said. ""He also knows that Washington will not fix itself.""On the campaign trail, Marco's going to keep talking up the Convention of the States, and other reforms to limit the size of the federal government and return power to the states and the people."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 30, 2015","Press Release - 'Radical Islamic Terror, A Lunatic in North Korea, and a Gangster in Moscow'","December 30, 2015This morning, the campaign released a new ad in New Hampshire and other early states. Marco outlines why it's more important than ever to restore American strength.Today, we face ever growing threats: radical Islamic terror, a lunatic in North Korea, a gangster in Moscow, and a president more respectful to the Ayatollah of Iran than the Prime Minister of Israel. Our allies don't trust us. Our enemies don't fear us. And the world doesn't know where America stands. On day one of my presidency that will change.I'm Marco Rubio. I approved of this message because the world is a safer place when America is the strongest country on earth.Marco has outlined plans to strengthen our military, defeat ISIS, and counter Russian aggression."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"December 30, 2015",Press Release - This Is the Story of Marco Rubio's Presidential Campaign,"December 30, 2015It all started in Miami. In more ways than one, really.On April 13, 2015, just over eight months ago, Marco Rubio launched his presidential campaign.The setting, a packed crowd at the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, was a beautiful place for Marco's rousing announcement speech. But it was fitting, too: The Freedom Tower was where thousands of Cuban refugees were welcomed to the United States in the 1960s. They were fleeing a country where Communism threatened to snuff out an entire country's God-given rights.The United States is a great country, Marco told the crowd  the greatest, still. But it wouldn't remain so unless the values that made America what it is, the ideas that made it a refuge for Cubans and so many other immigrants fleeing tyranny and poverty elsewhere, are preserved, he said.Marco was there that Monday to announce that he wasn't going to wait in line while the Washington establishment picked a Republican nominee. He wouldn't be seeking reelection to the U.S. Senate, where too often conservative proposals, the kind of ideas America needs to stay vibrant, had been blocked by ossified Washington thinking and a doctrinaire liberal president.What was the hurry? The stakes are simply too high, and Marco, like so many of the people joining him that afternoon in Miami, knew them personally.His parents, Mario and Oriales Rubio, were able live the American Dream. Marco had opportunities his parents had never even imagined  college, law school, the chance to lead his state's legislature, to serve in the U.S. Senate, and now to launch a candidacy for president.So the reason to hurry, in other words, is that the American Dream is slipping away  bad policies, overbearing government, and liberal ideology has gotten in the way of the path to prosperity and security that Marco's parents had paved for him.Marco at his announcement speech on April 13.Mario Rubio was a bartender; his son is a senator and a candidate for the most powerful office in the world. ""That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream,"" Marco told the audience in Miami.Keeping that dream alive, Marco said, means new ideas, not old ones. As it happened, Hillary Clinton had launched her campaign the day before Marco launched his  offering the perfect contrast.""Yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president, by promising to take us back to yesterday,"" he said. ""Yesterday is over  and we are never going back.""We Americans are proud of our history, but our country has always been about the future. Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. We can't do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them.""The goal was clear: Restoring the American Dream, forging a New American Century. The next step: Making it all happen.Lots of things have changed about presidential campaigns over the years  Marco was aiming to build a strong digital campaign, with supporters all across the country; he would be working with a media landscape radically transformed by innovation. Most of all, he'd be able to work with conservative grassroots supporters all across the country, many of whom had never been in politics before, who were inspired over the past few years to get involved.But some things have remained: Iowa and New Hampshire are where a presidential campaign really begins.Just four days after his speech in Miami, Marco was winging his way Manchester, New Hampshire, where he made a bunch of the traditional stops: door-to-door campaigning for a state representative, a meeting with the local newspaper's editorial board, and attending a house party hosted by some early supporters.But there was a sign this campaign was going to be a little different, too: Marco made sure to stop by the local community college, too, to meet with students and talk up his record on reforming higher education. That's just one area where, long before the campaign began, Marco already had a record of policy innovation and a set of conservative ideas meant to bring our country into a New American Century.Senator Marco Rubio at Manchester Community College in Manchester, N.H.Days later, it was off to Iowa, where he gathered a crowd of over 100 grassroots supporters in the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny, and later spoke to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition about how he'd get government out of the way of people who want to live out their faith and traditional values.As it happens, Ankeny is where the campaign later ended up opening its first Iowa organizing office. On hand to officially open the office in August was Rick Harrison, the Las Vegas native who is the star of the hit TV show Pawn Stars. (Harrison's said he feels Marco just ""gets it,"" especially when it comes to his plans to emphasize vocational education and blue-collar jobs.)The operation in Iowa has come a long way since: These days, he's rolling around Iowa in a custom bus, affectionately named the ""Marcomobile.""Marco's campaign started off in Iowa and New Hampshire, but it certainly hasn't stopped there: In addition to nationally important campaign events and policy speeches all across the country, Marco has put just as much emphasis on South Carolina and Nevada, too.The beginnings of Marco's race to the White House  a shock to the establishment, humbling odds, an ideas-driven campaign  may feel exciting and new to many Americans, but he'd been there before.Just turn the clock back to 2009: After the country had been pitched into a deep recession, and the White House had responded with big-government programs and more control over the economy, Marco was worried even more worried about the direction of his country. He'd had real success as leader of Florida's state house, but when a Senate seat opened up, the establishment began lining up behind Charlie Crist, who was set to run as a moderate Republican.Energized by the conservative movement that was growing across the country, Marco knew the time was right. Marco knew, as he wrote in his memoir, there were millions of other Americans just like him who were ""genuinely frightened by the country's direction and felt compelled to speak out in opposition,"" and, like him, weren't just mad at Republicans, but Democrats too. In May 2009, Marco decided to take the plunge, and entered the Florida Senate Race.But it wasn't an easy choice at all: Crist was expected to have an insurmountable fundraising advantage, and the full backing of the Florida GOP establishment. After Marco decided to get into the race, media reports assailing his fundraising numbers pushed him close to dropping out at times. The polls were no better: At times, he trailed by more than 30 points.You know the rest of the story, though: Florida voters saw through the slick character Crist was, and Marco pulled off an incredible political upset. That fall, as the New York Times had put it, ""the first Senator from the Tea Party.""Turn the clock back further, Marco had ascended to the Florida speakership by asking the people of Florida what their ideas to improve Florida were, with a promise to achieve these ideas while in leadership. He published his platform in a book, 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future, that he'd gathered from his fellow legislators and  more important  ordinary Floridians he met as he traveled the state. Dozens of them eventually became law.This time around, it's not just that Marco once again leapt into the fray when the establishment wanted him to hold back. Like his speakership campaign, It's been an ideas-driven campaign, this time based on a comprehensive set of policy ideas for the 21st Century Marco laid out in American Dreams, the book he released before announcing his run. National Review said it was evidence that Marco would be ""the GOP's long-awaited candidate of ideas."" But, as Marco has emphasized on the campaign train, you don't have to rely just on his ideas  he already has some wins to show for it.'Marco Rubio Has Killed ObamaCare.""So read an October headline in The American Thinker. Similar sentiments followed from other outlets, with conservative leaders praising Marco for dealing what could be a mortal blow to the president's failed health care law. Of course, most Americans know that ObamaCare is, for now, still with us  so what was it that, just as candidates were comparing their records on fighting for conservative priorities, Marco had managed to accomplish?Months into the campaign, Marco certainly had been busy on the trail. But it didn't get get in the way of his growing record of accomplishments. He's had bills passed that increase sanctions on human rights violators, encourage countries around the world to better respect the rights of women and girls (especially with regard to the horror of sex-selective abortion), and help block Hezbollah's financing.His most important victory has come in the most important battle conservatives have right now: dismantling ObamaCare.The story starts back in 2013, as the law was ramping up toward full implementation. As the disastrous rollout of the federal exchange that fall made clear, the Obama Administration had put together a deeply flawed, unworkable law. But Republicans needed a realistic way, without control of the White House, to stop it.Marco and his staff soon spotted a vulnerability in the law: With its new taxes and regulations causing so much disruption to America's health system, insurance companies had to be coaxed into the law with various promises. One of them, called ""risk corridors"": Insurers that lost over a certain amount of money during the law's first few years would be compensated for those losses, paid for by companies making more than a certain amount of profit on the law.But Marco realized what the Obama Administration was going to do when the law inevitably proved a disaster In November 2013, just as ObamaCare was being rolled out, he warned that insurers would lose more than expected, and that President Obama would try to give them a ""bailout"" with taxpayer money.So, over the next two years, Marco raised awareness about this possibility and fought to ensure that Republicans would include it in the government funding bills  no easy task, because the insurance industry was so adamant on securing a bailout and the Obama Administration was insisting it wouldn't cost taxpayers anything. ""Senator Rubio raised the alarm even while the Congressional Budget Office was saying that the program would make the federal government money,"" Heritage Foundation health expert Paul Winfree said recently. ""His message was important in the effort to block the transfer of money to the risk corridor program.""Since ObamaCare has turned out worse than the official projections, Marco's efforts have already saved taxpayers $2.5 billion. With funding of the bailout blocked for 2016, too, savings will continue to stack up. The best news is, though, that this may be a deadly blow to the Obama Administration's efforts to keep ObamaCare alive: Insurers are considering leaving the ObamaCare marketplace because they simply can't make money without taxpayer backing. As the New York Post put it, Marco may have already ""slit the throat"" of ObamaCare. The victory was so important that some of Rubio's opponents have attempted to question whether he really played such an important role. The facts show that he did.As it happens, it's not just ObamaCare where Marco's knack for understanding complicated issues has served him well.That was thrown into sharp relief starting in August, when the Republican primary debates began  a crucial opportunity for Marco to share the message that he'd already seen catching on in the early states, and to demonstrate his grasp of the problems that were worrying Americans.The first chance was when the campaign team headed to Cleveland, on August 6. Fox News's inaugural debate of the cycle was the most-watched non-sports event in cable history, drawing 23 million viewers. Marco was well-prepared to put every minute to use.Marco getting prepared behind the scenes at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.Asked right off the bat in Cleveland whether he had the experience to be president, Marco put the whole race in perspective:I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she  how is she gonna lecture me  how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.There's been no stopping Marco since: At each debate, he's triumphed, beating back attacks from his opponents and the media on issues from his Senate record to his personal finances. (Speaking of parallels to the Charlie Crist race  the personal attacks on Marco were no surprise this time.)As the situation in the Middle East has descended further into chaos and the Islamic State has shown its ability not only to hold , foreign affairs has become an unexpectedly crucial issue in this campaign. That has been a development well-suited to Marco, who had laid out a foreign-policy doctrine over the summer and has a long record of fighting back against the Obama Administration over their weakness abroad.It was never more clear than when Marco did something that, far as we know, is unprecedented in presidential debates: He exactly predicted the next aggressive move America would see from one of its enemies  Vladimir Putin's Russia  and was proven right within weeks.""Here's what you're going to see in the next few weeks,"" Marco said at the September 16 debate at the Reagan Library. ""The Russians will begin to fly combat missions in that region  not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.""Sure enough, two weeks later to the day, news reports confirmed that Russian jets had begun flying missions in Syria, targeting primarily not ISIS but anti-Assad rebels. Those strikes continue to this day  rousing no significant response from the Obama Administration.Some of the most important moments of the campaign, though, have happened at campaign events that don't quite draw cable news coverage. A few of the most moving have been when Marco's been asked on the trail about his faith  something many candidates wear on their sleeves, but he isn't always the most forthcoming about.At least, that is, until someone asks  and then what flows forth has been truly inspirational, to the audiences who've heard it in person, and to the voters who've seen the conversations caught on video.One evening in New Hampshire, Marco was asked about how religion influences his political life, and delivered an extended, detailed explanation of how his faith has led him to support a free-market system and oppose the kind of safety net that can lull people into dependency.  I don't think free enterprise works without a safety net, to help catch people that are having a tough time, Marco said. ""But I also know that the safety net cannot be a way of life, cannot become a lifestyle, and in fact it's become that for many people. And my faith also teaches me that that's not good for the soul, it's not good for people, it's not good for their aspirations for the future.""He's gone even deeper at times. One of the most pressing questions that confront Christians, and people of all faiths, is the problem of evil  why does God allow so much suffering in our world?That was the question Marco was asked at a campaign event in Iowa not long after the horrific terror  attacks in Paris.""We are biblically ordered not to be afraid,"" he told the pastors. ""You know why? Because God is telling us no matter what happens it it's part of my plan, I will give you the strength to endure it whether you like it or not.""If we looked to God more often, in fact, Marco pointed out, we'd realize that what he has to give us isn't the solution to every problem  big or small. ""If we did take more time to do that, to stop, and ask for that guidance,"" he said, we'd realize ""you're not going to get the answer that you want. That's not what we pray for  we pray for peace, and we're ordered to have peace.""The humble response  Marco was frank about his occasional feelings of doubt  quickly went viral, drawing praise from conservative faith leaders, Evangelicals, Catholics, and more. Amidst a hectic campaign, it was clear that Marco, and those on hand, were glad to step back and reflect on the bigger questions.Life on the campaign trail isn't always either high-pressure or pensive, though  occasionally it's just fun. Whether it's bumper cars at the Iowa State Fair or tossing the football around (supposedly he's been working on that aim), Marco has every once in awhile found some time to unwind.Sometimes that's family time: He did his best this fall to make it home to Miami for his sons' football practices and games.Other times, the campaign team catches him at a casual moment, and just starts tossing questions at him. Then there's his intensive regimen of debate preparation. There's hours of policy work, of course, but Marco has also paid special attention to the lay of the land  what are the various players up to?It hasn't been all fun and games on camera.  He's been on the trail as much as he can, with voters in the early states and elsewhere, but getting Marco on the airwaves is crucial to getting his message out and inspiring grassroots volunteers to get involved.The team has recorded a number of ads so far that get across the core themes of Marco's campaign. One of them, naturally, focuses on his dad  the man who taught him the meaning of the American Dream not just through words, but through deeds.The ideas that allowed Marco's dad to work for the opportunities he has today, Marco believes, are under threat. That's the point he made in another ad, laying out the stakes of this election. It's understandable that many Americans don't recognize their country anymore, Marco says  that's what happens when you turn away from the ideals that made us great, and scorn the traditional values that keep our families strong. Returning to those values and those ideals  with solutions that recognize the problems American families are facing in the 21st Century  is exactly what Marco wants to make this election about. So where does this all put Marco today? Right where he wants to be. With the right conservative ideas, his optimistic message, and strong grassroots support, the momentum building behind Marco every day is easily visible. Just ask Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina  the latest high-profile rising conservative leader to get behind the campaign.The campaign team knows this  not least the veterans of the 2010 race, who know what it's like to be on an underdog team that wants to shake things up. Marco is, once again, the man for the moment, the candidate with the vision to restore America's promise, and the optimism to win Americans over to his side. Marco and the campaign leave behind a 2015 that has gone even better than they could have expected  and 2016 looks likely to provide everything they want it to be, too."

Trey Gowdy, who hit the trail with Marco in Iowa this week, was on FOX & Friends this morning to discuss why Marco earned his vote.With Marco's growing momentum, Rep. Gowdy said it was an ""easy decision"":I also have been a great admirer of Senator Rubio's ability to express the message of conservatism in a hopeful, aspirational, persuasive way. I am not a terribly hopeful or optimistic person  I'm a former prosecutor, I'm actually cynical. So, I greatly admire the [South Carolina Senator] Tim Scott's of the world, and frankly Ronald Reagan and Marco Rubio who can communicate our message in an aspirational, hopeful way. That to me is persuasive, so when you like someone personally, you agree with them on the issues, and you think they're a really persuasive messenger for our movement, for our party, it made it kind of an easy decision for me.Rep. Gowdy joins a rapidly growing team of next generation conservative leaders backing Marco."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 1, 2016","Press Release - Wondering What Marco Rubio's Record Is on Libya, Another Example of Hillary Clinton's Failed Leadership? Read Up Here","There is no question that Libya, after the Arab Spring uprising of 2011, is today a failed state and a haven for Islamic extremism.What you may not know, though, is that Marco Rubio warned that Libya would suffer such a fate when the Obama Administration decided to belatedly ""lead from behind"" in toppling the Qaddafi regime, rather than taking a leading role in helping the Libyan people.When the Libyan people rose up against Moammar Qaddafi, a brutal dictator with a history of supporting terrorism against the U.S. and Israel and horrific abuses against his own countrymen, the country was dissolving into civil war.The only question was whether the West  the U.S. and its NATO allies  would be there to protect the Libyan people by ending the violence quickly, fight Islamic extremism, and support the Libyans' efforts to build a new stable, inclusive government.For months, the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton dithered  Libya, in fact, is the conflict where they boasted they were ""leading from behind.""Here's what Marco toldThe Weekly Standard in March 2011, when the Obama Administration was slowly coming to back our European allies' plans for intervention:The administration is complicating matters with phony multilateralism, [Marco said.] ""This idea that we're turning this over to NATO is quite frankly humorous. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad because we are NATO. And that needs to be confronted and that needs to be handled.In June, Marco wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Congress needed to strengthen President Obama's efforts in Libya  not tie his hands as some Republicans wanted, which would have prolonged the conflict even longer and led to more violence and anarchy and undermined America's standing in the region with our NATO and Arab partners and allowed our enemies to believe that an American President's word was meaningless.But once Qaddafi was toppled that autumn, President Obama and Hillary Clinton failed to provide the support that was needed to help the Libyan people rebuild their country. That challenge was all the greater because their reluctance to back the Libyan people prolonged the conflict. Here's what Marco told Fox News in October, after Qaddafi was killed:A lot of infrastructure has been destroyed in Libya that has to all be rebuilt; 30 some odd militias have now formed. It's going to be a bear to get them to disarm. You have a lot of young men who instead of entering the workforce and rebuilding the country are now young men that need medical rehab, prosthetics because they have been injured in war. The cost of rebuilding the country has gotten exponentially high. If the United States had just gotten engaged a little bit earlier and a little bit more aggressively, what happened last week would have happened months ago and it would have cost a lot less money, there would have been a lot less uncertainty. Here is what else happened over the last eight months: Thousands of shoulder-fired rockets have gone missing, and now these rockets are out there capable of shooting down an airplane and we don't know where they're. . . . If the rebels had had a no-fly zone when they asked for it, this thing would have been over in a week. . . .NATO has limited capabilities. The British and the French, they worked very hard; they did a very good job. But they don't have the weaponry we have. If we had just stayed in that effort a little bit longer, this thing would have ended sooner as well.That same month,following a visit toLibya, Marco underscored the need for the United States to maintain its commitment to aiding a post-GaddafiLibya:We can also helpLibyalay the foundation for sustainable security. This requires safeguarding the immense stockpiles of weapons and dangerous materials that exist across the country. It also requires bringingLibya's many militias under the TNC's civilian authority, and working toward their demobilization, disarmament and reintegration intoLibyansociety. We and our allies should encourage this peaceful process as much as we can, and oppose external efforts to pick winners who would advance factional or ideological interests through force... American support is also important forLibya's democratic transition. The TNC wants to cooperate with the U.S., especially with our nongovernmental organizations, in the monitoring of national elections (which could be held soon), the drafting of a constitution, and the development of civil society.As the Benghazi Commission and other investigations have shown, despite the chaos the Obama/Clinton intervention left behind, Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration essentially abandoned Libya. They did little to help the nascent moderate Libyan government dissolve the militias and build cohesive security forces. They ignored the growing chaos in Libya, so much so that repeated threats to our personnel in the country, including in Benghazi, went unheeded.The results were the attacks on our facilities on September 11, 2012, which left four Americans dead and eventually forced U.S. personnel to leave the country entirely. As Marco pointed out in October 2015 in a Breitbart piece, the Obama Administration's desire to have a ""light footprint"" is what's allowed terrorists to flourish in Libya  including the ones who killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi.As the Libyan government was left on its own, so too were our personnel in Libya.Ambassador Stevens and his team requested additional security personnel from State Department headquarters on multiple occasions, only to have the requests denied. Clinton now claims that these decisions were made by her subordinates, but given her role in crafting the administration's policy toward Libya, she should have been more engaged, both before and in the middle of the worst attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in decades.This disengagement from a major crisis facing her Department is symptomatic of her broader approach to her role as Secretary of State. Indeed, she really has no major accomplishment to point to from her four years as Secretary of State and the issues on which she engaged the most often had the most disastrous results for U.S. foreign policy.Now, as Marco has repeatedly warned, Libya is in such chaos that it is now the premier operating area for ISIS outside of Syria and Iraq.When Qaddafi, an anti-American dictator who had the blood of Americans and Israelis on his hands, was falling, it was a no-brainer for the United States to help the Libyan people take him down. But then President Obama and Hillary Clinton squandered the opportunity that presented. Reluctant to lead, they were slow to provide American help, and then failed to continue the support after Qaddafi's fall. The costs of restoring Libya to stability now will be much, much greater than they would have been if America had offered more than the kind of half-hearted, politically minded intervention that has characterized the Obama-Clinton foreign policy."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 2, 2016",Press Release - Iowa Voters are Comparing This Presidential Candidate to Ronald Reagan,"January 2, 2016Republican voters remember Ronald Reagan so fondly because he ran optimistic, winning campaigns that focused on forward-thinking ideas.One Iowa caucus goer thinks we have a candidate who can pick up Reagan's legacy: Marco Rubio.Here's what he had to say:Senator, I just want to comment on the commercials that have been running on your behalf that I have been watching on television. I want to thank you for them. They are positive, and they are expressing an American vision, and a New American Century, and I think that's something that's sorely needed to be states. I haven't heard anyone speak like that who is running for President since Ronald Reagan in 1980, and I want to thank you for that.It's not just Iowa voters who see the resemblance  when he announced his support for Marco, Trey Gowdy said he sees Marco as a new Reagan, too.Marco wrapped up a two-day bus tour in Iowa last week, making his case for ideas that will address the concerns Americans have in the 21st Century."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 4, 2016","Press Release - In New Hampshire, Marco Rubio Is Keeping the Heat on President Obama's Failed Foreign Policy","Today in Hooksett, New Hampshire, Marco delivered a major foreign policy address  laying out President Obama and Hillary Clinton's failures abroad and how he's the best qualified candidate to fix them.Eight years ago today, he noted, was a key point in President Obama's ascendance to the presidency, where he's been a danger to America and the world order:Though the media isn't covering it, today is actually the anniversary of a historic moment in global affairs.Eight years ago today  January 4th 2008  was the first day many people around the world heard the name Barack Obama. They awoke to the news that a little-known Senator from Illinois had won the Iowa caucuses the night before, and that a political frenzy was sweeping the United States. As that year went on, many around the world who resented America's influence found a lot to like about this man.There have always been voices in our country who say America's not that different, that every country thinks they're special  voices who question our role abroad, who think of America as a bully rather than as a leader. But in 2008, for the first time ever, one of these voices was elected president.""America is in far greater danger than it was 8 years ago,"" Rubio says pic.twitter.com/ks2oUG2Ayj Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) January 4, 2016After eight years of dangerous weakness, what can we do? Elect a president who will restore strength and clarity to American foreign policy:When you vote for me, you know exactly what you'll get. You'll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need. You'll get a reversal of the defense cuts that Obama and Harry Reid have forced on our military. You'll get a leader who upholds the promise we make to our men and women in uniform that we will never send them into a fair fight, but will always equip them with the upper hand.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 4, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio's Address on National Security in the 21st Century,"January 4, 2016As prepared for delivery in Hooksett, New Hampshire:Thank you all for being here. Though the media isn't covering it, today is actually the anniversary of a historic moment in global affairs.Eight years ago today  January 4th 2008  was the first day many people around the world heard the name Barack Obama. They awoke to the news that a little-known Senator from Illinois had won the Iowa caucuses the night before, and that a political frenzy was sweeping the United States. As that year went on, many around the world who resented America's influence found a lot to like about this man.There have always been voices in our country who say America's not that different, that every country thinks they're special  voices who question our role abroad, who think of America as a bully rather than as a leader. But in 2008, for the first time ever, one of these voices was elected president.A man was elected who condemned America for having ""arrogance"" and the audacity to ""dictate our terms"" to other nations. A man who apologized for America and bowed pitifully to foreign leaders. A man willing to abandon our allies, make concessions to our enemies, and worst of all, to make historic, devastating cuts to our military and intelligence capabilities.For a while, many thought all of this was the result of naivety. But it wasn't. It's now abundantly clear: Barack Obama has deliberately weakened America. He has made an intentional effort to humble us back to size. As if to say: We no longer need to be so powerful because our power has done more harm than good. From the beginning, elites around the world rejoiced at this. The Nobel Peace Prize was thrown at his feet. But happiest of all have been America's enemies. Because when America steps back, it gives darker forces the space they need to rise. And rise they have.Let's take a quick tour of Obama's world today.While Washington continues to weaken our military, China is undergoing the most rapid peacetime military expansion in the history of mankind. It is methodically taking over the South China Sea, one of the most valuable shipping lanes on earth. It has carried out massive cyber-attacks against the United States. It is testing missiles that can obliterate American satellites in space. It's developed a rocket that can destroy a U.S. aircraft carrier. Meanwhile, North Korea is in the grip of a lunatic. There's no other way to describe him. He expands his military while his country starves. He is growing his nuclear arsenal, and building missiles capable of reaching the west coast of the United States.To the north, Russia is undergoing its largest military buildup since the Cold War. It is controlled by Vladimir Putin, a gangster determined to redraw the maps of Europe. He has invaded his neighbors. He is aiding Assad in Syria. Obama is standing idly by while Putin is hurtling toward a Second Cold War.Iran, meanwhile, is governed by a radical Shia cleric who's about to receive tens of billions of dollars of sanctions relief from our president  tens of billions of dollars that will be used to sponsor anti-American, anti-Israeli terrorism and to develop long range missiles that can be used to launch nuclear weapons.And then of course there's ISIS, which is forcing its way across the borders of the Middle East, expanding beyond Syria and Iraq, now into Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan and even nuclear-capable Pakistan. It's threatening to advance into Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and has launched attacks into the Sinai, Beirut and as we saw in Paris, into the heart of Europe. It is now recruiting attackers and inspiring mass violence in the United States. This is just a sampling of the threats Barack Obama will leave to our next president.America is in far greater danger today than it was eight years ago. Our president thought he could make America like Luxembourg or Switzerland. But he can't. We are the United States of America  the highest-profile, most important, most powerful country in the world. And while we may ignore problems that exist far away, those problems do not ignore us. In the 21st century, there is no such thing as a remote problem. What happens in Beijing or Moscow or Tehran is our business. Our economy and our lives are directly impacted by global events. Foreign policy is now an important part of domestic policy. Yet President Obama willfully ignores this. Instead of shaping world events, he is shaped by them. Instead of a foreign policy based on strategy, his is based on politics. We saw this clearly with his despicable speech after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. When America needed a bold plan of action from our Commander-in-Chief, we instead got a lecture on love, tolerance, and gun control designed to please the talking heads at MSNBC.The result of all of this is that people are afraid. And they have every right to be. To make matters worse, candidates for president in both parties cling to the same plan of weakness and retreat. On one side of this race we have, of all people, Obama's former Secretary of State. The very person who stood by while the conflict in Syria became the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation, who pushed the ""reset"" button with Russia even as Putin assaulted the sovereignty of his neighbors, and who resorted to half-measures in Libya instead of doing what it would take to prevent terrorists from taking hold  terrorists who ultimately took the lives of four Americans in Benghazi.Not only is Hillary Clinton incompetent, she's also a liar. While she was leading the public and the families of the fallen to believe the attack in Benghazi happened because of a YouTube video, we now know she was admitting in private emails that it was the result of terrorism. She lied to our faces. No one in the mainstream media has the courage to call her out for it. If I am our nominee, voters will be reminded of it time and time again.On the other side of this election is the party of Reagan, the party of strong national defense and moral clarity, yet we have Republican candidates who propose that rulers like Assad and Putin should be partners of the United States, and who have voted with Barack Obama and Harry Reid rather than with our men and women in uniform. We have isolationist candidates who are apparently more passionate about weakening our military and intelligence capabilities than about destroying our enemies. They talk tough, yet they would strip us of the ability to keep our people safe.Words and political stunts cannot ensure our security. ISIS cannot be filibustered. While some claim they would destroy ISIS, that they would make the sands of the Middle East ""glow in the dark,"" my question is: with what? Because they certainly can't do it with the oldest and smallest Air Force in the history of this country, or with the smallest Army we've had since World War II, or with the smallest and oldest Navy we've had since 1915. Yet these are what we will have thanks to the cuts these candidates have supported and even tried to deepen.We need a Commander-in-Chief with a record of leadership and judgment. Of all the candidates running in either party, only I have that record. In early 2011, when the people of Libya were rebelling against Muammar Gaddafi, and it was extremely unpopular to say we should get involved militarily, I was one of the few voices to argue that if America did not get involved decisively and responsibly, a vacuum would open that radical jihadists would rush to fill. And that's exactly what's happened in Libya. It's also happened in Syria, where I argued from the beginning that we needed to do more than what our president was proposing. Now the results of his approach are plain to see.And while ISIS was rising, and many in Washington were hesitating, hoping the problem would magically disappear, I went down to the Senate floor and said, quote, ""If we do not confront and defeat ISIL now, we will have to do so later, and it will take a lot longer, it will be much costlier and even more painful."" That has also proven true.I am also the only candidate to have laid out a detailed strategy to roll back our president's failures  a strategy to rebuild our military, revitalize our alliances, defeat ISIS, and restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it. I've offered numerous detailed plans on every major challenge we face, because this is a race for the presidency of the United States. The job is not described in the Constitution as ""entertainer in chief"" or ""commentator in chief"" or even, frankly, ""economist in chief."" It is described as Commander in Chief. If you can't be bothered to offer specifics on how you will perform that job, then you don't deserve that job. When you vote for me, you know exactly what you'll get. You'll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need. You'll get a reversal of the defense cuts that Obama and Harry Reid have forced on our military. You'll get a leader who upholds the promise we make to our men and women in uniform that we will never send them into a fair fight, but will always equip them with the upper hand. Anyone who supports Obama's disastrous defense cuts cannot make that promise.And I will realize that American personnel are in harm's way every day  that no matter where we place them, they must be adequately protected, so what happened in Benghazi will never happen again, so what happened in Chattanooga will never happen again, so a young American somewhere in Afghanistan, or tonight in Iraq, or serving in an embassy somewhere in the world, will not be vulnerable to attack.And by the way, it's not just American personnel serving abroad who are in danger. It's also our people here at home. And that's why it's more important today than ever to protect our people's right to protect themselves. President Obama's executive actions limiting gun rights will restrict our law-abiding citizens, not the criminals or terrorists who target them. In fact, the president has not even attempted to point to a single mass shooting these actions would have prevented, because there isn't one. This president needs to stop focusing on what he's constitutionally forbidden to do, which is interfering with our Second Amendment rights, and he needs to start focusing on what he's constitutionally required to do, which is protecting our people as Commander in Chief.There is another duty that comes along with being Commander In Chief that this president has forsaken. He has broken the promise we make to our veterans: that when they return home, we're going to care for them as they cared for us. When I am president, we will have a VA system that works for our veterans rather than our bureaucrats. Every candidate supports our veterans, but I am the only one who has brought accountability to the VA. Last year I passed a law saying if managers at the VA are not doing their jobs, they can be fired.Here's something else I will do: I will not only restore the intelligence programs Obama and Congress have destroyed, I will strengthen them. Because ISIS does not use carrier pigeons to communicate. They use sophisticated encryption and carefully secured networks. It was already difficult to infiltrate them, now it is even harder. If ISIS had lobbyists in Washington, they would have spent millions to support the anti-Intelligence law that was just passed with the help of some Republicans now running for president.When I am president, we are not going to violate the civil liberties of Americans, but we are going to capture as many terrorists as possible. And when we catch foreign terrorists abroad, we're not going to take them to court or read them their Miranda rights. Unlike some candidates, I don't think foreign terrorists captured abroad should get any rights under our Constitution or in our courts. America cannot fight terrorism from a courtroom. We cannot prosecute ISIS out of existence.When I am president, foreign terrorists caught overseas will receive a one-way ticket to Guantanamo where we will interrogate them and gather as much information as we can to prevent future plots. And if you're an American who has committed the ultimate act of betrayal against our country, I will have no qualms about treating you like the enemy combatant you are if you have actionable information and refuse to cooperate.Our next president needs to be someone prepared on day one to execute his duty  someone with the judgment and the vision to lead this country back. I will be that president. I will be a president who doesn't just believe America is the greatest country in the world; I will be a president who acts like it. I will take the global stage and say, ""I know what the last eight years have been like, but America is back. We once again have a president who understands our role in the world."" That role is not to do everything or solve every problem. But that role is to do absolutely everything required to keep this country safe, and it is to lead and be an example to an afflicted world. We are the only nation capable of bringing others together to confront global challenges, and when I am president, we will do so.Eight years ago today, our nation and our world took a turn for the worse. But we are not a weak country, we just have a weak president. And starting in a few weeks, we can take a turn back toward strength, toward greatness, toward opportunity and prosperity for all. New Hampshire plays an enormous role in that, so today I'm asking for your vote.The time to act is now. We cannot afford to elect Hillary Clinton, because America cannot afford another four years like the last eight. And we cannot settle for just any Republican, because this election is not a choice between two parties, it is a generational choice on our identity as a nation and as a people.I am running for president because while America doesn't owe me anything, I have a debt to America I will never fully repay. America changed the very history of my family. All of us have benefited from the extraordinary story of America  from its greatness around the world and its opportunities here at home, from the safety our veterans and troops have provided, and from America's tradition of strength that has existed across generations.With all my heart, I want my kids and yours to grow up and inherit an America equally as safe, equally as strong, equally as great as the America that changed my parents' lives, as the America that changed the world. I believe we owe that to our children. For the greatest nation on earth is what we inherited. And that is what we must pass on, and that is what we will pass on, if I can earn your support and your vote."

Washington's pattern of borrowing and spending its way out of problems has failed to expand opportunity for working families, preventing many parents from providing their children with a better future as Marco's parents did for him. Marco is committed to expanding jobs and opportunity for all Americans, and he has successfully chipped away at Obamacare and consistently fought back against burdensome regulations that are crippling businesses from hiring more workers and increasing wages. Under Marco's leadership, all American families will know that their best days lie ahead.Chris himself has a decorated career of fighting for conservative, pro-growth policies as a former congressman from Indiana.The Club backed Marco's insurgent candidacy against party elites in 2009, and Marco earned his support this time around by living up to the principles on which he campaigned.Rubio bags the endorsement of Club for Growth's former president, Chris Chocola.

She does not want to run against me. She knows that if I am the nominee we are going to beat her. She doesn't want to run against me, but I can't wait to run against her. She is a failed Secretary of State. She was a disastrous Secretary of State. All of the foreign policy issues we've faced around the world happened under her watch. And by the way, she is disqualified from being Commander in Chief because she recklessly and irresponsibly used her email server, she recklessly and irresponsibly lied about Benghazi. She told the families of those four brave Americans. ""Oh this was just a spontaneous uprising because of a youtube video."" And then she was telling her family members and foreign leaders and others that this was a planned terrorist attack. Someone who does that can never be Commander in Chief or President of the United States.There's a reason why the New York Times said that a Marco vs. Hillary match-up is a ""scary thought"" for Democratic elites.No one is better prepared to highlight Hillary Clinton's failures and outline a stronger, more forward-thinking vision for America than Marco."

If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Our enemies around the world are taking advantage of Obama's weakness. We need new leadership that will stand up to people like Kim Jong-un and ensure our country has the capabilities necessary to keep America safe.North Korea is one of the topics Marco addresses in a recent ad, too:"

Here's what he had to say in Iowa today:But what would he do to reverse this? Good question  that's what one Iowa voter asked. Here's his answer.1. Put North Korea back on the State Sponsors of Terror list.2. Ratchet up sanctions on the wealthy and corrupt North Korean regime.3. Rebuild our military alliances in the Pacific, especially by restoring our Navy's strength.4. Recommit to missile defense, because North Korea already has ballistic missiles capable of hitting us at home.Replacing the weak Obama-Clinton foreign policy with one of strength isn't not just about rhetoric.Marco knows better than any of his opponents the steps we need to take and what is required to keep Americans safe."

Barack Obama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment, a pertinent protection our Constitution recognizes and defends for us. He is looking for anyway possible to undermine it. He has been doing this forever. Now this executive order is just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families. This is going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes, because criminals don't buy guns that way. They buy from the black market.The President's refusal to admit this is nothing new, Marco said:It is part of a broader narrative that this president is obsessed with undermining the Constitution in general, but the Second Amendment in particular. He is obsessed with undermining it and he will do nothing, not this executive order or even the things he stands for related to this issue will do nothing to prevent gun violence and gun crimes in America, because criminals do not follow the law.Marco has already pledged to reverse Obama's executive orders targeting gun rights on day one as President."

Hillary Clinton is the architect of leading from behind. And that's what's led to this mess. You know, first of all, we have a president who believes that America is an arrogant, global power that needs to be cut down to size. That's how you get a foreign policy where we betray our allies and we cut deals with our enemies and we weaken the U.S. military, and the president apologizes, especially in the Middle East, for the United States of America, at least on ten separate occasions. So that's where you get a Saudi Arabia, which is a military ally of the United States, feeling vulnerable. Because we cut a deal with Iran that is their Shia enemy and their mortal enemy, really, in many cases, in regards to this. You have the U.S. leading from behind, getting out of Iraq too early, leaving a space for ISIS to fill in. Same thing now happening in Afghanistan. And Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State over much of these decisions  when these decisions were being made. Both she and President Obama are a complete and total disaster on their foreign policy.There's a reason why Hillary Clinton is afraid of running against Marco: Hillary Clinton leads from behind. Marco Rubio will lead, period."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 9, 2016",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio Lays Out Detailed Plan to Stand Up to the Lunatic in North Korea,"Marco has been warning throughout the presidential campaign that North Korea is a rogue state run by a lunatic with a growing number of nuclear weapons. The Kim regime's January 2016 nuclear test was just the latest reminder of its aggressive, dangerous ambitions. Meanwhile, its government ranks as possibly the world's worst human rights abuser  jailing, torturing, and killing its people with abandon.President Obama and Hillary Clinton have stood idly by while Kim Jong-un has tortured his people and threatened his neighbors and the United States. When they have engaged on North Korea, they have only offered concession after concession in the hopes of cutting an Iran-style deal that would only empower the regime. Years of this behavior has allowed North Korea to test multiple nuclear weapons and build ballistic-missile technology capable of hitting the United States. Moreover, North Korea is more of a force for instability in the region, a crucial one with a number of close U.S. allies, than ever before.This failure must be replaced with a policy of strength and clarity: Stop the giveaways, ratchet up the pressure on North Korea's leaders and their Chinese supporters, back up our allies in the region, restore critical funding to our missile defense programs, and promote human rights and access to outside information within North Korea.As President, Marco will:Counter North Korean Aggression End the policy of rewarding North Korean provocations and nuclear blackmail with new rounds of concessions; Work with allies to disrupt North Korean nuclear and missile proliferation by interdicting ships or aircraft suspected of carrying material related to North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs; Impose crushing new sanctions on the North Korean regime, including freezing the overseas assets of the North Korean leadership, sanctioning international entities and individuals that continue to do business with the regime, and disrupting illegal sources of income, from drug smuggling to counterfeiting and illicit arms sales; Pressure China to stop propping up the Kim family by demonstrating to Beijing that continuing to do so will result in greater U.S. and allied presence around the peninsula; Deter North Korean hacking and cyberattacks against American companies and the government.Restore North Korea to the State Sponsor of Terrorism List  Unless it ceases supporting state sponsors of terror like Iran and Syria, includingthrough such entities as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, North Korea would be re-designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism.Bolster Deterrence Rebuild our nuclear deterrent and strengthen U.S. missile defenses and offensive capabilities in the region by coordinating with our allies to deploy the THAAD system to South Korea; Reestablish missile defense, especially homeland missile defense, as a national priority by fielding more interceptors, providing additional radar, and leveraging new technologies to intercept the most sophisticated missile threats; Enhance cooperation with and among regional allies, such as South Korea and Japan.Promote Human Rights and Democracy  Provide support to North Koreans by helping them gain access to the outside world, bolstering counter-information efforts, and sanctioning North Korea for its brazen human rights violations; Declassify information about North Korea's apparatus of repression and highlight the specific North Korean leaders involved in human rights abuses; Ensure that human rights no longer take a backseat to concerns about North Korea's nuclear program and militarism.Marco has Taken Time off the Campaign Trail to Push for New Sanctions on North Korea: Read More HereOn VideoOp-Eds and SpeechesMarco Shines a Spotlight on North Korea's Horrors(National Review, April 14, 2014)"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 11, 2016",Press Release - TRANSCRIPT: Marco's Address on Growing the Economy Without New Taxes,"January 11, 2016As prepared for delivery in Sarasota, Florida:Thank you all for being here.Every time an election rolls around, the media becomes obsessed with polls. But oftentimes they obsess over the wrong ones. Today I want to tell you about a poll the media is ignoring, but that should be the talk of this entire election.It's a recent poll that asked, ""Is the American Dream alive or dead?"" Almost half of millennials, meaning young Americans, replied that the American Dream was dead. Other polls have shown even higher numbers, across all generations.This is a warning sign for America  a sign that what's at stake in this election is our identity as a special nation. That identity has long been tied to the belief that here, anything is possible. That here, you don't have to come from wealth or privilege to provide a comfortable life for your family. That here, anyone who works hard can leave their children better off than themselves.That is the real American Dream. But today, it is dying. It's not dying because our people have changed. They haven't. It's dying because both parties in Washington have let us down.It's dying because Barack Obama has abandoned the economic principles that made us the most prosperous nation in the world. It's dying because Congress has spent us into unprecedented debt. And it's dying because, while our economy is pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, our leaders are stuck in the 20th.They fail to grasp the way technology and globalization have transformed our economy. They raise taxes and grow government even though it's costing jobs and making America globally uncompetitive. They shrug off the rising importance of trade and foreign policy on our household budgets. They seem bewildered when market turmoil in Beijing triggers market turmoil in New York.To confront new realities, we need new leaders  leaders who will apply the free market principles of our founding to the economic realities of our time  who will once again place Washington's faith in our economy, rather than forcing our economy to place its faith in Washington.The purpose of my presidency will be to restore the American Dream. And I will start by re-embracing free enterprise, because it is the greatest economic system in history  the only system where poor people can become richer without rich people becoming poorer. The only system where everybody can be better off.Here's what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don't understand about free enterprise: In a free enterprise system, the president does not run the economy. The president's job is to ensure policies are in place that allow the private sector to succeed, because it is the private sector that creates jobs and opportunity.Today, we don't have those policies in place. Under Barack Obama, Washington borrows an average of more than a trillion dollars a year. It forces our private sector to spend almost two trillion dollars a year to comply with regulations. It imposes the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. It thinks its job is to make your health care decisions, to bailout big businesses, and even to control the weather.As president, I will put Washington in its place. It will once again stand behind our people, not in their way.I will repeal and replace ObamaCare before it repeals and replaces any more American jobs. I will shred Obama's job-killing executive orders. I will cap the amount regulations can cost our economy. And I will end Washington's addiction to wasteful spending. Because by the time our next president takes office, America will already be $20 trillion in debt.It's difficult to even fathom how much that is. So think about it this way: If you were to count 20 trillion dollars by hand, at one dollar per second without stopping, it wouldn't take a year or a decade or even a century to finish counting. It would take you over 600,000 years.That's how much money we will owe when Barack Obama leaves the White House. The debt will have almost doubled since he took office. Much of it we'll owe to China. And make no mistake: if we change nothing, we are going to have a debt crisis in this country. It is going to destroy jobs. It is going to disrupt the function of our government. It is going to threaten our national security.This is the most predictable crisis in American history. But every time the alarm starts blaring, signaling we're reaching the debt ceiling, Washington hits the snooze button and goes back to sleep. Under our last three presidents, the debt ceiling has been raised more than 20 times without serious spending reforms.I will stop this irresponsible spending and solve our nation's debt crisis.First, I will have the political courage to reform the main drivers of our debt, which are Social Security and Medicare. If we do nothing to save these important programs, they will bankrupt themselves and our nation. I will save them for future generations by placing them on fiscally sustainable paths.But that alone will not avert a debt crisis. Because history backs up the following fact: If you don't have laws in place to keep politicians from spending money they don't have, they will borrow money and spend it. And since Congress refuses to pass a law restricting itself, we are left with only one option.We must do what our founders gave us the power to do: we must call a convention of states to amend the U.S. Constitution. We must pass amendments limiting the size and scope of the federal government, forcing Congress to balance the budget, and imposing term limits on Congress and the Supreme Court.As president, I can promote such a convention, but I cannot make it happen without the American people. That's why I'm asking for your help today. To any American worried about the debt we're leaving our children: Join me in this effort. Press your state representatives to convene a convention of states.The third and final step to solving our debt crisis is growing the American economy. That will happen by making America the best place in the world to own and operate a business. If you want to know how to do this, talk to our job creators.I don't know of a single job creator who is looking for more taxes or more regulations, yet that's exactly what some candidates for president are proposing. Hillary Clinton's answer to every problem is to raise taxes and create a new government program. And it's not just her, or the avowed socialist running against her. Believe it or not, multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people.Some even support imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against, called a Value Added Tax  also known as a VAT. The VAT being proposed in this election works by taxing businesses at each stage of the production process. It falls squarely on profits and wages. That means it punishes businesses for earning money, and it punishes your boss for giving you a raise.The VAT is also intentionally sneaky. It attempts to trick people into believing their taxes are being lowered, when in reality they're simply being shifted to employers  meaning everyday Americans would feel its impact through higher prices and lower wages. This would be especially harmful to the poor and senior citizens with fixed incomes.The VAT makes for a dangerous expansion of Washington's power, especially when stacked on top of an income tax. In most European countries where a VAT has been implemented, government has grown in size. It's no wonder that fans of the VAT include Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, who called it a ""novel"" idea.And opponents included Ronald Reagan, who said the Value Added Tax, quote, ""gives a government a chance to blindfold the people and grow in stature and size."" And he was right. No candidate who supports this tax can claim to be in favor of ""abolishing"" the IRS. Reagan's Treasury Department estimated it would need 20,000 new agents just to administer a VAT.Republican candidates today try to hide their support for the Value Added Tax by renaming it a ""Business Flat Tax."" But don't be fooled. If it acts like a VAT, taxes like a VAT, and grows government like a VAT  it's a VAT.This isn't the only anti-free market idea being offered up by Republicans in this race. Other Republicans running for president support an Internet sales tax that could subject businesses to audit from almost 10,000 jurisdictions around the country. The Internet is the marketplace of the 21st century and it's unacceptable that anyone who claims to be a conservative would join the liberal call for an online tax.Let me be clear: I do not support new taxes of any kind, because what our country needs is economic growth, and there is no new tax that leads to economic growth.I have offered a plan to simplify and reduce taxes on both individuals and businesses. My plan is pro-growth and pro-family. It will lower the corporate tax rate to be globally competitive, it will level the playing field between big businesses and small ones, and it will make it easier for your boss to give you a raise.It will also allow families to keep more of what they earn. Today it is more expensive than ever to raise a child, and our tax system is making it even costlier. With four children of our own, Jeanette and I live this every day in our house. As president, I will raise the per-child tax credit so parents can keep more of their money to spend on food, clothing, school supplies, and all the other daily costs of raising children.I will also end the marriage penalty that leads to couples being taxed more than individuals. Nothing has the ability to improve a child's future more than being raised in a loving two-parent home, and it's time our tax code recognizes that.Through tax reforms, I will also strengthen family leave policy so fewer parents have to choose between providing financially for their children and being there for them in times of crisis. Instead of raising taxes and growing government to solve this problem, as Hillary Clinton just proposed last week, I will solve it by cutting taxes for all businesses that offer between four and twelve weeks of paid leave.From the individual to the business side, my free market reforms will yield a tax code that makes it easier for Americans to find jobs and easier for businesses to create them. They will help everyone succeed and create millions of new jobs.As president, I will recognize that what makes America great is not that we have rich people. Every country has rich people. What makes America great is that we have millions of people who are not necessarily rich, but who have a job that pays a comfortable wage, that enables them to do the activities they enjoy with the people they love, to retire with dignity, and ultimately to leave their children better off than themselves.That has been possible in America because of the choices generations before us have made.Almost every other country in the world has chosen to have government dominate the economy. In those countries, those who can influence government keep winning, and everybody else stays the same. The employee never becomes the employer, the small business can never compete with the big business, and no matter how hard your parents work or how many sacrifices they make, if you weren't born into the right family, there's only so far you can go.Americans before us have chosen something very different. They chose individual liberty. They chose a limited government that exists to protect our rights, not to grant them. They chose a free enterprise system designed to provide equality of opportunity, not compel equality of results.And yet, there are still people who cling to the belief that America is better off adopting the economic policies of nations whose people immigrate here. There have always been these voices in American politics. But seven years ago, one of them was sworn in as president.Since then, his ideas have sent the message to our people that becoming better off requires someone else becoming worse off  that the only way to climb up the economic ladder is to pull someone else down  that government is the best hope for those in search of a better life.But his big government ideas have failed us. Our people hear him talk about how well the economy is doing, but they don't feel it in their lives. And as a result, we are now at risk of seeing an entire generation of Americans lose hope in the fundamental promise of our country: the promise that hard work and perseverance will lead to a better life.Seven years of Barack Obama have left us a nation in decline. But we can still pull out of the dive. Because we are not a weak country, we just have a weak President.But the time to act is now.We cannot afford to elect Hillary Clinton, because America cannot afford another four years like the eight before it. And we cannot settle for just any Republican, because this election is not just a choice between two parties, it is a generational choice about our identity as a nation.We did not become an exceptional nation by accident. For over two centuries, each generation before us did what they needed to do to make this the greatest nation on earth.And now, the time has come for us to do our part.If you elect me president, we will return to the principles that made America great, we will put the false promise of big government behind us and embrace the power of a free people in a free economy to create a more prosperous nation. In doing so, we will not only save the American Dream, we will expand it to reach more people than ever before.And the 21st Century will not just be as good as the 20th century, it will be better.It will be a New American Century."

I am proud to supporta bill, just like I have every year since joining the Senate, that would require an audit of the Fed and allow Congress to examine its activities like they do other government institutions.Especially since the financial crisis, the Fed has taken an outsized role in the American economy, purchasing over $4 trillion in bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other assets. Its balance sheet is now larger than the GDP of Germany. This overreach has created an unhealthy, Fed-centric economy that leaves businesses and investors hanging on the arbitrary, unpredictable decisions of a few central bankers. Unwinding the current situation, as everyone knows is necessary, will come with even more new risks.The Fed should never be a substitute for the sound regulatory, fiscal, and tax policies that America desperately needs. Instead of eliminating harmful regulations and enacting pro-growth pro-family tax reform, both of which would stimulate healthy and lasting growth, the Obama Administration has been able to use the Fed's policies as a crutch  one we lean on with more weight now than ever before. Instead of holding the Fed accountable for its mistakes, the Obama Administration gave the Fed even more power with the disastrous Dodd-Frank law.It's time the American people have a chance to hold the Fed accountable. Giving Congress the ability to audit its work is a commonsense first step."

What we are saying is in the process of attacking us, hundreds of thousands of americans could find themselves in situations over the next ten years where they're threatened in one way or another by what's happening [with ISIS.]That is the threat they pose. This is a sophisticated group now, that is figuring out how to use our immigration system to get fighters in here, not to mention growing their affiliate branches around the world. And so they pose a very significant threat. Let me put it to you this way: They're the best funded and fastest growing terrorist group in the history of the world and need to be confronted for what they are: a growing and looming threat. This is the same president that called them a JV team two years ago.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 14, 2016",Press Release - How Marco Rubio Has Fought to Reduce Sexual Assault on Campus -- and Protect Due Process Rights,"As a Senator, Marco hasheard stories of sexual assault on campus, and of schools badly mishandling allegations and investigations. He'sheard from victims  both of assaults, and accusations gone wrong. He'salso heard from campus administrators who feel stuck between conflicting statutes, shifting regulations, and damaging cultural forces. And he has four children  boys and girls who are on their way to college some day.So in 2014, Marco joined a bipartisan group of senators to co-sponsor the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which aims to improve the handling of sexual assault on campus while protecting the rights of the accused. Republicans supporting the bill include Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley.We don't need to buy into the Left's overheated rhetoric and misleading statistics about campus sexual assault to believe something should be done. Of course, the government's role is also limited: Many of the problems of campus life are connected with broader cultural issues, weakened values, and the plague of substance abuse.Incidences of sexual violence are among the most serious and destructive crimes imaginable; they should be taken seriously whether they occur on campus or anywhere else in America.A few important principles should govern the handling of such a crime: Perpetrators of sexual violence should face the same system of punishment no matter who they are; those accused of sexual assault should have their due process rights respected; victims should get the support they need to heal; and wherever possible, the cases should be handled by the criminal justice system.Those are the main issues the bill tackles: It requires that every university enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with local police departments, so that law enforcement and campus personnel are best trained, prepared, and equipped to handle allegations of sexual violence on campus. The bill also requires that every school have a confidential advisor that a victim can speak to understand his or her options following sexual violence, including how to pursue a criminal complaint. These two measures together would help make it more likely crimes of sexual violence will be reported and prosecuted.Second, the bill protect due process rights without more federal micromanagement: It simply requires that schools notify an accused student within 24 hours of the decision to move forward with a disciplinary proceeding, offering the details of the complaint, the process followed, and the due process rights of each party.Third, it includes an important prohibition against schools operating, in the case of sexual violence, any special campus disciplinary procedures for athletes, honor students, or any other favored subgroup. Whatever policies universities have in this area must be uniform for everyone on campus.Marco has fought successfully to exclude the key items on the left's wish-list. The bill does not adopt ""affirmative consent"" (known as ""Yes-means-yes"") as a national standard for campus sexual assault. Nor does it legislate a ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard for campus disciplinary proceedings.Those ideas are an assault on notions of fair play and due process, and Marco would not stand for them. Opponents claiming that this bill includes or promotes them do are relying on guilt by association or simply no evidence at all.Sexual assault can destroy lives, but so can false allegations of sexual assault. One need only review recent news reports to know that false allegations do, in fact, happen. Certainly, we should make additional efforts to protect due process on campus. Most importantly, as President, Marco would swiftly move to stopthe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights's assault against due process rights.The Campus Safety and Accountability Act is not a perfect bill. It is a compromise, but it is a step in the right direction on a pressing problem. Sexual assault should not be a partisan issue, and the modest steps forward under consideration will improve the situation for the millions of students and their families who've put their trust in universities and law enforcement."

This long-running television show is about to see a spinoff. Call it ""The Contenders."" It won't happen all at once, but the trio of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio stood far enough above the rest of the field here that you could, for the first time, really sense the separation of the two tiers on the debate stage.  While one could argue that Rubio had one of his best showings so far, winning rounds with Cruz and others, what really made this debate different for Rubio was the obvious separation between him and the other four candidates on stage not named Trump or Cruz.Erick Erickson: Rubio was ""really impressive.""It was a really impressive moment for Rubio. Really impressive. Twice Rubio got the better of the better debater. Cruz, Rubio, and Trump had good nights.

His consistent strength across these debates is no fluke. Perhaps in response to needling from his rivals who've effectively questioned his strength, Rubio's tone and demeanor felt fiercer than usual. He dialed back (but didn't abandon) his signature optimism and sunniness, in favor of a more forceful approach. He scored throughout the proceedings with very good answers on issues ranging from Hillary Clinton's unsuitability for the presidency, to guns, to free trade  almost always making the most of his strangely limited talk time.Daily Caller's Matt Lewis: ""I really think it's now becoming a three-man race. I think it's Trump, Rubio, and Cruz."" (CNN)Sean Hannity: Marco Rubio had great moments.New York Post's John Podhoretz: ""Rubio's last-minute theatrics make it a three-man GOP race.""When the debate passed its second hour and kept going, Rubio seized center stage. With his amazing fluidity, he delivered a series of jabs at what he called Cruz's inconsistent conservatism  11 in all, by Cruz's startled count at the end of it.Washington Examiner: ""This is a three-man race between these skilled  and incredibly different  debaters.""The debates keep getting better. Thursday night's debate featured precision attacks, stunning comebacks, brutal beat-downs and sparkling oratory. For a while Sen. Ted Cruz appeared the clear winner. But Donald Trump took a round from Cruz, and later Sen. Marco Rubio did too. The clearest upshot: This is a three-man race between these skilled  and incredibly different  debaters."

My brother, Brian, sacrificed his life while serving along a southern border that has grown out-of-control with an administration that has done nothing to change it. For my family and millions of Americans, there is no greater priority than to ensure that our fellow Americans are safe so that no one else has to endure the same pain. That's why I'm proud to be supporting Marco Rubio. I know and trust that with Marco we will finally secure our border, and ensure that the men and women who served alongside Brian have the support from Washington they need. Tragically, my family knows firsthand the cost of misguided policies coming out of our nation's capital. It was these policies that put the weapons into the hands of Brian's killers. That cannot happen again. My family knows that Brian's legacy will be honored by Marco Rubio as our next President of the United States.She had this to say about Marco today:My brother, Brian, sacrificed his life while serving our country on the southern border, so my family knows firsthand how important it is to once and for all secure it. And for seven years now, Barack Obama has done nothing.Such a scandal never would have happened with someone like Marco Rubio in the White House. For my family, there is no greater priority than electing a president who will keep us safe. That's why I'm proud to support Marco Rubio.As president, I trust him to secure the border and keep America safe. Senator Rubio is not just someone who can win the nomination. He is a standard bearer that can make it to the White House."

But he campaigns as a consistent conservative, and basically says he's the only consistent conservative on the stage. That is not his record.Then, Marco went on to lay out the wrinkles in Cruz's record:He has flipped his position on birthright citizenship, on legalization of illegal immigrants. He wanted a 500% increase in guest workers. He wanted a doubling of the number of green cards. He did change his position on [Trade Promotion Authority]  he wrote an article with Paul Ryan, before Paul Ryan was speaker, praising TPA. He used to lobby members to support TPA, and then four months later all of a sudden he flips on it. And we saw him flip his vote on crop insurance on the Senate floor. I mean I was standing right there. And then last week, he [flip-flopped on] ethanol again in iowa.So my point is, the only thing consistent is the consistent political calculation that I'm going to change my position if it helps me politically in a given moment.And so don't run as a consistent conservative if, in fact, you have consistently calculated your positions. That's what he's done. Again, it came up because he launched into an attack. and so i responded with his record  not with an oppo dump, with his record.Read more about Cruz's shifting positions here."

After watching last night's debate, my mind is made up that Marco is the conservative leader to lead our country's economy in the 21st century. Marco gives us the best chance of both winning in November and delivering meaningful change to a broken Washington. He is an ardent reformer of the status quo, who has demonstrated his ability to take on Washington special interests by scoring a victory in defunding the insurance bailout provisions of ObamaCare. His commitment to limited government and helping states like New Hampshire break free from overarching federal mandates, rules and regulation shows that he's not just worried about the next election, but our next generation.Marco has the vision, judgment and experience to keep our country and our families safe as our next President. As every debate has shown, Marco is smart, tested and tough, and ready to take action and get results on Day one. He is the leader our Party can unite behind, and I look forward to working closely with him in the weeks ahead.Stephen joins a growing New Hampshire leadership team for Marco. In fact, Marco will also receive the backing of Brenda Willis, Vice Chairman of the Derry Cooperative School District, today.An additional 25 First In The Nation leaders also signed on with Team Marco last week.

Never have the threats to innocent life been worse than they are now, Marco writes:For the first time ever, Planned Parenthood has endorsed someone for president in a primary. It is now abundantly clear that if Hillary Clinton is elected, she will pursue the most radical pro-abortion agenda in American history. She must be stopped. And with your help, she will be.All human life is worthy of the protection of our laws. Even one abortion is too many. Yet despite the fact that the pro-life movement continues to grow, we have not yet persuaded enough Americans to join the effort to protect life once and for all. If I am our party's nominee, I will work every day to change that.Throughout my time in public service, I have sought, whenever possible, to protect life. I've worked to prohibit abortion after twenty weeks, when science tells us an unborn child can feel pain. I've led the fight to require parental notification when a minor is taken across state lines for an abortion.Hillary Clinton has already attacked Marco for defending life, but he won't back down.

It is pretty thin. (CNN, 1/26/15)The Washington Post Fact Checker: ""Here's Why The Marco Rubio's Corporate Card Saga Isn't Really A Scandal.""Rubio's carefully worded explanation doesn't quite rise to the level of a Geppetto Checkmark, but it is accurate enough that it does not warrant even a single Pinocchio. Perhaps the release of the 2005-2006 card statements will change the outcome. We'll be keeping an eye on this issue but based on the information released so far, a mountain's been made out of molehill, by the media and Rubio's opponents.(The Washington Post, 11/6/15)The Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel: ""If this is a scandal, we've found a cure for insomnia.""The card was used primarily for political expenseswhich were covered by the party. Mr. Rubio occasionally used it for a personal expense, which he then paid for each month by writing a check to the card company. No one is suggesting that the party paid a dime toward Mr. Rubio's expenses, or that the candidate was a dime short in promptly paying back his personal charges. If this is a scandal, we've found a cure for insomnia. . . .The press for its part is more interested in presenting Mr. Rubio's financial history as some evidence of scandal. The New York Times has devoted near novel-length inches to the non-news (this was all covered in Mr. Rubio's Senate race in 2010) that as a Florida legislator he used a Republican Party charge card for personal purchases. (Kimberly A. Strassel, WSJ, 11/5/15)National Review's Charles Cooke: ""And the scandal is . . . what?""This story has been doing the rounds for five years now, since Rubio first ran for the Senate. And now, as back then, I am struggling mightily to determine what exactly is supposed to be scandalous about it. Per the Times, the card in question was a Republican-party-linked American Express that was tied to Rubio's 'personal credit.' Primarily, it was used 'for political expenses, which were covered by donations to the party.' Occasionally, however, 'a few personal expenses were charged to the card as well.' Thus, when the bill came in, it contained a mixture of outlays that needed to be carefully sifted through.And the scandal is . . . what? Did the GOP pick up the tab for those personal charges? Did a group of secret donors bankroll Rubio's home expenditures? Did Rubio and his wife benefit from a line of untaxable private income? Nah. Not even close. Rather, as the Times flatly notes, Rubio made sure to identify all of the personal purchases and ultimately paid for them himself. He wrote a monthly check to the credit card company to cover the personal costs, and the party wrote a check to cover the political ones, according to his staff.In other words, he did what millions of Americans who work for corporations do each and every month. He didn't borrow money. He didn't ask his backers to pick up his personal tab. He didn't default on his obligations. (Charles C.W. Cooke, National Review Online, 11/5/15)Red State: ""Rubio lived on the income of a pretty ordinary person.""The other financial issues, however, serve mainly as a reminder of the fact that, at least until a couple years ago, Rubio lived on the income of a pretty ordinary person. Maybe they provide one of the reasons that he can talk with authenticity about the struggles people face in terms of paying their student loan debts and living paycheck to paycheck, because they are real life struggles that Rubio himself has faced.""

So we were glad to have her with us. It really was a boost to us earlier this morning when a lot of Iowans turned out to hear her introduce me. With just days until the Iowa caucus, Iowans are recognizing that Marco's the right candidate to bring our party, and the country, into a New American Century."

But it's not enough just to be angry. The next President has to have a real plan to turn the page on Obama and his disastrous policies, and they have to be willing and able to sell that plan to the American people. That's why these debates are so important.These kinds of theatrics by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow, but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton. I'm going to stay focused on uniting the Republican Party so we can defeat Hillary Clinton and turn the page on eight years of liberal failure. We don't have time for these kinds of distractions.Marco will be participating in the debate, which will be held in Des Moines, Iowa ahead of Monday's caucuses."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 27, 2016",Press Release - That Time When Ronald Reagan Opposed the Idea at the Heart of Ted Cruz's Tax Plan,"One of the key parts of Ted Cruz's tax plan is a new Value-Added Tax, which is a hidden tax embraced by big government European countries and liberals in the U.S. Marco opposes a VAT  and so did President Ronald Reagan. Watch Reagan in his own words:Reagan's big reasons for opposing a VAT?1. It ""blindfolded the American people"" by hiding the tax.As Reagan explains, when the American taxpayer doesn't see the ""hurt"" from taxes, it's easier for liberal politicians to raise them. Cruz's VAT wouldn't show up on income tax returns or sales receipts, but it would hit every American's wages, and raise the price of everything they buy2. It empowers big government by creating a huge new revenue source.The U.S. government has never had a VAT before. Lots of European countries do, though. Having a VAT in addition to income taxes has allowed governments across Europe to explode in size  to the point where in many cases they control way over half of the economy.3. It infringes on the tax base of state and local governments, who primarily rely on sales taxes to fund their operations.As a tax on consumption, the VAT is a new way for the federal government to raise revenue, but also one that will be layered on top of state and local sales taxes. That means a really high combined tax rate on everyday purchases in lots of states, higher than in many European countries.If Ronald Reagan could see the problems with a European-style VAT years ago, why can't some Republicans see them today?"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"January 30, 2016",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Never Supported Cap and Trade -- It's an Old Charlie Crist Attack,"Marco was asked during Thursday's Fox News debate about cap and trade.The untrue claim he ever supported the idea now the subject of a Ted Cruz ad in Iowais a recycled attack from liberal Charlie Crist in 2010.In 2010, liberal Charlie Crist falsely edited an interview with Marco Rubio to make it look like he supported cap-and-trade. The Crist campaign edited out the key part where Marco actually said he opposes big government mandates like cap-and-trade.Liberals always pull these tricks. In 2010, Marco'scampaign effectively responded to these false liberal attacks by pointing out the full interview.Watch the response video:This is the key line that liberals cut:The way we're gonna clean up our environment, the way we're gonna lower carbon emissions, is not through government mandates. It's through the American innovator. And that's what anything we do should be based upon. Not big government mandates like they do in Europe and California.In 2007, Marco wrote an op-ed in the Miami Heraldwhere he stated:The potential to integrate greener approaches into the fabric of Florida's economy is unlimited, but we must be willing to embrace the free-market approach  not European-style big government mandates. . . . Instead of adopting measures that will have little if any impact on our environment and make life in Florida more expensive, we need a strategy that encourages environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity, while continuing to stimulate our economy.As National Journalwrote in 2015, liberals in Florida actually attack Marco for killing attempts to implement a liberal cap-and-trade system in Florida:In his second session, Rubio played hardball with Crist. Climate change was one of Crist's signature issues, and he wanted the Legislature to pass a bill that would lay the groundwork for a California-style cap-and-trade system to cut carbon emissions. Rubio and House conservatives opposed the idea, but public sentiment was with Crist. The House ultimately passed the bill, but Rubio's team inserted a poison pill that prevented the plan from going into effect. ""I fully credit him with the gutting of the bill,"" Gelber says."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 2, 2016",Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio's Campaign Manager Reveals How They Stunned Everyone in Iowa,"To: Team Marco and Interested PartiesFrom: Terry Sullivan, Rubio Campaign ManagerDate: February 2, 2016Last night was a great night for Marco and just the first step in what will be a long nominating process that moved to New Hampshire when he landed in Manchester last night. What we witnessed in Iowa yesterday was the result of the strength of Marco's candidacy, a vision for a New American Century that resonated across a broad spectrum of caucus-goers, and a campaign built from the ground-up over the last few months that was ready to persuade and turn out the vote.Here are 6 key takeaways from last night:1) The Delegate CountAfter last night, Marco has earned 7 delegates to Ted Cruz's 8 and Donald Trump's 7.2) Marco Is the Strongest Candidate in the RaceMarco is the most compelling candidate with the best message. We knew that when people saw Marco at his events and heard his message, they would join the campaign. As CNN wrote this morning, ""Marco-mentum is real."" And last night's results are even more remarkable when considering the onslaught of negative advertising Marco faced from the Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush campaigns and Super PACs.To put this in perspective, the Jeb Bush campaign and Super PAC alone exposed the average Iowa resident to more than 34 minutes of 30-second attack ads against Marco. Yet throughout that, Marco's favorability and broad appeal remained untarnished and compelling for voters who decided late.3) A Ground Game Meticulously Built, Seldom Talked AboutOver the last few months, the campaign had built a significant ground game in Iowa that we didn't talk about. Over the last month, we made 200,000 voter contacts. In the last four days, we knocked on 10,000 doors. This on-the-ground campaign was complemented with a significant digital effort, especially on Facebook. We knew exactly the voters who were inclined to support Marco, identified more than 30,000 pro-Marco voters, and targeted a defined persuasion universe through a combined phone, door, digital, and friend-to-friend campaign.4) Assembling a Broad CoalitionOn the way to his strong finish in Iowa, Marco assembled a broad coalition of voters. According to entrance polls, Marco won 21% of those who considered themselves Evangelical. The significance of that could be seen in counties like Sioux County where Marco over-performed our vote goals. Of the 27% of caucus-goers who said the economy and jobs were their top issue, Marco won with 30%, beating even Donald Trump. And Marco carried those who decided in just the past few days. Of the 16% who decided just on Caucus Day, Marco won that category with 28%. Of those who decided ""in the last few days,"" Marco won with 31%.5) A Candidate Who Can Defeat the Democrats Is Important to VotersMarco's message resonated with Iowa voters as we approached Caucus Day. Of the 21% of caucus-goers who said ""can win in November"" was the one quality that mattered most to them, Marco won with an astounding 44% over Trump's 24% and Cruz's 22%.6) A Campaign in ActionOne story from Urbandale highlights Marco's campaign in action on Caucus night. A woman attending her caucus last night unexpectedly filled in for a Marco speaker. Quickly accessing digital talking points from the campaign, she helped carry her precinct with 152 Rubio votes, more than Cruz and Trump combined.Check out this series of tweets that captured what happened:""Alright, I guess I'm doing this.I'm talking from the heart here."" says she pulled Rubio talk pts from guest wifi pic.twitter.com/ykNBwWVAIE Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) February 2, 2016Last minute Rubio speaker gets the loudest and longest applause tho pic.twitter.com/BpBOfQacwh Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) February 2, 2016Rubio yuuge winner in Urbandale-13; Rubio 152, Cruz 77, Trump 70 pic.twitter.com/XqalRa5P8L Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) February 2, 2016"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 2, 2016",Press Release - South Carolina's Tim Scott Backs Marco Rubio. A Look at Their Inspiring Stories Makes it Easy to See Why.,"February 2, 2016Senator Tim Scott, the stalwart South Carolina conservative who has become a national name thanks to his optimistic vision and focus on economic opportunity, has made his pick for President.It's easy to see the parallels between Senator Scott and Marco: Both are optimistic, next generation conservatives. But their shared story goes beyond that.Marco has talked on the trail about growing up living paycheck to paycheck; Scott's mother working 16 hours a day to provide for him and his brother.That background has made Scott a leading voice in crafting conservative solutions to challenge poverty because he knows it's not about where you start, it's about where you are going.Earlier this year, he hosted the Kemp Poverty Forum to address this issue:@marcorubio @SenatorTimScott @SpeakerRyan and other GOP candidates at recent #kempforum16 sponsored by @OppLives https://t.co/wf1Br1Saut John Hart (@johnhart333) February 2, 2016When it comes to politics, Scott has taken on the establishment, too.In his first congressional race, he took on two political heirs  the sons of former South Carolina Governors and Senators. It would have been easy to wait, but Scott knew the moment demanded him.  Scott became the first black Republican in Congress from the South since Reconstruction.Scott was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2012 and won the seat outright in 2014, a remarkable climb from living in working poverty. It's the same dream Marco's parents worked so hard to provide for him. With his incredible life story, it's pretty easy to see why Senator Scott believes in Marco  and why his support is a big deal.The Tim Scott endorsement is a huge get for @marcorubio. #Marcomentum https://t.co/d4zQEg9eyv Mark Potter (@mdpotter77) February 2, 2016Wow.

I thought he ran a good race and obviously he is going to run for re-election to the Senate, and we wish him well in that endeavor.. . .We would love to have everybody's support, and obviously, we will work hard to earn the support of some of the people that were helping him.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 5, 2016",Press Release - His Record Is Clear: Marco Rubio Is the Strong Conservative Who Can Win,"February 5, 2016If you're looking for a candidate who is both a strong conservative and can win in November, the choice is simple: It's Marco.When it comes to Marco's conservative record, this says it all:Just to check out his scores and grades from the nation's leading conservative organizations:"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 5, 2016",Press Release - One Conservative Activist That Just Endorsed Marco on Why 'He Makes Us Swell with Pride',"Frayda Levin is a Reagan-administration veteran who has devoted years of her life now to the causes of liberty and free markets, working with groups like the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity.She just endorsed Marco. Here's her explanation why:From the first time I heard Marco Rubio speak about America and all our freedoms, I felt in my heart that he understood this country is truly a land of opportunity for all. At least it was  Marco has also experienced that opportunity has being eroded due to the burdens of government and restrictions it places on struggling Americans.This fight for liberty is immensely personal for him, given the struggles of Marco's family and how they were able to succeed thanks to America's robust free market system. He is saddened that so many working Americans are being denied the opportunities of past generations due to licensing requirements, regulations stifling manufacturing, limits on energy production, and more.I also admire how Marco views each and every working profession as admirable. He praises those who work in all trades which are critical as well as those in the service industries. He does not disparage their contributions to our economy by claiming everyone should get a college education.Marco also defied the establishment in Florida: When they wanted to elect Charlie Crist, Rubio fought for the right to assure Florida was represented by someone who had true conservative principles. And yet, unlike Cruz, Rubio can work with all types  which is something Marco proved as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.Marco is also the most conservative candidate who can get elected. Marco will not just get elected  he make us swell with pride. I will be so proud as he debates the Democratic candidate and show her (or him) why an expanding government is destroying America's middle class and opportunity."

Rubio are many. Notably, the Florida senator has deep personal connections to the state. He lived in the Las Vegas Valley from age 8 to age 14, the son of immigrants employed by the hotel industry. The driving force behind the 44-year-old's compelling story is his family's pursuit of better opportunities and a better life. The policies he champions in his campaign are intended to provide all Americans as much.The paper endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican primaries.They also cite Marco's ability to win in November and his strong conservative credentials.Sen. Rubio is a limited-government conservative, as proved by his 94 percent conservative rating from Heritage Action  bested by only five Republicans in the entire Congress. He is not a go-along-to-get-along RINO (Republican in Name Only), as many have declared. If you want your next president to be an outsider, Sen. Rubio is part of the discussion.Marco will unite the Republican Party and beat Hillary Clinton, and he will do it while standing up for his conservative record."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 6, 2016",Press Release - Why Do Democrats Fear Running Against Marco Rubio the Most? Watch!,"February 6, 2016Last night, Marco was asked why he's the best Republican to beat Hillary. Here's his answer:First of all, I'm in the best position of anyone running to unify our party. We all have differences of opinion on some key issues in our party but I believe I'm best positioned to bring everyone together, because we cannot win if we're not all together. We also have to grow the conservative movement. We have to take our message to people who are living paycheck to paycheck. I've lived paycheck to paycheck. I grew up paycheck to paycheck. We're going to take the conservative movement to people that are living paycheck to paycheck. We'll take it to young people, you know, you come to my rallies, there's a lot of young college students there, young Americans. A lot of them are worried about student loan debt. I had a student loan just three years ago, I still had one. So I think we can not just unify the conservative movement, we can grow the conservative movement.Marco knows we can reach more voters. Donate $17 to Help Grow the MovementWe can offer ideas that will create new opportunities in the 21st Century workforce. We can overhaul our broken higher education system and provide alternatives to student loans.That message can expand the movement, and that's why Marco is the candidate the Democrats fear the most."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 6, 2016",Press Release - Must See: Marco Rubio Blasts Obama's Proposed Energy Tax,"January 6, 2016In case you missed it, President Obama is proposing a new energy tax  $10 on every barrel of oil.Marco's not a fan, and he let a crowd in New Hampshire know it.You may not have heard this, it just broke on the news. The president wants to solve transportation issues in America. Being from the left, guess what his answer  what do you think the answer was to our transportation issues? A tax! It's his answer to everything.He wants to put a tax on Ebola. He wants to put a tax on  I'm kidding about that. That is not a real thing. Everything is a tax. Now it is going to be a ten dollar a barrel tax. Who's going to pay that? You are. You are going to pay it.Sure, the barrel of oil is down to 35 dollars. It's not going to be down there forever. But the tax will be. All to fund this pipe dream that he has with his high-speed this, and clean cars that. We don't need a tax for these things. Everything is about a tax.

Watch what he had to say on that front last night, as the moderators pressed him:"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 7, 2016",Press Release - Here's What Marco Rubio's Accomplished in Florida and the Senate,"In his time in the U.S. Senate and as Speaker of Florida State House, Marco has a range ofaccomplishments onimportantissues for conservatives. Here are some of his accomplishments in the Senate:1. Marcoled the effort on the biggest Republican victory against ObamaCare.Back in 2013, Marco sounded the alarm about the potential for the Obama Administration to bail out insurers losing money under ObamaCare.He led the fight to make Congress block the Obama Administration from transferring taxpayer dollars to insurers losing money under ObamaCare. When those big losses started racking up, Marco's work saved taxpayers $2.5 billion in one year alone.This isn't just about saving taxpayers the bailout money: The only way to keep ObamaCare afloat may be to subsidize the insurers who are losing money on it, and Marco has done more than anyone to stop that from happening. In fact, it's the most important victory against ObamaCare that any Republican running for president has achieved.2. Marco was behind the toughest partof the recent VA reform law.Following revelations about deep corruption and incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Marco introduced a bill that would allow the firing of incompetent, negligent or corrupt VA managers. The bill, the VA Management Accountability Act, was adamantly opposed by government-union-friendly Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders.Thanks to his work on VA issues, Marco was asked to be on the conference committee that put together the final VA reform legislation. There, he ensured that an important element of his VA Management Accountability Act the ability to fire senior VA executives who aren't doing their jobs  made it into the legislation that passed. McClatchy's reported that Marco ""played a vital role on a special committee that finalized that legislation.""Marco has continued to push for the accountability law to be implemented and has pushed to expand this authority so that any VA employee can be fired for poor performance, and will ensure as president that it becomes law.Here's what Pete Hegseth, a top veterans advocate who runs Concerned Veterans for America, has to say about Marco on veterans' issues:Having led 9 townhall events w/ Rubio, Cruz, Jeb, Carly, Carson & Rand, I can say nobody knows vets/defense/foreign policy like @MarcoRubio. Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) January 30, 20163. Marco pushed new sanctions on Hezbollah, which are already beginning to bite.In 2015, Marco led the successful effort to tighten the screws on the financing of the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah. His legislation allows the U.S. to sanction foreign banks that are working with the group, which is waging war on Israel, killed 241 American servicemen in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombings, and has carried out attacks on civilians around the world. AIPAC praised Marco and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire's leadership on the bill, calling it ""an important tool against Iranian aggression.""The good news: Hezbollah is already starting to feel the pinch, the Wall Street Journal reported recently. The group even called Marco's bill ""a new crime by American institutions against our people and nation.""4. Marco fought the Obama White House to pass sanctions against Venezuela's brutal socialist regime.Marco has long been a leader on human rights issues, calling on the U.S. to stand up for people living under oppressive regimes, in Latin America especially.In 2014, he led an effort to pass sanctions against the corrupt, anti-American government in Venezuela. One of the problems in the way: The Obama White House was reluctant to take a stand against Venezuela. Marco felt differently, and, as McClatchy's reported, ""played a pivotal role in prodding the Obama administration on the matter  in a hearing, in multiple letters, in Senate speeches.""At the end of 2014, Marco succeeded in passing the bill, and the White House has since sanctioned several individual Venezuelan government officials who've been responsible for human rights abuses.5. Marco led the passage of the Girls Count Act, to combat human trafficking.One of the most widespread human rights problems across the world is the way government policies and cultural norms undermine the rights of women and girls: many of them never counted at birth, depriving them of things like education and health care and making them much more vulnerable to human trafficking. The problem is greatest in the poorest countries, but it's also a huge problem in China, with its horrific one-child policy (now ""two child policy"").Marco succeeded in passing a bipartisan bill, the Girls Count Act, seeing it through to becoming law, that would direct U.S. foreign aid resources toward protecting girls' rights by addressing this problem.The bill, supported by groups like Catholic Relief Services, means the U.S. will now help governments to properly register girls at birth and respect their rights under the rule of law, making it more likely that their rights will be respected.6. Marco has defended religious freedom at home and abroad.In the Senate, Marco has worked to protect one of our most fundamental liberties, the right to believe and live out those beliefs.He has been at the forefront of the Congressional effort to reverse the Obama administration's unconstitutional, anti-conscience HHS Mandate, authoring the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2012, and has championed the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects religious institutions' ability to live by their values.Marco has also made international religious freedom a foreign policy priority: He led the charge to reauthorize the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, has fought to highlight the oppression of religious minorities in China and elsewhere, especially Christians and others facing genocide in the Middle East at the hands of ISIS.Marco explicitly campaigned for Florida House Speaker on an ideas platform, with abook of 100 policy proposals gathered from Floridians. Dozens became law.Some of his State House accomplishments:1. Marco balanced the budget twice without raising taxes.Even while the Florida economy was slowing as the housing bubble ebbed, and Florida's revenues dropped, Marco balanced the budget both years without raising taxes, and passed budgets with less spending than Governor Charlie Crist and the State Senate wanted.As House Speaker, his pro-growth record earned him a 100 percent rating from the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and in 2006, he had a 100 percent rating from the National Federation of Independent Business. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said Marco as Speaker was ""the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country.""2. Marco led on stopping eminent domain abuse.Just before Marco was speaker, when the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Kelo v. City of New London formally gave governments nationwide the right to seize private property not just for infrastructure projects but also for any economic development project, Marco led the effort to curtail government's eminent domain powers in Florida. He ran a bipartisan committee that examined how to stop governments from seizing property to hand over to private developers. He sponsored both a law and a constitutional amendment to prevent eminent domain abuse, and they both passed, earning the state an A grade from the Castle Coalition, which assesses states on their respect for property rights.3. Marco fought to reform higher education.He's talked about the importance of supporting vocational education and college alternatives on the campaign trail, and his record on the issue stretches back to his time in the Florida House: He successfully saw through the creation of ""career academies"" to allow high schoolers to begin learning a trade, encouraged community colleges to focus on high-demand trades and majors, and made the transfer of credits between state higher education institutions easier.4. Marco improved Florida's K-12 education system.A number of education reforms from Marco's policy book,100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future, became law, including an expansion of the state's school choice scholarship program that empowers parents, the promotion of new programs for gifted students, the creation of public-private partnerships for after-school programs and other school services, and easier access to virtual schooling. The House also passed a sweeping law to expand education opportunities for children with disabilities, and ultimately made law a bill focused on helping children with autism.Two more 100 Ideas promises Marco made happen: He passed the legislation to raise Florida's K-12 educational standards significantly, create a world-class curriculum without Washington's involvement, and improve school measurement and accountability systems, and he helped create the Miami Children's Initiative, the type of ""children's zone"" suggested in 100 Ideas and modeled after the highly successful Harlem Children's Zone.5. Marco promotedsmall governmentand transparency.In 100 Ideas for Florida's Future, Marco proposed the idea of a Legislative Sunset Advisory Committee for Florida, modeled on a committee in the Texas legislature, that would review laws on a regular basis for necessity and effectiveness  and he made it happen.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 9, 2016",Press Release - Here's What Marco Rubio Did for Florida When He Was House Speaker,"After being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, and being selected as majority whip and then majority leader, Marco served as Speaker of the House in 2007 and 2008.A few main points stand out about his tenure: He governed conservatively, he governed on new, conservative ideas, and he amassed an impressive record of accomplishment even during some tough years for the Florida economy.Even while the Florida economy was slowing as the housing bubble ebbed, and Florida's revenues dropped, Marco balanced the budget both years without raising taxes, and passed budgets with less spending than Governor Charlie Crist and the State Senate wanted.As House Speaker, his pro-growth record earned him a 100 percent rating from the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and in 2006, he had a 100 percent rating from the National Federation of Independent Business. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said Marco as Speaker was ""the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country.""Further, Marco explicitly campaigned for Speaker on a platform of ideas, laying out in a book 100 policy proposals that he gathered from meeting with Floridians across the state.In the two years he had as term-limited speaker, Marco's hard work turned many of these ideas into reality, improving how the government worked for Floridians on everything from education and health care to protecting their property rights or improving vehicle registration.Here are just some of the ideas he made happen:Eminent DomainJust before Marco was speaker, when the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Kelo vs. the City of New London formally gave governments nationwide the right to seize private property not just for infrastructure projects but also for any economic development project, Marco led the effort to curtail government's eminent domain powers in Florida. He ran a bipartisan committee that examined how to stop governments from seizing property to hand over to private developers. He sponsored both a law and a constitutional amendment to prevent eminent domain abuse, and they both passed, earning the state an A grade from the Castle Coalition, which assesses states on their respect for property rights.Higher EducationMarco has talked about the importance of supporting vocational education and college alternatives on the campaign trail, and his record on the issue stretches back to his time in the Florida House: He successfully saw through the creation of ""career academies"" to allow high schoolers to begin learning a trade, encouraged community colleges to focus on high-demand trades and majors, and made the transfer of credits between state higher education institutions easier.K-12 EducationA number of education reforms from Marco's 100 Ideas became law, including an expansion of the state's school choice scholarship program that empowers parents, the promotion of new programs for gifted students, the creation of public-private partnerships for after-school programs and other school services, and easier access to virtual schooling. The House also passed a sweeping law to expand education opportunities for children with disabilities, and ultimately made law a bill focused on helping children with autism.Two more 100 Ideas promises Marco made happen: He passed the legislation to raise Florida's K-12 educational standards significantly, create a world-class curriculum without Washington's involvement, and improve school measurement and accountability systems, and he helped create the Miami Children's Initiative, a ""children's zone"" first suggested in 100 Ideas and modeled after the highly successful Harlem Children's Zone.Small Government & Government TransparencyIn 100 Ideas for Florida's Future, Marco proposed the idea of a Legislative Sunset Advisory Committee for Florida, modeled on a committee in the Texas legislature, that would review laws on a regular basis for necessity and effectiveness  and he made it happen. In 100 Ideas Marco also championed the principle of transparency, following through on ideas like creating a public website to detail the state's budget and requiring accountability for state-funded hospitals.Crime100 Ideas set forth a number of ideas to cut crime in Florida communities. Under Marco's leadership, bills became law that registered sex offenders' online identities, toughened penalties on repeat sex offenders, expanded efforts to collect DNA evidence from felons, and increased law-enforcement efforts and penalties for gang activity.Executive PowerMarco stood up against Governor Charlie Crist's executive overreach: The House blocked Crist's unauthorized attempt to impose a liberal cap-and-trade scheme on Florida, and Marco stopped an unconstitutional Crist attempt to expand gambling in the state.When Marco delivered his final speech as speaker, though, he didn't just focus on political accomplishments  he also gave a moving testimony about his own faith and the larger purpose we all have as Americans."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 9, 2016",Press Release - This Is Some of What Marco Rubio Has Gotten Done as a Senator (It's a Lot More than Barack Obama Had),"In four years as a U.S. Senator, Marco has built a record of accomplishments on some of the most important issues for conservatives. Here are some of them:1. Marco led the effort on the biggest Republican victory against ObamaCare.Back in 2013, Marco sounded the alarm about the potential for the Obama Administration to bail out insurers losing money under ObamaCare.He led the fight to make Congress block the Obama Administration from transferring taxpayer dollars to insurers losing money under ObamaCare. When those big losses started racking up, Marco's work saved taxpayers $2.5 billion in one year alone.This isn't just about saving taxpayers the bailout money: The only way to keep ObamaCare afloat may be to subsidize the insurers who are losing money on it, and Marco has done more than anyone to stop that from happening. In fact, it's the most important victory against ObamaCare that any Republican running for president has achieved.2. Marco was behind the toughest part of the recent VA reform law.Following revelations about deep corruption and incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Marco introduced a bill that would allow the firing of incompetent, negligent or corrupt VA managers. The bill, the VA Management Accountability Act, was adamantly opposed by government-union-friendly Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders.Thanks to his work on VA issues, Marco was asked to be on the conference committee that put together the final VA reform legislation. There, he ensured that an important element of his VA Management Accountability Act  the ability to fire senior VA executives who aren't doing their jobs  made it into the legislation that passed. McClatchy's reported that Marco ""played a vital role on a special committee that finalized that legislation.""Marco has continued to push for the accountability law to be implemented and has pushed to expand this authority so that any VA employee can be fired for poor performance, and will ensure as president that it becomes law.Here's what Pete Hegseth, a top veterans advocate who runs Concerned Veterans for America, has to say about Marco on veterans' issues:For the record, from someone who was there, Senator @marcorubio led the charge for #VAaccountability in the U.S. Senate. Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) February 7, 20163. Marco pushed new sanctions on Hezbollah, which are already beginning to bite.In 2015, Marco led the successful effort to tighten the screws on the financing of the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah. His legislation allows the U.S. to sanction foreign banks that are working with the group, which is waging war on Israel, killed 241 American servicemen in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombings, and has carried out attacks on civilians around the world. AIPAC praised Marco and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire's leadership on the bill, calling it ""an important tool against Iranian aggression.""The good news: Hezbollah is already starting to feel the pinch, the Wall Street Journal reported recently. The group even called Marco's bill ""a new crime by American institutions against our people and nation.""4. Marco fought the Obama White House to pass sanctions against Venezuela's brutal socialist regime.Marco has long been a leader on human rights issues, calling on the U.S. to stand up for people living under oppressive regimes, in Latin America especially.In 2014, he led an effort to pass sanctions against the corrupt, anti-American government in Venezuela. One of the problems in the way: The Obama White House was reluctant to take a stand against Venezuela. Marco felt differently, and, as McClatchy's reported, ""played a pivotal role in prodding the Obama administration on the matter  in a hearing, in multiple letters, in Senate speeches.""At the end of 2014, Marco succeeded in passing the bill, and the White House has since sanctioned several individual Venezuelan government officials who've been responsible for human rights abuses.5. Marco led the passage of the Girls Count Act, to combat human trafficking.One of the most widespread human rights problems across the world is the way government policies and cultural norms undermine the rights of women and girls: many of them never counted at birth, depriving them of things like education and health care and making them much more vulnerable to human trafficking. The problem is greatest in the poorest countries, but it's also a huge problem in China, with its horrific one-child policy (now ""two child policy"").Marco succeeded in passing a bipartisan bill, the Girls Count Act, seeing it through to becoming law, that would direct U.S. foreign aid resources toward protecting girls' rights by addressing this problem.The bill, supported by groups like Catholic Relief Services, means the U.S. will now help governments to properly register girls at birth and respect their rights under the rule of law, making it more likely that their rights will be respected.6. Marco has defended religious freedom at home and abroad.In the Senate, Marco has worked to protect one of our most fundamental liberties, the right to believe and live out those beliefs.He has been at the forefront of the Congressional effort to reverse the Obama administration's unconstitutional, anti-conscience HHS Mandate, authoring the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2012, and has championed the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects religious institutions' ability to live by their values.Marco has also made international religious freedom a foreign policy priority: He led the charge to reauthorize the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, has fought to highlight the oppression of religious minorities in China and elsewhere, especially Christians and others facing genocide in the Middle East at the hands of ISIS.7. Marco has been a leading defender of Internet freedom.In 2012, the Senate and House both unanimously approved Marco's bill to oppose any international efforts to regulate the Internet, calling on the U.S. government to reinforce its commitment to Internet freedom by opposing efforts to cede Internet regulatory power to the International Telecommunications Union. Thanks to the strong opposition Congress showed, no damaging regulatory measures were adopted at the World Conference on International Telecommunications."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 9, 2016",Press Release - Here's What Marco Rubio Actually Thinks about the Draft and Women in Combat,"Throughout its history, our nation has been blessed in moments of great peril to be able to call upon the service of heroes to defend our security and our ideals. It is a testament to the character of our nation that we honor the service and sacrifice of those that fight on our behalf, including so many women that have served with distinction in our military for decades. They have filled critical roles in every branch of the armed forces. Many of these women have served in harm's way. They have won Purple Hearts and Silver Stars. And nearly 200 women have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Women in combat is not a theoretical debate. It has been the reality for more than a decade of war.Marco supports women who wish to volunteer for combat being allowed to serve inmost combat roles as long as physical standards are not lowered and it does not harm unit performance, preserves combat readiness, and takes into account career progression of all soldiers.The U.S. military is not an instrument for social experimentation. That is why it is critical that we preserve and maintain the same high standards that have made the U.S. military the most elite and effective military force the world has ever known.Two of our nation's most senior military leaders the Commandant of the Marine Corps General Robert Neller and the Chief of Staff of the Army General Mark Milley have recently recommended that all eligible women now be required to register with the Selective Service System.Marco supports the recommendation of our top military leaders. As women fill more roles in our military, Selective Service should be open for both men and women. In the event a draft is ever required, registering with the Selective Service System would not mean that someone would be automatically be drafted, and women would certainly not be drafted into combat. Only those that meet the military's high mental, physical, and moral fitness standards would be ever be inducted into the armed forces. Moreover, a draft is highly unlikely to occur, even in the most difficult military scenarios.Our military must have the forces, training, and equipment it needs to deter, and if necessary, defeat any adversary. And as Commander-in-Chief, Marco will review the entire Selective Service System to determine whether it is still necessary or what reforms must be considered given the threats our nation confronts around the world."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 10, 2016",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Has a Fiery Response to His Showing in New Hampshire,"On Fox and Friends this morning, Marco was straightforward: Despite a rocky few days for which he's taken responsibility, he's going to win the Republican nomination, and he's going to win the general election.How's he feeling right now?Our team here [in NH] did a great job. To the extent that we finished shorter than we wanted to, I think it had to do with the fact that Saturday night and the last three days and the coverage. So that's on me. That ain't ever going to happen again. We're looking forward to South Carolina. We're headed there right now. We're getting back on the road here. We're going to win this campaign. We're going to win this primary. It's important for the country and I'm fired up about that.What's one reason he's the best candidate?This line that somehow I have no experience is absurd. It's true I haven't lived as long as some people running for president, but I have more foreign policy experience than any of them  a lot more. And that's the most important job of a president. The most important job of a president is to be the commander in chief and to keep us safe.Is anything going to change about the campaign?Looking forward, we're going to talk about the future. Which is what all elections are about, but never more so than right now. One of the things I'm criticized for is saying the truth, and I'll continue to say this: Barack Obama is undermining this country . . . in a way I believe is part of a plan to weaken America on the global stage.The differences between Republicans and Democrats are not small  they are massive. And this election is about that difference, and ensuring we choose the right road.Marco's moving on to South Carolina  get fired up!"

Lynn Westmoreland, have joined Marco's Georgia Leadership Team.The latest addition came today, with former Georgia Republican Party Chairman Alec Poitevint joining the team. He had this to say:Having endured almost eight years of President Obama, Americans are frustrated with the direction of our country. I am one of them. The only way to turn it around and advance our conservative cause is to win in November. I believe the only candidate who can do that is Marco Rubio.

Georgians will play a very important role in ensuring we nominate the candidate best suited to defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in November, and I look forward to working with this outstanding team to energize voters as we approach the March 1 primary.State Senator Dean Burke, of Bainbridge, praised Marco's record:A lot of politicians in Washington have talked about the harmful impact Obamacare is having on families across the country but few have actually done anything about it. Early on, Marco warned of a taxpayer bailout of the insurance industry, and he succeeded in stopping it, already saving taxpayers $2.5 billion. That's the kind of leader we need in the White House, someone who can not only identify problems but can implement solutions.Team Marco in Georgia held a press conference to highlight the big additions:Georgia's Marco endorsers rally at the Cap to highlight growing momentum.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 12, 2016",Press Release - See Which Social Conservative Organization Just Gave Marco Its Highest Honor,"This week, Family Research Council Action, one of America's most prominent social-conservative advocacy groups, recognized Marco with its ""True Blue"" Award.The award recognizes legislators who have a 100 percent rating according to FRC Action's legislative scorecard, as he did last year.Here's what the group's president, Tony Perkins, had to say about Marco:We thank Senator Rubio for consistently voting to uphold the fundamentals of faith, family and freedom. Senator Rubio voted to repeal key parts of Obamacare, protect the unborn, end the forced partnership between taxpayers and Planned Parenthood, and protect state marriage laws before the Supreme Court changed the [natural] definition of marriage.We can be encouraged by elected officials who are willing to be criticized by some in the media and the intolerant voices of secularism as they stand for family values. Congress as a whole is often criticized, and rightfully so, but there are individual Senators, like Senator Rubio, who deserve praise for their unwavering commitment to stand for life, family, marriage, and religious liberty.Family Research Council Action and the hundreds of thousands of families we represent are proud to recognize Senator Rubio for his faithful work. Our hope is that in the next Congress, he will be joined by many more like him.Marco earned the rating this year for, among other things:his opposition to the redefinition of marriagethe federal government's imposition of Common Coreand federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and his support for banning late-term abortions and eliminating the death taxHe believes America's values have made America great, and supports strong families and the right to life.That's why he's received the endorsement of top pro-life figures like Abby Johnson.He's received a whole set of accolades from other conservative organizations for his sterling voting record:Marco's unabashedly conservative  and he can unite ourparty and beat Hillary."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 12, 2016",Press Release - Ted Cruz Is Proposing a Huge New Tax That Will Hit the Middle Class,"A new analysis from a left-leaning think tank claims that Marco's pro-growth, pro-family tax plan, which cuts taxes for families and businesses, contains a form of a value-added tax (VAT).This is a notable claim  and a wildly misleading one  because numerous conservatives have criticized Ted Cruz's plan for including a value-added tax, on the grounds that it's a hidden mechanism to grow government as European countries have, a new tax on the middle class, and a levy that would hit previously untaxed portions of the economy. The problems with Cruz's plan are significant, so it's important to understand why they don't apply to Marco's plan at all.Some of the key differences between Marco's plan and Cruz's plan: Cruz stacks a new tax  the VAT  on top of our existing income tax. Marco cuts the existing income tax in a way that will spark economic growth.Cruz's plan taxes wages and wealth  hurting retirees, employees of charities and churches, and home sales. Marco's does not.Cruz's VAT is totally hidden from those who pay it: the American people. In fact, it is deliberately less transparent than VATs in many European countries. This is troubling because it makes it easier for politicians to raise taxes with no accountability. Marco's plan cuts taxes for all Americans in a transparent manner and does not include any new taxes.Cruz's VAT would, contra his promise to abolish the IRS, likely require tens of thousands of new IRS agents to enforce it. Marco's plan works within the existing system and wouldn't grow government.Those are just few of the most important differences between two plans.Rubio tax cut vs. Cruz VAT pic.twitter.com/Bz6WkbMwZ7 Phillip Swagel (@pswagel) February 11, 2016Conservative tax expert Ryan Ellis said the liberal think tank's report is grossly misleading:There is only one candidate running on a VAT plan this year. His name is Ted Cruz, not Marco Rubio. There are major, major differences between a VAT and a business cash flow profits tax (Rubio's method). Yet report author Len Burman has apparently confusedthe Washington Post, Politico, and the Washington Examiner by telling them that the two taxes are, to useBurman's term, ""effectively"" the same (the Wall Street Journal didn't buy it).They are very much not the same, as any tax expert will tell you. The biggest difference is that Rubio's business profits tax allows wages and other compensation to be deductible, but Cruz's VAT does not. That's a very big deal, and it's not the only distinction between the two. To inject confusion into what has become a hot policy conflict between the two is not appropriate.Marco proposes to cut both individual and business income tax rates across the board  and his plan creates no new taxes. It allows the immediate expensing of business investment, a longtime conservative priority for tax reform that would boost economic growth and investment and help businesses large and small.Many economists see that second change as having the effect of turning the U.S.'s current income tax into a consumption tax  considered by most economists to be a pro-growth reform. That's why Marco proposed the plan he did.But this kind of reform is nothing like the harmful VAT contained in Cruz's plan. While Marco's plan would encourage investment and spur growth, the VAT in the Cruz plan would enact a new, hidden tax on a much larger tax base than we have today so much biggerthat over 70 percent of the revenue raised in Cruz's plan comes from his VAT.Liberal economists might want a new tax on the American people like a VAT to help them pay for big government, but that will never happen when Marco is president.US corp taxes are so high that companies are going overseas. @marcorubio wants to lower taxes and encourage investment. This is not a VAT. Diana Furchtgott-R (@FurchtgottRoth) February 11, 2016The group that's muddled the waters about Marco's plan, the Tax Policy Center, is not a neutral arbiter and is biased against pro-growth plans. After the TPC deliberately misrepresented Mitt Romney's tax plan in 2012, the Wall Street Journal editorial board called the group ""the intellectual frontmen for President Obama's re-election campaign,"" noting they ""claim to be nonpartisan, above-the-fray economists but somehow always seem to provide analysis that serves those who want to raise tax rates."" Even the federal government, through the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation use dynamic scoring, but the TPC still does not, inflating the amount of lost revenue from any pro-growth tax reform, including Marco's plan. And that isn't the end of the problems: The TPC also makes inaccurate assumptions that lead them to understate the tax relief Marco's plan provides for low-income workers.The Bottom LineMarco's plan transforms the federal tax system to make it work for American families and businesses, cuts their taxes significantly, and dramatically simplifies the tax code. Cruz's plan adds a new, hidden tax on wages and hide the cost of government from the American people. That's all you need to know."

Congressman Trey Gowdy said he's ""bitterly disappointed"" by Cruz's attack:Marco is passionately committed to the pro-life cause and has repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Marco's unwavering defense of life is one of the reasons I so enthusiastically support him. I am bitterly disappointed Ted Cruz would try to intentionally mislead my fellow South Carolinians. The sanctity of life is not a political issue to many of us. It is a moral, spiritual and human rights issue. I am not surprised when Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Nancy Pelosi distort Marco's record. I am surprised and disappointed when Ted Cruz does it.And here's what former senator Rick Santorum who led the charge to ban partial-birth abortion said it's a ""disservice to the pro-life cause"":Marco Rubio has been and always will be a staunch defender of life. For Ted Cruz to suggest otherwise is a disservice to the pro-life cause. We should be united in our fight to defund Planned Parenthood. Trying to create divisions and pit passionate pro-life leaders against each other is a disservice to the innocent unborn babies relying on us for help. We need a leader like Marco who can unite conservatives in the fight for life, not people like Ted Cruz who choose to weaken the pro-life movement for political gain.Conservative activists were turned off, too:This is jaw-droppingly dishonest https://t.co/d2uZJZdk9b Ellen L.

Marco has always been passionately committed to the pro-life cause and has repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Instead of working to unite conservatives to defund Planned Parenthood, Cruz is using the issue as a political weapon.

It was clear:A CBS Overnight Poll: 32 Percent Thought Marco Won The Debate. Thirty-two percent of these debate watchers say Marco Rubio won the debate, beating out Donald Trump (24 percent) and John Kasich (19 percent), who are ranked second and third, respectively. Further down on the list are Ted Cruz (12 percent), Ben Carson (8 percent), and Jeb Bush (5 percent).Marco Rubio is the clear favorite among Republicans2. Brett O'Donnell: Rubio had ""an excellent night""3. Chris Cillizza: Marco was better than Jeb4. National Review:Marco 'delivered a solid showing' and 'spoke competently of the national-security challenges.'If Trump's clash with Bush proved to be the pivotal moment of the evening, all eyes had been on Rubio as the night began. ... He delivered a solid showing in Greenville: He dumped the talking points for which Chris Christie had pilloried him and spoke competently of the national-security challenges the next president will face. ...Rubio also demonstrated in a testy exchange with rival Ted Cruz that he can throw a punch. ... That was likely true tonight, where Rubio's solid performance was overshadowed by Trump's antics, and where Trump's antics were likely enough to make voters forget about Rubio's big fumble. But all will have to do more  Trump to hurt himself, Rubio and Bush to help themselves  between now and next Saturday to appreciably change the dynamics of the race.5.New York Post'sJohn Podhoretz: Marco Was 'Sensational.' And Marco Rubio? He was sensational. Did what he had to do. Got off the mat and got himself back in the fight. Winner on points.6.The Weekly Standard: 'Rubio'sStellar Performance.'Rubio seemed to bounce back with strong, informed answers on national security and taxes...It's hard to say how Rubio's stellar performance will help him in South Carolina, which holds its primary this coming Saturday.7.PJ Media: 'Basically, this was Marco's night.'It remained for Rubio to make the strongest defense of Bush's brother against Trump's attacks, when the Florida senator said he thanked God that George W., not Al Gore, was in the White House on 9/11. The applause was resounding, as it was after Rubio's impassioned final speech. The camera at that point had moved over to Cruz, who clearly had the displeased expression of someone who just saw his victim get up off the mat.Basically, this was Marco's night.8.Politico Insiders Agree: 'Rubio Won The Night.'Meantime, a plurality of Republican insiders  44 percent  said Marco Rubio won the night. Slightly more than one-third of Democrats agreed'Rubio is back. Rubio is back. Rubio is back,' said a South Carolina Republican of Rubio, who last week was criticized for repeating the same lines. 'He dismantled Cruz without getting too entangled with Trump. If South Carolina voters were paying attention tonight, this could be a huge boost for him.9.Tampa Bay Times: Marco had a 'strong debate performance.

Marco will be a strong Commander in Chief, and I look forward to him restoring America's leadership in the world.Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens:Marco has ""the most nuanced and sophisticated foreign policy"" in the Republican field.Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer:Foreign policy looms uncharacteristically large in this election cycle, and Rubio is the most knowledgeable and fluent current contender [in the Republican field] on everything from Russia to Cuba to the Middle East.Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo, member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, West Point graduate:I'm proud to stand with Marco  he will be an outstanding commander-in-chief. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a veteran, there is no doubt that Marco has shown great national security leadership in the Senate.Retired Marine Lt. Col. Mike Moffett member of Gen. Tommy Franks' Central Command staff after 9/11:We need a leader with vision, courage, and the leadership qualities necessary to restore confidence in our allies while conveying clarity to potential foes. Such a leader is Senator Marco Rubio, who yesterday gave an inspiring address on the future of America's role in the world. His remarks sold me on his unique suitability to be Commander-in-Chief.I believe Senator Rubio will execute this ""first duty"" with a conviction that our nation  and the world  desperately needs. His senate record backs that up. He's been an active member on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. That background, combined with a domestic agenda that can renew the American Dream, accounts for my fervent and passionate support for his candidacy.Richard Grenell, U.S. Spokesman to the U.N. under Ambassador John Bolton:For political reporters who try to put [Rubio] in a box, like he's a first term senator, and he's young, they are surprised . . . [That's because] they haven't been watching the national security issues closely. . . . It's clear that Marco Rubio is not just learning foreign policy and memorizing the leaders and the different groups. This is not an academic exercise for him.Grenell:What most presidential candidates do is just kind of summarize past foreign policy crises to give a Wikipedia page [explanation] of what's going on. . . .Marco Rubio is actually offering solutions and he's leading the discussion.Senator Deb Fischer, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee:He is strong on national security. He understands the threats to this country. I do serve on the Armed Services Committee and I chair the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats. I know what the challenges are out there that we face. And no one knows these threats better, no one knows the challenges that we have in the world today, the dangerous world we face than Marco Rubio. That's why I'm supporting him. He will be a strong commander-in-chief. He will keep us safe. He will keep our country safe. He will keep our families safe.Senator Jim Inhofe, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee:As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Marco consistently demonstrates that he understands what it will take to keep America safe and to rebuild our place of leadership in the world. He is also one of the most informed and most knowledgeable critics of the Obama administration's failed foreign policy, not only regarding ISIS in the Middle East, but across the globe. Marco has demonstrated sound judgment in knowing who our allies are and who they are not.Former Arizona Senator Jon Kyl:I came to respect him as a real expert in matters related to our national security. He is on the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. He knows the subject very well, and he also has very good instincts about what we should do.Former Texas Senator Phil Gramm:He's [the] best prepared on national security.Gramm:I think he has the judgment, the wisdom, the foreign policy experience. I think he's right on terrorism.Max Boot, Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, on an appearance Marco made there:It felt as if he were taking a Ph.D. oral exam in foreign policy  and he passed easily. . . He never seemed the slightest bit flustered, he always had cogent points to make, and he had a plethora of specific facts to cite in his answers about everything from Iraq to China.Arizona Congressman Matt Salmon, member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs:More than any other candidate, Marco Rubio has the right ideas to take on the threats we face around the world. As a member of the Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees, he has seen firsthand the importance of identifying our enemies and standing by our friends, and he knows what it takes to win the war against ISIS.California Congressman Darrell Issa, member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs:He's been fighting for a lot of things I believe in, and he's not afraid to engage on the hottest subjects. That's important because the next president's going to have to fix a lot of broken things including our foreign policy.California Congressman Doug LaMalfa:When it comes to terrorism, Marco Rubio understands the threats facing our country and he knows what is required to defeat terrorism. Marco is fully prepared to be our next Commander In Chief and he has my full support. I proudly endorse Marco Rubio for President.Colorado Congressman Mike Coffman, member of the House Committee on Armed Services:Marco understands the threats facing our country and his plan for a New American Century will strengthen our military, keep our country safe, and it's why as a Marine Corps combat veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am proud to endorse him.Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland, member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence:Marco's experience on the Senate Intelligence Committee and his strong stance on foreign policy make him the most qualified candidate to lead our nation. He understands the threats our country faces every day, and how to protect our nation, citizens and interests abroad.Oklahoma Congressman Markwayne Mullin:One of the most important jobs of our next president will be keeping this country safe. Senator Rubio has the knowledge and understanding of the serious threats facing this country.Pennsylvania Congressman Glenn Thompson:During these dangerous times, Marco understands national security and I am confident that he is the right leader to work to keep our families safe.Tim Mak, Daily Beast national security reporter  ""Marco Rubio Schools Jeb Bush on Foreign Policy"": The student has now become the teacher. Sen. Marco Rubio, once viewed as a protege of presidential competitor Jeb Bush, schooled the former Florida governor Wednesday evening in the first national security address of his national campaign. As compared to Jeb Bush, who fumbled and stumbled through his first major national security address, Marco Rubio delivered a master class on foreign policy that spoke to the soul of the right's hawkish neoconservatives. In New York City, before the Council of Foreign Relations and their foreign policy experts, Rubio showed himself to be a peer.John Hinderaker, Powerline Blog:When I have interviewed Marco Rubio over the years, I have been highly impressed by his command of a broad range of foreign policy issues. I consider him the strongest candidate in the 2016 field, of either party, on foreign affairs.Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal:He has in his head a fact-horde, which is immediately accessible to him as he speaks.

Ted Cruz and Rand Paul proposing a value-added tax (VAT). It's ironic for a few reasons. First, their idea of a VAT is being praised by columnists in places like the Washington Post for its efficiency in raising revenue. Second, the VAT is specifically a European-style tax that was invented by the French. (Let's just call them 'Freedom Taxes' and see if anyone notices.) Third, in world where we hear a lot about politicians wanting to 'simplify' our taxes, the VAT is fairly complex  and hidden).""

""But here's the part of Cruz's plan that raises a red flag. He says he wants a 'business flat tax,' but what he's really proposing is a value-added tax.  His proposal is a VAT because wages are nondeductible.

""Mr. Rubio argued that Mr. Cruz's 16% Business Flat Tax is actually a value-added tax, a levy on consumption used by every other industrialized nation and despised on the right as the gateway drug to socialism (only a slight exaggeration). Under Mr. Cruz's plan, businesses would be able to deduct payments to other businesses and capital expenses but not profits or wages. 'My proposal is not a VAT,' Mr. Cruz said.

I imagine that he's talking about a tax in the nature of a value-added tax. First of all, this appears to be increasing taxes, which I've said we wouldn't do. But a value-added tax actually gives a government a chance to blindfold the people and grow in stature and size. First of all, you are kind of interfering with one of the principal sources of local government levels and State governments in their use of the sales tax, since the Federal Government had soyou might say, confiscated the area of the income tax. But the other thing with that tax is, it's hidden in the price of a product. And that tax can quietly be increased, and all the people know is that the price went up, and they don't know whether the price went up because somebody got a raise, or whether the company wanted to increase profits, or whether it was government.

PALIN: ""National sales tax is going to affect every single one of us and take away more opportunities and freedoms to grow, to progress, especially with our small businesses, as more people pay attention to that discussion on the only way to pay for this government largesse is a value added tax, borrowing more money, not drilling for our own domestic supplies of resources, but being even more reliant on foreign sources as we're headed if we say no to off shore drilling, if we keep ANWR locked up, if we're not aggressive about getting Alaska's natural gas pipeline.""

Put simply, a VAT is a European-style sales tax. It's assessed on the profits generated at every stage of production (raw material, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, etc.), so there is constant reporting and payment. As such, it's an extremely efficient money machine for big government. The VAT is embedded inside the price of a good (as opposed to the U.S., where sales tax is transparent and on top of the price). As such, people forget they pay it, and European governments have found it too easy to raise the tax repeatedly over time."" (Human Events, Grover Norquist, 4/23/10)Senator Cruz's VAT could be ""a relatively simple way of getting more revenue to finance European-style big government."" ""But it's still a red flag because I worry about what might happen in the future.

While retail sales taxes applied by states and localities in the U.S. are generally made explicit to the consumer, it is customary in many VAT jurisdictions overseas to prohibit shoppers from seeing the portion of their bill that goes to funding government.

Moreover with the personal and business tax systems still in effect Cruz's plan sacrifices simplification and would still necessitate a substantial taxing authority to police all this (rather than 'abolish the IRS' as Cruz likes to say)."" (The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin, 10/30/15)Cruz's statement that he would ""abolish"" the IRS ""is an overstatement."" ""Mr. Cruz talks frequently about shutting down the tax agency and sending auditors to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. It's overstated. The individual income tax will still exist. The business tax wouldrequire someone to write rules, receivethe money,audit companies and collect unpaid taxes  and the payroll tax it replaces is relatively simple to administer. Perhaps the IRS could be smaller, but 'abolish' is an overstatement."" (The Wall Street Journal, 1/15/16)Senator Cruz's support for a VAT has been echoed by leading liberals:""Paul Volcker, Nancy Pelosi, John Podesta and other allies of the Obama Administration have already floated the idea of an American VAT."" ""As Americans rush to complete their annual tax returns today, there is still some consolation in knowing that it could be worse: Like Europeans, we could pay both income taxes and a value-added tax, or VAT. And maybe we soon will.

(The Wall Street Journal, Editorial, 4/15/10)Obama: The VAT is ""something that would be novel  for the United States."" ""A value-added tax (VAT) is a 'novel' idea for the U.S., President Barack Obama said Wednesday. The president neither ruled in nor ruled out implementing a VAT on goods and services, saying that he is waiting to see what recommendations the committee he's set up on deficit reduction will generate. 'You know, I know that there's been a lot of talk around town lately about the value-added tax  that is something that has worked for some countries,' Obama said in an interview with CNBC. 'It's something that would be novel  for the United States.'"" (The Hill, 4/21/10)Nancy Pelosi: ""But in the scheme of things, I think it's fair to look at a value-added tax as well."" ""Candor about taxes is rare in Washington, so when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admits that Democrats may have to impose a huge new tax on the middle class to fund their spending ambitions, believe her. Speaking with PBS's Charlie Rose on Monday, Mrs. Pelosi mused publicly about the rising possibility of enacting a value-added tax, or VAT, as part of broader tax reform. 'Somewhere along the way, a value-added tax plays into this,' she said. 'Of course, we want to take down the health-care cost, that's one part of it. But in the scheme of things, I think it's fair to look at a value-added tax as well.'"" (The Wall Street Journal, 10/8/09)John Podesta called ""for a 'small and more progressive' VAT."" ""John Podesta, an adviser to President Obama and president of the very liberal Center for American Progress, called in September for a 'small and more progressive' VAT.""

But, he wondered, does Marco think the campaign will just keep surging from here?That's not the key question, Marco said  ""because God is in control over everything.""Here is what I am at peace with: whatever happens next, God will either give me the ability to get around it or the strength to go through it.

I am so blessed for me to complain about anything would truly be greedy.The stakes for this election are high, Marco said  but America's about more than just our government and our politics.I do feel great about our momentum and more importantly I feel optimistic about America. You know why? Because America is not a government. Our government is messed up. You are our country. And tomorrow morning  well, maybe not tomorrow morning because it is President's Day. Tuesday morning, you are going to get up and go to work. You are going to raise your families. You are going to run your businesses. You are going to volunteer in your community.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 16, 2016",Press Release - Did You Know the EPA Could Be Coming after Your Homebuilt Race Car?,"For years, Marco has been talking about the EPA's affinity for job-killing regulations, but they go after Americans' hobbies with pointless power grabs, too.Now, the EPA is coming to your local racetrack.In July of 2015, the EPA issued over 600 pages of proposed rules on ""Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles."" You might be wondering: What does this have to do with race cars? Good question. The common sense answer would be nothing. But this the EPA we're talking about.The EPA recently stated that an emissions-certified vehicle (i.e., a regular car) cannot be modified into a race car in a way that violates the Clean Air Act.So race cars that range from modified sports cars to Mini Stock cars could be in violation of EPA rules.The EPA maintains this is merely a ""clarification"" of its existing rules, not a new rule, but hobbyists are worried their cars are now technically illegal.Of course the rule could never make any dent in air pollution, but it could get in the way of you or your neighbor's hobby.SEMA, which represents manufacturers of aftermarket car parts, denounced the EPA's ""clarification,"" saying the following:The regulation would impact all vehicle types, including the sports cars, sedans and hatch-backs commonly converted strictly for use at the track. While the Clean Air Act prohibits certain modifications to motor vehicles, it is clear that vehicles built or modified for racing, and not used on the streets, are not the ""motor vehicles"" that Congress intended to regulate.""This proposed regulation represents overreaching by the agency, runs contrary to the law and defies decades of racing activity where EPA has acknowledged and allowed conversion of vehicles,"" said SEMA President and CEO Chris Kersting. ""Congress did not intend the original Clean Air Act to extend to vehicles modified for racing and has re-enforced that intent on more than one occasion.""There's now a White House petition to stop the EPA, which gained over 100,000 signatures in less than 24 hours!For the sake of America and American jobs  and racing fans everywhere  we need a President who will stand up to the EPA and rein in out of control government regulation."

Listen to His Response.,"February 16, 2016This morning on the nationally syndicated Mike Gallagher Show, Marco was asked about Ted Cruz's continued attacks. Here's his response.Unfortunately, although he's a friend of mine, Ted Cruz has spent the better part of the last two weeks making things up, about my record. On Planned Parenthood, so National Right to Life had to rebuke him. He had an ad pulled off the air because he was not being truthful about my position on sanctuary cities. He was not being truthful about my position on the definition of marriage, so, you know, you can't let those things stand.Indeed, a Cruz Super PAC ad was pulled off the air because of legal worries and pro-life leaders from around the country rebuked Cruz's attack on Marco's exceptional record on life.Whenever he can, Marco's going to keep his message focused on strengthening America and creating opportunity. When he's attacked, however, he'll respond, and he'll call out dishonesty."

And without any question, head and shoulders above the other 11 candidates, was Marco Rubio. When I think about the fact my brother is a Colonel in the Air Force, I think about the guy I want leading this country on day one as commander-in-chief, my answer was simply, Marco Rubio.Rep. Gowdy was asked about the campaign's expectations in the Palmetto State:Well, Sean, he had such a great night Saturday night. He looked so presidential. He may be the youngest from a chronological standpoint but he sure seemed like an adult Saturday night in Greenville during the debate. He's also got the most popular elected official in the entire state in Tim Scott supporting him and going around the state. I think when people get to meet Marco, we had a fabulous crowd yesterday in Easley. We had a great crowd this morning.

That Marco supported sanctuary cities. In reality, he plans to cut off their federal funding as President.The extreme dishonesty is of a part with the Cruz campaign's tactics recently: They've lied about Marco's pro-life record, drawing condemnation from top pro-life conservatives, lied about his record on marriage, misrepresented Cruz's own record on judicial nominations, and resorted to dirty campaigning tricks like false robo-calls and push polls."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 17, 2016",Press Release - This Major Leader on Veterans Issues Just Endorsed Marco Rubio,"Sean Parnell is a highly decorated combat veteran of the war in Afghanistan and is the New York Times bestselling author of Outlaw Platoon. He is also the co-founder of the American Warrior Initiative. Here's what he has to say about Marco's leadership on veterans' issues:As a retired Army veteran wounded in Afghanistan, I have seen countless examples of true leadership and commitment to those who have served our nation in uniform. Sadly, these qualities have been sorely missing over the past seven years at both the commander-in-chief level and at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This year's presidential election is a chance to put these issues front and center and elect a president who can actually reverse course, rebuild our military, and honor our veterans with real, fundamental reforms at the VA.There are many solid candidates running for the GOP nomination, all of which say good things about fixing the VA. All would be better than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanderseach an apologist for a failed VA bureaucracy. I firmly believe America's veterans deserve a president who isn't just outraged with the VA's ongoing problems and scandals, but also has a proven record of doing something about it.That is why, as a long-time advocate for veterans and VA reform, I feel a responsibility to set the record straight about the candidate who has truly made veterans issues a priority, doggedly fought for VA accountability, and ultimately gotten results for veterans. I can attest to the fact that Senator Marco Rubio is that kind of leader  because I have seen it firsthand.Before the VA's recent scandals even became public and rocked our nation, Senator Rubio teamed up with House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller to introduce the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014, which would give the VA secretary the authority to fire VA managers who were failing at their jobs. To Senator Rubio, it didn't take a scandal for him to spring into action and lead on this accountability issue; he had already seen the cases of terrible treatment come through his Senate officeand resolved to take action. To Senator Rubio, this was also personal, as he saw his older brother, a former Green Beret, embroiled in a years-long dispute with the VA over dental care for an injury sustained while serving.One would think that Senator Rubio's proposal for firing the people responsible for the VA scandals would find unanimous support in Congress, but it didn't. Entrenched public sector unions opposed the bill, as did their congressional allies, including then-Senate VA committee chairman Bernie Sanders who blocked it. Undeterred, Rubio worked at it, showing his passion for veterans but also the leadership skills to get things done for us. As he worked to advance the bill, there were no headlines to be had and it was an uphill battle  yet Senator Rubio and his staff persisted.He went out and rallied public support for it. He quietly reached across the aisle and convinced Democrats and Republicans alike to co-sponsor the bill on its merits, resulting in a majority of senators backing it. Although then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to hold a vote on it, Rubio would not accept defeat. Every day seemed to expose a new failing of the VA under President Obama and, when the House and Senate passed different bills to fundamentally reform the VA, Rubio was asked to join the conference committee that negotiated a final bill  even though he does not even serve on the veterans committee that usually works on these issues.Ultimately, Rubio succeeded in getting new VA accountability measures passed into law as part of a larger VA reform bill. But when it comes to helping our veterans, he's not done. He has aggressively stayed on top of the administration to fully implement this law and fire all VA managers who are responsible for failing our veterans. He is again working with Jeff Miller on a new bill, the VA Accountability Act of 2015, which would expand the VA secretary's firing authority to any VA employee that fails our veterans a commonsense measure that the VA unions again oppose, that Senate Democrats are determined to block and that President Obama has already threatened to veto.In addition to prioritizing and fully implementing these accountability measures at the VA, Rubio's record and agenda offer additional proof that he'd be a president that takes care of our veterans and makes sure they have opportunities to achieve the American Dream after their service to our country is complete. Among many issues he has championed, Senator Rubio supports fundamentally reforming our VA health system and giving veterans real health care choices when the VA fails to take care of them. He knows it's not just about accountability, but also giving veterans choices to access VA care or care from private providers. Senator Rubio and his office are always looking for the best ideas to help veterans, and always ahead of the curve on real policy reform.South Carolina voters and veterans will soon go to the polls to choose a president and commander-in-chief. There are lots of strong options. But if fixing the VA, rebuilding our military, and doing right by our veterans is a top priority for you, then Senator Rubio should be your first and only choice. I can attest that he is fully committed  and capable  of putting an end to the bureaucratic nightmares that have plagued the VA and our veterans altogether. We deserve nothing less."

I can honestly say I can't imagine doing anything different with my time for the past 5 months; us volunteers have all truly become a family. I love campaigning and I encourage everyone to get involved  just go here to sign up to volunteer in your state, and go here to make calls from home!I promise the experience is worth everything and more. I hope to see you on the trail! "

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 20, 2016",Press Release - Read Marco Rubio's Stirring Tribute to Justice Scalia,"February 20, 2016By Marco RubioAntonin Scalia entered the world as the son and grandson of Italian immigrants in 1936. When he unexpectedly departed this life last week, he was the patriarch of a large American family and the intellectual father of the most important legal movement in generations. Between those points, he lived an extraordinarily full life that helped shaped the course of our country.By 1980, Scalia had already accomplished more at the age of 44 than most can ever hope to in a lifetime. He had been a distinguished lawyer, served at the highest levels of the government, and taught at the country's best law schools. He might have continued to develop a reputation as the nation's brightest law professor and scholar, but providence had still more to ask of him.Upon his election, President Ronald Reagan came to Washington with a mission to restore a country that seemed divided and in decline. He promised to rebuild our military, revive our economy, and restore our sense of purpose. Just as critical as these efforts, Reagan was determined to bring new life to our founders' vision of our Constitution, which provided for carefully limited government, separation of powers and the rule of law. In accordance with that determination, Reagan appointed Scalia first to the critical D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court of the United States. The three decade judicial career that followed would establish Justice Scalia as one of the most influential American jurists and one of the most consequential Americans in our nation's history.The federal judiciary that Scalia joined in 1982 had, for too long, both abused and shirked its proper role. It had stripped the American people and their elected representatives of their legitimate powers by inventing brand new ""constitutional rights"" practically out of thin air. Just as troubling, it had failed to uphold the very real constitutional limits on government. The courts too often treated the text of statutes as mere suggestions and often appointed themselves as a kind of super-legislature.Scalia would not stand for this. He saw this prevailing approach of judges as an abuse of power and a threat to a free and self-governing people. For Scalia, the rule of law was the touchstone of liberty, and judges had an important role in upholding it. He understood that America has a written constitution for clear reasons: to restrict government and preserve liberty. As a judge, Scalia insisted that the Constitution be applied as written and originally understood, not freely interpreted by unelected judges. If the Constitution must change, as it has needed to throughout our history, the document itself offers an amendment process.Justice Scalia had a sharp and well-articulated legal philosophy that put the text and meaning of the Constitution and law front and center. A judge, Scalia believed, must put aside his policy preferences in order to say what the law is. ""The judge who always likes the results he reaches is a bad judge,"" he said.Justice Scalia lived out this approach on the bench. His majority opinions established clear and well-articulated precedents. His sharp and colorful dissents brilliantly exposed moments when too many of his colleagues preferred to put policy preferences and outcomes above the Constitution and the rule of law. For conservatives, the words ""Scalia dissents"" always offered a silver lining; they meant that a likely damaging legal precedent would at least come pre-packaged with a wonderfully readable corrective.Whether he was on the majority or minority side of a decision, the forceful logic and clear phrasing of Scalia's opinions commanded attention and engagement. Over time, his most reliable intellectual adversaries found themselves increasingly forced to fight on the ground he established. While Justice Scalia did not win every argument, he changed the conversation forever. Judicial activism no longer has a free hand, because Scalia challenged it and inspired an entire generation of legal minds to follow his example.His judicial writing alone would have changed American law and advanced the cause of liberty, but Justice Scalia went further than that. He wrote books, lectured and mentored students. He traveled around the country, engaged the media, and debated colleagues and critics. His many law clerks now distinguish themselves throughout the legal profession. The Federalist Society, which he helped nurture in its fledgling years, now provides a lively forum for a variety of conservative and libertarian perspectives on law. Antonin Scalia has left us a legal culture absolutely transformed from the one he found.Justice Scalia's judicial opinions, legal philosophy, and forceful advocacy for the rule of law inspired me as a law student and continue to inspire me to this day. While a wide array of life experiences and values have shaped the way I see America and the world, Antonin Scalia has been the single most important influence on my view of the Constitution and the proper role of judges in our Republic as men and women who should put the original meaning of our Constitution ahead of their policy preferences.Clearly, the Supreme Court will continue wrestling with cases impacting freedom of speech, religious liberty, the right to keep and bear arms, the death penalty, abortion, the definition of marriage, and affirmative action. It will consider the constitutionality of this president's lawless affronts to our Constitution in the form of behemoth regulatory policies like the Clean Power Plan and his immigration executive orders. The Court will continue examining the constitutionality of measures we undertake to keep our people safe in the face of growing terrorist threats.But the stakes surrounding this Supreme Court vacancy will likely be even more profound because of the way this 21stcentury has unfolded so far. In this rapidly changing world, where new technologies, new security threats, growing government, and unprecedented assaults on faith are becoming all too commonplace, some judges will be increasingly tempted to step in to fill what they perceive to be policy voids our elected officials are ""too slow"" to address. They will be more tempted than ever to ""update"" the Constitution on their own to keep up with their sense of where the American people are.They would be wrong to do any of this, because one of the most important qualities all future justices must possess is the fortitude to resist the temptation to substitute the people and make new laws, or constitutional rights, on their own. I will not only nominate judges that recognize this, but I will also put the weight of the presidency behind an Article V Constitutional Convention that amends the Constitution to, among other things, impose term limits on both Congress and the federal judiciary, with the people's consent. Justice Scalia often fondly quoted Lord Acton's truth that ""power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""As Reagan's choice of Scalia has shown, the judgment a president shows in choosing Supreme Court justices is one of the most important enduring legacies of any presidency. In choosing Supreme Court justices, there can be no more surprises, no more stealth candidates, and no more relatively ""blank slates"" that offer paths of least resistance in confirming them. As president, I will nominate highly qualified individuals to the highest court of the land with a proven track record of abiding by our Constitution's originalmeaning. Just as importantly, as president, I will fight for their confirmation, whatever political capital it may cost. This will begin with the selection of Justice Scalia's successor and follow with any other vacancy that may arise.But there will be a time and place for that after this presidential election. For now, we remember the man our country has just lost.Justice Scalia's life is a testimony to the fact that ideas matter. It is proof that a person of principle, with the willingness to invest in debate and persuasion, can change history. His life also reminds us of another important truth. Particularly in these sharply divided partisan times, we can lose sight of the fact that the things that unite us are more important than the things that divide us. Justice Scalia never did. He knew the Constitution was his sole guide in his professional life, but he was also a devout Catholic who accepted that God has a plan for all of us. He took evident joy in living out his faith, in loving his family and in nurturing countless friendships, even with his ideological foes. We should all be grateful that God's plan for our nation, especially the people whose paths he crossed, included having Justice Scalia on the Court for the past thirty years. He was a role model for all us, and particularly for Christians in public life.As a U.S. senator, I led a bipartisan group of colleagues in filing an amicus brief in the Supreme Court. The brief, submitted in the case ofTown of Greece vs. Galloway, defended the practice of legislative prayer. It argued that the original meaning of the First Amendment clearly did not require the purging of religious expression from the public square. I attended the oral argument in the case and will forever be grateful for having had the opportunity to watch Justice Scalia's sharp and incisive questioning from the bench.Although I did not have the good fortune to get to know Justice Scalia personally, he had a profound impact on me. All those who cherish the Constitution and limited government mourn this great loss. Justice Scalia was a brilliant legal mind who served with honor, distinction and only one legal objective: to interpret and defend the Constitution as written. He is a model for exactly what his successor and all future justices should strive to be on the highest court in the land.As America honors Antonin Scalia's life and lays him to rest today, my thoughts and prayers are especially with those who knew him best: his wife Maureen, his nine children and many grandchildren, his law clerks, and his friends of all political persuasions.Antonin Scalia left us far too soon, but his legacy will remain with us as long as we remain a Republic under law."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 20, 2016",Press Release - Get the Facts about Marco Rubio's Pro-Traditional Marriage Record,"Marco's desperate opponents are misrepresenting his record on marriage and family issues. It's a common trend from his opponents: circulating falsehoods and misrepresentations to mislead voters about Marco's commitment to causes he believes in deeply.Marco has fought for traditional marriage, opposes judicial attempts to redefine it, and believes Americans who agree with him should be respected, not persecuted.Here are the facts:Marco believes that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and that the traditional family is the fundamental building block of society.Marco knows the Constitution leaves the regulation of marriage to the states. When the Supreme Court forced a false understanding of marriage on all 50 states in 2015, Marco opposed it, saying:People who disagree with the traditional definition of marriage have the right to change their state laws. That is the right of our people, not the right of the unelected judges or justices of the Supreme Court. This decision short-circuits the political process that has been underway on the state level for years.Marco will appoint judges to the Supreme Court, and lower federal courts, who believe that the federal government should not be able to impose its view on the states, and believes that is the right way to restore states' ability to make this decision democratically.Marco has been awarded the top honor and a 100 percent rating from Family Research Council Action in recognition of his record on traditional marriage and other issues.Marco has fought as a Senator for the rights of Americans to practice their traditional beliefs, including with regard to marriage. He has:Championed the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects religious institutions from vindictive government officials revoking their tax status and forbids discrimination against traditional churches and civil-society groups in federal grant-giving.Voted against new federal laws that would prevent nonprofits and employers applying their religious beliefs to hiring practices.Spoke out in favor of state laws protecting the fundamental right to freely practice one's religion.Worked to stop the federal government from punishing supporters of traditional marriage.Led the Congressional effort to reverse the Obama administration's unconstitutional, anti-conscience HHS Mandate, authoring the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2012."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 20, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio Campaign Warns South Carolina Voters of Cruz Dirty Tricks,"February 20, 2016Marco's campaign is warning South Carolina voters to beware of dirty tricks from the Cruz campaign during today's primary. Communications Director Alex Conant explained:We will not allow Ted Cruz to do to Marco in South Carolina what he did to Ben Carson in Iowa. Cruz has proven that he is willing to do or say anything to get elected. Over the last 10 days, the Cruz campaign has lied, smeared, fabricated and even photoshopped. We fear the worst dirty tricks are yet to come. We strongly urge all South Carolina Republicans to beware of suspicious news reports, emails and social media posts during tomorrow's voting. The Cruz campaign will do anything to stop Marco Rubio's momentum.South Carolina voters who suspect more dirty tricks by the Cruz campaign to immediately contact the Rubio campaign.Among the reasons why the campaign is concerned there could be foul play:Push PollsCruz supporters have reportedly been doing ""push polls"" in South Carolina, which are intended to influence voters without being forthright about where they're coming from.Ted Cruz denied all knowledge of robocalls being made in South Carolina on Thursday after Donald Trump accused the Texas senator's 'people' of 'doing very sleazy and dishonest ""pushpolls"" on me.'  The episode follows a report by The Washington Post published earlier in the day that refers to robo-calls to potential voters in South Carolina that become hostile when the respondent voices support for a candidate other than Cruz. The Texas senator's campaign denied for that story that it was responsible for the calls, which said they were being conducted by Remington Research, the name of the consulting firm started by Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager"" (Politico, 2/11/16)Fake Dog-Whistle RobocallsSome opponents of Marco's have reportedly been making Spanish-language robocalls to spread false impressions about Marco's views.Over the last week, voters in South Carolina received a robocall, recorded in Spanish, that targeted Rubio for allegedly supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants. Approximately 5 percent of South Carolinians are Hispanic, and only 72 percent of them speak Spanish at home, suggesting that the call was designed as much for its dog-whistle effect as the substance of the attack. As the Huffington Post noted, the woman on the recording heavily emphasizes the words ""Marco Rubio,"" ""amnista,"" and ""inmigracin ilegal,"" words that an English-speaking Republican would grasp immediately. ""The recording is most likely an effort to make non-Spanish-speaking voters believe that Rubio is calling Hispanics and promising amnesty,"" reporter Igor Bobic speculated. (Vanity Fair, 2/19/16)Utterly Dishonest AdsSouth Carolina television stations pulled an anti-Marco ad from a Ted Cruz super PAC after legal review.Television stations in South Carolina have pulled an ad from Stand for Truth, the 'super PAC' supporting Senator Ted Cruz, after a legal review. The ad, titled 'Sanctuary,' was a version of an ad the group ran in Iowa, criticizing Marco Rubio for his record on immigration.  ""We had our legal folks review it, and it was decided that this needed to be pulled and substituted,"" Randy Ingram, the general manager of WBTW in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said, although he couldn't recall the specifics of the legal team's decision. He said other stations in the Media General umbrella, which includes WCBD in Charleston and WSPA in Greenville/Spartanburg, also pulled the ad. The decision was made on Friday, and the ad was pulled from rotation on Saturday. (The New York Times, 2/15/16)False Rumors about OpponentsOn Iowa Caucus night, the Cruz campaign was accused of ""sabotaging [Ben] Carson"" by passing around false rumors that he was dropping out of the race:Dr. Ben Carson and his campaign accused Sen. Ted Cruz's team of sabotaging Carson in the Iowa caucuses Mondaynight by encouraging Cruz supporters to tell voters at their caucus sites  incorrectly  that Carson was dropping out of the race. 'It was happening all over,' Iowa State Director Ryan Rhodes told MSNBC. ""One of the precincts Candy [Carson, the candidate's wife] walked into, she had to correct the record. She actually walked in, in Ankeny, and gave a speech about no, he's still in the race and that's a lie."" (MSNBC, 2/1/16)Lying about Marco's Stance on Life and MarriageTed Cruz has repeatedly told South Carolinians that Marco isn't fully supportive of defunding Planned Parenthood. National Right to Life has called Cruz's attacks on Marco ""inaccurate and misleading.""The National Right to Life, one of the chief arbiters of social issues in GOP politics, quickly stepped in to back Rubio and called Cruz's Friday remarks 'inaccurate and misleading.' 'Marco Rubio voted to defund Planned Parenthood before Ted Cruz ever got to the U.S. Senate. Since Ted Cruz joined the U.S. Senate, both he and Sen. Rubio have voted the same on every roll call that National Right to Life regards as pertinent to defunding Planned Parenthood,' said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life. (Politico, 2/12/16)Cruz has also lied about Marco's position on marriage, claiming it's the same as President Obama's.The Weekly Standard's Michael Warren said Cruz is being deceptive.CAROL COSTELLO: ""I will say Michael the gay marriage issue is probably very important in a state like South Carolina, and he wants to get ahead of what Ted Cruz is accusing him of."" MICHAEL WARREN: ""That's right. Let's be honest here I mean Cruz is being somewhat shifty on this at least with regard to Marco Rubio. I mean Rubio came out after that decision and said that while this is the law of the land, that he would appoint court appointments who would seek to overturn this law. So Cruz isn't being quite forthright about this."" (CNN, 2/13/16)Personal AttacksCruz staff have now repeatedly attacked Congressman Trey Gowdy, a widely respected conservative, for defending Marco Rubio.On Fox News, Cruz's communications director attacked Gowdy's intelligence:GRETCHEN CARLSON: A pretty strong statement now coming from Trey Gowdy. The accusations were alive and well in Iowa as well with your camp against Ben Carson where you had to apologize. So what do you say in this case?"" RICK TYLER: ""Well, first of all Trey Gowdy, who was a former federal prosecutor with apparently limited skills, failed to look up that that Facebook started in 2014"" (Fox News, 2/17/16)"

Unfortunately, while Marco was leading the crowd in prayer, some were writing scripts for anonymous phone calls using the incident to suggest Marco was leaving the race. These calls are false, malicious, and beneath the dignity of all South Carolinians.Because of his track record in spreading such false rumors as he did in Iowa, Senator Cruz should immediately repudiate these calls.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 21, 2016",Press Release - Read This Nevada Marine Corps Vet's Take on Why Marco Rubio Is His Pick,"Nevada StateAssemblyman Derek Armstrong is a Marine Corps Staff Sergeant veteran and a member ofNevada's Homeland Security Commission. Here's what he has to say about Marco's national security record:For the first time since World War II, our armed forces are at risk of being ill-equipped to handle the ever-growing and dynamic threats we face abroad. Under Barack Obama's presidency, our military has faced neglect and disdain, as our weapons systems have been cut and our military leaders ignored. Marco Rubio has fought these cuts that have harmed our military and broken our sacred compact with our men and women in uniform to ensure they are never sent into a fair fight.As president, Marco will reverse the damage President Obama has inflicted on our military and restore it to readiness levels not seen since the last decade.For example, the Obama Administration has pursued efforts to weaken our close air support capability by attempting to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt. The A-10 is a vital piece of the American arsenal that our ground troops in Afghanistan and Iraq repeatedly call upon for rapid and overwhelming firepower from the skies. As our soldiers and marines have stated time and again, there is no other aircraft in our military's arsenal that can provide the same type of devastating low-flying air protection.In the Senate, Marco has consistently voted for the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the most recent of which blocked the A-10's retirement, provided platform upgrades, restored necessary personnel and support, and ensured the fleet would remain flying for years to come.It is critically important that our warfighters are able to maintain a state of cutting-edge technological readiness through advanced operations facilities such as Nellis Air Force Base here in Nevada, where state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles are remotely operated.This installation supports some of our most important reconnaissance assets and provides our military leaders with an unparalleled ability to monitor global theaters of operation thousands of miles away. This is another reason why Marco has consistently voted for the NDAA, which also provided increased resources for training of unmanned systems pilots and joint terminal controllers. When Marco is president, he will prioritize the growth and support of our strategic reconnaissance and surveillance capacities overseas.The 2014, 2015, and 2016 NDAAs all included provisions prohibiting the Defense Department from conducting a new round of base closures  protecting vital facilities such as Nellis Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Fallon.Other candidates tout their strong support for military readiness, but their records say something entirely different. For example, Senator Ted Cruz voted against the NDAA three times, effectively voting to deny funding to our armed forces and voting against these key provisions that benefited Nevada. One can only assume that if he would consistently vote against the NDAA, he would veto it if elected president. This dangerous posturing has no place in the White House.If we continue down our current path, we are at risk of having the smallest Air Force this country has ever seen. When Marco is president, he will put an immediate stop to this trend and put our armed forces back on track to maintaining their status as the most feared military in world, able to strike anywhere at a moment's notice. Marco will help ensure that Nevada continues to play an important role in ensuring that our military can fulfill this responsibility."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 23, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio Slams Obama's Incoherent Gitmo Plan,"President Obama's dangerous and disastrous national security policy continues with the release of his so-called ""plan"" to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. After seven years, President Obama has still not explained to the American people in sufficient detail where, under what authorities, and at what cost he will detain some of the world's most dangerous terrorists.His latest effort is a continuation of prioritizing his own legacy over the safety of the American people.In the Senate, I have sponsored and supported legislation to prohibit dangerous detainee transfers, block funds for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and prevent the return of the facility to Cuba. And I have stood with Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Cory Gardner (R-CO), and Pat Roberts (R-KS) to oppose bringing terrorists to facilities in South Carolina, Colorado, and Kansas, because it is unnecessary, expensive and, most importantly, dangerous.As President, I will focus America's detention policy exclusively on protecting our national security, keeping dangerous terrorists off the battlefield, and ensuring our military and intelligence professionals have the authorities and tools they need to extract valuable intelligence from captured terrorists and prevent attacks on our homeland. If we capture terrorists alive, they will get a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, and we will find out everything they know. Enemy combatants suitable for trial will be tried in military tribunals. And no Guantanamo detainees will be brought to the United States for trial in our courts.Our nation cannot afford to let Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders take us back to the failed pre-9/11 law enforcement approach to counterterrorism. Our nation is at war with radical jihadists.As Commander-in-Chief, I will use every available tool to destroy them."

Endorsing Marco today are Luis Fortuo, Jenniffer Gonzalez, Zoraida Fonalledas, and Jose Carrion.Luis Fortuo, who served as Governor of Puerto Rico from 2009-2012 and represented Puerto Rico in Congress as ResidentCommissionerfrom 2005-2009, hadthis to say: Washington today is plagued by the same problems we see in San Juan: politicians who tax too much, spend too much and lack the courage to solve the great challenges of our time. Marco Rubio would change that. He can inspire us to greatness, and has the judgment, vision and strong values to be a great president. Marco can be trusted to deliver real results, because he's an ideas man with a relentless drive to make a difference in the lives of real people. As American citizens, Puerto Ricans deserve better than the failed leadership they've gotten during the last eight years, which would continue if the Democrats retained the White House. Marco Rubio is the only candidate in this race who can unite us, win the White House and lead us into a New American Century.Jenniffer Gonzalez, Minority Leader of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, added?: With Marco Rubio, the Republican Party of this New American Century will demonstrate that it recognizes the many Hispanic citizens who share our party's conservative ideals and who understand the value of work, family, community and church. These citizens seek a leader like Marco who will energize constituencies that in the past have been left behind. Marco speaks to the young, to women, to the unemployed, and those for whom equality is a promise not yet achieved, including the people of Puerto Rico who seek the tools to improve our island economy, create jobs, and achieve full equality as Americans.Zoraida Fonalledas, RNC national committeewoman, spoke about Marco's actions to stand up for the Puerto Rican people:We need a president like Marco who was raised in a family that understands what it's like to struggle, persevere and achieve the American Dream, and who understands that dream is only possible if we keep our nation safe and have a vibrant free enterprise economy. Puerto Rico may not have a vote in the Senate, but Marco Rubio has been looking out for us throughout his time there and standing up against the unequal treatment Puerto Ricans face when it comes to many federal policies. I encourage all Puerto Rican Republicans  on the island and on the mainland  to join me in supporting Marco Rubio for president, as he will be a leader that helps all Americans, including Puerto Rico's 3.5 U.S. citizens, achieve the full and equal promise of achieving our dreams as Americans.Jose Carrion, a Republican fundraiser?, says it's all about leadership:Marco has all the leadership qualities we need in a president, and is a man who will never forget that he leads a nation that also includes Puerto Rico's 3.5 million American citizens. I'm proud to endorse Marco for President, and it's critical that we stand with him as the only leader who can not only unite our party and our nation but also get things done."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 24, 2016",Press Release - WATCH: Marco Rubio Reminds Us a Majority of Republicans Really Do Not Want Trump,"February 24, 2016Marco was on all four morning shows on Wednesday to react to the results of the Nevada caucuses, where he finished a strong second.One key point he emphasized: most Republicans really do not want Donald Trump to be their nominee.The majority of the Republican electorate, the majority of Republican voters in this country do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee. I think that is pretty clear now. The problem is that they're divided up among four people. At some point in South Carolina, it was five people and before that seven people. So until there is some consolidation here, you aren't going to have a clear alternative to Donald Trump. And the argument we have made: I'm as conservative as everyone in this race, but I am the conservative that can unify the Republican Party.He also noted that he's coming out of Nevada with a number of delegates, and that's how the race is ultimately decided:And, he pointed out, we need a nominee who can win over new voters to the conservative cause, and he's the guy who can do that:"

Most important of all for me, Marco has a thorough knowledge of foreign policy and fully understands the true nature of the terrorist threat.Congressman King represents New York's 2nd congressional district.

The former Governor is joining Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe and Congressman Markwayne Mullinin endorsing Marco.Here's why Keating is joining the team:Before the privilege of serving as Governor of Oklahoma, I had the honor to work in the Reagan administration and witnessed how President Reagan inspired so many when talking about the greatness of our country,"" Governor Keating said. ""Marco Rubio speaks about America the same way. He understands that we are a unique and exceptional nation, and I'm supporting him because I know he is determined to preserve that.America faces great challenges and we need a president willing to confront them. I have been particularly focused on the high cost of housing that continues to crush middle and lower income Americans and our criminal justice system that is in need of desperate reform. Having looked at Marco's record and listened to what he plans to do as President, I'm confident that he will put forward bold and meaningful solutions that address both of these pressing challenges.I hope all Oklahomans will join with me in voting for Marco on March 1st so that we can have a nominee that can win this fall and bring back Reagan-style principles back to the White House.Frank Keating was the Governor of Oklahoma from 1995 to 2003, and held critical positions in the Reagan Administration and the H. W. Bush Administration. Keating was a strong fiscal conservative as governor, who turned conservative principles into action.Governor Keating, welcome to Team Marco!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - Two Major MA Papers Just Endorsed Marco Rubio,"Two major Massachusetts newspapers have endorsed Marco Rubio  and it's a good sign of how he can unite the Republican party.First, the Boston Herald, Boston's conservative paper, endorsed Marco, commending him as a member of a new generation of conservatives:It is clear that, in what is for all practical purposes a three-way race, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida represents the Republicans' best hope to bring the party and the country together. The Herald is pleased to endorse him for the Republican nomination.Consider that among South Carolina voters who said the ability to win in November mattered most, Rubio was miles ahead of his rivals. He was the top pick of voters who prioritized experience. A Cuban-American who has developed strong relationships within and outside of his own party, Rubio could be a demographic game-changer for the GOP. . . .[And] Rubio happens to be an ideas kind of guy  solid on policy, too.He has been a strong voice in favor of reducing the size of the federal government, while increasing accountability for government spending and promoting pro-business tax policies. He backs practical reforms to entitlement programs. He has called for ""a return to the Constitution,"" in contrast to the current occupant of the White House, who is content to ignore that precious document when it suits his needs.Then, the Springfield Republican, from the western end of the state, endorsed Marco too.The editors explicitly said they don't agree with Marco on every issue, but they see him as the candidate who can stop Donald Trump and get our country back on track:If primary voters in the Bay State (and elsewhere) can get behind Rubio, he'd likely have a good chance of defeating billionaire blowhard Trump for the GOP presidential nomination. And the party would be saved from having been taken over by an entertainer whose entire campaign has been based on empty promises. And a cult of personality.Rubio, in other words, is the GOP's last, best hope to stop the Trump train before it gathers so much steam that it cannot be halted.Elections are best when they offer a choice between two competing, clearly articulated visions of the future. If Rubio emerges as the Republican nominee, that would be the case, whether he ultimately faces Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in November.Marco also has the backing of a number of top Massachusetts conservative leaders in state government and the Eagle Tribune, a paper in central Massachusetts."

Mr. Petrina, who declined to comment, is of Romanian descent and has an office in Romania, which has served as a de facto labor pool for many European countries. Employers are obligated to pay for workers' transportation to the United States and any recruitment fees. The visas are valid for 10 months, although in some circumstances they can be extended to three years. Mr. Petrina recruits for other American employers, but highlights his connection to Mr. Trump in Romania, where newspaper articles say that he tries to recruit young people who take hospitality courses in college.""

The full list of supporters is included below.Adam Hasner, Marco Rubio For President Statewide Co-Chair & Former House Majority Leader:Marco's going to win the White House because he shares the American people's frustration with the disastrous eight years we've had under Obama, and he knows how to channel that feeling into innovative policy ideas, unite our country and lead us into the future. Our growing support in Florida is a strong sign that we'll have the team in place to turn out the early vote in the coming weeks and close the deal with a victory on March 15.Congressman Tom Rooney, Marco Rubio For President Statewide Co-Chair: Marco has been the best candidate since day one ,and I'm glad to see so many in the Florida delegation supporting him.

Our time to come together is now and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to become the 45th President of the United States.Adam Putnam, Agriculture Commissioner: After eight years of Barack Obama, our nation is in desperate need of strong conservative leadership.

Our country needs a President who can unite us, inspire us, and lead us into the future. Marco Rubio was an outstanding Speaker of the Florida House and United States Senator. Marco is the only candidate who can reignite our economy, restore our leadership on the international stage after the failures of the feckless Clinton-Obama foreign policy, and revive the promise of the American Dream so our children inherit an America that is stronger and more prosperous than ever before. I am honored to endorse Marco Rubio for President of the United States, and I look forward to helping him defeat Hillary Clinton in November.Richard Corcoran, Speaker-Designate of the House: Marco Rubio understands that we are a country of families, faith, and freedom.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 26, 2016",Press Release - Fact Check: Did Marco Rubio Take the Lead on the ObamaCare Bailouts?,"Marco led the fight against the ObamaCare bailout fund that to date has saved taxpayers $2.5 billion. Check out the facts below:Marco was the first to identifythe likelihood of an ObamaCare bailout in November 2013.Marco introduced legislation to stop it.Marco rallied support from conservative organizations and members of Congress.Marco ultimately succeeded by making it a Republican priority in the 2014 spending bill that became law.Marco made stopping the ObamaCare bailout a top priority of his conservative agenda, and succeeded because he was able to get others to buy into that agenda.And check out these media accounts:RedState: ""Marco Rubio Helps Kill Obamacare.""

Marco Rubio may have dealt the biggest blow in the GOP's five-year war against ObamaCare. A 2014 budget measure inspired by the Florida senator and presidential hopeful is pushing some insurers to drop out of the ObamaCare exchanges, experts say. (The Hill, 11/24/15)Rubio provision has ""rattled confidence in the durability of President Obama's signature health law.""A little-noticed health care provision that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida slipped into a giant spending law last year has tangled up the Obama administration, sent tremors through health insurance markets and rattled confidence in the durability of President Obama's signature health law.

Ted Cruz (R-Fla.), who led the shutdown proclaiming only he was a true anti-Obamacare fighter, Rubio can claim a concrete, major accomplishment. That is hard to do for a freshman senator in a body that until recently took very few votes. It just might turn out to be the calling card he needs to climb over the rest of the pack. (Jennifer Rubin, The Washington Post, 11/25/15)""Rubio has already taken major steps toward dismantling ObamaCare.""Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio has already taken major steps toward dismantling Obamacare. The Florida Republican managed to tack on a policy rider to the 2014 Cromnibus spending bill preventing the risk corridor program from bailing out insurance companies losing money under the administration's landmark health-care legislation, and is hoping to do it again. (Daily Caller, 12/9/15)""Marco Rubio has already cut ObamaCare's throat.""ObamaCare is on death watch. On Wednesday, Cigna CEO David Cordani said the giant insurer won't commit to offering policies on the ObamaCare exchanges beyond next year. This, just two weeks after a similar announcement from the country's largest insurer, UnitedHealth. The problem: Exchange policies (written by Democratic politicians and bureaucrats) turn out to be a good deal only if you're sick. Healthy folks have been opting out  so not enough are paying premiums to make selling the policies profitable. One gimmick might keep insurers in the game: The law's 'risk corridor' provision allowed Washington to tax profitable exchange plans to prop up unprofitable ones. But even in Year One, there weren't enough profits to cover the losses  so Team Obama transferred money from elsewhere. This subsidy was entirely distinct from the law's support for lower-income folks: It was a bailout for the companies. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put a stop to that last year, passing an amendment that prevents these back-door bailouts. (New York Post, Editorial, 12/10/15)Rubio provision being credited ""with shielding taxpayers from jittery health insurance companies that may be eyeing shaky bottom lines.""Marco Rubio's Republican presidential bid is getting a surprisingly big boost from a little-known legislative tweak he helped tuck into last year's spending bill  one that ObamaCare critics are crediting with shielding taxpayers from jittery health insurance companies that may be eyeing shaky bottom lines. The provision, similar to one he's pushing this year, prohibits billion-dollar bailouts for private insurers under the Affordable Care Act.

The angst in the industry centers on an obscure program in the healthcare law known as 'risk corridors' that was designed to shield insurers against losses. Rubio in 2013 went on the warpath against the program, decrying it as a 'taxpayer bailout.' He penned op-eds against it, testified about it as the star witness at a House Oversight Committee hearing and even made his case to top House Republicans like then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). (The Hill, 11/24/15)FACT: Marco rallied conservatives to the cause.In October 2014, it was Marco who led an effort of Senate conservatives to warn Speaker Boehner about the ObamaCare bailout fund. Check it out HERE.FACT: When the House took up risk corridors, they called upon Marco.Chairman Darrell Issa in February 2014: Marco ""has proposed a bill to repeal the Risk Corridors in the president's healthcare law"" that is ""a timely proposal.""Therefore, we are not neutral observers. But CBO is a neutral observer. And I believe that the testimony that's going to be given today by our distinguished senator from Florida, Senator Rubio, who has proposed a bill to repeal the Risk Corridors in the president's healthcare law comes both with a timely proposal and with a recognition that after you guarantee that insurance companies cannot lose money, it is little surprise that when the president makes changes which will adversely affect the profit projects of insurance companies, you hear not a word.

It's 100 percent true that Trump Tower was built on the backs of illegal immigrant workers, Polish men who suffered horrible working conditions and, in many cases, never even got paid what they were due.CNN looked into the matter after Marco raised it last night:Here's a report from 1998:Eighteen years ago, Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump Tower, the skyscraper jewel in Donald J. Trump's real-estate empire. Today, Mr. Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe benefits.""We worked in horrid, terrible conditions,"" Mr. Kozak said of the six months he spent in 1980 wielding a sledgehammer and a blowtorch in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump Tower. ""We were frightened illegal immigrants and did not know enough about our rights.""Mr. Kozak, like other laborers on that job, has no hope of collecting about $4,000 in back wages from a contracting company that began the demolition and later became insolvent. But after almost two decades, the demolition workers are still struggling to compel Mr. Trump and his business associates to compensate a union's welfare funds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for some of the Polish workers.Mr. Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that has meandered through the Federal courts for 15 years and charges that Mr. Trump owes $4 million to the union welfare funds for the work the Poles performed. Filed in 1983, the suit has been bogged down by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by the deaths of a judge, a lawyer, the original lead plaintiffs, an important witness and two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants.Mr. Kozak is one of thousands of working Americans whom Donald Trump has fleeced over the years.He wants to convince them he'll fight for working Americans in the White House  but even if he knew how, he never has."

Where are Trump's?,"The Rubio campaign released Marco and Jeanette Rubio's joint federal tax returns from 2010 to 2014. The Rubios' income has included earnings from employment with the U.S. Senate and Florida International University, Marco's legal work, Marco's books, and Jeanette's business.There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account. Today, the Rubios have a single debt: the mortgage on their family home. They are able to send their four children to private Christian schools in Miami, and have created college savings accounts for each child.The financial priority in Marco's life is to provide his four children with a good home, a quality education, and a safe and happy upbringing. As he wrote in his book,The mark I make in this world will not be decided by how much money I make or how many titles I attain. Rather, the greatest mark I can leave is the one I will make as a father and a husband.Here are the facts about Marco's taxes:In the last five years of paying taxes, the Rubio family has paid a total of $526,092 in taxes on their $2.29M income.The effective federal tax rate paid by the Rubio family in each of the past five years has been in line with rates paid by Americans of similar income levels.(Average rate data from the Tax Foundation.)Marco's Tax Forms 2014 Tax Returns2013 Tax Returns2012 Tax Returns2011 Tax Returns2010 Tax Returns2000-2009 Tax Returns"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - Hobby Lobby Founder Backs Marco Rubio for President,"David Green, founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby, has made his pick for President. Green has rarely made public comments on politics, but he issued the following statement:Our family business that we began with $600 has quite possibly been more successful than Mr. Trump's, but that doesn't make either of us qualified to be president. And unlike Mr. Trump, we give all the credit to God. Marco Rubio has impressed us with his preparation and the way he carries himself. But most importantly, Marco regularly exhibits humility and gives the glory to God. Humility is what brings success. I don't see humility in Mr. Trump, and that scares me to death. I want a president that my kids, my grandkids and my great-grandkids can emulate. In Marco Rubio, I see a man who has achieved great things from humble beginnings, but gives the glory to God, where it belongs. I see a man who is prepared to be president, and someone I would be proud for my children to emulate. I will be voting for Marco Rubio on Tuesday and I encourage my fellow Oklahomans to do the same.Hobby Lobby, headquartered in Oklahoma City, started in 1972 and now operates over 600 arts and craft stores. The company is privately held by the Green family. Hobby Lobby is noted for its high wages and its Christian values. It is closed on Sundays and states on its web site: ""We believe that it is by God's grace and provision that Hobby Lobby has endured. God has been faithful in the past, and we trust Him for our future.""Marco has consistently stood in strong support of religious liberty, and is honored to have David Green's endorsement."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - What Marco Rubio Gets about Gitmo That President Obama Doesn't,"February 28, 2016By CongressmanMike Coffman (R-CO)On February 17th, Fox News reported that an inmate released from the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay had become a prominent star of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's propaganda videos. The individual is Ibrahim al Qosi, a former aide to Usama bin Laden who was jailed in Guantanamo Bay in 2002. He pled guilty to war crimes in 2010 and somehow made it on to the Obama administration's list of detainees to be released in 2012. Now, he's on the internet calling for jihad against America.This incident shows that we need a Commander-in-Chief who is willing to do what is necessary to keep Americans safe. That is why I am supporting Marco Rubio for President.Unlike Barack Obama, Marco realizes that the detainees at Guantanamo are hardened terrorists who should not be allowed brought into our communities here in Colorado. Last July, two former detainees were arrested in Belgium as part of an Al-Qaeda recruiting cell. Last March, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said nearly one in three prisoners released from Guantanamo were confirmed or suspected by U.S. intelligence to have returned to terrorist activities.And yet, this past week, the Obama administration reiterated its intention to close Guantanamo, releasing dozens of the ninety-one remaining prisoners and transferring dozens more to American states like Colorado. In October, officials from the Defense Department visited two sites in Colorado to consider them as locations to which to transfer these high-risk terrorists. They examined the Federal Correctional Complex in Florence and the maximum-security state prison in Caon City.President Obama has stubbornly held to this initiative for political purposes, to make good on a campaign pledge, rather than protect the people of Colorado and the rest of the United States. Thankfully, Colorado is being protected by its representatives, and the few politicians who prioritize and understand national security, like Marco Rubio.Marco has worked with me in the Senate to steadfastly oppose this dangerous and misguided initiative. He has blocked President Obama from utilizing funds to close Guantanamo and sponsored and supported bills to prohibit the Defense Department from transferring prisoners to the United States.Unlike Senator Cruz, he has consistently supported the annual defense authorization act that has prevented President Obama from putting his legacy over the safety and security of Coloradans and their families.The facility in Guantanamo contributes to safety of our homeland, both by producing intelligence and providing a safe location in which to incarcerate dangerous terrorists. Replacing it would require millions of dollars to either improve an existing facility or construct a new one. And that new facility would then become a target, along with the community hosting it. In November, 41 Colorado sheriffs signed a letter to President Obama asking him not to transfer Guantanamo detainees to our state, stating their belief that it would make the prison and the community targets for international terrorists.The Obama administration asserts the Guantanamo facility is a rallying point for terrorist organizations. ButPresident Obama and the Democratic Party are basing this assessment on liberal dogma, not established fact. The truth is that the facility at Guantanamo has never been a pillar of ISIS or Al-Qaeda propaganda. And even if it were true, how would any new facility not immediately take Guantanamo's place in the long list of reasons the terrorists seek the demise of our country?Contrary to current policy, more terrorists should be interned at Guantanamo, not fewer. Our troops and intelligence officers have been hampered for seven years by President Obama's refusal to let them bring new detainees to Guantanamo, forcing them to turn the terrorists over to partner nations and losing valuable intelligence in the process. Marco has made clear that when he is President, if terrorists are captured alive, they will get a one way ticket to Guantanamo and we will find out everything they know.This country needs a commander-in-chief who will put national security first and won't endanger states like Colorado with politically-driven policies. We need a president who understands this is a war on terror and not a law enforcement operation. We need a president who understands the enemy in this war  radical Islam  and does not fear to speak its name, unlike President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And we need a leader who understands that terrorists who plot to attack our homeland should be kept in Guantanamo and not in our backyards. Marco Rubio has been that kind of senator. Marco Rubio would be that kind of president."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - This Is How Marco Will Fight for a Strong National Defense -- And Virginia Jobs,"February 27, 2016By Delegate Tim Hugo, Chairman of Virginia House Majority CaucusOur Navy has the smallest number of ships in active service since 1916. Unfortunately, as the world grows increasingly dangerous, statistics like these are becoming all too common for our military.Unlike others running for President, Senator Marco Rubio has a proven record that demonstrates his passion for reversing this trend and rebuilding our military. Marco has supported the National Defense Authorization Act every year, while Ted Cruz has voted against it every time. Most recently, the NDAA authorized the building of the new Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers and Virginia-class nuclear submarines. Additionally, it authorized the overhaul and nuclear refueling of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at Newport News shipyard in Virginia, a ship some had tried to decommission.Despite the fact that these programs guarantee job security for thousands of Virginia families, Ted Cruz also voted against them all. These programs will ensure our men and women in uniform have the most advanced capabilities of any military in the world. We cannot afford a president that will actively pursue the dismantling of these weapons systems and the thousands of Virginia jobs and families they support.The engineers, builders, and support staff at Newport News shipyard are the most skilled shipbuilders in the world. Their selfless dedication to their work embodies the working spirit that makes the United States the greatest country on Earth. Marco recognizes this and understands that long-term support of this shipyard is vital to keeping our underwater and surface warfare systems on the forefront of technological advancement.Marco supports building the Ohio-class submarine replacement, expanding the Marine Corps' force projection by adding eight amphibious landing ships to the current strength of 30 and increasing our existing aircraft carrier force from 10 to 12.Actions speak louder than words and Marco's actions tell us he is the only candidate who has and will maintain Virginia's defense industrial infrastructure and the thousands of jobs and families that help make it the most advanced in the world. This is why I am proud to support Marco Rubio for president."

The stakes are high. If our nominee does not win, Hillary Clinton's justices will control the Supreme Court for 30 years and we'll be stuck with Obamacare forever.I have watched Marco up close. I have seen him take the lead in passing new laws to impose tough new sanctions on Hezbollah terrorists, and to get rid of incompetent managers who weren't doing their jobs to help veterans. He has proposed good new ideas for giving students more options for college. I am convinced he would be a strong and effective president of the United States.Senator Alexander was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2003. He has previously served as the U.S. Secretary of Education in the George H.W. Bush Administration from 1991 to 1993, and as Governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987. Throughout his time in public office, Senator Alexanderhas been a strong advocate for conservative principles.Senator Alexander, welcome to Team Marco!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - This Donald Trump Con Scammed Working Americans Out of MILLIONS,"A lot of people are talking about ""Trump University,"" one of Donald Trump's rip-off business schemes that Marco mentioned at the debate the other night.+500% spike in searches for ""Trump University"" #GOPDebate https://t.co/0I2QNqjWOW GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) February 26, 2016America's higher-ed system may be overpriced, but Donald Trump's ""university"" took things to a whole new level: It was a scam that delivered almost nothing to ordinary Americans who ponied up tens of thousands of dollars to high-pressure salesmen.Here's what happened to one ordinary American couple who enrolled in one of the ""Trump University"" programs:In June 2009, Richard and Shelly Hewson paid the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, an educational venture owned by businessman and nowpresidential candidate Donald Trump, $21,490 for classes that promised to teach them how to flip homes for profit. They ponied up the high price ""because we had faith in Donald Trump,"" Richard wrote in a January 2015 affidavit. ""We thought that if this was his program, we would be learning to do real estate deals from his people who knew his techniques."" What did the New Jersey couple get for shelling out more than $20,000 to a business bearing the famous Trump name? An instructor took them on a field trip to see dilapidated homes in rough Philadelphia neighborhoods, never bothering to explain how to reliably find properties to sell for a profit. ""We realized that Trump was not teaching us how to find these needles in a haystack,"" Richard Hewson's affidavit says. ""We concluded that we had paid over $20,000 for nothing, based on our belief in Donald Trump and the promises made at the [organization's] free seminar and three-day workshop.""Trump's ""university"" is now the subject of multiple lawsuits over misrepresentation and fraud. More than 100 victims have come forward and told their stories:""Trump is facing three separate lawsuits  two class action suits filed in California and one filed by New York's attorney general  which argue the program that took in an estimated $40 million, but was mired in fraud and deception.  ""We started looking at Trump University and discovered that it was a classic bait-and-switch scheme. It was a scam, starting with the fact that it was not a university,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told CNN's New Day after filing suit in 2013."" (CNN, 9/30/15)It was a ""nationwide scam"" according to this 2013 report:More than 100 new people have come forward to complain that Donald Trump's now-defunct ""university"" was a ripoff, the Daily News has learned.They come from New York and 25 other states and say they were wrongly promised they could get rich quick if they enrolled in an expensive mentoring program that investigators say was a sham, a source familiar with Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's investigation said.Donald himself? He personally made $5 million off of the ""university"" according to documents and testimony, as Time reported last year.This spring and summer  as the Republican and Democratic nominees face off for the White House  Trump will have to answer questions under oath about the scam:This spring, just as the GOP nomination battle enters its final phase, frontrunner Donald Trump could be forced to take time out for some unwanted personal business: He's due to take the witness stand in a federal courtroom in San Diego, where he is being accused of running a financial fraud.In court filings last Friday, lawyers for both sides in a long-running civil lawsuit over the now defunct Trump University named Trump on their witness lists. That makes it all but certain that the reality-show star and international businessman will be forced to be grilled under oath over allegations in the lawsuit that he engaged in deceptive trade practices and scammed thousands of students who enrolled in his ""university"" courses in response to promises he would make them rich in the real estate market.Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's not a con artist. But to those who lost thousands of dollars through his phony ""university,"" that's exactly what he is."

Marco.Fortunately, there's no need for the nation to face a choice between extremists and truth-benders. And Virginians are in a position to help ensure Americans have a better option come November.Marco Rubio boasts a compelling life story  the son of Cuban immigrants who worked their way to the American dream. We live in an era that needs more tales of success, in a welcoming country, built on sacrifice, effort, and integrity. More important, Rubio understands the significance of his family's ascent  and is able to express the foundational optimism that makes America exceptional. The bottom line, for Virginians going to vote this Tuesday:On Tuesday, Virginians will vote in the state's presidential primary, which arrives at a crucial moment. If America is to step forward to regain its optimism, its strength, its gift for broadly growing prosperity, we must choose a leader who reflects those indispensable qualities. We believe that candidate is Marco Rubio. The alternative is a President Trump or  far more likely  another President Clinton."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Rubio Calls Out Donald Trump's Cowardly KKK Excuse,"Donald Trump now claims that he wouldn't decline the endorsement of Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and condemn the group, when asked about it on national television, because he couldn't hear the question.Despite, of course, repeating parts of the question. It's just another lie from a con artist.Here's what Marco had to say about it today in Knoxville, Tenneseee:We can't have a President who shies away from condemning the KKK  or worse, lies about it after the fact."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio Says What Needed to Be Said about Trump Playing Footsie with the KKK,"This morning, Donald Trump refused multiple times on national television to disavow the support of David Duke, a prominent white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan leader.It's exactly this kind of thing that Marco says shows why Trump is dangerous, and a threat to the Republican party and our country. So on the campaign trail today, Marco really let Trump have it. Here he is in Loudoun County:The key line:""We cannot be the party that refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.""Later in the day, Marco hit on some of the same themes at a rally outside Richmond:Here's what he asked the enthusiastic crowd:""Should the head of the conservative movement, should the Republican nominee be someone who today, like Donald Trump, refused to criticize the Ku Klux Klan?""""There is no place in the conservative movement for David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, or any sort of hated or bigotry,"" Marco declared."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Kansas Treasurer Ron Estes Backs Marco Rubio in March 5th Caucuses,"February 29, 2016Today, Kansas Treasurer Ron Estes endorsed Marco Rubio for President.Estes is joining a prominent group of conservative leaders endorsing Marco,including Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, Senator Pat Roberts, and Congressman Mike Pompeo.Here's why Estes chose Marco:After multiple debates and town hall meetings, one candidate has emerged as the best choice to move America forward in a responsible manner. That candidate is Marco Rubio and I'm proud to endorse him for President of the United States of America. I trust Marco to bring runaway government spending under control; spending cannot continue to outpace revenue and growth.As Kansas State Treasurer, part of my job is to administer the state's 529 higher education savings program. Rapidly rising costs associated with higher education has become a chief concern of mine. These costs continue to outpace a student's ability to pay for higher education, and as a result Americans are graduating with burdensome student loan debt now totaling over $1.2 trillion. This is a serious problem that demands action.We must move beyond the idea of throwing more federal money at the problem and encourage a national conversation about the appropriate career education at the appropriate cost. More than any other candidate, Marco Rubio has shown a passion for reining in the rising cost of higher education. Marco continuously demonstrates a desire to modernize an education system that has left far too many students unable to start their adult lives on solid financial footing.Americans are crying out for a leader who understands the real challenges we face. Marco Rubio gets it; he offers workable solutions that will make a difference. Please join me in casting your vote for Marco Rubio at theMarch 5th caucus.Welcome to Team Marco!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Tom Coburn: Trump 'Perpetuating a Fraud on the American People',"February 29, 2016Former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, an outspoken conservative known for leading the charge against government waste and abuse, is backing Marco.Oklahoma's Tom Coburn Endorses Rubio, Says Trump 'Perpetuating a Fraud' https://t.co/LdOE1wU7FM The Weekly Standard (@weeklystandard) February 29, 2016He says America is at a crossroads:At a time when our republic, and the Republican Party, is at a crossroads I have no doubt that the right choice for America is Marco Rubio. America desperately needs a president who will appeal to people's highest aspirations rather than their deepest fears; a president who will model servant leadership rather than self-promotion; and a president who will cast a vision and unite the country instead of denigrating dissenters as second-class citizens. Marco would be such a president. I urge voters in Oklahoma and across the country to take a stand for freedom and stand with Marco on Tuesday and throughout this campaign.Senator Coburn also went after Donald Trump in no uncertain terms. This is a devastating critique of Trump's con man candidacy:Donald Trump's campaign is a fabrication. He is perpetuating a fraud on the American people. His empty promises, bullying and bloviating rhetoric will only deepen the frustration and disillusionment that gave rise to his campaign. He simply lacks the character, skills and policy knowledge to turn his grandiose promises into reality.Put simply, Donald Trump has no plan to make America great again. He is a populist without portfolio.It's truly a time for choosing, and Senator Coburn is right  we must aspire for America to be better, not give in to our fears."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Tennessee Rep. Phil Roe is Backing Marco Rubio,"February 29, 2016Today, Tennessee Congressman Phil Roe endorsed Marco Rubio for president. Congressman Roe is joining Governor Bill Haslam and Senator Lamar Alexander in endorsing Marco.Congressman Roe issued the following statement in support of Marco:When I think about this election, I'm reminded of how the generations before us chose leaders of optimism and strength at critical moments in our history. Today we face a critical moment, and we have to decide what kind of country we want to leave our children and grandchildren. I believe we're lucky to have a next generation leader like Marco Rubio working to inspire and unite our people the way Ronald Reagan once did. I believe our Party would be remiss to pass up this opportunity to build a brighter, more conservative future for America. Marco's innovative vision will extend the American experiment into a new century and restore opportunity to the greatest nation on earth.Congressman Roe represents Tennessee's 1st congressional district. He was first elected in 2008, and during his time in the House, Roe has been a strong voice for conservative principles, and an advocate for our country's veterans."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Trump's Mortgage Company Was a Disaster for Him AND His Customers,"February 29, 2016When the housing market bubble was in the final stages before it popped, some mortgage lenders preyed on vulnerable Americans, helping them buy homes they couldn't afford with loans they shouldn't have gotten.One of the firms taking advantage of those Americans: Trump Mortgage.Trump's firm specifically targeted vulnerable borrowers:Trump Mortgage was divided into two units. One side was an upscale residential and commercial mortgage business, which Scheck ran. The other side was known internally as the ""boiler room,"" where employees often made cold calls to people seeking to refinance or originate loans, many of them ""sub-prime,"" meaning the borrowers had poor credit histories.And yet, Trump didn't even time the business correctly, starting it up just as the market was falling apart:Within 18 months, as the experts' worst fears began to pan out and home prices began to dip, Trump Mortgage closed, leaving some bills unpaid and a spotty sales record that fell short of Trump's lofty predictions. Trump distanced himself from the firm's demise, saying at the time that he had not been involved in the company's management and that its executives had performed poorly.When Trump Mortgage collapsed, like with other Trump businesses, clients and contractors got a raw deal:Jennifer McGovern, who had been a mortgage seller, filed suit, saying she was fired before receiving $238,000 of promised compensation for a commercial real estate deal she negotiated.McGovern, a mother of three, won a judgement in 2008 by a New York State Supreme Court judge, who ordered that she be paid $298,274. But the bill was not paid. ""The company was set up in a way that we could never recover what we were owed,"" she said.Despite Trump promising to always ""hire the best people,"" the man he hired to run the company turns out to have ""inflated his qualifications."" So, to recap: Donald Trump tried to get in on the housing bubble by swindling everyday Americans, hired a man who lied about his resume to do it, timed the business totally wrong, and then stiffed the people he was doing business with.That's the definition of a con job."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - WATCH: This Was How Donald Trump Sold His Trump University Scam,"February 28, 2016Donald Trump's fake ""university"" conned working Americans out of millions of dollars, and it especially preyed on those desperate for a lifeline.To recap: His fake school offered courses that were nothing more than get rich quick schemes, and many lost tens of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it.In a video selling his fake ""university,"" Trump made some pretty big promises:Now, Trump University is the subject of multiple lawsuits, and Trump himself may have to take the stand in the middle of the general election.Like he did with Trump University, Donald Trump is promising America success, but it's nothing but an empty con."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Rubio to Trump: Release What You Told the Times about Your Real Immigration Position,"February 29, 2016Following reports that Donald Trump told the New York Times ""what he really thinks"" about immigration, Marco has called for Trump to release the tapes.The Times has said they cannot release the audio or transcripts without Trump's permission, as the interview was off the record.Trump could solve that by asking that the tapes be released, so that we can find out if Trump's immigration rhetoric is just another con job."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Arkansas's Biggest Paper Picks This Republican Because He Scares Democrats More than Anyone,"The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette is the biggest paper in the state of Arkansas  so its endorsement is no small thing on Super Tuesday.And they've backed Marco, with big praise for him as a conservative and as someone who can win.The editors write:Now that the GOP field is getting smaller every week, here's hoping that the party wakes up and rallies behind somebody who can win the general election. And who scares the Democrats more than anybody?Marco Rubio.They go on:It's not just his story that makes Marco Rubio such an attractive candidatealthough the story is something. (He's the son of Cuban immigrants who worked hard to give their kids the American Dream.) But his bearing, knowledge of foreign policy, reasoning, and thoughtful manner recommend him. Call it a presidential comportment.Think about some of the things he said just in Little Rock the other day, and compare it to the other leading campaigns:Free enterprise ""is the only economic system in the world where you can make poor people richer and you don't have to make rich people poorer.""Democrats' ""answer to everything is a tax. . . . But big government doesn't work and in fact big government hurts those who are trying to make it.""Not once did he call anybody a loser. Or have to apologize for a dirty campaign trick.If Arkansas voters going to the polls on March 1 want a conservative, a winner, and a nominee with presidential comportment, then Marco's their guy."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Trump Gets One Step Closer to Going to Court for Fraud While Running for President,"March 1st, 2016Chalk up another loss for Donald Trump: A New York court just slapped down his lawyers' efforts to dismiss the lawsuit against his fake low-rent ""university.""The suit, brought by the state of New York on behalf of victims of Trump's ""university"" scam, is now moving forward:An appeals court denied a request from Donald Trump to dump a New York fraud lawsuit against Trump University today, taking the $40 million case against the presidential front runner a step closer to the courtroom.The suit, brought by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, alleges that Trump University ""intentionally misled"" thousands of people across the country with its pitch for the business mogul's real estate courses. Schneiderman sued in 2013 for money to repay former students.""We look forward to demonstrating in a court of law that Donald Trump and his sham for-profit college defrauded more than 5,000 consumers out of millions of dollars,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.That brings Trump one step closer to having to testify in a fraud trial while trying to carry on a presidential campaign.Trump ""University"" was designed to convince struggling Americans to drop tens of thousands of dollars into worthless seminars, often getting them to go into credit card debt to do so.Trump's a con artist  he should never be president."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Georgia Congressman Who'd Planned to Keep His Vote Secret Endorses Rubio to Stop Trump,"Rep. Tom Graves, who represents northwestern Georgia, explained on Facebook yesterday that he'd planned to keep his vote for President secret:If you've seen me in Georgia recently, you'll recall that I planned to keep my vote for president private. I thought doing so might help unite the Party once this divided primary ended.But that was before the real consequences of stopping Donald Trump had become apparent:In recent days, however, the election has taken some concerning turns, and I've decided that it could be more helpful to share my thoughts with you ahead of tomorrow's Georgia primary, especially if you haven't voted yet.Whom is he picking at this crucial juncture? Marco.They go way back as fighters for conservativesolutions:Of all the candidates, I feel I know Marco the best. We were both named Legislative Entrepreneur of the Year by FreedomWorks back in 2008 when he was Speaker of the Florida House and I was a member of the Georgia House. We were both underdogs in the 2010 elections and won. We've worked together in Congress on serious issues and even played a game of flag football from time to time.Marco would be a great president. He knows himself and his faith. He has a proven conservative record, from his consistent support for a strong military to his pro-life advocacy to passing a key provision that did real damage to Obamacare. He leans into tough issues regardless of the personal or political consequences, and he communicates in a way that would grow the Republican Party and unite our country.Here's his message to Trump supporters:If you're a Trump supporter in Georgia's 14th District, I can relate to your frustration and your deep desire to end business as usual in American politics and government. I respect that and agree with you. But it might be worthwhile to consider some of the same questions that I have had about Trump.With all the noise and emotion that surrounds any election, it's easy to get distracted and caught up in the moment. But this decision is more than a moment, it's our history that has yet to be written. As the scribes of our time, the pen is in our hands.If you live in Georgia, go vote today for Marco, and if you have friends or family there, encourage them to!Here's his full Facebook post:Dear friends, If you've seen me in Georgia recently, you'll recall that I planned to keep my vote for president...Posted by Tom Graves onMonday, 29 February 2016"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - This Marco Rubio Voter Did Everything to Make Sure Her Vote Counted,"Team Marco gets a lot of letters, but ahead of today's voting, one email stood out. One Texas voter did everything she could to make sure her vote counts today:Hey guys,I'm a Texas native living in Tulsa while I finish a bachelor's in journalism  due to an administrative oversight at my local elections office my absentee ballot didn't make it into my mailbox until this past weekend. I paid $65 today to overnight it to Texas because I believe in Marco.Thanks for all your hard work! Best of luck tomorrow! #marcomomentum-JennyAs long as Jenny's ballot makes it (and it sounds like it will) before polls close today in Texas, it's another vote in the bank for Marco. That's dedication!Voters in 11 states, including Texas, have an opportunity to make their voice heard today!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Rubio: Donald Trump Is Dangerous,"Marco sent the following message his supporters ahead of Super Tuesday:The media being what it is, most of my back-and-forth with Donald Trump that's gotten attention this week is the light-hearted stuff. Believe me I really never expected to be talking about spray tans while running for President.But there is a much, much more important issue at hand here: Donald Trump is a serious threat to the future of our party, and our country.I, like you probably, hoped and believed that our fellow Americans would see his cons for what they are, that slogans, celebrity, and tough-talking insults are not enough.But here's the truth: Americans are scared and angry. And in far too many cases, Donald Trump has been preying on their fears and their insecurities, successfully.This is no joke. It's time to fight back, because we've seen a scary side of Donald Trump. It isn't just the opposite of what the Republican Party stands for, it's the opposite of what America stands for.Donate $25 to Help Marco Stop TrumpHow bad is it?In just the last few days, Trump has refused to condemn white supremacism and the Ku Klux Klan, praised dictators Saddam Hussein and Moammar Qaddafi, and proposed infringing upon the First Amendment of our Constitution. That's all after he made fun of disabled people, said China was too soft on dissidents, demeaned women, and insulted war heroes.Trump doesn't take many clear policy positions, but when he does, they're just as scary. Trump proudly champions Planned Parenthood. He refuses to stand by Israel against the forces of terror. And Trump thinks the individual mandate the foundation of the massive government expansion called Obamacare is actually a good thing.We cannot allow Donald Trump to hijack the conservative movement and the party of Reagan. We cannot allow this country to turn away from the conservative principles that make us great.America was built on ideas  equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, the rule of law  that Donald Trump's campaign has been tearing down, mocking or abusing. Truth is, we have to stop him  not just for our party, but for our country.For more than two centuries, Americans have made sure those ideals have survived, and our country has thrived. This election is about ensuring the next generation can say the same."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio Knows What It's Like to Be an Underdog  One That Wins,"Marco had a clear message for the thousands of supporters who met him for his rally in Miami Tuesdaynight:The media may treat me like an underdog, but I'm an underdog that can win.Florida, I know you're ready. The pundits say we're underdogs, I'll accept that. We've all been underdogs. This is a community of underdogs. This is a state of underdogs. This is a country of underdogs. But we will win. And when we do, we will do what needs to be done. And our children will be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the American Dream will change more lives than ever before. And we are going to leave for our children what Americans always leave their children: the single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.Across the country, hundreds of thousands of voters are impressed by Marco's efforts taking on Trump:Rubio: Just five days we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner thus far in this race...

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - Major Tennessee Paper Enthusiastically Backs Marco Rubio,"The Chattanooga Times Free Press is one of the biggest papers in Tennessee, which goes to vote today, March 1.And they just announced their pick for the primary and the general election: It's Marco.They say the stakes of this election are as high as ever, and Marco's ready to rise to the challenge:People say every four years that the upcoming presidential election is the most important one in the country's history. After seven years of radical, divisive, class warfare, against-the-will-of-the-people rule by President Barack Obama, the statement has merit in 2016.Rubio offers an opportunity to turn that page to energize the American workforce, strengthen the country around the world, widen educational opportunities, staunch the porous Southern border from illegal immigration, grow the Republican Party and, just as importantly, make people proud of their country again.Their closing line is some pretty high praise:For governance, for soundness of mind, for electability and for the best opportunity for the country to return to the ""shining city on a hill"" that former President Ronald Reagan often spoke of, we encourage a vote in the presidential preference primary for Marco Rubio.Live in Tennessee, or have any friends or relatives there? Tell them to vote for Marco Rubio on Super Tuesday!"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 1, 2016",Press Release - This Congressman Has One Message to Virginia Voters: #NeverTrump,"Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell, who is backing Marco, has an urgent message for voters in the Commonwealth today: we have to stop Donald Trump.In an editorial on the conservative blog Hot Air, Rigell makes a powerful case:I reject Trump as our nominee based on his judgment, temperament and character, all of which point to a reckless, embarrassing and ultimately dangerous presidency. Just this past Sunday, Trump's poor judgment was on display. He failed not once, not twice, but three times to denounce the KKK and its onetime leader, the infamous racist, David Duke. Looking a bit confused when asked about the KKK and Duke, Trump pleaded ignorance. What void must exist in the heart of a person who when asked about the KKK has to struggle for even a moment as to what his position is? . . .Through these and other bizarre statements we have come to know Trump. We have seen how he draws from a putrid well in making his case for his candidacy. He rarely debates but chooses instead to belittle. On the trail he caricatured the physical challenges that a respected reporter has to overcome every day of his life. The terms he used in reference to a female news anchor cannot be printed here, nor are they uttered in my home.Virginians join Republicans in 10 other states today who have an opportunity to stand against the politics of fear and division and embrace unbridled optimism for a strong America in the 21st Century.Rep. Rigell is right: #NeverTrump."
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 2, 2016",Press Release - Donald Trump Held This 'Unpopular' Position...Until He Wanted to Be President,"Donald Trump has built his campaign around promising he'll keep jobs in America.But never mind that he has no idea how he'll do it (Marco does)  he used to sing a very different tune, praising the outsourcing of American jobs.Here's what he had to say in a post on the blog of Trump ""University"" (the scam that ensnared thousands of working Americans), entitled ""Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run"":We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobshow sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.I understand that outsourcing means that employees lose jobs. Because work is often outsourced to other countries, it means Americans lose jobs. In other cases, nonunion employees get the work. Losing jobs is never a good thing, but we have to look at the bigger picture.Now that Trump wants to win a political office, he's abandoned the position he called unpopular, and promises he'll just stop outsourcing without any specific ideas whatsoever.It's just one more reason we know he's a con artist, not the truth teller he's trying to campaign as  and that working Americans are the marks."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 2, 2016",Press Release - Super Tuesday Was Actually Terrible for Ted Cruz  Here's Why,"Since even before he launched his Presidential campaign, Ted Cruz boasted that the Super Tuesday ""SEC"" Primary was tailor-made for him.But on Tuesday, despite investing in these states big time, he came up way short of expectations, winning just his home state and a neighboring state.The map going forward is much less favorable for Cruz, which is why commentators are saying that his path to the nomination has narrowed.Time: ""Cruz's path to the nomination is now narrower."" [F]or Cruz, the victory wasn't as big as he'd hoped. Cruz had overplayed his own expectations for Super Tuesday, when many Southern states that happen to be in the SEC college athletic conference would vote. ""States like Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, those are conservative states. They are evangelical states,"" he told CNN's State of the Union in December. ""They are states where our grassroots team is incredibly strong. And I view the SEC primary as a firewall.""  Cruz's path to the nomination is now narrower, something his own supporters worried about at his Tuesday rally. Of the dozen Cruz supporters TIME interviewed at the rally, 10 of them thought Trump would likely end up the nominee.Politico: Cruz's ""own people admit he's less of a threat than appearances suggest.""But even his own people admit he's less of a threat than appearances suggest. The math just doesn't quite add up for the Texas tea partier  unless tonight's victories spawn a major wave of anti-Trump momentum, spurred perhaps by the (possible) exit of fellow evangelical conservative Ben Carson. Despite the Donald's somewhat tenuous grasp of biblical chapter and verse, Trump bested Cruz with evangelicals in Southern states outside the Lone StarRoll Call: Cruz's ""inability to dominate the South calls into question whether he can catch Trump as the primaries move north and east."" Cruz had long looked to the so-called SEC primary states and their evangelical base as home turf but Trump has consistently taken those voters away from him in most states. A loss in his home state could have been a fatal blow to Cruz's campaign, and his inability to dominate the South calls into question whether he can catch Trump as the primaries move north and east, where Trump has had success and Cruz has not.The Atlantic: ""a disappointing evening for the Cruz team."" It wasn't that long ago, however, that Cruz's advocates were touting the many contests in Southern statesthe ""SEC Primary""as his firewall, where he would clean up in states heavy on evangelical voters. Judged against those expectations, it was a disappointing evening for the Cruz team.Buzzfeed: ""It's a far cry from the outcome his campaign expected when Cruz was referring to the SEC primary as his 'firewall'"" But it's still a far cry from the outcome his campaign expected when Cruz was referring to the SEC primary as his ""firewall"" to a gathering of Koch network donors last summer.  Cruz is back in the spotlight now. But the problem is that the process doesn't get any more favorable to him going forward than it was on March 1.Texas Tribune: ""An otherwise disappointing night for a campaign that had hoped to be closer than ever to the nomination by now."" Ted Cruz on Tuesday added two more wins in the Republican presidential primaries, claiming victory at home and in Oklahoma in an otherwise disappointing night for a campaign that had hoped to be closer than ever to the nomination by now.Houston Chronicle: ""More problematic for Cruz were a string of defeats to Trump in most of the southern states..."" More problematic for Cruz were a string of defeats to Trump in most of the southern states that make up the so-called SEC primary, which was supposed to be his firewall against a Trump onslaught.The Tennessean: Cruz's ""finish in Tennessee was disappointing."" Cruz had circled the so-called ""SEC primary"" as a make-or-break date for his campaign. The firebrand, tea party-aligned senator spent the most money of all candidates on TV ads in Tennessee leading up to Tuesday. And he was the first to start building a ground game last year, thinking he could capitalize on the state's network of evangelical Christians.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 3, 2016",Press Release - This Is VERY Bad News for Hillary in Her Email Investigation,"The investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server just took a big step toward her being recommended for indictment: A key player just received immunity.The Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staffer, who worked on Hillary Clinton's private email server, as part of a criminal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information, according to a senior law enforcement official.The official said the FBI had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before setting up the server in her New York home in 2009.As the FBI looks to wrap up its investigation in the coming months, agents are likely to want to interview Clinton and her senior aides about the decision to use a private server, how it was set up, and whether any of the participants knew they were sending classified information in emails, current and former officials said.What else does Pagliano's cooperation mean? That we might finally get some serious answers about Hillary's mishandling of top secret information.One thing remains certain: Hillary Clinton is disqualified from serving as President of the United States."

OUR RECOMMENDATION: In Florida primary, @marcorubio is the best candidate to unite GOP. @RebecaSosaMiami. https://t.co/DqhxZCv19w Miami Herald Opinion (@HeraldOpEd) March 3, 2016Specifically, the Herald reminds voters that there's a clear way to stop Donald Trump  and it's uniting the party behind Marco.As the pivotal Florida primary on March 15 draws near, Floridians should not be stampeded into thinking that it's all over. In the Republican race, in particular, they have an opportunity to change the course of a deeply discouraging  even embarrassing  campaign narrative by boosting the chances of native son Marco Rubio, the best remaining candidate with a mostly positive message and a practical chance to win the nomination.Donald Trump would have voters believe his campaign has gained unstoppable momentum, but a deeper look raises doubt.Despite the big wins, Mr. Trump is not yet on track to secure the nomination, according to a delegate count by the Associated Press. Thirty-five states have yet to be heard from. His negatives remain very high, especially among important sectors of the electorate (80 percent negative among Latinos). In seven of the states up for grabs on Super Tuesday, he received no more than 35 percent.Florida's winner-take-all primary on March 15th is a major opportunity to send a message  Marco is going to unite the Republican Party."

In his 2000 book, Trump wrote, 'I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today's Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.'""

(ABC News, 9/18/15)Trump also attacked the Republican position on gun control, saying they ""walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.""""It's often argued that the American murder rate is high because guns are more available here than in other countries. After a tragedy like the massacre at Columbine High School, anyone could feel that it is too easy for Americans to get their hands on weapons. But nobody has a good solution. This is another issue where you see the extremes of the two existing major parties. Democrats want to coPnfiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions."" (Donald Trump, The America We Deserve, 2000)"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 4, 2016",Press Release - Trump Finally Took a Policy Position Last Night. He Stuck to It for About an Hour.,"At last night's debate, Donald Trump explicitly said he doesn't agree with reforms to high-skilled visas he has outlined in his own immigration plan  repeating a flip-flop from an earlier debate.Then after the debate, his campaign issued a statement saying Trump does believe what he says in his immigration plan.It had Marco still shaking his head in disbelief this morning.Here's how Marco laid it out:The frontrunner in the Republican primary refuses to answer a single policy question. Finally, last night he actually took a position and said, alright, I've changed my opinion on temporary guest workers  high-tech workers.And as soon as the debate ended and his handlers got ahold of him, within seconds he reversed his position back. It's just unreal.This kind of thing is why Republicans adamantly refuse to unite around Trump, Marco said:When is the last time you've ever seen a frontrunner who's performed the way he has . . . and we're still being asked will you support him if he's the nominee?That question would never come up if anyone else was the frontrunner. 65 percent of Republican voters do not want him to be our nominee; he can never unite our party. It really puts us in a tough position, and that's why I'm asking everyone to unite behind our campaign, we're the only one that can bring us together.You know where Marco stands  Donald Trump won't even tell you, and if he does, he'll probably change his tune a few minutes later.

'But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.' 'I understand that outsourcing means that employees lose jobs,' continued Trump.

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 7, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio Just announced a Slate of Top National Security Advisors,"March 7, 2016Today, the campaign publicly announced Marco's National Security Advisory Council, whichwill provide strategic advice to Marco and the campaign regarding foreign policy, defense, intelligence, and homeland security issues.The group will lend their considerable expertise to Marco's efforts to make the case for American leadership in an increasingly uncertain world.Marco is the most prepared candidate in this race to take on the national security challenges America faces in the 21st century.Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General, had this to say about Marco:I am proud to support Marco to be our next Commander-in-Chief because no candidate better understands the national security challenges we face. He is the only candidate with the knowledge and judgment needed to confront radical Islamic terrorism, and the commitment to use every legally available tool to prevail in that long-term struggle.Former Senator Jim Talent praised Marco's plans to restore our military: Under the Obama/Clinton foreign policy, America has been in retreat across the globe. The first step toward restoring American strength is to rebuild our military. I am endorsing Marco for President because he understands better than any other candidate that we cannot confront the national security challenges of the 21st century without rebuilding our armed forces. Under Marco's comprehensive, detailed plan to rebuild our military, America will be ready to face a growing set of challenges and ensure that our country is safe and prosperous.Ambassador Eric Edelman, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, praised Marco's work in the Senate:I am proud to endorse Marco for President. After seven years of failed leadership by Barack Obama, our allies no longer trust us and our enemies are testing us. We need a president ready to undo the damage of the Obama years on day one. Marco Rubio is that candidate. As one of the most active members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Intelligence Committees, Senator Rubio will not have a learning curve when he steps into the Oval Office. He understands the threats we face and has the experience and wisdom to put America back on track toward a more prosperous and secure future.Elliott Abrams, former Deputy National Security Advisor for Global Democracy Strategy, has been impressed by Marco's advocacy for democraticvalues:From Cuba and Venezuela to Russia, Iran, and China, Marco has always fought to ensure that the United States is on the side of those who are oppressed. He has an innate understanding of America's important role in supporting freedom and standing up to tyranny. As President he would ensure that our allies respect us again and our enemies fear us. That is why I am delighted to join Marco's team.General Keith Alexander, former Director of the National Security Agency, recognized Marco's support for our intelligence programs:Our next Commander-in-Chief needs to understand the dangerous world in which we live and be willing to do what is necessary to keep our families and communities safe. I am supporting Marco for President because he actually has a record of warning about emerging crises overseas and clearly outlining how he would deal with them. At times when others have wavered in their support for a strong national defense, he has steadfastly backed the intelligence programs that our law enforcement and intelligence professionals need to defend our country.Marco's National Security Advisory CouncilElliott Abrams, former Deputy National Security Advisor for Global Democracy StrategyGeneral Keith Alexander, former Director, National Security AgencyMichael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland SecurityEliot Cohen, former Counselor of the Department of StateSenator Norm ColemanAmbassador Paula Dobriansky, former Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global AffairsAmbassador Eric Edelman, former Under Secretary of Defense for PolicyAaron Friedberg, former Deputy National Security Advisor to the Vice PresidentKim Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization AffairsAmbassador Robert Joseph, former Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International SecuritySenator Jon KylJohn Lehman, former Secretary of the NavyMichael Mukasey, former Attorney GeneralAndrew Natsios, former Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International DevelopmentDan Senor, former Senior Advisor & Chief Spokesman, Coalition in IraqAmbassador Kristen Silverberg, former Ambassador to the European UnionSenator Jim TalentDov Zakheim, former Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)"
Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 7, 2016",Press Release - Marco Rubio is the Only Candidate Who Can Cure Government's Over-Spending Problem,"March 4, 2016ByIdaho Senator James E. Risch and State Controller Brandon Woolf.Risch currently serves the people of Idaho as our U.S. Senator. Previously, he served as Governor of Idaho, Lieutenant Governor, State Senator and county prosecuting attorney. Woolf serves the people of Idaho as their State Controller, one of seven constitutionally elected offices in Idaho.As a United States Senator and State Controller we have unique insight into a critical problem in America. Much of the coverage about the Republican presidential nomination seems to focus on the more salacious and base elements of campaigning. Unfortunately, in this age of instant news and 140-character reporting, while bare-knuckle politics may be a necessary evil, the hard work of dissecting policies and reporting candidate positions is seldom undertaken by the national press.This is why we are writing to bring your attention to the most serious issue facing America: out-of-control federal spending. Marco Rubio is the only presidential candidate who has the vision, plan, and horsepower to fix this critical, potentially nation-destroying problem.The key element of Marco's plan which will prevent the financial failure of our government is to fight for a federal Balanced Budget Amendment. In Idaho, our constitution requires state government to live within its means by spending no more than it takes in. Unfortunately, our federal government is not bound by such a constitutional constraint, so there is no barrier to stop the bureaucracy's insatiable appetite for spending your tax dollars. With Marco as president, we believe there will be an opportunity to amend the U.S. Constitution to mandate a balanced federal budget.Marco Rubio supports line-item veto authority to cut wasteful spending, and so do we. Given the complex nature of the budgeting and appropriation process, there are too many opportunities and incentives for bureaucrats to fatten the budget. We believe that with line item veto authority, budgets and spending under Marco's presidency would be much, much leaner. Additionally, Marco's plan includes a permanent ban on pork-barrel earmarks, which again, we strongly support.Coupled with Marco's other ideas for slashing the bloated federal workforce in Washington D.C., opposing corporate welfare, preventing massive and irresponsible spending bills, and allowing states to use otherwise-wasted federal funds to pay down federal debt, it is clear to us that only one candidate is serious about fixing the federal government's addiction to spending, Marco Rubio.Marco is committed to stopping government waste. He has a roadmap to grow the U.S. economy. And most importantly, Marco has a plan and is prepared to make the hard decisions which will ensure our great nation is fiscally solvent when our children and grandchildren inherit it. For these reasons, and many others, we are proud to support Senator Marco Rubio in his bid to be the next President of the United States of America. We ask that you please join us in our efforts to help protect America from financial ruin by casting your vote for Marco Rubio in the Idaho Republican primary election on Tuesday, March 8."

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 10, 2016",Press Release - Why Vets Shouldn't Trust Trump,"March 10, 2016By the Honorable Thomas F. Hall, Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve AffairsIn January,just as voters in Iowa were making their final decisions on which candidate to support, Donald Trump decided to skip the Iowa Republican presidential debate. He instead hosted a rally that he claimed would raise money for veterans, but we now know that he has donated less than half of the $6 million he raised that night to veterans' groups.This broken promise, at best, reveals Donald Trump's tendency to over-promise in the name of instant publicity only to under-deliver once the media has moved on. At worst, it is evidence that Donald Trump deliberately used veterans as a prop to make his decision to skip a difficult debate seem principled. Neither is a good sign of what a Trump presidency might look like.The Republican Party deserves a candidate who will follow through on his promises, particularly when those promises involve men and women who have fought for our nation. That's why I am calling on Donald Trump to immediately complete the $6 million in donations he pledged to more than 20 veterans ''roups. Whether he does so will be a measure of both his commitment to veterans and his trustworthiness as a politician.In Florida alone, there are over 1.5 million veterans. Donald Trump talks a lot about veterans, but only Marco Rubio has a proven record of accomplishment when it comes to increasing accountability at the VA. Working with Congressman Jeff Miller, the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Rubio led the fight to allow the VA to fire incompetent senior executives at the VA  and won. Donald Trump should join Mr. Rubio in proving that the Republican Party is the party that fights for those who have fought for America, but his actions are cause for serious concern.Mr. Trump has succeeded in channeling a legitimate frustration with Washington into a political movement, but it is time for him to realize that politics is about more than just spectacle and theater. It is about following through. It is about making a difference in people's lives. His pledge to support veterans lent a principled look to his decision to skip the Iowa debate, but now he needs to put his money where his mouth is.This is true of more than just his pledge to veterans. Mr. Trump's campaign has been characterized by numerous pledges to the American people, yet the promises of what he will do are rarely backed up with explanations of how he will execute it. How will he make America great? How will he keep us safe? How will he honor our veterans? It's time for policy, not just empty promises.It is my hope that Republican voters will ultimately make the best possible decision with the information available to them and that we will be left with a nominee who has both the character and the ideas to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and return America to greatness. I believe Donald Trump has yet to prove himself to be a leader of conviction or a man of his word, and I hope that changes soon."

With so much attention paid to quirks  his debate repetitions, his perspiration, even his choice of boots  many Republicans seem not to have noticed his fundamental GOP message of opportunity and uplift. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation calculated that the tax plan Rubio floated with Sen. Mike Lee would raise after-tax incomes for the bottom 10 percent of earners by 44 percent, chiefly via expanded credits. Spending limits, line-item veto, a balanced-budget amendment  all Rubio policy pillars. Crucially, his foreign affairs expertise vastly exceeds that of his rivals. We like his youth, his bilingual fluency and the fact that he isn't one more Republican who's been standing in line, awaiting his turn to run.Right here is where liberal and conservative critics fire howitzers at this or that Rubio drawback. We look forward to debating those points in a general election campaign. But we won't be able to do so if Trump or Cruz is the nominee. The Tribune today endorses Marco Rubio for the Republican presidential nomination.Making things even better, the Tribune refused to endorse either candidate in the Democratic primary, noting that they are far away from understanding the economic realities our country faces. We'd have to agree!Illinois, remember to vote for Marco on March 15th!"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 10, 2016",Press Release - Donald Trump Laughs at POW/MIA Familiess and Vets  Marco Rubio Will Honor Them,"No group of Americans deserves greater respect than those who've put their lives on the line to defend our country. Among them, special respect should be accorded to those who have been taken prisoner by the enemy or gone missing in action, leaving their families without even knowing their fate.And yet, somehow that's not what we've seen from some this election: The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, has made disparaging comments about one of America's former POWs, Senator John McCain. McCain spent more than five years in a Communist Vietnamese prison camp, subjected to torture and solitary confinement  and Donald Trump said he thought he was ""not a war hero,"" unworthy of our gratitude.This wasn't just an attack on John McCain  it was an attack on all POW/MIAs. In other greatest hits, Trump has said his military prep school involved more work than actually being in the military and received an exceptional number of Vietnam draft deferments. He's also claimed to raise millions for veterans groups, when much of the money has never been given to veterans.Marco, whose older brother Mario served as a Green Beret during the Vietnam era, will not only honor the service of our veterans, and honor POW/MIA servicemembers and their families. He'll fight for them on their issues, not let them down like the current president or just offer empty promises like Trump. Marco has already won important victories in the battle for VA reform  thanks to his work, senior VA officials not doing their jobs properly can now be fired  and he has laid out real ideas and principles for reforming the VA. In the Senate, he's also fought for the recognition veterans deserve: For instance, he secured a Congressional Gold Medal for the 65th Infantry Regiment, the ""Borinqueneers,"" a segregated unit of mostly Puerto Rican soldiers who had not received the same benefits and honors as those they served alongside in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.We need a president who will honor and respect the men and women who've put their lives on the line to defend our country. That's what Marco Rubio will do  and to judge by his record right up through this election, Donald Trump won't."

Marco Rubio. Unlike Trump, Rubio has the knowledge and judgment to be president.The Sentinel not only praises Marco, but outlines how catastrophic of a candidate Donald Trump would be against Hillary Clinton:Where to begin on Trump's judgment? His idea of political discourse is hurling or tweeting insults at anyone who dares question him. He has maligned Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He has mocked people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He has disparaged and degraded women.Lately Trump has been singing the praises of torturing suspected terrorists  which is not only illegal, but abhorrent to American values. He has called for changes in libel law to make it easier for politicians to muzzle the free press with lawsuits.With multiple new polls showing Marco as the only candidate in position to defeat Donald Trump in Florida, the Orlando Sentinel is right.

Winner.""He needed to hit a home run in his home state, and he did so by dumping the personal attacks and adopting a more personal approach.

SCARBOROUGH: ""Whose fault do you think it is that there hasn't been peace, the Israelis or the Palestinians?"" TRUMP: ""You know, I don't want to get into it. I don't want to get into it for a different reason because, if I do win, there has to be a certain amount of surprise, unpredictability. Our country has no unpredictability. If I win, I don't want to be in a position where I'm saying to you  and the other side now say, 'We don't want Trump involved. We don't want ' Let me be sort of a neutral guy."" (MSNBC Town Hall, 2/17/16)Trump said he would be ""a neutral guy"" between Israel and the Palestinians. ""GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to pick sides in the conflict between Israel and Palestine. 'You know, I don't want to get into it,' he told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski during a MSNBC town hall in Charleston, S.C.  'Let me be sort of a neutral guy,' the billionaire added."" (The Hill, 2/17/16)Trump argued that maintaining neutrality would give him more credibility with both sides. ""'If I win, I don't want to be in a position where I'm saying to you [my choice] and the other side now says, 'We don't want Trump involved,' the real estate mogul said of potentially winning the presidency and then brokering a lasting peace deal.""

'Can I at least try and pin you down on Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel?' an event organizer at the Republican Jewish Coalition's 2016 presidential forum asked the leading GOP candidate. 'Yeah, go ahead ...' Trump responded, seemingly looking to change topics. 'No, is that a position you support?' the organizer shot back. 'You know what I want to do  I want to wait until I meet with Bibi ... I just want to,' Trump said, referring to an upcoming meeting between him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which he announced during a campaign rally Wednesday. His response was a met with a loud boo from the majority of the crowd."" (Washington Examiner, 12/3/15)Trump questioned Israel's commitment to peace, placing the onus for a deal squarely on Israel. ""'I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,' Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with 'one side in particular.' 'A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal  whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things. They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm OK with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal.'"" (The Atlantic, 12/3/15)"

Marco Rubio,R,p,"March 11, 2016","Press Release - Rubio: It's Time to Fix Our Relationship with Israel, Not Be 'Neutral'","March 6, 2016By Marco RubioFor years, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have treatedIsraelas one of America's biggest problems. From the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran to insultingIsraeliPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there are too many examples to list. Even after years of failure, the administration continues to double down on its terrible treatment ofIsrael, instead investing time and energy in new friendships with countries like Iran.In January, for example, the U.S. Ambassador toIsrael, Dan Shapiro, openlyattackedIsraelfor failing to prosecute attacks on Palestinians in Judea and Samaria. His blunt criticism came right after a 15-year-old Palestinian terrorist brutally murdered a mother of six  pressuring Israeljust when it needs our support the most.LecturingIsraeleven as terrorists target its citizens in their streets and homes is something of a habit for the Obama administration. The European Union recently approved new trade rules requiring labeling of products made in what the EU considers ""Israel-occupied territories""  including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The goal is to encourage Europeans to boycott goods fromIsrael  part of a growing, dangerous worldwide movement to cut off the Jewish state from the global economy and starve it out of existence.The Obama administration should have condemned this blatant, bigoted double standard. Instead, it endorsed it  with a State Department spokespersonconfirmingthat the administration has no issue with the EU decision. Rather than stand withIsrael, the White House sided with European attempts to browbeat the Jewish state into submission.On my first day in office, I will end this moral ambiguity. The best way to begin restoring stability to the Middle East, and to the world, is to renew and strengthen our bond with the Jewish State.My love forIsraelruns deep. My support forIsraelflows from my faith in God  my conviction that it is our duty to safeguard the Jewish State and help it flourish. I have been blessed to visit Israelon multiple occasions.My wife Jeanette and I have prayed at the holy sites and been amazed time and again by the resilience of theIsraelipeople under great threat. And my dedication to the U.S.-Israelalliance stems from a careful understanding of our national interest:Israelis our best friend, strongest supporter, and an island of stability in a region of chaos.I also understand the nature of the threats thatIsraelconfronts. When Palestinians attack Israelis, I will not remain silent or call on both sides to exercise restraint, as if there were no difference between aggression and self-defense. Instead, I will confront the fact that leading Palestinian figures incite these poor children to murder Jews, placing them in harm's way to kill on their behalf.As President, there will be no daylight between the Jewish state and me. I unequivocally reject the notion propagated by Donald Trump that the United States should somehow be ""neutral"" betweenIsraeland the terrorists who seek its destruction. Even President Obama would not make such a nave and uninformed declaration.As President, I will take several immediate steps to bring trust back to the U.S.-Israel relationship. First, I will tear up the terrible nuclear deal with Iran started by Hillary Clinton and signed by President Obama. I will travel toIsraelon my first trip abroad and stand side-by-side withIsrael's prime minister. And I will make good on our longstanding promise to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Jewish State's undivided and eternal capital.With our bond restored, I will make our alliance withIsraelcentral to our foreign policy in the Middle East. I will work withIsraelto develop the next generation of missile defense systems and bolster its ability to address the many challenges it faces, from the Iranian nuclear program to the presence of ISIS terrorists on its borders.My administration will end President Obama's policy of demanding unilateral concessions from Jerusalem and put the peace process back in perspective; with all the threats confrontingIsrael and with no viable peace partner, we need to support the Jewish State unconditionally.And I will take a strong stand against efforts to delegitimizeIsraelat home and abroad. I will use every power of government to combat efforts to boycottIsrael, and call on college presidents, administrators, religious leaders, and professors to condemn the boycott movement as blatant anti-Semitism  the same way they speak out against other forms of racism and bigotry. I will also end our tacit acceptance of UN bias againstIsrael. My administration will defund and leave UN entities that attackIsraelwhile excusing the abuses of dictators and terrorists.Some members of my own party call themselves strong supporters ofIsrael. But their actions don't back up their words. They support a foreign policy that would see America leaveIsrael alone to deal with Iran, ISIS, and Assad. They think we should remain ""neutral"" betweenIsrael and the Palestinians.The last thing we need is another President who doesn't understand who our true friends are. In choosing a president, we need to look at what candidates do, not just what they say. I have always been, and will always strive to be, a true friend to the only free-market pro-American democracy in the Middle East."
