Scott Walker,R,s,"July 13, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Scott Walker: Why I'm Running for President""","b'I love America.In the small town I grew up in, our neighbor Claire Congdon was something of a legend. A veteran of both world wars, Mr. Congdon was a model of American patriotism. After serving his country, he came home and never stopped serving his community through church, Legion baseball, Boy Scouts, and as city engineer. To be around him was to share his love of God and Country.When his American Legion Post helped me attend Badger Boys State, I met a Vietnam veteran from Georgia by the name of Bob Turner. Bob and others who helped run the program shared their love for the USA, and instilled the importance of public service as we seek to protect our freedom.These patriots and so many others remind us that America has always been a can-do kind of country. We just have a government in Washington that can\'t seem to get the job done.It\'s time for new and fresh leadership. Someone with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington who will listen to the people who go to work, pay their taxes, support their families and balance their budgets. The good news is that it\'s not too late to turn things around. I am running for President to change our direction - because I love America.In Wisconsin, we took on the unions and big-government special interests and won. We cut spending and transformed an inherited $3.6 billion deficit into a surplus. We cut taxes by $2 billion, reducing the burden on individuals, employers and property owners. We enacted lawsuit reform and regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We defended the Second Amendment by passing castle doctrine and concealed carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote.If our conservative reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America.Let\'s turn things around in our nation by focusing on three positive goals: reform, growth and safety.Government closest to the people is usually the best and that\'s why reform must begin by taking power and money out of Washington and sending it back to states and communities in areas like Medicaid, transportation, workforce development and education.It\'s time to stop measuring success by how many people are dependent on the government and measure it by just the opposite. True freedom and prosperity never come from the mighty hand of the government. They come from empowering people to live their own lives and control their own destinies.Like most Americans, I did not inherit fame and fortune. What I did inherit was something far better: the fundamental belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can do and be anything you want. That\'s the American Dream.And helping Americans who are able to work transition from government dependence to true independence through the dignity of work will help more people live that dream. That\'s why in Wisconsin, able-bodied adults receiving unemployment compensation or food stamps get job training and now assessments for drug use, as well as treatment if they need it. Some have said we\'re making it harder to get assistance. But in truth, we\'re making it easier to get a job. And those are the kind of real reforms we can put to work in Washington.Strong families with two involved parents are central to a child\'s success. But for too long, the federal government has penalized families through the tax code and structured welfare to discourage the involvement of fathers. It\'s time we end the marriage penalty and fix the damaging programs that replace parental involvement with government influence. Empowering families also means no national school board and no Common Core.A strong, pro-growth economic plan will help workers and families earn, save and achieve their piece of the American Dream. To help live that dream, we have a plan to help the people create more jobs and higher wages.We need to lower the burden on taxpayers to raise take-home pay. We need tax levels that are competitive with other nations to bring back U.S. jobs from overseas and put Americans back to work in full-time, family-supporting jobs.We must repeal ObamaCare and put patients and families back in charge of their health care. We need to rein in the federal government\'s out-of-control regulations the way we did in Wisconsin. We\'ll start by repealing the bad ones.We are an energy-rich country. We can literally fuel our economic recovery with an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy.American prosperity is interdependent with a safe and stable world. Under the Obama-Clinton doctrine, America is leading from behind. Their defense and foreign-policy follies have abandoned allies, rewarded enemies and backed away from our military.We have a President who drew a ""red line"" and allowed Syria to cross it. He called ISIS the JV squad and Yemen a success story. Our current leaders think Iran is a place America can do business with.The greatest threat to future generations is radical Islamic terrorism. We must defeat ISIS and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism before it threatens the homeland. We need to acknowledge that Israel is our ally and start treating them like one. We need to stop Russian aggression. We need to stop China\'s cyber attacks, slow its advances into international waters and speak out about its abysmal human rights record.We must honor our men and women in uniform by giving them the resources they need to keep us safe and the quality care they deserve when they come home. But the first and best way to honor fighting men and women is by fighting to win. Our goal is peace, and we secure peace when every foe knows that if they start a fight with the United States, they will be defeated.As a reform governor in a state long saddled with failed liberal policies, I have proven I will fight the good fights, and I know how to win. It is time to restore and reclaim the great results of the American experiment - the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.This is the road back to American greatness. I am ready to be the President who begins this journey.Walker is the governor of Wisconsin and a candidate for president.'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 14, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Walker on the Iranian Nuclear Deal',"b'After warning of President Obama\'s failure to lead on Iran, Governor Walker commented today on the P5+1\'s comprehensive agreement with Iran:""President Obama\'s nuclear agreement with Iran will be remembered as one of America\'s worst diplomatic failures. The deal allows Tehran to dismantle U.S. and international sanctions without dismantling its illicit nuclear infrastructuregiving Iran\'s nuclear weapons capability an American stamp of approval. In crafting this agreement, President Obama has abandoned the bipartisan principles that have guided our nonproliferation policy and kept the world safe from nuclear danger for decades. Instead of making the world safer, this deal will likely lead to a nuclear arms race in the world\'s most dangerous region. What\'s worse, the deal rewards the world\'s leading state sponsor of terrorism with a massive financial windfall, which Iran will use to further threaten our interests and key allies, especially Israel.""I call on all congressional leaders and presidential candidates, including Secretary Clinton, to repudiate this agreement. Iran\'s Supreme Leader should know that a future American president will not be bound by this diplomatic retreat. Undoing the damage caused by this deal won\'t be easy. But when the United States leads, and has a president who isn\'t eager to embrace Iran, the world will follow. In order to ensure the safety of America and our allies, the next president must restore bipartisan and international opposition to Iran\'s nuclear program while standing with our allies to roll back Iran\'s destructive influence across the Middle East.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 17, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Walker on the Anniversary of the Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17',"b'Davenport, IA -- Governor Scott Walker released the following comment on the anniversary of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 (MH-17) over eastern Ukraine:""A year ago today, 298 civilians on board MH-17 were murdered, shot out of the sky by a Russian missile fired from territory illegally occupied by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.""Russia has shown no remorse for causing this tragedy. Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin suggested Russia would block the establishment of a tribunal to prosecute those responsible for downing the plane, another effort to hide Russia\'s aggression in Ukraine.""The tragedy of MH-17 wouldn\'t have happened had Russia not invaded Ukraine a year and a half ago. For that, Putin bears full responsibility. The United States cannot allow Putin\'s regime to go unpunished for this criminal act.""If the U.S. continues the failed Obama-Clinton approach of sitting on the sidelines while our adversaries advance, we will further endanger our safety and that of our allies.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 20, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on President Obama's Restoration of Full Diplomatic Ties with the Castro Regime""","b'Madison, Wis.  Governor Scott Walker today made the following statement on President Obama\'s misguided decision to restore full diplomatic ties with the Castro regime:""Today, the Castro regime is opening its embassy in the United States. Much like with Iran, desperation for a deal has led President Obama to give up much in exchange for almost nothing. The president has handed Cuba a financial lifeline through increased U.S. tourism and investment that will sustain the Castro regime and its oppression for decades to come. Meanwhile, the so-called normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba will do nothing to advance American interests or the interests of the Cuban people. A president who believes in American leadership and negotiates from a position of strength would use our leverage to advance U.S. interests and gain greater freedoms for the Cuban people. Unfortunately, President Obama refuses to do that.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 22, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Walker on Americans Being Held Hostage in Iran',"b'Nashville, Tenn. -- Today, Governor Walker made the following statement on the anniversary of Jason Rezaian\'s imprisonment in Iran:""One year ago today, the Iranian regime arrested Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, sent him to Tehran\'s notorious Evin prison, and brought bogus espionage charges against him. He has been held by Iran longer than any other foreign journalist.""Rezaian isn\'t the only American held hostage by Iran right now. A former U.S. Marine, Amir Hekmati, and a pastor, Saeed Abedini, are still languishing in Iranian jails. Another American, Robert Levinson, has been missing in Iran for eight years. We recently had the opportunity to meet with the Hekmati family and hear about the torture Amir has suffered. I will continue to speak up about his case and the other hostages until all are released and returned to safety.""The Iranians held my friend Kevin Hermening hostage after they stormed the U.S. embassy in 1979. The Iranians saw President Carter as weak, and they held Kevin for 444 days. He was finally released on day one of Ronald Reagan\'s presidency in part because the mullahs in Tehran knew they would be dealing with a strong American leader.""Today, Iran\'s rulers see our sitting president as weak, much like they saw President Carter. Amid all of President Obama\'s dangerous concessions to Iran in the nuclear deal, he has also failed to get our fellow Americans back home to their families. Ensuring the safety of Americans is a president\'s number one priority, and that is why we must turn up the pressure on Iran\'s regime to release these innocent Americans. The Iranians won\'t release our fellow citizens until we have a commander-in-chief they fear and respect.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 23, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on President Obama's Trip to Africa""","b'Today, Governor Walker released the following statement on President Obama\'s trip to Kenya and Ethiopia: ""Sadly, like many of President Obama\'s policies toward Africa, his visit to the continent is only symbolic. His and Secretary Clinton\'s approach to Africa has lacked the strategic vision and consistent engagement needed to achieve progress and stability in the region. As epidemics like Ebola and the spread of radical Islamic terrorism demonstrate, the U.S. needs a new policy.""The next President must treat Africa as an opportunity. After decades of conflict and poverty, African countries are showing signs of promise. We should focus on helping these countries fully embrace democracy and reduce rampant corruption. In the face of increasing evidence of China\'s often-exploitative involvement on the continent, America has to compete for political and economic influence in this part of the world. We must also provide the leadership needed to resolve Africa\'s long-running conflicts and work with governments in the region to help them combat terrorist groups like Boko Haram and al-Shabaab that have pledged loyalty to ISIS and al-Qaeda.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 24, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on Possible Criminal Investigation of Hillary Clinton's Email""","b'Following reports that two federal inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation into the sharing of sensitive government information via Hillary Clinton\'s private email account, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.""Attorney General Lynch needs to do the right thing and immediately launch an investigation into whether Secretary Clinton broke the law and endangered our national security by using a private email server to conduct official State Department business. Given Clinton\'s reputation for thinking she\'s above the rulesand her previous denial that she emailed classified materiala complete and thorough criminal investigation is the only way to get to the bottom of this serious matter. Even if the investigation proceeds, however, we may never know the truth about what Clinton used her email for because she has already admitted deleting a trove of emails that could have been potential evidence. The United States cannot afford to have a commander-in-chief who believes it is worth risking the safety and security of the American people in order to avoid personal accountability and scrutiny. To preserve the integrity of our political system, the Justice Department must accept the recommendation of two inspectors general appointed by President Obama and launch this long-overdue investigation.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"July 31, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on Hillary Clinton's Misguided Cuba Policy""","b'Shenandoah, Iowa  Today, after Hillary Clinton\'s speech in Miami, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on her misguided Cuba policy:""Hillary Clinton\'s support of this administration\'s misguided Cuba policy is further evidence that if she is elected, she will be nothing more than a third term of the Obama presidency.""When President Clinton signed the embargo against Cuba into federal statute, it was in response to the Castro regime\'s oppressive treatment of the Cuban people, its despotic grip on power, and rampant corruption. Nothing has changed. These problems still remain. And yet, the Obama-Clinton policy is to reward the Castro brothers, provide them with a financial lifeline, and turn a blind eye to their egregious human rights violations.""Americans deserve a leader who won\'t make sweetheart deals with dictators, and as president, my approach to Cuba would be the opposite of President Obama and Hillary Clinton\'s failed policy. That means leveraging our strength to advance U.S. interests, facilitate greater economic and democratic freedoms for the Cuban people, and secure relief for those harmed by the Castro regime\'s oppression.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 3, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on President Obama's Costly Power Plan""","b'Manchester, N.H.  Governor Scott Walker today slammed the Obama administration\'s final rule of far-reaching regulations on existing U.S. power plants unveiled this morning. Walker sent a letter to the president on May 21, 2015 stating the proposal was ""riddled with inaccuracies, questionable assumptions and deficiencies that make the development of a responsible state plan unworkable.""""President Obama\'s plan should be called the Costly Power Plan because it will cost hard-working Americans jobs and raise their energy rates,"" said Walker. ""It will be like a buzz saw on the nation\'s economy. I will stand up for American workers and stop the Costly Power Plan.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 5, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on President Obama's Iran Speech""","b'Madison, Wis.  Ahead of President Obama\'s speech regarding Iran, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement:""President Obama could give 100 speeches attempting to justify his appeasement of the rogue Iranian regime, and it wouldn\'t change a thing. The truth is, the Obama-Clinton bad deal with Iran jeopardizes American safety and that of our allies, especially Israel. That\'s why, as president, I would terminate this disastrous agreement on day one.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 12, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on Hillary Clinton's Top Secret Emails""","b'Madison, Wis.  Following reports that top-secret emails were found on Hillary Clinton\'s private server, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.""This is a serious and potentially criminal offense that proves Hillary Clinton put her own personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people. She cannot be trusted to keep America\'s secrets or its citizens safe, and therefore cannot be trusted to be commander in chief.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 14, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on Secretary John Kerry's Visit to Cuba""","b'Madison, Wis. -- Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement today regarding Secretary of State John Kerry\'s visit to Cuba:""Opening a U.S. embassy in Havana rewards the Castro dictatorship and undermines the Cuban people. Secretary Clinton\'s support for President Obama\'s misguided Cuba policy further demonstrates why she is unfit to be commander-in-chief.""As president, I would not make sweetheart deals with dictators. Instead, I would focus on facilitating greater freedoms for the Cuban people and securing relief for those harmed by the Castro regime\'s oppression.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 14, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker on Hillary Clinton's Latest Hypocritical Lecture""","b'Madison, Wis. - Governor Scott Walker today made the following comment on Hillary Clinton\'s latest attack on him:""While Hillary Clinton was driving college costs up by charging schools exorbitant speaking fees, I was busy freezing tuition for students. In fact, I froze tuition for four years in a row across the University of Wisconsin system. Instead of delivering hypocritical lectures on college affordability, perhaps Hillary Clinton should look to Wisconsin as an example of how to combat skyrocketing college tuition and student debt.""'"
Scott Walker,R,s,"August 19, 2015",b'Statement by Governor Walker on New Iran Deal Revelations',"b'Following news reports that the Obama-Clinton Iran deal includes provisions that permit Iran to inspect its own alleged nuclear weapons sites, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement:""The more we learn about the Obama-Clinton Iran deal, the worse it gets. Allowing Iran to inspect its own alleged nuclear sites puts trust in a fanatical regime that\'s cheated for decades and hates everything we stand for. This deal, and the secret side agreements that continue to emerge, jeopardize our safety and that of our closest allies. That\'s why I would terminate the disastrous Obama-Clinton Iran deal on my first day as president.""'"

Scott Walker released the following statement:""Three years ago today, in a feeble attempt to threaten Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, President Obama made his infamous red line\' comment. Assad subsequently ignored the president\'s hollow warning  along with a similar threat from Secretary Clinton  and he used chemical weapons to murder his own people. President Obama\'s meek response to this atrocity sent a devastatingly clear message of weakness to our enemies: you will not pay a price for defying our commander-in-chief. We need new leadershipleadership that will restore American credibility in the world.""'"

Scott Walker released the below statement. ""After 24 years of independence, I want to pledge unwavering support for an independent, sovereign and Democratic Ukraine. Unfortunately, after unchecked Russian aggression and a lack of leadership under the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, Ukraine\'s future remains unclear. Last week, Russian-backed separatists shelled civilians in eastern Ukraine, and rebel leaders declared they were preparing for a full-fledged war. As I said during the first debate earlier this month, America must provide Ukraine with the lethal military assistance needed to defend itself against Vladimir Putin\'s power grab in the region.""

Scott Walker,R,s,"August 24, 2015","b""Statement by Governor Walker: Cancel Chinese President's State Visit to U.S.""","b'Spartanburg, S.C.  Ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s state visit to the U.S. next month, Gov. Scott Walker released the below statement.""Americans are struggling to cope with the fall in today\'s markets driven in part by China\'s slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy. Rather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests. Given China\'s massive cyberattacks against America, its militarization of the South China Sea, continued state interference with its economy, and persistent persecution of Christians and human rights activists, President Obama needs to cancel the state visit. There\'s serious work to be done rather than pomp and circumstance. We need to see some backbone from President Obama on U.S.-China relations.""'"

As I heard when I met with Amir\'s family, the Iranians have since tortured him and forced him to endure solitary confinement and psychological suffering. It\'s shameful that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have ignored Amir\'s plight, while making repeated concessions to Iran in order to secure their dangerous nuclear deal. ""Ensuring Americans\' safety is a president\'s number one priority. That\'s why as commander in chief, I would terminate the bad Iran nuclear deal on day one and turn up the pressure on the regime to release Amir and the other innocent American hostages held in Iran.""'"

After being attacked this morning by Hillary Clinton for his positions on the Iran nuclear deal and ISIS, Gov. Scott Walker released the following statement: ""Hillary Clinton\'s legacy as secretary of state is that every country she touched is more messed up than the day she and President Obama took office. The bad Iran deal she supports and is fighting to keep in place gives the Iranian regime a nuclear program with an American stamp of approval and billions of dollars to fund terrorism. It will make the world more dangerous and Iran more powerful.

On that terrible day, radical Islamic terrorists unleashed unimaginable horror against our country, ending nearly 3,000 innocent lives. As we honor the victims and keep their families in our thoughts and prayers, we cannot forget the bravery of the hundreds of first responders who sacrificed their lives while trying to save others. Today and every day, our hearts are filled with the strength and spirit of a nation that rose out of the rubble united, unintimidated, and undeterred from celebrating our uniquely American values of freedom, liberty, and opportunity for all.

Until we prevail in this struggle, we must always remain vigilant.""'"
