George Pataki,R,p,"June 18, 2015",Press Release - Pataki Says Washington Killing American Dream,"Philly.com ArticleAn overbearing federal government in Washington is squelching the American Dream, former New York Gov. George Pataki warned in a speech Thursday afternoon in Center City Philadelphia.The Republican presidential candidate noted that six of the 10 wealthiest counties in the U.S. surround the capital city - and that's not a good thing, he said.""What do they make in Washington D.C.? They make credits and exemptions and laws and regulations,"" Pataki said at the opening session of the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference at the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown Hotel.And most of that product is aimed at smoothing the way for insiders to amass more wealth and power, Pataki said. ""The government has become a captive of an inner-beltway mentality of lobbyists and lawyers, the rich and the powerful,"" he said. ""They have stopped serving the American people.""Pataki, 69, served three terms as governor of ultra-blue New York from 1995-2003. He has moderate views on social issues - he favors abortion rights, for instance, in a party that is mostly opposed - but reminded several hundred conferees that he had been a fiscal conservative, cutting taxes and shrinking the state workforce by more than 15 percent.As for Washington, he said he'd shrink the size of the federal government. And he said he would push to ban members of the House and Senate from lobbying - for life.Pataki was the first of several presidential candidates to pitch to the activists at the leadership conference. Tomorrow, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, are all scheduled to speak Friday. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is due in Saturday.Read more at http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/big_tent/Pataki-says-Washington-killing-American-Dream.html"
George Pataki,R,p,"June 22, 2015","Press Release - Boston Herald: Pataki Slams Clinton Over Emails, Chinese Hackers","LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEW FROM BOSTON HERALD RADIO HERE Former New York Gov. George Pataki slammed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton today for ""probably"" breaking the law by erasing emails on a private server that likely left information open to Chinese hackers.""It's clear to me that having that home server not only violated State Department rules and regulations, deleting those emails was probably a crime because she had good reason to know that Congress wanted to see what was in them,"" Pataki said on Boston Herald Radio today. ""But what is most disturbing to me is that the Chinese in all likelihood know what every one of those 30,000 emails said. The American people don't, Congress doesn't, the State Department don't, that is wrong.""Pataki also criticized New Hampshire television station WMUR for not pressing Clinton harder during a one-on-one last week when she lamented the vulnerability of the State Department's servers, but never mentioned her own.""That's exactly the question that any decent reporter would ask if they were trying to get to really learn something and get some real answers,"" said Pataki, who made the comments on Boston Herald Radio's ""Morning Meeting"" show hosted by Hillary Chabot and Jaclyn Cashman. ""And I can't believe they didn't ask it. Well actually I can believe they didn't ask it.""Pataki claimed the entire incident shows that Clinton is more concerned about her own political reputation than protecting the security of sensitive information.""Clearly Hillary's basement server isn't going to have that level of protection,"" she added. ""It was grossly irresponsible for her to do this. It poses a tremendous security risk to America. But more importantly, it raises questions about her judgment in so many ways. She is so concerned about her political career that she will jeopardize critical American communications.""Pataki went on to criticize both former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton for rhetoric on helping the middle class, all while their charity, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has accepted between $1 million and $10 million from the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board since 2010, according to a report earlier this month in the Daily Mail.""And you want to talk about privilege, Bill Clinton takes a very poor African country, Cameroon, and takes $10 million from them so that he and Hillary can fly around in private jets and have expensive dinners at the expense of one of the poorest countries and the people of that country on the planet,"" said Pataki. ""Talk about privilege, talk about wrong -- that is wrong and so is Hillary Clinton.""Originally Published on BostonHerald.com"

George Pataki,R,p,"June 23, 2015",Press Release - Times Union: Pataki's Call for Bipartisan Approach Shows a True Leader,"By Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. and Joe LiebermanWhen George Pataki announced that he'd make a run for president, he surprised a lot of people. Without a strong base, without firm support from Republicans, many dubbed his run a ""long shot."" But his message of bipartisanship is a winner.Pataki's four-minute campaign announcement video touched on his experience and his background, but mostly on his insistence that partisanship has no business in his politics. This message distinguishes Pataki from the other candidates in play by making a bipartisan approach to politics central to his campaign, but it's a message that all candidates  and voters  should heed.Pataki insists that D.C. is broken, and a simple survey of Congress tells us he's right. We've seen a government shut down in 2014 due to partisan politics, and a favoring of filibusters over collaboration. Rhetoric has been ratcheted up and teamwork has broken down. And a recent Gallup poll shows that Americans give the 114th Congress an approval rating of just 16 percent.Things need to change.And it seems Pataki, though the most vocal, isn't the only candidate who has recognized the need for this change. We've heard candidates make allusions to their willingness to work with the opposition should they be elected  though none as vocal as Pataki thus far. The idea of bipartisanship is creeping slowly into campaign promises. And this is what we at No Labels want to see more of  more candidates who are unafraid to commit to a different kind of politics. No Labels is committed to fixing the broken politics of Washington by encouraging our politicians to work together, to put the needs of the nation above the needs of the party. We believe a message like Pataki's is a good place to start.There has been an obvious drought of bipartisanship in Congress in the last several years, but we are just beginning to see signs of progress. Our senators and representatives, when making those steps toward teamwork, rebuild trust across the aisle and prove the efficacy of their labor. When Republicans and Democrats put aside their political differences, the good of the nation becomes a top priority. We need a president who will foster that collaborative environment.We need more of this message, and less of the status quo.The status quo has proven itself ineffective and has left Americans face to face with some serious issues. Our next president must be ready to work side by side with conservatives, liberals and independents if we want to address these top concerns because, as time has proven, no party has been able to resolve these alone.It is our belief that through a bipartisan approach, our next president can cultivate a collaborative environment in Congress and build a framework to address the four issues that Americans have identified as the most problematic. We've created a National Strategic Agenda aimed at addressing these issues, which encourages Congress to work together to create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, secure Social Security and Medicare for another 75 years, balance the federal budget by 2030 and make America energy secure by 2024.These are massive undertakings, but the solution lies in a bipartisan approach from both the next president and Congress.We applaud Pataki's bipartisan platform, and any other candidates who echo these sentiments. But we need to go beyond campaign promises and sound bytes  we need to dig deeper into those one-liners and question how these candidates believe they will get there. The answers could catapult a long-shot candidate into a winning bid, or move a sure-thing candidate to the back burner. Americans have the power to determine who best represents our interests and goals, and we will continue to press our candidates for answers. We require more than promises  we expect a framework for actualizing bipartisan goals.We won't stop until we get one.Jon M. Huntsman Jr. is a former Republican governor of Utah. Joe Lieberman is a former Democratic U.S. senator from Connecticut.See the article here at the Times Union "

""But governing is not. Governing is about solving problems and putting people before politics, and if I have the opportunity to lead, that's what I will do.""Pataki joined the already crowded Republican presidential nominee race in May, presenting himself as the three-term governor of New York who led the state through the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and launching a campaign with the slogan ""People Over Politics.""In meeting with voters at the historic general store, which is only opened about once a month to maintain its license and in hopes of remaining a turnkey operation for a future owner, Pataki emphasized moderate Republican stances in answering questions posed by locals.He decried a gap between educational opportunities and training and local jobs, saying that the country needed to have ""a lot more respect for the community college"" system and trade jobs that lead to ""a very good career.""He also indicated support for education waivers for parents with kids in failing public schools, presenting it as a social-justice issue.""We trap too many low-income kids, particularly low-income minority children, in schools in communities, largely urban schools, where teachers can't teach and the schools can't educate and we know that that's the case,"" Pataki said. ""And yet we tell those poor parents we're not going to give your kids a choice. They are going to have to go to this government school that can't educate their kid. You're putting those children behind the eight ball.""Pataki also advocated tax reform, calling the tax code ""74,600 pages of incomprehensible lawyer-written lobbyist-driven gobbledygook"" and urging ""we throw it all out"" and devise a system that ""functions for the people, not the special interests.""Washington, in fact, came under frequent criticism. Pataki described it as ""going to a foreign planet"" and warned that as ""banks were too big to fail, federal government is becoming too big to succeed.""Yet Pataki also acknowledged that government had a role. Responding to a question about food safety, Pataki noted he was a farmer who depended on the Food and Drug Administration to ensure food safety, and he was in the process of certifying his farm to have free-range, antibiotic-free cattle.But Pataki repeatedly emphasized that government was out-of-touch with regular citizens. He mentioned Obamacare as one of the ""awful laws"" and said it, Social Security and any other law Congress passes should be followed by legislators.""If Congress passes a law that applies to the American people, it should apply to Congress and their staffs as well,"" Pataki said.Hooksett resident Tina Paquette, who said her cat is named after the governor, didn't think that would work.""That's a hard sell,"" Paquette said.""Let them go back to the people and say 'I think I should be exempt,'"" Pataki responded, after remarking ""poor cat"" and wondering if the cat was ""verbally slow.""As for his rivals, Pataki tried to stay above the fray. He said he would be at the New Hampshire Union Leader's Aug. 6 forum and said the ""the rules are what the rules are"" for Fox's first prime-time debate criteria, where Pataki's low national polling precludes him from participating.""I would love to be there, but if I'm not, then I'll keep going,"" Pataki said when asked about whether the debate criteria was fair."

I know that we can bring people together, stop dividing us for political benefit, and start uniting us for the people's benefit. I can appeal to Republican voters, but beyond that to a broader electorate. When I talk about reducing the size and the power and the influence of the federal government, and when I talk about reducing the tax and regulatory burden, when I talk about replacing dependency with opportunity....I did it in one of the bluest states in America.WHO SHOULD WE CALL FOR A REFERENCE?My dogs would be very supportive. Balto and Bradley. They think a great deal of me, I believe.WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THE FOLLOWING... THE ECONOMY.I think one of the tragedies of the last decade has been the hideously slow economic growth and the creation of jobs. It's not about the unemployment rate, it is about people's belief that they can have a career that is successful....one of the things I would focus on is lowering the tax and regulatory burden, taking advantage of the American work ethic, taking advantage of our lower energy prices, linking community colleges with industry in their area to create a base of manufacturing that will significantly expand economic opportunities and jobs for middle class Americans.THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (AKA OBAMACARE).I think it is a horrible law. I honestly think it is the worst law passed in my lifetime. We have a great healthcare system, but there were two issues pre-Obamacare: one, was it was too expensive for many people, and the second was, the unavailability of health care for too many Americans. Those issues could have been easily solved without disrupting the entire national healthcare system.STUDENT LOANS.College is way too expensive. I think that universities and colleges have gotten used to the fact that students don't object to higher tuition or fees because they borrow it....We have to work with universities...to lower the costs and to provide options for students, so you're not stuck paying this one flat level if you don't want certain services. The second thing the federal government should do is not make money off of student loans.GUN CONTROL.First of all, and I think this is often missed; mental health is a critical, critical component. We have to do more to expand mental health counseling, mental health preventative services, and have the ability to deal with those who quite obviously are in public and a threat in a way that we don't react tragically after the incident. The second thing with federal gun laws, is that we need to do a better job of enforcing them. It is illegal to bring a gun across state lines, and yet it happens all the time, and I don't understand why the federal government is not doing far more to prevent that.WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THE US IS HANDLING THIS WHOLE ISIS THING?I would change everything. I would directly train, support, arm, fund, and provide whatever assistance to the Peshmerga, the Kurdish military....I would ramp up the intelligence and surveillance and the bombing attacks against ISIS....No nation building, not a trillion dollar war, not a ten-year war, not hundreds of thousands of troops. If we need to strike to protect us here, do that and then get out.RIGHT TO CHOOSE. YES OR NO?I don't think politicians in Washington should tell a woman or a family what her decision must be.GAY MARRIAGE. YES OR NO?Up to the states. There are those in my party who are saying 'pass a constitutional amendment making it illegal.' I would vote against it.HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU HIT SNOOZE IN THE AM?I get up. I actually do. Somehow, if I have to do something early in the morning, my mind tells me that so I usually wake up beforehand.HOW DO YOU TAKE YOUR COFFEE?I have Diet Coke for breakfast. Don't let any doctor read that.WHAT WOULD YOU ASK THE WHITE HOUSE CHEF TO MAKE FOR YOUR FIRST MEAL?Probably pizza, with sausage and mushroom. Hey, I'm part Italian, I love pizza.Read The Skimm Here"

It is inexcusable that a private organization that engages in such hideous behavior receives taxpayer funding. I strongly believe that the federal government should stop funding Planned Parenthood and reallocate those resources to fund real women's health priorities.Unfortunately, there are some in our party who support a different strategy. Instead of pursuing a serious and achievable solution to defunding Planned Parenthood, they want to shut down the entire government. This is a terrible idea.Today, the world is on the brink of chaos. Failed nation states, millions of displaced refugees flooding Europe, radical Islam expanding its powers and Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror, on the brink of an economic and diplomatic windfall. Our government needs to be functioning to protect our security and grow our limping economy. A shutdown is simply intolerable.As frustrated as we all are by the Obama Administration, the American people want and deserve a government that works for them. They are tired of the petty bickering and the pointless back-and-forth. They want a political system based on effective compromise, not brinksmanship and shutdowns. They deserve grown-up government.The best way to defund Planned Parenthood is to elect a Republican president who will sign a budget that defunds the organization. As a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, I am committed to doing just that.I ask you to reject the failed approach of shutting down the government.I hope you will join me in saying no to a shutdown and yes to creating a government that works for the American people.Very truly yours,George Pataki"
George Pataki,R,p,"September 16, 2015",Press Release - USA Today - George Pataki: Donald Trump Not Fit to be President,"Donald Trump is an old-school Know-Nothing, dressed up as a modern-day birther. The Know-Nothing, anti-immigrant, nativist positions were born out of religious and class resentments, and fears not dissimilar to many of those we see today.George Will recently wrote that Trump is ""an affront to anyone devoted tomaking conservatism intellectually respectable and politically palatable.""None other than Abraham Lincoln noted that if the Know-Nothings ever took power, the Declaration of Independence would have to be amended to say that all men are created equal ""except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics."" Donald Trump is rehashing that fear of foreigners again. He is appealing to the worst in Americans, instead of the best.Trump's ideas are about Trump alone  about him and his future reality show ratings, not about conservative principles. His half-baked plan to send police into small businesses, farms and homes around America to forcibly deport millions, including millions of American citizens born here, here is an invitation to a government so large that it would and should scare all true conservatives. Deporting over 11 million people in America would result in a massive, intrusive police state.Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship is equally distasteful. The answer to illegal immigration is to secure our border, deport criminals and control our visa program not make innocent babies and children criminals.Donald Trump might ready for prime time, but he is not ready to govern.Read the full article from USA Today here."

George Pataki,R,p,"October 7, 2015",Press Release - Newsday: Pataki Presses on in New Hampshire With Presidential Bid,"HANOVER, N.H. -- George Pataki has a lot to say about energy supply, climate change, the Islamic State group, Vladimir Putin, the federal tax code, Washington lobbyists, Obamacare, welfare, vaccines, guns and what he considers pie-in-the-sky promises by his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.But first, he has to get by the question he hears at every campaign stop: Why is he running?The former New York governor is not oblivious to the fact that he's conducting a long-shot campaign for the GOP nomination. In a 14-person field, he's registering at less than 1 percent in most national polls and has been relegated to the second tier in the GOP's televised debates. With comparatively few donors, he's running on a shoestring budget, traveling with only a few aides and meeting with small groups of voters.Pataki, though, is plugging away, putting all his effort into this state's primary and hoping for a break.""One thing that is certain is that things will change dramatically between now and February,"" Pataki, referring to the date of the first GOP primary, said while shaking hands Tuesday with the breakfast crowd at the Lebanon Diner. ""But I'm not going to pretend I can come in 12th in New Hampshire and continue. We have got to break into the pack.""Click Here to read the full Article at Newsday.com"
George Pataki,R,p,"October 12, 2015",Press Release - C-SPAN: Presidential Candidate George Pataki Joined by Former Senator Evan Bayh to Discuss Climate Change,"Former Governor George Pataki (R-NY) speaks about bipartisanship, the role of government, his record as governor, drug-related incarcerations, gun violence, and climate change. He then answers questions from the No Labels Problem Solver audience on a range of issues, including his current standing in the polls."
George Pataki,R,p,"October 14, 2015",Press Release - Concord Monitor: Pataki is a Proven Leader and Problem-Solver,"By Sens. NANCY STILES and JOHN REAGANFor the MonitorNew York State had fallen into such a sorry state and was losing population because it was just too expensive to live there. The state had a deficit of $5 billion. New York was a haven for welfare recipients. The state bureaucracy had expanded beyond its means and was dragging down the entire state economy. George Pataki knew it and he went to work to fix it.An upstate mayor - and a Republican no less - Pataki wanted to revitalize his native state. Pataki was a practicing attorney raised on a dairy farm, a family man with strong beliefs in what was the correct path to follow in his personal and professional life. He was a Republican in a totally blue state.Mario Cuomo was the well-entrenched Democrat governor. Cuomo had followed the easy path of deficit spending and appealing to the easily bought voters with entitlements. He was a favorite of state employees; such popularity is often a warning to the taxpayer.With two weeks to go, the polls showed Pataki down 17 points with little chance to overthrow the incumbent governor. Two weeks later, the collective wisdom of the Empire State voter decided to see what it meant to have a conservative state leader. Pataki won!George Pataki served three four-year terms. In 12 years, he reduced the welfare rolls by a million people. He turned a $5 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus. Pataki reduced the state workforce by 15 percent and cut taxes by $143 billion. Finally, the governor was tested when on Sept. 11, 2001, the terrorist enemies of the United States crashed two commercial jetliners into the symbol of America's success and prosperity: the World Trade Center. The loss of life was appalling, at over 3,000 Americans. The structural damage to the world's financial center left it unable to function. Thanks to Gov. Pataki's steady, competent, leadership during those trying times, New York recovered quickly and more united than ever.Pataki has passed every test thrown at him as a mayor and governor, husband and father. He is ready to step up again to lead the country. The current administration has saddled us with more debt and has encouraged the most formidable enemies in our history. George Pataki can do this job because he has already proven that he is a leader and problem-solving manager.New York, then and now, is a deep blue state. Gov. Pataki passed each of his initiatives through the New York State General Assembly, which had a two-to-one Democrat majority. There is a saying, ""Let George do it.""My fellow Granite Staters, we actually have a George who has done it and will do for the United States what he did in his own state of New York. George Pataki is our candidate and a man whose time to lead our country has come.(State Sen. Nancy Stiles, a Hampton Republican, represents District 24. State Sen. John Reagan, a Deerfield Republican, represents District 17.)Click Here to view the full article at the Concord Monitor"

George Pataki,R,p,"October 19, 2015",Press Release - MSNBC - Pataki: Trump a 'Schoolyard Bully Spewing Nonsense',"by PAM KEYMonday on MSNBC, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. George Pataki (R-NY), said that his rival Donald Trump blaming former President George W. Bush for the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks is ""like an eighth-grade schoolyard bully spewing nonsense.""Pataki said, ""Donald Trump is like an eighth-grade schoolyard bully spewing nonsense. 'I would have stopped September 11 if I was president. I'll beat China. I'll make Mexico build and pay for a wall.' This is all complete nonsense. And more than that, you wonder why all of a sudden he's going after Bush when it was Clintonthe Clintons had been in power for eight years before September 11. So I don't know what he's doing. I just think it makes it plain that this man is not someone who should be president.""He continued, ""This is Trump spewing nonsense. Whether it's Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)is not a war hero or Mexico's going to pay for the wall, or now today if his immigration policy had been in effect, September 11 might not have happened. He just continually says things that make it plain that this man is not fit to be president of the United States. But it makes you wonder why going after Bush as opposed to the Clintons, who were in power for eight years. What is he really thinking here? I don't know.""Read the full article Here."

George Pataki,R,p,"October 29, 2015",Press Release - CNBC Debate: Governor George Pataki's Greatest Hits,"Governor Pataki is getting an overwhelmingly positive response for his performance in last night's CNBC debate. We wanted to make sure you saw these quotes and clips from the debate:On tax reform:""I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage, more than everybody on the next stage combined, by more than the other 49 states, in New York State. I don't just have a plan. I will enact tax cuts, get rid of those loopholes, and make the system fairer for all Americans.""On working across party lines:""I understand to change Washington, you have to understand government as well. You can't just be an outsider, you can't just be someone who throws stones at Washington. You have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines. I can do that. I will do that if I have the chance to lead this party.""On protecting America's military:""Barack Obama is the first President in American history to hold our military hostage. He knew that we needed funding for overseas contingent operations, $30 million that would go to support our troops. And he was prepared and would have vetoed it unless this deal went through. I have two sons. They both served overseas, one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I understand we have got to do far more to help our military, help our veterans and help protect our security. This is a bad deal. But to protect our military, I would have signed it.""On Hillary Clinton:""Hillary Clinton put a server, an unsecure server, in her home as Secretary of State. We have no doubt that that was hacked and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese, and others. That, alone, should disqualify her from being President of the United States.""On Obamacare:""No question, Barack Obama inherited an economic disaster in 2009. But what did he do? Instead of focusing on pro-growth policies and the economy, he ran through Obamacare, the worst law of my lifetime, that hurt small businesses, hurt companies, raised taxes, and almost completely eliminated one industry because of its taxes.""On vaccines and climate change:""One of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts. I mean, it's ridiculous in the 21st century we are questioning whether or not vaccines are the appropriate way to go. Of course they are. And it's also not appropriate to think that human activity, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, doesn't make the earth warmer, all things being equal. It does. It's uncontroverted.""On a new brand of conservatism:""I'm a limited government conservative. And I mean by that that not just when it comes to economic issues, leaving them to the state, but social issues as well. And in that I differ from every single other candidate seeking the Republican nomination. I take the Tenth Amendment very, very seriously.""On embracing science and innovation:""I'm a Republican who embraces science and understands we have to work with the next generation of Millennials to have the innovation and technology so that we can grow a 21st century economy.""On supporting America's blue-collar workers:""What we have to do in America is honor blue-collar work again. We have to honor the carpenter, the plumber, the electrician who can actually build something. And instead of just saying that a college degree delivers prestige, let's celebrate those who do things with their hands and elevate their skills, using training in high school and community colleges.""On Uber:""The [app] I use the most is Uber. You know, I used to get driven. When I was governor, I had a driver. I don't anymore. It's an example of what Millennials are doing to change America for the better.""On New York sports teams:""I'm a long-suffering Jets fan, so my answer is no, there's no reason to take off the day after the Super Bowl...Let me just add this. The Mets are going to win tonight."""
