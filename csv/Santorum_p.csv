Rick Santorum,R,p,"June 7, 2011",b'Press Release - Back Stage With The Santorums',"b'by Elizabeth SantorumYesterday was a big day in the Santorum household. After long months of discernment, my father has decided to run for president of the United States of America. This morning, as I drove my sister Sarah Maria to school, she looked over at me and said, ""Wow. I think I\'m still absorbing how important yesterday was!"" I had to agree. So, I\'ll give a recap of yesterdays ""behind the scenes"" excitement. My Dad spent the morning doing radio and television interviews, while my Mom and I got all six of my siblings ready to go. As you can imagine, getting everyone ready is never an easy task. From ""Oh no, did you pack the hairbrush?"" to ""Patrick, those had better not be grass stains on your khakis,"" let\'s just say that we averted several minor crises. Bella is often the easiest to get ready because she always looks adorable in whatever she\'s wearing. Her sweet smile and peaceful demeanor are a constant source of joy for our family. Onceat the Somerset Courthouse, many friends, old and new, greeted us. The Courthouse is beautiful! You can see its regal dome from the turnpike as you pass the Somerset exit. Before taking the stage, my Father led our family in prayer in a quiet room in the courthouse. After that, we were ready to go. The crowd of hundreds of people was overwhelmingly enthusiastic and supportive. My Mom introduced my Dad, sharing with the crowd the love and respect she has for her husband of 21 years. Then, my Dad stepped up to the podium. The energy was kinetic, nearly tangible. It was living proof that what my Dad so wisely says is true: ""In 2008 America was looking for a president that they could believe in. Now, Americans want a president who believes in them."" Yesterday, my Dad showed that he believes in America and in her people. So, here we go. We are out of the gates and into the race  and what a crazy journey it will be! Everything could not have gone better and, as a family, the Santorums send a huge thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this day possible and to everyone who continues to support us along our journey. God bless you. To close, I echo the words of Ronald Reagan from his own presidential announcement speech over thirty years ago  ""A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us, pleading for us to keep our rendezvous with destiny; that we will uphold the principles of self-reliance, self-discipline, morality, and--above all--responsible liberty for every individual that we will become that shining city on a hill. I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny."" Our time is not unlike his. Freedom is once again in jeopardy. Now, my Dad calls upon Americans to rise again, to keep our own ""rendezvous with destiny."" For as someone once said, great moments are born of great opportunity. Now, as a nation, we are given a great opportunity, which I am sure will be turned into a great moment in our history. '"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"June 8, 2011",b'Press Release - Santorum Pledges to Protect Taxpayers',"b'Signs ATR Presidential Taxpayer Protection PledgeManchester, NH - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) was joined by Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist at Central Paper in Manchester, NH today as he signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge was first created in response to taxpayer fears that some politicians would raise income taxes in the wake of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As of March 2011, over 230 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 41 U.S. Senators had signed the pledge. Prior presidential candidates who had signed the Pledge include President George H.W. Bush, Sen. Bob Dole, and President George W. Bush.In signing the Pledge, Senator Santorum commits to ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes"" should he be elected President of the United States.""Americans deserve a president who believes in them again, and today I am publicly committing to the American taxpayer that I believe that they know how to better spend their hard-earned money than Washington does,"" said Santorum. ""I have always admired the great work Grover Norquist and the entire Americans for Tax Reform team have done in keeping public officials accountable to their responsibility of being stewards of the People\'s money, and I am anxious for the opportunity to bring fiscal responsibility back to Washington.""""I am delighted that Senator Santorum is continuing his long-standing commitment to the American taxpayer. This commitment from candidates for President is more important now than ever, as the Obama Administration has set in motion a dangerous precedent of imposing new taxes on our economy and threatening to allow existing tax rates to expire should they be re-elected,"" said Grover Norquist.'"

Rick Santorum,R,p,"June 29, 2011",b'Press Release - ICYMI: Santorum Pens POLITICO Op-Ed In Support of Balanced Budget Amendment',"b'Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) authored an op-ed in this morning\'s edition of POLITICO entitled ""The Courage to Balance the Budget."" In this opinion piece, Senator Santorum argues that Republican leaders need to draw a line in the sand and not vote to raise the debt limit unless a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution is also passed. During his time in both the House and Senate, Senator Santorum was a passionate advocate in support of the Balanced Budget Amendment and budget reforms - sponsor or cosponsoring over 20 pieces of legislation focused on balancing the budget, enacting significant budget reforms, and increasing spending transparency of taxpayer dollars, three of which became public law.In fact, upon entering the Senate in 1995, the Balanced Budget Amendment was among the first bills Senator Santorum cosponsored. And as just a freshman senator, it was Senator Santorum who led the fight to remove the powerful Republican Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mark Hatfield, for casting the deciding vote against the Amendment.Most recently, Senator Santorum signed the ""Cut, Cap, Balance"" Pledge to cut government spending, place enforceable caps on government spending, and enact a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. Below is the text of Senator Santorum\'s op-ed.""The Courage to Balance the Budget""By Sen. Rick Santorum""Yogi Berra once made the statement, ""It\'s dj vu all over again."" I look at the current budget and debt limit debate and I can\'t help but think he was right. It\'s just like 1995 all over again, except this time the stakes are much higher.When I was a freshman senator we came close to passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In fact, it was the Republican Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mark Hatfield, who can be credited with killing the amendment that could have helped us avoid the mess we face today. I led the fight to remove Hatfield as chairman because of his irresponsible vote and was castigated by my Republican colleagues, because that was not how the greatest deliberative body was supposed to behave. My response was that Hatfield\'s vote was not how he was suppose to behave as a responsible representative entrusted with protecting the individual liberty of his constituents...... So to my former colleagues, I ask: Do you have the courage to fight for not just a balanced budget, but for handing off America to your children and grandchildren better than you received it? To those who do - I stand with you and as president I commit to ensuring the Balanced Budget Amendment is ratified as our 28th Amendment.""To read Senator Santorum\'s op-ed in its entirety: http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57960.html'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"July 1, 2011","b""Press Release - Watch Senator Rick Santorum's New Video: Time to Fight Back""",b''
Rick Santorum,R,p,"July 5, 2011",b'Press Release - The Courage to Fight for American Jobs',"b'Burlington, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) today offered a bold vision for putting America back to work and encouraging innovation across the country. Senator Santorum\'s bright vision is in stark contrast to the one advanced by the Obama Administration. Unlike President Obama\'s faith in top-down government control, Rick Santorum believes in the power of the American worker to once again make our economy the envy of the world.""The American worker is no longer looking for a president they can believe in. They are looking to elect a president who believes in them, and I believe in the American worker,"" said Senator Santorum. ""We have seen what happens when government solutions are broadly applied, most vividly in the manufacturing sector. My plan does just the opposite, it frees business from the constraints of burdensome regulations and taxes that do nothing but hold back the American spirit of innovation.""The Santorum vision to unlock American economic greatness and open up the job market again focuses on five simple points to create growth, spur innovation, and ensure prosperity - all centered on freeing the American people and free-enterprise:We must reduce the size and scope of a government that is stifling job creationHistorically, the federal government has been 18% of America\'s gross domestic product. If we hope to not be served the fate of the western European countries now embattled with debt crisis after debt crisis, we must return to our historical norms. This starts by first cutting government spending, capping future government spending, and finally enacting a Balanced Budget Amendment to our constitution.Creating a tax structure that does not punish, but encourages innovation and entrepreneurshipFirst and foremost, America must no longer have a tax regime that punishes the individual, the small business, or the corporation but encourages growth in America. Rick Santorum believes we need to reduce taxes on individuals across the board, making the system simpler, flatter, and fairer. Likewise, we must cut the corporate tax rate in half, so that we can once again be competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. However, we must go further and cut the tax rate to zero for all manufacturers irrespective of the tax paying entity so we can keep jobs in America. Manufacturing has epitomized the loss of American jobs and innovation over the past several decades, and by reinvigorating this crucial sector of our economy the multiplier effect on our entire economy will spur on economic and job growth not seen in three decades. We must also permanently extend the current Capital Gains and Dividend Tax rates, repeal the Death Tax, and repatriate taxable income outside the United States at a rate of 5% to induce job creation here in America rather than abroad. And, we must not only encourage innovation, but celebrate it by no longer holding entrepreneurs hostage year-in and year-out through the tax code\'s treatment of the research and development of new and promising discoveries - regardless of whether it is the next ground-breaking cancer treatment or a component for a fuel-efficient engine.Removing the regulatory burdens that hold our economic engine BackThe first thing nearly every executive will tell you, from sole proprietors to CEOs of international conglomerates: the existing federal regulatory structure in untenable. From the enactment of the boondoggle of ObamaCare to the CO2 regulations of the EPA, President Obama has single-handedly placed weight after weight on our job market and economy as a whole - and Rick Santorum would immediately repeal the regulatory alphabet soup implemented by the Obama Administration. This also means ensuring that government agencies stay within their intended framework, most notably the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that has diverted from its purpose of protecting the rights of workers to doing the political work of President Obama\'s staunches union allies. Furthermore, while legislation pending before Congress is a start, Rick Santorum believes we need to streamline the patent process to unclog the patent backlog and encourage innovation in America. And likewise, to ensure America remains the global beacon of biotechnology, we must reform the transparency of the Food and Drug Administration\'s approval process so entrepreneurs and investors alike can have surety in the process. Finally, Rick Santorum believes that each new federal law and reauthorization of existing laws should be simpler and limit the ability of federal agencies to expand upon the law through regulation.Ensuring global capital and credit markets Believe in America againWe must repeal the burdensome Sarbanes-Oxley law that not only did not prevent the financial crisis, but chased capital overseas. At the same time, we must repeal Dodd-Frank before it can be fully-implemented and start from scratch to enact real reform that ensures the 2008 financial crisis does not happen again but at the same time does not place impediments in the way of capital formation and credit availability for average Americans. Rick Santorum believes we should not enshrine ""too big to fail,"" and both of these laws do just that. Tap America\'s vast domestic resources to power our 21st Century economyRick Santorum believes we need to stop being nave, put aside our dreams of ""green jobs,"" and focus on the great domestic resources at our disposal. This means we need an all-of-the-above energy policy that utilizes oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy to power our economy and empower the American worker. To do this, we must start by eliminating the Obama Administration\'s roadblocks to oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, along the Outer Continental Shelf, and onshore - including in ANWR. Furthermore, no new natural gas regulations, such as those being debated by Congress, should be enacted. The states are regulating the natural gas industry and there is no reason for the federal government to get involved. Federal regulation for federal regulation\'s sake serves no purpose - and in this instance it not only impedes job growth, but weakens our national security.***While many Republican presidential contenders agree with the Santorum vision, none have the experience of Rick Santorum in successfully fighting for the American worker and real economic reform on the national stage. The Santorum record of national leadership and accomplishment is clear:Rick Santorum was the principle author of the landmark 1996 Welfare Reform law that not only ended a federal entitlement, but empowered millions of Americans to leave the welfare rolls and enter the workforce;Rick Santorum led the fight to ensure each and every American saw their tax burden cut; and,Rick Santorum successfully instituted term limits for Senate leaders when it was a member of his own Party who stopped the passage of the Balanced Budget Amendment.Rick Santorum has not just checked the boxes, he has the courage to lead and as President he will lead America to 21st Century economic prosperity.'"

""We are going to say, \'Go ahead and build your manufacturing plant here and employ people here, and your corporate taxes are going to be zero.\' ""Santorum proposed a five-point plan aimed at reshaping the federal government, cutting taxes, removing regulatory burdens, improving capital markets, and tapping domestic energy sources to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment.He called manufacturing ""the real key to bridging the wealth gap"" in America, saying factory jobs have an economic multiplier effect because they require other companies to provide supplies, transportation and other goods and services. Manufacturing firms also pay dividends and salaries, generating tax revenue for the federal government, he noted.His remarks received positive reviews from several Winegard Co. workers.""Keep the jobs here in this state,"" said Shawn Mears, a maintenance manager who had previously lost a job in Fairfield when a former employer moved its operation to Mexico......

Rick Santorum,R,p,"August 11, 2011","b""Press Release - ICYMI: Santorum Op-Ed Defends Traditional Marriage and Asks Why Other Republican Frontrunners Don't""","b'On Marriage, Republicans Should Embrace Lincoln, Not DouglasBy: Rick SantorumFrom its inception the Republican Party has been the party of the family and great moral causes. This is only one of many reasons why it is so disturbing that some prominent Republicans have seemingly washed their hands of the value and importance of marriage. When asked about New York State\'s new law recognizing homosexual marriage, Texas Governor Rick Perry recently told an audience in Aspen, Colorado: ""Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex. And you know what? That\'s New York, and that\'s their business, and that\'s fine with me."" Governor Perry later attempted to clear up his statement saying, ""I probably needed to add a few words after that \'it\'s fine with me,\' and that it\'s fine with me that a state is using their sovereign rights to decide an issue. Obviously gay marriage is not fine with me."" By taking refuge behind ""states\' rights"" as it relates to moral wrongs, the definition of marriage then becomes subject to fifty different interpretations and versions. What\'s even worse is for one to say you fundamentally disagree with homosexual marriage but then claim you don\'t have the right or will to fight it. Governor Perry is not alone. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann also characterized what New York has done as an issue for each state when she said: ""I\'m running for the presidency of the United States. And I don\'t see that it\'s the role of a president to go into states and interfere with their state laws."" In a subsequent interview she said, ""states have, under the 10th Amendment, the right to pass any law they like.""  These positions are deeply troubling for the Republican Party and the country. Consigning these moral issues strictly to local decision-making runs contrary to the positioning of our party\'s founding and to Abraham Lincoln\'s philosophy that there is no moral right to enact a major social and moral wrong.  Once the definition of marriage is discarded, there will be no rational or legitimate legal or moral argument left to prevent the acceptance of any other kind of definition of marriage, including other moral wrongs like polygamous marriages. Would those same candidates say that New York State has the right to allow for polygamous marriage-and then leave it at that? In Lincoln\'s time the political debate was over the foundationally immoral institution of slavery. Lincoln rightly criticized Stephen Douglas\' ""don\'t care"" attitude about that great moral issue this way: ""When Judge Douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is nothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong."" Using Douglas\' rationale today, we subject the definition of marriage to 50 different versions and that leads to settling of the conflict by the U.S. Supreme Court. This is precisely the same road that led to the downgrading of human life with abortion laws. By allowing the states to define and grant the right to life in a multitude of ways, the Supreme Court was forced to step in to settle the conflict; and it did so by granting localities even further latitude on the most important of all moral questions. We simply cannot allow this to happen to marriage too. Traditional marriage is one man and one woman, and it has been the essential building block of every truly free, fruitful, and lasting society. Marriage-and the family founded upon it-is the first government, the first economy, the first school, the first hospital, and the first religious institution. The family is the first mediating and civil institution of society. Conservatives simply concede too much when they communicate that there exists some ""right"" to commit a great moral and civil wrong, and then leave it at that. We must not give up our moral authority and say it is ""fine"" for a state legislature, or a court, or an executive, to redefine marriage in the name of states\' rights or say it is none of our business. As Thomas Jefferson said the people are free, and ""inherently independent of all but moral law."" I believe marriage is important enough to fight for and I\'ve done it in my home state and in Iowa - actually campaigning last year against unelected judges when they re-wrote Iowa\'s marriage law. We must push for legislative and federal amendment fixes to the wrongs that have already been done and Republicans should not remain silent or inactive. Running for president means running for president of all of the United States, unifying them behind great moral causes, taking sides, and then speaking to what a President or the federal government can do to ensure our national morality. Marriage simply cannot be fifty different things, and the states do not have the right to choose what marriage will be. Marriage is one thing; one very important thing-the basis of all family law and morality - one man and one woman.'"

""The highest response is from the four states I\'ve spent the most time in - Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and New Hampshire."" In those states he\'s encouraged by a noticeable uptick in calls to his campaign, fundraising and volunteers...... Santorum is nothing if not fearless. ""My boots aren\'t shaking,"" he said in reference to those ahead of him in the race. He very passionately took on Perry for his comments on Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. ""I am not in agreement with Ben Bernanke,"" he began. ""But having a presidential candidate calling [a policy disagreement] treason is shockingly maladroit. Maybe he can get away with that in Austin, but we\'re not in Austin anymore...... He also argued, ""I will match my record in the U.S. Senate with anybody."" He embraces his reputation as a staunch conservative, and in in contrast to Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) he contended that he was ""doing big stuff.""...... Perhaps the Republican Party has changed so much in the last few years and the style of unbridled opposition has become so entrenched that Santorum, a man painted as a rigid conservative, comes across as downright reasonable and pragmatic in his pursuit of conservative goals. He may cause his competitors fits in the upcoming debates by attacking their positions and style from the right... He actually has something to teach the party, the conservative punditocracy and his competitors about how a conservative can make progress and not simply mouth talk-show rhetoric.

As Senator Santorum stated on Friday, the jobs report was ""another sad sign that President Obama\'s economic policies would need to improve dramatically to even be described as incompetent.""Johnstown is a blue-collar, steel and industrial town in southwestern PA, an area hard hit by the latest recession that has seen thousands of manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Senator Santorum\'s jobs plan focuses on bringing those jobs back by unleashing American entrepreneurial spirit and innovation. Across Pennsylvania, manufacturing remains the leading economic sector, making up 13% of Gross State Product and employing nearly 575,000 Pennsylvanians.Santorum\'s job-growth plan has meritThe Tribune Democrat- Rick Santorum thinks he has a plan for generating jobs ...We think he\'s headed in the right direction...... The presidential candidate and former senator pushed his plan Wednesday when visiting one of our region\'s manufacturing success stories - JWF Industries of Johnstown.After touring the Iron Street plant with JWF officials, Santorum reiterated his belief that eliminating the federal tax of 35 percent for manufacturers would help push job growth and give companies a reason to make their products here rather than in foreign countries...... In a sentiment he reiterated during a fundraising event Tuesday in Johnstown, Santorum also told Fox he is concerned that manufacturing jobs have dropped from 21 percent of the U.S. economy several decades ago to 9 percent now.""We lost those jobs overseas,"" he said. ""We need to bring them back.""After a respectable fourth-place finish in last month\'s Iowa Straw Poll, Santorum sees himself as a rising Republican candidate in the race for the 2012 presidential nomination.We don\'t know if he has a chance of winning the GOP nod.But we do hope his proposals for the economy make people stop and listen.On this Labor Day, any idea that could help improve our economy and reward companies striving to create jobs is worth consideration.To read the entire editorial, please visit: http://tribune-democrat.com/editorials/x803541154/Santorum-s-job-growth-plan-has-meritSenator Santorum\'s plan to put America back to work, which was released on July 5th, focuses on reinvigorating the ""great middle of America"" that has been lost over the past several decades - specifically the manufacturing sector. Among the many initiatives in the Santorum jobs plan are:Cutting the corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturers from 35% to 0%Repatriating foreign income at a 5% tax rate rather than the current 35% to bring those revenues home to be investing in America;Increasing the R&D; Tax Credit from 14% to 20% and making it permanent;Reducing the regulatory burden currently stifling American innovation, including complete repeals of ObamaCare, Sarbanes-Oxley, and Dodd-Frank; and,Expanding domestic energy exploration to lower energy costs for manufacturers and create good paying manufacturing jobs.For more information on the Santorum jobs plan:http://www.ricksantorum.com/news/2011/07/courage-fight-american-jobs'"

He goes on to detail Senator Santorum\'s policy platform as a ""tour de force"" and ""bold,"" while pointing out that Senator Santorum is ""out-working, out-hustling, and out-slogging everybody else in the field in Iowa."" Hillyer outlines the Senator\'s long history of defying the odds, ousting three Democrat incumbents and winning re-election in a year President George W. Bush lost Pennsylvania to Al Gore. Why Not Santorum?By: Quin Hillyer, National Review Onlinehttp://www.nationalreview.com/corner/282738/why-not-santorum-quin-hillyer""...Yet could it be that the sharpest, most accomplished, most campaign-savvy, and most full-spectrum conservative in a quarter-century of presidential contests has been in the contest all along, working harder than anybody, making at least as much intellectual sense as anybody, never blowing a debate, and never failing to stand on principle?The man of the hour could be that perennial underdog, Rick Santorum...... Well, no. Santorum never stands; he keeps on running. As even the New York Times recently has noted, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania is out-working, out-hustling, and out-slogging everybody else in the field in Iowa, building a campaign organization in an old-fashioned, one-person-at-a-time manner more thorough than any candidate since Jimmy Carter first put Iowa on the presidential map in 1976. His 99-county campaign is probably unprecedented, and his energy is infectious. This week he scored a huge coup with the endorsement of Chuck Laudner, a former Iowa Republican party executive director who is perhaps the most effective conservative operative in the Hawkeye State. Amidst all that, Santorum also has built surprisingly extensive grassroots networks in New Hampshire and South Carolina, with well-liked former congressman Gresham Barrett helping lead his effort in the latter.Rick Santorum is a man accustomed to beating long political odds. As late as election night in his first race for Congress in 1990, top staffers at the National Republican Congressional Committee weren\'t even familiar with him - even as returns came in showing that, without a single bit of national party help, he had won an upset victory in western Pennsylvania. Redistricted into a fight with a Democratic incumbent in 1992, he won again. Running for the Senate in 1994, again he was supposed to have no chance, this time against media favorite Harris Wofford, who was thought unbeatable after having erased a 30-point deficit to beat Republican former Gov. Dick Thornburgh in 1991. Running for reelection in 2000, Santorum again was an underdog - but, even as George W. Bush lost Pennsylvania by four points, Santorum won it by seven...... As almost any conservative will readily acknowledge, Santorum\'s record of actually legislating on principle is stellar. Almost every conservative interest group rated him highly, with the American Conservative Union\'s lifetime 88.1 rating for Santorum being typical. Yet those who buy into the media image of him as a saber-rattler without real effect haven\'t looked at the real record. One doesn\'t get chosen as Senate Republican Conference Chairman, the party\'s third-ranking Senate position, if you can\'t get things done and work well with others. He was a lead Senate author and floor manager of the 1996 welfare reform act, and the author of other successful legislation ranging from various anti-abortion bills to the Iran Freedom and Support Act. Those with longer memories will remember his leadership of the Gang of Seven in the early 1990s that did so much to publicize various ethics breaches in the House, helping set the stage for the historic 1994 Republican takeover of Congress.Finally, conservatives heavily engaged in the wars over judicial nominations know that even though Santorum wasn\'t on the Judiciary Committee, he ranked was one of the Senate\'s two or three most stalwart, and effective, supporters of conservative selections, even when much of the rest of the Republican caucus didn\'t want to be bothered.In this campaign, meanwhile, nobody has been more substantive. His major policy speeches on defense and the role of faith in public life were tours de force, and on Friday he added a bold speech on a plethora of social issues. He also enthusiastically embraced House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan\'s spending reforms even when others like Newt Gingrich were trying to distance themselves from it...""'"

Thousands of our bravest had already given what Lincoln poignantly described as the ""last full measure of devotion."" Yet there I sat, making the case Iran poses the greatest threat to our security.I said \'Iran\' because they have been at war with America since 1979. Iran has been a leading funder of Hezbollah - who is the provider of the most deadly weapon used against our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, Improvised Explosive Devices or I.E.D\'s - and complicit in the training of al-Qaeda. Most recently, it was uncovered that Iran sought to assassinate the Saudi ambassador on U.S. soil - an unprecedented power play directed at becoming the preeminent Middle East power while at the same time showing complete disdain and disregard for - what they call, ""the Great Satan"" - America.The parallels between 1980\'s Soviet Union aggression and the aggression of this Iran are shockingly similar: an aggressive, expansionist ideology; projecting regional power and causing military mischief; creating alignments in our hemisphere, including support of militant and terror organizations that can penetrate our homeland. However, there are almost no parallels between how we dealt with the Soviet Union and how we need to deal with Iran. Reason being, mutually assured destruction worked to keep the cold war cold. Russia was an atheistic enemy who didn\'t believe in an afterlife. In this case, history proves self-destruction is no deterrent for Iran. In fact, the Islamists ruling Iran view dying for its cause will be rewarded in the afterlife. There are those in Iran\'s ruling elite who use religious theology as justification for building a nuclear weapon. Some even believe that bringing about great worldly chaos that would certainly occur with the destruction of Israel, would usher in the rule of the 12th Imam - or Islamic religious Savior. This week\'s report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) now shows that these radical Islamists are on the verge of having a nuclear weapon that could allow them to do just that.The most tragic part is we could have avoided this escalation.While in the senate serving on the Armed Services Committee, I warned repeatedly of the threat that a nuclear Iran would be, and urged steps to avoid it becoming one. As the IAEA\'s report indicates, my predictions were unfortunately right. In 2004, I first authored the Iran Freedom and Support Act (IFSA) - sweeping legislation that funded pro-democracy groups in Iran and imposed real sanctions on this regime aimed at stopping Iran\'s nuclear weapons program. At first, not a single Democrats or Republicans would join me. That changed in 2005, as it became evident of Iran\'s involvement in killing our troops in the region - and I collected 60 co-sponsors. In 2006, Pres. Bush entered into negotiations with Iran - over my strong objections. I brought IFSA to the floor of the Senate for a vote making it clear to the Iranians that Congress was ready to act if the negotiations were unsuccessful. My bill faced opposition from Joe Biden and President Bush and it was narrowly defeated. A few months later, Iranian negotiations broke down and that very same bill was passed unanimously and signed by President Bush.While many of the sanctions were implemented, neither Pres. Bush nor Pres. Obama implemented a key aspect of the bill that funded a movement to overthrow the Iranian regime. Pres. Obama actually cut the funds completely and the money intended to support pro-democracy groups in Iran was never provided to them. So, when the Green Revolution erupted in 2009, we were not in good positions to help them - even if we wanted to. And unfortunately, Pres. Obama did not want to help them, and as a result that revolution failed.President Obama naively and cavalierly once declared Iran as a ""tiny country"" that did not pose a serious threat. Candidate Obama wanted to negotiate with Iran, just as JFK negotiated with Khrushchev. But just as negotiations with Khrushchev failed, so has Obama\'s efforts and his naivety in international diplomacy has led our nation to the brink of a nuclear Iran that neither fears nor respects American power. More importantly and perhaps to many, more surprisingly, the threat of a nuclear Iran is not just ""over there."" Reports now show that Iran has been building alliances in our hemisphere with countries like Venezuela, through which it has been funding and supporting terrorist groups like Hezbollah. Iran is literally operating off our shores and borders with partners like Cuba and Brazil, and this country has so far, turned a blind eye to their actions and motives.To make matters worse, the Obama administration\'s support of the Start Treaty has limited our ability to build a missile defense system and its political correctness has tied our border security hands behind our backs. We must move beyond our 9/10 mentality - ignoring clear threats. We must broaden our 9/11 mentality - solely focusing on a shadowing terrorist network thousands of miles away. Instead, we must immediately understand that we are facing a new enemy and entering a new age of international threats to this country and he allies.The threat is here and it is now. We must work with Israel to determine the proper military response needed to stabilize the region, protect our allies and protect this country - if that includes targeted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, then I am prepared to authorize that action. In addition, nuclear scientists who stand with Ahmadinejad must know that if they help the regime, they are enemies of the United States and they will be treated as such.In response to this latest revelation outlined in the IAEA\'s report, I would work with Israel to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat immediately and put provisions in place to assist any pro-democracy uprising in the Iran. As President, I would exhaust every diplomatic option before exercising military might, but we cannot take military action against Iran off the table - because a nuclear Iran is gravely dangerous for American security and Israeli survival. America must again be a leader for peace in the world, and leading against Iran is the most critical place to start. As President, I will commit to do just that.'"

I have been working on Iran since 2004 and I proposed what Mitt Romney and Herman suggested. I was opposed by Bush but we were able to pass the Iran Freedom and Support Act (to implement sanctions and funding for pro-democracy movements). But now, I disagree with Newt that more sanctions and pro-democracy funding will be enough. We should be working with Israel to help them do what they did in Syria, take out Iran\'s program before the next explosion we hear is a nuclear one.""On Pakistan:""Pakistan must be a friend because they are a nuclear power. We cannot be indecisive, we must engage them as friends, get over the difficulties we have ... We need to work with elements in the government and military, and continue the relationship.""On Leadership and His Administration:""I will come into the office with a clear agenda and get people together who share my point of view. In my office, I didn\'t hire people who didn\'t share my approach to a problem. As you hear from my answers, you know what I believe and I follow through. I say what I\'ll do and do what I\'ll say. I will hire people who will execute my agenda.""On Reversing Obama Executive Orders:""Gitmo is essential to leave open, we have to use enhanced interrogation and it has proven successful.

Family is important to me and to America, and we have a government that has undermined the family. Look at our welfare programs, where parents stay unmarried so that the mother can receive welfare benefits. We are doing things to break families and we do not encourage marriage. There are things a president can do beyond laws. I wrote a book called ""It Takes A Family."" In the book, I talked about a program in Chattanooga, TN where the city, non-profits, and the educational community came together to promote marriage. The President has that power to convene.On States Rights And Abortion:I support Personhood Amendment to our Constitution to ban abortion, and that certainly involves the states through ratification. I have always been a supporter of uniform laws on values that undergird the family. That\'s why I supported the Federal Marriage Amendment - you cannot have 50 different marriage laws. And you cannot have 50 different abortion laws.On The EPA:We have seen a radical environmental policy that is based out of very poorly crafted legislation, with the Endangered Species Act as case in point. We have legislation that is too broadly crafted and gives too much authority to the agency to rewrite the law. I will not sign a reauthorization of these bills unless they are strictly crafted with definitions of what the laws are to do.On The Separation Of Powers:Our Founders created a separation of powers to protect the rights of the States and the citizens. Look at the Senate, it was originally selected by the states so that the states would have the belt and suspenders to keep power at the state level - closer to the people. On the Defense of Marriage Act:The President has an obligation to defend the laws of this country, and the Defense of Marriage Act passed overwhelmingly. When a law is challenged it is the obligation of the President to defend it... I would do everything to go around the courts if they struck down DOMA, and I\'ve already done it. Look at the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. The Supreme Court called it unconstitutional, so we passed an almost identical bill, where the first two sections of the bill told the Court why they were wrong, and five years later the Court ruled that it was constitutional. The President and Congress are co-equal branches of the government to the Supreme Court!... The Courts are not the final arbiter, absolutely not!In Closing:Everyone says we need a truce on social issues, that we need to focus on jobs and the economy. But what is at the heart of this country is that America is a moral enterprise and we are sick at the heart of our country - when we see millions of children being aborted and marriage not being defended. A truce is not a truce, it is a surrender. I will not surrender, I will fight and defend America.'"

And as President, I will ensure that those who have served our country will have whatever they need to re-adjust to civilian life.""Santorum continued: ""I commend all of you in Patriot Outreach for your tireless efforts to bring help and healing to our veterans. Your work is invaluable. It is essential for the health of our nation.""Rick Santorum is the son of two Veterans Administration professionals, growing up on VA Grounds in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, andIllinois.

Rick Santorum is a humble person of solid character and integrity. He has been a powerful advocate for the unborn, and he has been a strong voice and excellent example for traditional marriage. On all points, Rick Santorum is a solid conservative -- both socially and fiscally -- and he has the political record to prove it. He also knows that we need to cut spending, cut taxes, and create jobs in order to stimulate the American economy. Senator Santorum is also well-versed in foreign policy. He understands the nuances and complexities of the Middle East, and of the threats posed by Islamic Jihad. By visiting all 99 counties in our state, Rick Santorum has proven that he will do whatever it takes to get the job done. He will be a refreshing change in Washington. He is exactly what we need in a president. I urge all Iowans to carefully consider giving your support to Rick Santorum.""Senator Santorum said: ""I am honored to receive the endorsement of Rev.

Rick\'s momentum is undeniable and he\'s proving every day that he\'s a man you can trust to be the Commander in Chief. His record matches his rhetoric - Rick has consistently fought for conservatism and Rick has consistently won for conservatism. Rick\'s the real deal and the country got to see that tonight.""SANTORUM SAID:On Distinguishing Job Creation Plan:""I was just visiting Fremont County where they just lost hundreds of jobs from a ConAgra plant. Instances like that are why Governor Branstad and Lt. Governor Reynolds held a manufacturing forum in Pella, because the heartland of America is suffering. During my lifetime we\'ve gone from 21% of people employed in manufacturing down to 9% today. Small town America is hurting. We need a plan to revitalize manufacturing, which is why I have called for the elimination of the corporate tax on manufacturers, repealing the bevy of regulations of the Obama Administration, and lower energy costs... I will not give you a jobs number, because government doesn\'t create jobs. I don\'t believe you can have a top down mentality. You create the petri dish and I don\'t need a government bean counter to tell me how many jobs we\'re going to create.""On Being A Consistent Conservative and Winning:""This is not about what you say at the debate. In 1994, I was not supporting an individual mandate. I authored Medical Savings Accounts because I believe in a bottom up approach and I have never strayed. The record is important and what the question is was who is a consistent conservative. I would agree with Michele, but she\'s been fighting and losing. I have been fighting and won. I won and passed Welfare Reform. I was the leader on pro-life and pro-family issues. I went out and fought on national security, and imposed sanctions on Iran. I was there in good times and in bad. I was there, I led, and I won... I was in the minority and along with Jim Nussle we formed the Gang of Seven, and we won. We exposed the House Banking scandal and sent the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to jail. We figured out how to win, even though we were in the minority.""On Fidelity:""Character counts, all of your record - personal and political. I would not say it is a disqualifier, people make mistakes, and people should hold you accountable. You are electing a leader, trust is everything, particularly in this election. I hear this all the time in Iowa, who can we trust? I have been married for 21 years, I have seven children. I have been consistent and I talk about my past.""On Israel/Palestine Dispute:""You must speak the truth, but do so with prudence. We are in a real life situation, not an academic exercise. We need to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally. We need to be working with the Israeli\'s, because they have the right to determine what they do with their land - and the West Bank is their land.""On His Upbringing and Family:""I grew up in a modest home, and I was blessed with a mom and a dad who made the little things feel like luxuries. Today we see the family breaking down. Single parent households have poverty approaching 40%. Single moms are doing heroic work, but it\'s tough. We need to elevate the institution of marriage and the family. The most important luxury is a mom and a dad.""One Bringing People Together and An Opponent:""I listened to Newt\'s (GOPAC) tapes as a young man and he laid out a vision for conservative governance. I ran in a tough environment. In 1990, I ran and won, and when I won, the Wall Street Journal called the RNC and the RNC didn\'t even know my name. In 2000, I won re-election in Pennsylvania in the same year that President Bush lost by 5%, I won by 6%. I\'ve run as a conservative and won, I stuck by conservative principles.""'"

His family served pie to those in attendance at that event.The Santorum\'s had been adopted by Mahaska County residents Steve and Jan Boender that week where they were learning about life on a farm. Fishing, tractors and the simple life are the things they immersed themselves in...... Our next opportunity to speak with the former Senator was at a Debate held in August just before the Iowa Straw Poll. One of the things that started to work into our thoughts about candidates was Santorum\'s availability after large events like this. When most candidates would make their way across the \'spin room\' floor to the national tv stage, Santorum was one of the few that took the time to answer questions to the rest of the media, including the little guys like Osky News...... The Reagan Dinner gave Santorum an opportunity to shine on his own without the strangle hold of perceived approval based upon polls that networks use to measure how much time a candidate gets in a debate.With a set time limit for each of those who attended, Santorum continued with his consistent message that was also added to his current talking points. But beyond those, what struck us once again was his commitment to the people of Iowa. ""It is great I would say to be back in Iowa, but I\'ve been here a little while. This is my 8th straight day in the State of Iowa and I am proud to announce that I did a Grassley. I\'ve been to all 99 counties in the State of Iowa and I tell you I had a wonderful time doing it,"" Santorum said to the group of GOP supporters who attended the dinner.... We came to the conclusion of endorsing Rick Santorum nearly a week ago, but we held off until we got to see Santorum in action once again. Santorum didn\'t disappoint with his knowledge of Iowa and its residents when he made his recent stop in Pella on Tuesday...... Hands down, this endorsement is for Rick Santorum.""'"

In order to defeat Barack Obama we must highlight his biggest mistakes - namely government run health care and government bailouts. We must draw clear contrasts. Rick Santorum is the one candidate with the consistent record of conservative success in entitlement reform, national security, and the preservation of the traditional family.""SANTORUM SAID:Why Governor Romney Would Have A Difficult Time Defeating President Obama:""If his record was so great, why didn\'t he run for re-election? Why did you bail out (on the people of Massachusetts)?... We want someone when the time gets tough to stand up for conservative principles.""On Representative Paul\'s Lack Of Accomplishments:""The serious issue with Rep. Paul is that he\'s never passed anything of importance. One of the reasons people like Rep. Paul is his economic plan, but he\'s never been able to accomplish any of that. The problem is that what Ron can do is as commander-in-chief is pull our troops back and leave a vacuum for China and Iran to fill.""On Accomplishments:""It worked in my case, look at welfare reform. I remember standing next to Ted Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, saying that this dependency is more harmful and not believing in people is more harmful, so we went out and fought. Clinton vetoed it twice, but we were able to work together. Yes, we made compromise, but not on our core principles. I stuck to those principles, because poverty is not a disability and welfare programs should transition people from that dependency. And in the end, we were able to get 70 votes in the Senate.""On Gay Rights:""I would be a voice for making sure every person in America is treated with respect and dignity. That does not mean I agree with changing laws though. Madison said it best regarding the First Amendment, that it is the perfect remedy. People can come into the public and be heard and be respectful of everyone else. Just because you don\'t agree with them doesn\'t mean that you are discriminating against them.""On A National Right To Work Law:""I have signed a pledge that I would sign a National Right To Work Law.""On Iran:""They are a theocracy that has deeply embedded beliefs that that afterlife is better than this life. President Ahmadinejad said the principle virtue of Islam is martyrdom, so there is no deterrent in using nuclear weapons. In fact it\'s an encouragement to use nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and China is not a theocracy.""'"

""What moved me most are the words Rick Santorum used to ""connect the dots""-to explain why support for marriage, for life, and for an economy that provide the dignity of jobs to average Americans are not three separate things. They are bound together by principles-by American principles...... The left, which thought it had buried Santorum years ago, is going after him with a hatred unmatched. They hate him with that special ire reserved for a man\'s virtues, not his vices.They will go after him not just to defeat Rick Santorum, but to smear his good name, to associate it with their own muck, to take a decent and honorable man and try literally to make his name mean mud.They will not succeed.The American people, I promise you, are not going to reject a man they would otherwise support because he believes in traditional Christian views of sex and marriage. Especially when he believes-not just with his words, and not just with his vote, but with every action of his soul and his life-that a man\'s job is to support his children, born and unborn, to commit a loving and faithful marriage to one woman, and to devote himself to being a good dad.That\'s Rick Santorum...""Rick Santorum was one of the original authors of the Federal Marriage Amendment and is widely credited for pushing for the only vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment in the United States Senate.

Rick Santorum,R,p,"January 13, 2012","b'Press Release - ICYMI: Santorum - We Need ""Bold Solutions For America\'s Families""'","b'Santorum Op-Ed In This Morning\'s ""The State"" Newspaper In Columbia, SCMt. Pleasant, SC - In this morning\'s edition of ""The State"" newspaper in Columbia, SC, Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum argues that we need a President with bold solutions for America\'s families.Santorum: Bold solutions for America\'s familiesBy RICK Santorum - Guest ColumnistI am excited about America and her future. In this election the American people have an opportunity to restore her greatness and to focus once again on protecting liberty and creating opportunity for all. No longer should it be harder for people to succeed economically than it was for their parents. No longer should upward mobility be better in parts of Europe than in America. We need a renewed focus on creating opportunity, not dividing Americans by class; on creating wealth, not distributing it; and on promoting savings rather than dependency.This is what my father and grandfather came to America for. This is our time to reclaim it. In contrast, Obamanomics has brought one in six Americans to poverty. President Obama\'s philosophy of ""spreading the wealth"" in fact spreads poverty and economic decline.I have a bold economic plan that will move our country forward - a plan that will create jobs, renew confidence in the free-market place and reward families for their hard work. My plan will cut spending and ensure future fiscal responsibility through a balanced budget amendment; lower and simplify taxes for families and businesses to promote growth; return federal programs to the states to promote freedom; and promote sustainable health-care and retirement solutions for young people and seniors.First, I will cut spending by $5 trillion over 5 years, repeal ObamaCare and other onerous regulations and cut non-defense spending to 2008 levels. I support legislation to prevent members of Congress from being paid if they don\'t pass fiscally responsible spending bills on time. We will pass a balanced budget amendment to discipline Congress and limit federal spending to a maximum of 18 percent of gross domestic product. I will eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\'s federal housing role, reduce non-defense related federal workers by at least 10 percent and eliminate all energy and most agriculture subsidies. We will unleash America\'s domestic-energy production.Second, I will lower personal income and corporate tax rates and dramatically simplify the tax code for families, workers and businesses. To promote marriage, families and the high calling of parenting, I will triple the child deduction and eliminate all marriage tax penalties. The family is the foundation of our country. We need to have an economic policy that supports families and freedom and encourages marriage.Instead of adding new taxes like President Obama has, I will fight to simplify the tax code by moving from six to two rates and lowering personal income tax rates to 10 percent and 28 percent respectively and eliminating most deductions. This will get us back to Reagan-era pro-growth tax rates. My goal is for the American economy to be growing at least 4 percent to 4.5 percent a year in my first term as president, more than double President Obama\'s; by one estimate this would help create 10 million jobs in three years.I also support two corporate tax rates: 17.5 percent for most businesses - half the current rate - and zero for manufacturers. This will multiply job opportunities for struggling middle-income families and renew communities that have lost critical manufacturing jobs.Third, I will support social innovation in the states and local communities, modernize our social safety net and be fiscally responsible by block granting to the states Medicaid, housing, job training, food stamps and education programs. We will promote dignity and control costs through time limits for able-bodied people, as we did successfully in welfare reform.Fourth, I will work to implement key reforms to Medicare and Social Security. Those approaching retirement can only be confident if these programs are on sustainable footing. I support Rep. Paul Ryan\'s Medicare reforms, which include private-sector innovation, competition and consumer choice. While I whole-heartedly support cutting taxes, I believe that changes to payroll taxes should be tied to sustainable reforms in Medicare and Social Security.I don\'t believe that poverty is a permanent condition. How do we effectively address poverty in rural and urban America? We promote jobs, marriage, quality education and access to capital and embrace the supports of civil society. I believe in equality of opportunity. I believe that American entrepreneurs and business owners create jobs and that skilled and committed workers sustain them, not government.Read more here: http://www.thestate.com/2012/01/13/2111262/santorum-bold-solutions-for-americas.html#storylink=cpy'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"January 13, 2012",b'Press Release - National Nemesis of Planned Parenthood Joins the Fight With Santorum',"b'Abby Johnson Endorses Rick Santorum For PresidentMt. Pleasant, SC - The Rick Santorum for President campaign announced that Abby Johnson, former employee of and now national nemesis of Planned Parenthood, has endorsed Rick Santorum for President.Abby Johnson said: ""I am proud to give my personal endorsement to Senator Rick Santorum, a true champion of the unborn. While Senator Santorum has other outstanding qualities that would make him a wonderful President of the United States, his focus on protecting life in its most vulnerable stages speaks magnitudes about his values and morals as a leader. By valuing life in all its stages, Senator Santorum displays the courage that is needed to turn this country around.When a society devalues life, from the unborn to the elderly and disabled, morals and values are thrown to the wayside to the detriment of all its citizens. As I saw during my time working at Planned Parenthood, when life is devalued, unborn babies and their mothers just become another way to boost the bottom dollar.Senator Rick Santorum has the courage to lead by morals and absolute truths, which I find refreshing. He is a man of integrity and faith and I am proud to publicly offer my endorsement.""Rick Santorum said: ""It is a true honor to receive Abby\'s endorsement. Abby is a woman of courage and conviction. Her stand against Planned Parenthood is something to be admired, and her stand for life is unquestioned. To receive her endorsement is a terrific boon to our campaign, and reaffirms my strong commitment to standing up for the dignity of each and every life - both the born and the unborn. I look forward to working with Abby to finally defund Planned Parenthood and advance our shared message of faith, family and freedom.""Abby Johnson has always had a fierce determination to help women in need. It was this desire that both led Abby to a career with Planned Parenthood, our nation\'s largest abortion provider, and caused her to flee the organization and become an outspoken advocate for the pro-life movement.During her eight years with Planned Parenthood, Abby quickly rose in the organization\'s ranks and became a clinic director. She was increasingly disturbed by what she witnessed. Abortion was a product Planned Parenthood was selling, not an unfortunate necessity that they fought to decrease. Still, Abby loved the women that entered her clinic and her fellow workers. Despite a growing unrest within her, she stayed on and strove to serve women in crisis.All of that changed on September 26, 2009 when Abby was asked to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion. She watched in horror as a 13 week baby fought, and ultimately lost, its life at the hand of the abortionist. At that moment, the full realization of what abortion was and what she had dedicated her life to washed over Abby and a dramatic transformation took place.Planned Parenthood did not take Abby\'s exodus sitting down. They are fully aware that the workers who leave are their greatest threat. Instantly, they took action to silence Abby with a gag order and took her to court. The lawsuit was quickly seen as the sham it was and thrown out of court.The media was, and continues to be, intensely interested in Abby\'s story as well as her continued efforts to advocate for the unborn and help clinic workers escape the abortion industry. She is a frequently requested guest on Fox News and a variety of other shows and the author of the nationally best-selling book, Unplanned, which chronicles both her experiences within Planned Parenthood and her dramatic exit.Today, Abby travels across the globe sharing her story, educating the public on pro-life issues, advocating for the unborn, and reaching out to abortion clinic staff who still work in the industry. She is the Chief Research Strategist for Live Action Films, works on projects for the various pro-life organizations and lives in Texas with her husband and precious daughter. She is grateful to God for her calling to speak for life and considers herself to be incredibly blessed.'"

Rick Santorum uses clear contrasts based on records to differentiate his conservative record from the Massachusetts liberal record of Governor Romney.Because unlike Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, Rick Santorum has never supported a top-down, intrusive government run health care program. Unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum does not support taxpayer funded abortions. Unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum did not support the Wall Street bailouts. And unlike Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Rick Santorum has been a proven fighter for the unborn and our nation\'s traditional values.And unlike Governor Romney, Rick Santorum will put his name behind the ad rather than relying on his SuperPAC friends to do his dirty work.All of this begs the question: why would we vote for someone like Obama when we can unite around a consistent, proven conservative like Rick Santorum?Watch: ""Easy Answer"" Script: ""Easy Answer""Voice Over:Obama supported the Wall Street bailouts...

But today during aCafeMom forumin front of more than 100 moms inMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, the former senator -- along with his wife and mother of their seven children,Karen-- showed a much more relatable side.Together the couple answered moms\' questions about education, the military, and the impact of popular culture on our children. Here are some of their more candid moments:From the start of the discussion, Karen had no qualms about admitting that the campaign is a family affair and, like any job, requires juggling and balance -- particularly with seven kids.

Yet, the Santorums say these obstacles only strengthen them in their resolve of ""being real folks trying to do a job and reflect the values of other real folks.""Another ""real life"" moment came when the couple joked about what it was like watching TV in their household and trying to shield their children from the more, uh, inappropriate messages in pop culture. According to Karen, she often tells the kids, ""Turn your head away! Rick hit the zapper!""

Pleasant, SC - Berkeley County, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Tim Callanan has resigned his position, effective immediately so that he can endorse Rick Santorum for President. Callanan needed to resign, as it was against Party rules for him to endorse a presidential candidate while serving as County Chairman.Rick Santorum said: ""I am truly honored by Tim\'s endorsement. I first met Tim nearly two years ago, and I know how much effort he has devoted to building the Berkeley County Party, so for him to resign his post in order to endorse our candidacy is an amazing testament. Tim\'s vote of confidence is another symbol that conservative coalescing behind this campaign has begun - and I\'m excited to work with him in the closing days of the South Carolina campaign.""In a letter of resignation, Callanan wrote the following:Over the last three years, it has been a pleasure to serve as your Chairman of the Berkeley Republican Party. On Monday January 14, 2012 I will be submitting my resignation to the county executive committee so that I can endorse Senator Rick Santorum for President. This is not an easy decision because for one I love this organization and what we have accomplished. We have taken a dysfunctional party that was both financially and organizationally bankrupt and turned it into one of the most influential county parties in the state. However, the county party has rules, rules that I helped to draft and install, and they state that the chairman cannot endorse a candidate in a competitive Republican Primary. I accept those rules and I can live with them. What I cannot live with is the realistic prospect of sitting idly by and doing nothing while the greatest nation in the world plunges into bankruptcy and I do not ever want to have my son ask me ""Dad, you could have done something, why didn\'t you at least try?"" I do not accept nor has history ever shown that moderation is a winning strategy for the Republican Party. Thus, the only way to win in November is by offering a distinct contrast to that of the current administration. I have read the plans of all candidates and there is only one that is both bold enough to change the direction of this county yet realistic enough to get congressional and public support and that plan is Rick Santorum\'s. I know Rick, he is an honorable man, a dedicated husband, father and a born leader and I am honored to give him my support and I encourage you to vote for him this Saturday January 21st.Tim Callanan - Berkeley County Councilman'"

Viguerie is the author of Conservatives Betrayed: How George W Bush and Other Big Government Republicans Hijacked the Conservative Cause.In a release to his network, Viguerie said:""This past weekend I attended a meeting of some 150 conservative leaders, convened primarily by leaders of the social conservative movement, to assess whether social conservatives and other conservative movement leaders and activists might coalesce behind one Republican candidate for President.""Contrary to some media reports of bitterness, suspicion, and acrimony at the meeting, in my 50-plus years in conservative politics at the national level, I have rarely seen a gathering conducted in such a spirit of good will. While many of the participants came to the meeting strongly, even passionately, committed to one or another candidate, all of us participated in the meeting with the greatest mutual respect and in the prayerful hope for a positive outcome.""My definition of a positive outcome from the meeting was that the conservative movement would coalesce behind a good candidate. I went to the meeting supporting former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, but was prepared to support and work for the consensus candidate, whoever that turned out to be. The strong support shown for Santorum, whom I have concluded is the most electable conservative seeking the Republican nomination for President, is a positive outcome.""After two ballots the group had narrowed the field to Santorum and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, with Santorum leading. On the third and final ballot, a number of Gingrich supporters, in a principled effort to achieve unity, switched their support to Santorum. This resulted in a strong 75 percent consensus of the group in support of Senator Santorum\'s candidacy.""This was not an anti-anyone meeting. Everyone there was united in their commitment to find the best candidate to defeat Barack Obama. We are long past trying to find the perfect candidate who achieves 100 percent on every conservative scorecard. Each of the major Republican candidates had their articulate advocates, but after the third ballot, it was clear that there was a strong consensus behind Santorum.""The group consensus was based on Senator Santorum\'s character, his principled stands on the issues of life, family, and the conservative agenda in general -- and most importantly on his judgment. I urge you to join me in supporting Rick Santorum as the most electable conservative in the race for the Republican nomination for President.""'"

If it is undermined or weakened by cultural and governmental forces, the entire superstructure will collapse in short order. And indeed, today it isinserious jeopardy. The very definition of marriage is threatened, which has implications for the next generation and the stability of society itself.Of all the Republican candidates who are vying for the presidency, former Sen. Santorum is the one who has spoken passionately in every debate about this concern. He has pleaded with the nation and its leaders to come to the aid of marriages, parents, and their children. What a refreshing message. The Congress voted in 1969 to impose a marriage penalty tax on husbands and wives who were struggling to raise their children. That unfair tax continued for 32 years, until George W. Bush rolled it back. Now, if Democrats and some Republicans have their way, the marriage penalty tax will be re-imposed in 2013. We desperately need a president who will intercede on behalf of those who are caring for the next generation and working to build this nation.""While there areotherGOP candidates who are worthy of our support, Sen. Santorum is the man of the hour.

On her widely read blog, Malkin noted:Rick Santorum opposed TARP.He didn\'t cave when Chicken Littles in Washington invoked a manufactured crisis in 2008. He didn\'t follow the pro-bailout GOP crowd - including Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich - and he didn\'t have to obfuscate or rationalize his position then or now, like Rick Perry and Herman Cain did. He also opposed the auto bailout, Freddie and Fannie bailout, and porkulus bills.Santorum opposed individual health care mandates - clearly and forcefully - as far back as his 1994 U.S. Senate run. He has launched the most cogent, forceful fusillade against both Romney and Gingrich for their muddied, pro-individual health care mandate waters.He voted against cap and trade in 2003, voted yes to drilling in ANWR, and unlike Romney and Gingrich, Santorum has never dabbled with eco-radicals like John Holdren, Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi. He hasn\'t written any ""Contracts with the Earth.""Santorum is strong on border security, national security, and defense. Mitt the Flip-Flopper and Open Borders-Pandering Newt have been far less trustworthy on immigration enforcement.Santorum is an eloquent spokesperson for the culture of life. He has been savaged and ridiculed by leftist elites for upholding traditional family values - not just in word, but indeed.He won Iowa through hard work and competent campaign management. Santorum has improved in every GOP debate and gave his strongest performance last week in Florida, wherein he both dismantled Romneycare and popped the Newt bubble by directly challenging the front-runners\' character and candor without resorting to their petty tactics.He rose above the fray by sticking to issues...Most commendably, he refused to join Gingrich and Perry in indulging in the contemptible Occupier rhetoric against Romney. Character and honor matter. Santorum has it.... It\'s not about ""raging against"" some arbitrarily defined GOP ""machine.""For many grass-roots conservatives across the country, Romney and Gingrich are the machine.And at this point in the game, Rick Santorum represents the most conservative candidate still standing who can articulate both fiscal and social conservative values - and live them.To read Michelle Malkin\'s entire post: http://michellemalkin.com/2012/01/30/for-santorum/'"

It\'s just confusing as to why Governor Romney would attack Rick Santorum for doing his constitutionally obligated job on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, just as Governor Romney once did for the people of Massachusetts and as a private citizen while running the Olympics. Governor Romney knows that Rick Santorum supported a moratorium on earmarks - but I guess if I had to defend the proliferation of spending Governor Romney advocated through bailouts and freedom-killing government run healthcare, I\'d try and distract people too.""As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney called on his state\'s congressional delegation to continue throwing good money after bad at the boondoggle ""Big Dig"" in Boston. Governor Romney had allotted $20 million from the Commonwealth\'s rainy-day fund, but grew so concerned that he reached out to the Massachusetts congressional delegation saying: ""I\'d be embarrassed if I didn\'t always ask for federal money whenever I get the chance."" (""Big Dig Ready To Swallow More Taxpayer Money,"" Tovia Smith, NPR, July 21, 2006)In his book Turnaround, Romney even devotes an entire chapter, entitled ""Funds from the Feds,"" to talk about his advocacy for federal appropriations for the 2002 Olympic Games. Romney outlines in detail his lobbying of Senator Ted Stevens and Senator John McCain for federal funding for the Utah games. Romney would state that they ""would need hundreds of millions of dollars worth of federal support from a long list of departments."" (Mitt Romney, Turnaround, pg 227)In fact, by the end of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games, the federal government had invested $342 million in aid to plan and stage the games. According to a Government Accountability Office report, this was nearly $50 million more in constant dollars than was spent for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games (Kirk Johnson, ""In Olympics Success, Romney Found New Edge,"" New York Times, September 19, 2007).Among the taxpayer funded expenditures were:$33,000 for an Olympic horse adoption program$55,000 for the Department of Justice to assess and resolve racial tension in Salt Lake City.More than half the federal dollars went to security, as well as shuttle buses, drug testing, and park-and-ride lots around Salt Lake City, UT.So, in other words, his much vaunted ""private sector"" turnaround skills required federal intervention.'"

Very early in the process, I promised Hot Air readers that I would disclose my choice for President in the primaries when I had fully made up my mind. Just as I did four years ago, I didn\'t fully make up my mind until shortly before the caucus. Last time I caucused for Romney; this time, if I had the opportunity, I would caucus for Rick Santorum...... Why Santorum? In my estimation, Santorum is the last consistent conservative standing, and the only one both promoting the conservative agenda and campaigning as a conservative in the race. That doesn\'t make Santorum perfect; he lacks the executive experience I\'d like to see, and some of his positions in the past and present give me pause. However, compared to the heterodoxies of his competitors in the GOP race, Santorum has a superior record on promoting conservative policies and values.Even more than that, though, Santorum has demonstrated a level of personal integrity in this race that outshines the rest of the field. Santorum has campaigned with blue-collar Reagan Democrats in mind, pushing for an economic plan that would revitalize manufacturing and small business. He could easily have tipped over into class-warfare populism while Gingrich and Romney bashed each other over their work at Bain and Freddie Mac in order to ingratiate himself with that sector by playing on latent envy. Instead, he defended capitalism and both of his competitors on the campaign trail more effectively than either could defend themselves. In contrast, Romney keeps demonstrating a lack of fluency in conservative politics and philosophy, while Gingrich has conducted a personal, angry campaign that threatens to reinforce every negative stereotype about conservatives, both at times putting themselves and their ambitions above the party they seek to lead.In the general election, I want to beat Barack Obama and send him into a prosperous retirement with his family. In the primary, I want a party leader who demonstrates the kind of integrity and consistency that only Santorum has shown. He worked hard for my vote, and I only wish I could be in the state to cast it on Tuesday.'"

But there are almost no differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama on heath care. Mitt Romney authored and has been a stalwart defender of the top-down, government run Massachusetts health care law that served as the framework of the disaster known as ObamaCare.Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""As Governor Tim Pawlenty so aptly said, RomneyCare should be called ObamneyCare. Everyone knows that Governor Romney\'s top down government run mandated health insurance plan was the basis of ObamaCare.Oddly enough, the only accomplishment that Gov. Romney points to and actually defends during his tenure as Governor - is the most liberal, the most intrusive and unconstitutional. In fact, the only area conservatives would appreciate Romney flip-flopping on would be RomneyCare. So why he doubles down on this liberal accomplishment instead of just flip-flopping as usual is beyond me. We\'re all looking for Gov. Romney to finally have firm conviction on something, but it\'s pretty telling that he picks RomneyCare.""Following the most recent Republican Presidential Debate, Grace-Marie Turner in the Wall Street Journal outlined why Romney\'s defense of the indefensible simply didn\'t work.""Scoring Last Week\'s RomneyCare Debate""By: Grace-Marie Turner, The Wall Street Journalhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577187351873393504.htmlRick Santorum went for the jugular in Thursday night\'s Republican presidential debate, exposing Mitt Romney\'s weak and contradictory defense of his Massachusetts health-reform law.Mr. Santorum attacked Mr. Romney\'s claim that the individual mandate affects only ""the 8% of people who didn\'t have insurance."" Mr. Romney insisted that ""92% of the people in my state had insurance before our plan went in place. And nothing changes for them.""Mr. Santorum blasted back that ""what Governor Romney said is just factually incorrect,"" because the mandate affects 100% of the residents who are forced to buy health insurance ""as a condition of breathing in Massachusetts.""...... Mr. Romney\'s attempt to contrast his plan with ObamaCare wasn\'t convincing. ""I don\'t like the Obama plan,"" he said in Thursday\'s debate. ""His plan cuts Medicare by $500 billion. We didn\'t, of course, touch anything like that. He raises taxes by $500 billion. We didn\'t do that.""These are bogus boasts: States have no authority over cuts in the federal Medicare program, so cutting Medicare never was an option with RomneyCare. Massachusetts didn\'t raise taxes to finance its plan because it relied on previously enacted health-insurance taxes and an infusion of federal Medicaid money to finance its coverage expansion. The state simply passed a big share of its costs to federal taxpayers.Mr. Santorum challenged Mr. Romney on his claim that RomneyCare is ""very different than ObamaCare,"" citing a new study that lists key features the two plans have in common, including the Medicaid expansion, an employer mandate and the individual mandate.The study is from the liberal Families USA, which credits John McDonough and explains he ""was deeply involved"" in developing both RomneyCare and ObamaCare. Among the key checkpoints showing the similarities between the two plans: ""RomneyCare authorizes \'tiers\' of insurance coverage, which are called Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Young Adult . . . ObamaCare sets the following tiers for policies: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Young Adult."" And government will specify which benefits must be included in health plans under both reform laws. Mr. McDonough earlier said the federal law is ""Massachusetts with three more zeros."" Mr. Romney repeatedly says he believes in state-level solutions. But when he says he wants to give states more discretion in implementing ObamaCare, there isvery little daylight between his position and President Obama\'s. The president has said Congress should pass legislation to accelerate the provision in the law that would allow states more flexibility in implementing the health lawstarting in 2014.Mr. Santorum was passionate in insisting that Mr. Romney\'s defense will collapse in a debate with President Obama, and the candidate would be wide open to attack. ""Folks, we can\'t give this issue away in this election. It is about fundamental freedom,"" he said. Mr. Romney has indeed backed himself into a corner by insisting on defending his health plan while attacking ObamaCare. In the Oct. 11 debate at Dartmouth College, Mr. Romney said: ""[W]e all agree about repeal and replace. And I\'m proud of the fact that I put together a plan that says what I\'m going to replace it with.""Does he really mean that he wants to use Massachusetts as a model for his ""replacement"" plan? No wonder voters are worried.Unless Mr. Romney takes steps to conform his position with reality, he will have trouble convincing voters he is serious about repeal and will have an even harder time mapping a clear plan on health reform should he be elected president.'"

Rick Santorum,R,p,"February 6, 2012",b'Press Release - Santorum Surge Prompts Romney to Use Attack Machine',"b'Verona, PA - Today Mitt Romney\'s well financed seek and destroy attack machine turned its sights on Rick Santorum. And the reason is clear. Recent polling data strongly suggests that Rick Santorum is by far Romney\'s most significant opponent.Polling results just released today by Magellan Strategies BR show Rick Santorum beating Romney in Missouri. Polling results by Public Policy Polling, also show Rick Santorum beating Romney in Minnesota, and catching up to Romney in Colorado. Polls earlier last week showed Rick Santorum ahead of Romney in Missouri and Ohio.And according to a Rasmussen survey released yesterday, while Mitt Romney loses to Barack Obama by 4 points in a potential matchup, Rick Santorum is ahead of Obama 45% to 41%. This last piece of information is particularly damaging to Romney because it destroys his argument that he is the strongest opponent to defeat Obama. It also reveals that a trusted conservative is better positioned to defeat Obama than a moderate who agrees with Obama on big government healthcare mandates, government bailouts, and radical cap and trade initiatives.Hogan Gidley said, ""If Governor Romney were confident running on his record and his vision for the future, he would. But Gov. Romney does what he always does and directs his well-funded attack machine to destroy the opponent. Mitt Romney\'s act is tired, old and wearing thin with voters and I suspect at this point, with the media too. Romney never touts his own record - because it\'s abysmal. In the Republican Party we have a name for someone who supports government healthcare mandates, big bank bailouts, and radical cap and trade initiatives - we call them Democrats. Rick Santorum is the only conservative candidate who is positioned to defeat Obama because he can credibly and effectively attack the President for supporting big government healthcare mandates, government bailouts, and radical cap and trade initiatives. Mitt Romney can\'t attack Obama on any of those major issues because Gov. Romney agrees with Obama on all of them - and his attack and smear campaign is his way of avoiding his liberal record.""'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"February 9, 2012",b'Press Release - Rush Limbaugh: Establishment Shocked by Santorum Sweep',"b'The following is the full transcript from Rush Limbaugh\'s radio show on Wednesday, February 8, 2012. The transcript is also available in its entirety on Rush Limbaugh\'s website. BEGIN TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Rick Santorum, one night, three victories. CBS has the story: ""Santorum Stunner: Sweeps 3 GOP Contests."" I\'ve taken a gander throughout the Republican media, conservative media, and all over the place, and they are shocked. They\'re literally shocked. The Republican establishment had no idea this was percolating out there. I can\'t believe how insulated they are. I mean I know they\'re insulated. I know they\'re ""inside-the-Beltway."" I know they have their own world in which they live, but to look at the reaction they\'re having today, to see how shocked they are that Rick Santorum has come out of what they thought was an impossible position equivalent to nowhere, is an incredible thing. And we\'re gonna look at this in some detail. Of course, the Drive-Bys are crediting me for this. You know, it\'s about time to put a stop to this. I know why they\'re doing it, and the real reason they\'re doing it is because they think they have this kind of power. They think they have the power, and in some cases they do with certain audiences. But they think they have the power to launch Obama from nowhere to the presidency, and it could be argued that they did play a significant role here, and so they think that of themselves. So a Republican candidate comes along out of nowhere. First it was Newt, now it\'s Santorum. It can\'t be the candidates. It can\'t be thatSantorum\'s connecting with voters. It can\'t be that, no, no, it can\'t be that Santorum\'s resonating with Republican voters, the conservative base. It can\'t be that the conservative base just isn\'t happy with Romney. It can\'t be any of that. No, no, no. It has to be that the Republican base is a bunch of mind-numbed robots sitting out there waiting for marching orders from me. (interruption) Well, while it\'s fun,Snerdley, while it\'s fun to sit here and tweak these people, and while it\'s fun to listen to their sound bites, which we\'re going to do today, and it\'s fun to listen to them talk about how I\'m responsible for it, never forget that I have the most profound respect and admiration the people in this audience. I know full well that conservative voters, by and large -- there are always exceptions to things -- are intelligent, they\'re engaged, and they\'re clearly able to make up their own minds, and they do. It may be a mixture of both. But still, it\'s fascinating to watch because all of these conservatives sneak up. The one thing, it\'s never gonna stop bothering me, this notion, this template, if you will, that conservative voters are a bunch of idiots and can\'t make up their own minds. They sit around and wait for marching orders. That\'s been one of the templates to describe this audience ever since this program started in 1988. It\'s insulting, it\'s demeaning, and it impugns these people, and I think it\'s a mistake because the Republican Party had better understand here that the people who are not voting for Romney are not doing it because I\'m telling them to, or because anybody else is telling them to. They\'re doing it because they genuinely have a problem with Romney. And they\'re doing it because, in Santorum\'s case, as I\'ve been saying the past couple of weeks, if you\'re looking for a conservative who is the least corrupted, who has the least number of periods of wandering off the reservation, if you\'re looking for a conservative who\'s never sat down with Nancy Pelosi on the couch for any reason, you get Rick Santorum. And people know this. Now, one of the things that could explain Santorum\'s sweep yesterday -- there are a number of things, but one thing that could explain it is people have to think that the guy can win. That\'s what the base is telling us today. They think Santorum can win. There may be some protest votes in this, but the establishment had better wake up and understand that Republican primary voters are doing this not just to stick a finger in the eye of the establishment, not just to be frivolous here. They\'re sending a message. They sent a message with Newt in South Carolina, and I told you then that Newt was the vessel for that message and that vote, the South Carolina primary victory that he had after the confrontation in the debate with Juan Williams.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We\'ll take a brief time-out, come back and listen to a bit of Santorum\'s speech last night in St. Charles, Missouri. And after that we have a bite from Trump, who says, ""I don\'t get this whole Santorum thing."" Just last week he goes out and endorses Romney, and now this! Santorum sweeps three states.There are a lot of people scratching their heads. And... (interruption) No, I wasn\'t surprised by this! I\'m not surprised by this. It\'s one of the reasons that I haven\'t been panicking throughout all of this. I think I have a pretty good understanding and idea where the Republican base is. If they\'re given the opportunity to vote for what they think so important, they\'ll do it. Coupled with, ""Is my vote gonna be cast where somebody can actually win?"" I think people thought Newt could win. It\'s one of the reasons they voted for him. People are gonna say, ""Well, you know, Santorum can\'t win. Everybody knows he\'s unelectable."" We\'ve been hearing this. Every one of our candidates is ""Unelectable! Can\'t be elected!"" It doesn\'t matter who, other than Romney. We\'ve been told this by our side, our establishment, and by the Democrats and the media as well. BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: When you see somebody running for office, I don\'t care who it is, for the presidency, do you think you know why they want to be president? Isn\'t it amazing -- (interruption) you don\'t wonder? (interruption) Well, okay. Well, that\'s the point. We\'re left to assume why these guys want to be president. The last time I can think anybody was asked was when Roger Mudd asked Ted Kennedy back in 1980, and we got the forerunner of that gibberish at a Clinton fundraiser in the nineties. He had no answer for why he wanted to be president, no answer for why he was running. It strikes me that there aren\'t very many candidates who are asked that question point-blank. So we\'re left to assume. Like Snerdley was just shouting at me in the IFB. ""I know why Obama wanted to run. He wants to totally change this country. He doesn\'t like the way the country was founded. It\'s his job to transform it."" Yeah, we\'re left to assume that, and I think we\'re right. But he wasn\'t asked. At least not that I recall. Now, sometimes they\'ll say, ""I want to be president of this country for X, Y, Z."" But put on the spot with the question, it doesn\'t happen. So when you look around, do you know why Newt -- I\'m just asking, I don\'t have an answer here. These are rhetorical questions. I\'m asking you, this audience as voters, when you watch a Republican debate, do you have any idea why Ron Paul wants to be president? Do you have any idea why Newt wants to be? Did you know why Bachmann wanted to be president? Did you know why Rick Perry did? I\'m just asking. The reason I\'m asking is because I think when you listen to Santorum, you know. He\'s answering the question without being asked, and it\'s in that little quote that I read to you about freedom and what\'s at stake in this election and this country. That\'s his ""why."" That\'s his answer to the question why he wants to be president. It\'s a powerful thing. Here\'s what he said, ""I\'m not the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. I\'m the conservative alternative to Barack Obama. I care about the very rich, the very poor. I care about a hundred percent of America. Ladies and gentlemen, freedom\'s at stake in this election. America\'s honor is at stake."" When you hear that, you have very little doubt what it is that\'s motivating or inspiring Santorum. Let\'s go to the sound bites. We have four of them here from St. Charles, Missouri, at Santorum headquarters last night.SANTORUM: Wow. Conservatism is alive and well in Missouri and Minnesota! Thank you all so very, very much it is great to be here. I just can\'t thank the people of Missouri. We doubled \'em up here and in Minnesota! Let me just thank God for giving us the grace to be able to persevere through the dog days and blessing us and blessing our family. My wife Karen here, what a rock. I mean what a rock through these last few weeks. We have had more drama than any family really needs, and she has just been an amazing rock and a great blessing to me, and I just want to thank you in particular, my sweet, for all you\'ve done. Thank you.RUSH: Here\'s the next excerpt.SANTORUM:  I wouldn\'t be surprised if he isn\'t listening. Why would you think he would be listening now? Has he ever listened to the Voice of America before? (crowd yells ""No!"") No, why? Because he thinks he knows better. He thinks he\'s smarter than you. He thinks he\'s someone who is a privileged person who should be able to rule over all of you. But we have a different message for him.RUSH:  Rick Santorum talking about Obama. Obama, he\'s not listening tonight. He thinks he\'s better than we are. I think that nails it, by the way. I think Obama is one of these narcissistic egomaniacs, superiorist who actually does think he\'s better. The bitter clinger comment is an example. When Obama looks at everybody he has to look down his nose to see us. In the next bite, this is Santorum saying he\'s not the conservative alternative to Romney. He wants to be the conservative alternative to Obama.SANTORUM: I hope you have been listening to our message, because if you listen to our message and you found out that on those issues -- health care, the environment, cap and trade, and on the Wall Street bailouts -- Mitt Romney has the same positions as Barack Obama. And in fact would not be the best person to come up and fight for your voices for freedom in America. Ladies and gentlemen, I don\'t stand here to claim to be the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. I stand here to be the conservative alternative to Barack Obama. (crowd chanting)RUSH: It\'s the standard slogan at these rallies, ""We pick Rick,"" that\'s always the slogan, got all fired up. Santorum is also very fluent in the language of conservatism. It\'s natural. It pours out. And explaining, for example, the theory of limited government is second nature to him. He doesn\'t have to be taught it. He doesn\'t have to have it written for him. He doesn\'t have to be briefed and he certainly doesn\'t have to be tutored right before he goes out to speak about it.SANTORUM: The president over the last few years has tried to tell you that he -- in fact, the government -- can give you rights. The government can take care of you and provide for you. They can give you the ""right"" to health care like in Obamacare.AUDIENCE: Nooo.SANTORUM: Well, look what happens when the government gives you rights. When the government gives you rights, unlike when God gives you rights, the government can take them away. When government gives you rights, the government can tell you how to exercise those rights. And we saw that just in the last week with a group of people -- a small group of people: Just Catholics in the United States of America.AUDIENCE: (applause)RUSH: Yep. It just flows out of there. Now, there was a piece today from the Independent Women\'s Forum, Charlotte Hays. I am familiar with this group. Members of this group have often referred to me as Braveheart in a political sense, although it was not Charlotte Hays. But they\'re a conservative bunch. They sorta created themselves as the alter ego of the feminazis. They appreciate strong men. They want strong men. They desire a role for strong men in relationships and in the world, in politics and all of this. They\'re a good bunch of people. So this is from Charlotte Hays, posted at eight o\'clock this morning.""If you think Rick Santorum can get independents, go for it, folks."" So once again, here we have this notion that we can\'t win this without winning the independents, and conservatives can\'t win the independents. It\'s a group called the Independent Women\'s Forum, and they identify themselves as conservative. ""If you think Rick Santorum can get independents, go for it, folks. Senator Santorum, who enjoyed a magnificent triumph in three states last night, deserves a lot of credit, as he would no doubt be the first to tell you, for hanging in there. He has been impressive in recent debates. And a grateful nation thanks Mr. Santorum for seemingly having dispatched Newt Gingrich back under his bridge...""That means he\'s a troll. Newt\'s a troll. He\'s lurking under the bridge there, comes out every now and then for a debate. (interruption) It is snarky. That\'s my point. But ""at least for the time being"" we thank Santorum for dispatching Newt ""back under his bridge."" ""But last night was not good for the Republican [P]arty,"" writes Ms. Hays. ""I think the voters last night were acting like my favorite Cousin Harry,"" she says, ""who yearns for a \'real conservative\' and refers to Mitt Romney as McCain,"" and then she writes in parenthesis: ""(a McCain presidency is looking pretty good right now; it was during the campaign, not a presidency, that McCain lost his nerve),"" end parenthesis.So this little paragraph here is chock-full of stuff. She\'s ripping people (paraphrased): ""Oh, yeah, yeah! A McCain presidency is looking pretty good right now!"" I actually could make the case that the party, the Republican Party would be far worse off today with McCain having won. But that\'s for another time. Back to Ms. Hays here. ""Mitt Romney speaks conservatism like a second language -- that is because it is a second language for him. Is that such a bad thing? Sure, he needed somebody to tell him not to flaunt that coveted Bob Dole endorsement.""He needs to quickly absorb some of the language and ideas that are first nature to movement [conservatives] (e.g., Walter Williams is good on the minimum wage, Mitt). I hate it when others beat me to ideas that I\'ve been playing with, but William Tucker did the other day, proposing that Romney, with his temperament, could be another Ronald Reagan. With a conservative Congress, the sky is the limit. In a way, Santorum has replaced Gingrich as the conservative feel-good candidate. As I said, if you think he can win in November, be my guest. I worry that he doesn\'t have the kind of broad appeal needed to beat even a disaster like Barack Obama.""Now, you might ask yourself... By the way, I said I ""know"" the Independent Women\'s Forum. I don\'t know Charlotte Hays. If I\'ve met her, I don\'t recall. Rick Santorum is not rallying support because of a cult of personality. As I pointed out in the previous 45 minutes of this program, he\'s rallying support because he\'s the last real conservative still standing. He\'s running enthusiastically as a conservative. The issue is not whether he has ""broad appeal."" It\'s whether conservatism has broad appeal and can win over converts with the strength of its arguments, which get clearer.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This whole thing with Charlotte Hays here: Either conservatism is what it is and you support it, or it isn\'t. Santorum is out... I don\'t care if you can say, ""No delegates assigned."" Three states! He swept three states. If the establishment\'s right, Romney should be winning everything now. It should be over, folks, and it\'s not. Romney\'s not sweeping everything.So now the latest is, at least from Ms. Hays... Again, I don\'t know her. This is really not even a criticism of her. This is more an opportunity to illustrate a point. Santorum is out rallying support because he\'s the last real conservative still standing, and he is running as a conservative. He\'s not cloudy about it at all. There\'s no doubt about what and who Santorum is. So the question isn\'t: Well, does he have broad appeal? The question is: ""Does conservatism -- properly explained, cheerfully proclaimed have broad appeal? Can conservatism win over converts with the strength of its argument?"" And there\'s no question that it can! It does every time it\'s tried.The problem is it\'s not tried enough in electoral Republican politics. But the last time it was overwhelmingly successful was Reagan. We\'ve been through time and time again how much the establishment doesn\'t like that. They just don\'t like conservatives and they don\'t like conservatism, for all the reasons that we\'ve stated. But in times like these? One of the reasons you want down-the-middle, straight conservative is because of the opportunity to contrast it with Obama. Times like this are when conservatism becomes crystal clear to people that don\'t understand it or have never had it explained to them or don\'t quite think ideologically in their lives. It\'s the greatest opportunity ever to explain conservatism to people. It explains itself! As times get more dire, and as Obama becomes more stridently left, conservatism comes into focus.Now, if you are a conservative and you don\'t believe that that\'s true, then why be a conservative?If conservatism has to be modified or moderated somehow, why be a conservative? So there\'s a lot going on with this. There is a lot that establishment types could learn and go ahead and use from this experience and this example. I know it gets frustrating, folks, having to constantly teach. You look at the left, and they don\'t have to teach it. Liberalism is the most gutless choice you can make. You see some suffering and go, ""Oh, gosh, I hate that!"" Oh, you\'re a liberal and you\'ve got a big heart. You got compassion. You\'ve done nothing but see it. You\'ve done nothing but say you saw it. You come along with ideas to fix it, and that\'s when you get opened up to all these charges and you have to take an intellectual foray into understanding what this is about. END TRANSCRIPT'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"February 11, 2012","b""Press Release - Rick Santorum's Response to Iran""","b'President Barack Obama naively and cavalierly once declared Iran as a ""tiny country"" that did not pose a serious threat. However, recent news reports that Iran will soon unveil big nuclear achievements, coupled with a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has renewed fears that these radical Islamists are on the verge of having a nuclear weapon.If Barack Obama has taught us anything, it\'s that experience matters. Rick Santorum has that experience  serving 8 years on Senate Armed Services Committee, authoring the Iran Freedom and Support Act in 2004 and the Syrian Accountability Act. In fact, Rick Santorum has recognized the looming threat of Iran\'s nuclear ambitions for nearly a decade  standing tall against both Republicans and Democrats who have discounted and dismissed the reality that this radical theocracy is intent on destroying Israel and western civilization.Santorum Administration\'s Response To Iran:Reinstate full funding authorized under the Iran Freedom and Support Act to assist pro-democracy groups within IranBring greater attention to human rights violations of the Iranian regime against democracy protestors and minority religious groupsWould work with Israel to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat immediately; and developing a potential plan for military action if neededWould work with Israel to determine the proper military response needed to stabilize the region, protect our allies and protect this country  including the authorization of targeted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.Any nuclear scientist proven to be working for Iran\'s nuclear program would be treated as an enemy combatantHelp create Strike Funds to help organizers on the ground publicly protest and overthrow the regimeEconomically target Iran by sanctioning Iran\'s central bank coupled with opening all forms of energy production in the U.S effectively devastating Iran\'s only economyEnsure Iranian officials cannot access any of their funds by freezing bank accounts and significantly limit their travel by revoking visasRefuse to negotiate on any level with the terrorist state of IranNeutralize Iran\'s relationships with their primary allies in The Middle East by increasing pressure on Hezbollah and SyriaEliminate the post of U.S. Ambassador to SyriaStand with Israel as an ally and in any efforts Israel may take to defend themselves from Iranian aggressionWould push for, fully fund and build a comprehensive missile defense system, and reevaluate the ramifications of the Start TreatyAuthorize more research on the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) ThreatDevelop a National Prevention Plan to prevent a severe terrestrial and space emergencies that would take down our information systems or electrical gridsDuring his time in elected office, Rick Santorum was the national leader and ahead of the curve on identifying and proposing real solutions to deal with the threat of a nuclear Iran:Served on the Senate Armed Services Committee for 8 years, where he worked to transform the military from a Cold War force into one prepared to deal with the threats of today and tomorrowAuthor of the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which imposed real sanctions on the Iranian regime and authorized $100 million in annual funding for pro-democracy movements within IranAuthor of the Syria Accountability Act to combat the threat Syria posed to Israel'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"February 12, 2012",b'Press Release - ICYMI: Polls Show Santorum Takes the Lead',"b'Santorum Connects With Republican Voters Based On Core Conservative Principles And LikeabilityVerona, PA - After Tuesday\'s landslide wins in Minnesota and Missouri, and his victory in the Romney strong-hold of Colorado, Rick Santorum\'s momentum continues nationally with several polls showing him surging to a lead over Mitt Romney.In a new Public Policy Polling survey, Rick Santorum surges to a 15-point lead nationally over Mitt Romney. When former Speaker Newt Gingrich is removed, Santorum\'s lead grows to 22-points.Public Policy Polling:National Poll (including Gingrich):Santorum: 38%Romney: 23%Gingrich: 17%National Poll (excluding Gingrich):Santorum: 50%Romney: 28%A new FOX News poll show similar momentum for Santorum, with a surge of 13-points in the two days following Tuesday night election contests.FOX News Poll: National Poll (two-days following Tuesday\'s elections):Santorum: 30%Romney: 30%Gingrich: 16%Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""So much of American politics can be summed up by the three questions, ""Do I know you?,"" ""Do I like you?,"" and ""Do I trust you?"" By this time, voters have gotten a chance to know all these candidates, and they now know Rick Santorum is the only true conservative in the race that they like and who they can trust.""As the Public Policy Polling survey notes:Part of the reason for Santorum\'s surge is his own high level of popularity. 64% of voters see him favorably to only 22% with a negative one. But the other, and maybe more important, reason is that Republicans are significantly souring on both Romney and Gingrich. Romney\'s favorability is barely above water at 44/43, representing a 23 point net decline from our December national poll when he was +24 (55/31). Gingrich has fallen even further. A 44% plurality of GOP voters now hold a negative opinion of him to only 42% with a positive one. That\'s a 34 point drop from 2 months ago when he was at +32 (60/28).Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as \'very conservative,\' he\'s now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney. Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney. And with Evangelicals he falls just short of a majority with 45% to 21% for Gingrich and 18% for Romney.'"

They\'re better at taking opponents apart than building a compelling candidate of their own. They do not seem capable of deepening his meaning, making his stands and statements more textured and interesting. He comes across like a businessman who studied the data and came up with the formula that will make the deal. A particular problem is that he betrays little indignation at any of our problems and their causes. He\'s always sunny, pleasant, untouched by anger. This leaves people thinking, ""Excuse me, but we are in crisis. Financially and culturally we fear our country is going down the drain. This guy doesn\'t seem to be feeling it. So why\'s he running? Maybe he thinks it\'s his personal destiny to be president. But if the animating passion of his candidacy is about him, not us, who needs him?""Mitt Romney\'s aides are making the classic mistake of thinking the voters want maturity, serenity and a jolly spirit. What they want is a man who knows what time it is, who has a passion to reform our country, and who yet holds these qualities within a temperament that is mature, serene and jolly. Newt Gingrich has half the package: He has a passion to reform, but it exists inside a crazy suit. Mitt has no particular passion within an obviously sane suit.Which leads to Rick Santorum. Nobody in the conservative base hates Rick. Newt is hated by many and Mitt by some. Mr. Santorum is liked. He has real indignation about what\'s happened to America, and he brings passion to his ideas about reform.He\'s got little money, little organization-there\'s no broad assumption he can pull it off. And by the time the Romney campaign is done dismantling him, he may have some people who hate him. But this will only underscore the Romney campaign\'s reputation for destroying, not creating.

Romney can do is unleash his well-funded DC attack machine to destroy others. However, Rick Santorum remains committed to discussing the issues that will have to be addressed if we are going to win this November and outlining his positive vision for America.""Going After RickBy: William Kristol, The Weekly StandardAmerica is going bankrupt, Iran is going nuclear, the Obama administration is going after religious liberty. And Mitt Romney is going after Rick Santorum.Which is fine (sort of). Romney\'s in a political fight, and politics ain\'t beanbag, as Romney has tried to say.But does his super PAC-following public (and therefore legal) guidance from his own campaign-have to go after Santorum in so juvenile a way? Santorum voted to raise the debt limit!(Along with every virtually other Republican when the GOP controlled the Senate-and does Romney think they shouldn\'t have raised the debt limit?). Santorum voted to raise his own pay! (As part of an appropriations bill-and does Romney think senators are overpaid?)The Romney campaign often gives the impression that it thinks Republican primary voters are really stupid-and it doesn\'t do a very good job of hiding its contempt. The Obama administration clearly thinks the American people are really stupid-and it doesn\'t do a very good job of hiding its contempt. It would be nice if the Republican nominee could contrast his respect for the American people with the Obama administration\'s contempt.Team Romney Attack On Santorum BackfiresBy: Byron York, The Washington Examiner... The Romney campaign discovered the risk of enlisting those lawmakers on Tuesday, when it held a call in which former Rep. and Sen. Jim Talent denounced Santorum\'s spending record. Among the targets of Talent\'s criticism was Santorum\'s support of the Medicare prescription drug entitlement. ""He voted for Medicare Part D, a big expansion of a federal entitlement,"" Talent said of Santorum.The problem was, Talent himself was in the Senate at the time, and he also voted for Medicare Part D. When reporters brought up that fact, Talent explained that he wasn\'t running against Santorum -- Romney was. ... Whatever the explanation, there\'s no doubt Talent\'s record undermined his criticism of Santorum, and in the end the episode highlighted why Santorum will be more difficult for the Romney team to attack than Newt Gingrich...... A new ad run in Michigan by the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future hits Santorum for voting to raise the federal debt ceiling, for voting in favor of wasteful spending, and for voting to raise his own pay as a member of Congress. How many members of Romney\'s team of House and Senate endorsers have never voted to raise the debt ceiling, never voted for wasteful spending, and never voted to raise congressional pay? The fact is, many, many Republicans who have been members of Congress, especially in the George W. Bush years, have done those things and more. How effective will they be in Romney\'s effort to condemn Santorum as a big spender? Romney himself can still make the spending argument against Santorum, although as governor of Massachusetts Romney sought federal earmarks just like other governors. But in this campaign Romney has often relied on surrogates to attack his opponents. From now on, when it comes to charges of big spending, Team Romney will have to be careful about who\'s doing the talking.""'"

John McCain on the earmarks: ""an incredible pork-barrel project for Salt Lake City and its environs""Verona, PA - Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has spent much of his time on the campaign trail either attacking Rick Santorum for his past support of earmarks or touting his ""turnaround"" ability in running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games. However, there\'s a serious inconsistency in Romney\'s support for Federal appropriations and the true catalyst for the Olympic ""turnaround.""Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said, ""Mitt Romney\'s negative-only style politics is sad and desperate. And just like his previous attacks, this latest attack about earmarks is hypocritical too. We all know Romney was his own lobbyist for millions in earmarks - who does he honestly think he\'s fooling? Unfortunately it\'s just what we\'ve come to expect from Mitt Romney. In fact, we just learned today that Mitt Romney\'s PAC is up to $12 million in negative-only attacks - and now Romney\'s very own campaign is pushing millions in negative ads too. After 4 years as Governor and 6 years of running for president, it\'s clear that Mitt Romney would rather tear down someone else than talk about his own record. The only contender in this race that is giving voters a hopeful vision for America is Rick Santorum. Polls continue showing the desperate politics of destruction displayed by both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will fall flat on voters looking to restore American hopefulness and American greatness.""Mitt\'s Federal BailoutIn his book Turnaround, Romney even devotes an entire chapter, entitled ""Funds from the Feds,"" to talk about his lobbying for federal appropriations for the 2002 Olympic Games. Romney outlines in detail his lobbying of Senator Ted Stevens and Senator John McCain for federal funding for the Utah games.They ""would need hundreds of millions of dollars worth of federal support from a long list of departments."" (Mitt Romney, Turnaround, pg 227)""He (Romney) directed plans to hire experienced transportation lobbyists -- even highlighting how he poached one from another group that was trying to win earmarks for non-Olympic projects in Utah."" (Jennifer Dobner & Kasie Hunt, ""Romney Led Olympics To Success - With Some Help,"" Associated Press, February 18, 2012)Though Romney claims this money was necessary as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the fact is that he began his lobbying months before that terrible Fall morning.... ""Other participants said they remember Romney\'s involvement vividly. In February 2001, half a dozen congressional staff members flew to Utah to review proposals for federal money from the organizing committee."" (Rosalind Helderman, ""Romney\'s Work On Olympics, Mass. Projects Reveals Complex History With Earmarks,"" The Washington Post, February 16, 2012)Romney even personally lobbied and ""wooed"" members of Congress for earmarks.""He (Romney) met Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, then the chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. And he wooed Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who along with Democratic Rep. John Dingell of Michigan had inquired about wasteful Olympic spending, resulting in a critical report from the Government Accountability Office."" (Jennifer Dobner & Kasie Hunt, ""Romney Led Olympics To Success - With Some Help,"" Associated Press, February 18, 2012)Current Romney supporter, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), was particularly critical of Romney\'s efforts to lobby for earmarks, calling the earmarks ""an incredible pork-barrel project for Salt Lake City and its environs."" (Jennifer Dobner & Kasie Hunt, ""Romney Led Olympics To Success - With Some Help,"" Associated Press, February 18, 2012)The magnitude of Romney\'s bailout by the Federal government reached the hundreds of millions of, if not over $1 billion, taxpayer dollars. ""But the federal government\'s contributions, thanks to Mr. Romney, were also immense. By the time the Games were over, about $342 million in federal money to plan and stage the Winter Games had flowed into Utah, a record outlay for the Olympics and nearly $50 million more in constant dollars than was spent for the Atlanta Olympics, according to a report in 2001 by the Government Accountability Office. (Kirk Johnson, ""In Olympics Success, Romney Found New Edge,"" New York Times, September 19, 2007)""The federal government pumped more than $340 million into Utah in advance of the 2002 Games, funding about 18 percent of the cost, including funds for buses, light-rail construction and a host of security-related projects, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. If costs for rebuilding Interstate 15 and all of the light-rail expenses are added, the federal sum zooms to $1.3 billion."" (Thomas Burr, ""Romney\'s Olympic Earmarks Under Fire,"" The Salt Lake Tribune, February 17, 2012)Among the expenditures paid for by taxpayer dollars included: $33,000 for an Olympic horse adoption program and $55,000 for the Department of Justice to assess and resolve racial tension in Salt Lake City. (Kirk Johnson, ""In Olympics Success, Romney Found New Edge,"" New York Times, September 19, 2007)So, in other words, Romney\'s much vaunted ""private sector"" turnaround skills required federal intervention.

Rick Santorum,R,p,"February 20, 2012","b'Press Release - Detroit News Op Ed: ""This President Is Not Interested in Creating Jobs... He\'s Interested in Creating a Dependency Class""'","b'Santorum Detroit News Op-Ed Today Outlines Real, Plausible and Possible Vision To Rebuild Manufacturing BaseVerona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum published an opinion piece in this morning\'s Detroit News outlining his dynamic plan to revitalize the American manufacturing sector. The op-ed contrasts Rick Santorum\'s bright, bold vision against the top-down government-focused plan of President Obama.Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""The differences between Barack Obama and Rick Santorum couldn\'t be more stark. Rick Santorum is advocating for free-people and free-markets to rebuild our industrial center from the bottom-up, the same way it became great in the first place. Barack Obama believes in the heavy hand of government, and defers decisions and policy ideas to his friends in the environmental fringe and Big Labor bosses.While gas prices continue climbing, this President decides to stop a job-creating energy-producing project like the Keystone Pipeline. The negative impact that this decision has on every American and American business seems to be obvious to everyone but President Obama. We need a president who understands the problems facing our industrial base and who will put people ahead of radical environmental policies - and that leader is Rick Santorum.""End taxes on manufacturing to help restore U.S. economyBy Rick Santorum, The Detroit NewsMichigan has lost 143,000 jobs since President Obama took office. Over a quarter of a million workers have left the labor force. Michigan\'s official unemployment is more than 9 percent. In Michigan, as in the rest of the country, if you ask people whether they are better off than they were four years ago, the answer is no... ... Some in America don\'t understand what makes America great. Last Monday President Obama sent to Congress a budget. It has massive tax and spending increases and continues our unsustainable budget deficits.America has tried three years of higher spending and increased government intervention. It has never worked. It cannot work.America can do better. Much better.In the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, Michigan created more than half a million jobs. The unemployment rate in the state fell from 12.4 percent when Reagan took office to 6.9 percent when he left.I\'m deeply committed to Reagan\'s policies of economic freedom, prosperity and growth. I\'ve also been unwavering and successful in my commitment to cut taxes for American businesses and families, reform regulations, and unleash our entrepreneurial spirit once again.Americans have to compete against countries all around the world who want our jobs, and in many cases took our jobs. Our plan understands the competitive playing field...... I\'ll triple the child exemption, because there\'s no more stressful job than being a parent. Unless we have strong families and strong community, we\'re not going to be an economically successful country.China is one of the most important countries in the world. America and China should grow and prosper together. The only way to do that is if both countries abide by the same set of rules. Unfortunately that has not yet happened.That\'s why we need a zero tax rate for manufacturing activity. Manufacturing is vital, and it\'s disadvantaged in America because of China\'s policies. We need to give our homegrown industry some help.In addition to a zero tax rate for manufacturing activity, I\'ll call on Congress to pass an immediate cut of the business income tax rate from the disastrously uncompetitive rate of 35 percent to 17 percent. That will help businesses stay in America and create jobs.I\'ll also ask Congress to eliminate or dramatically reduce the tax on profits that U.S. businesses earn overseas, thus encouraging the repatriation of capital to help build America and create jobs. I\'ll urge the expansion of the R&D; tax credit from 14 percent to 20 percent and make it permanent. We shouldn\'t have a society that has a president who creates class warfare or envy between one group of people and another. We should celebrate success like we do in towns all across America.Detroit builds statues and monuments and buildings, and names them after people. Why? Because in their greatness and innovation, they created wealth, not just for themselves but for everybody. And that\'s a good thing, not something to be condemned in America.We won\'t get the dynamic growth our sick economy needs unless we also reduce the suffocating regulatory burden on industry. Enterprise isn\'t free when it\'s tangled in 82,000 pages of red tape every year. Large corporations have compliance departments that can handle these regulations, but small businesses can\'t manage. Getting rid of irrational and burdensome regulations is change that we can believe in together as we restore America\'s greatness and freedom.I\'ve committed to immediately repealing all Obama regulations that have a burden of more than $100 million on American businesses. I\'ll have all regulations reviewed to determine whether benefits exceed costs, and I\'ll revoke those regulations that cannot meet this commonsense test.Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank law go against the America\'s principles of limited government and individual freedom. They kill opportunities for job growth. I\'ll work with Congress to repeal Dodd-Frank.An effective energy policy will expand economic development and create high-quality jobs, resulting in a strong economy for America\'s families and workers. It\'s time to get serious about unleashing America\'s domestic energy.Hydraulic fracturing has turned oil shale into an economically viable resource. It\'s reduced North Dakota\'s unemployment rate to 3.3 percent and created well-paying jobs for everyone who wants one.The Obama administration\'s decision to prevent the construction of the Keystone Pipeline is unconscionable. Oil supplies from Mexico and Venezuela are diminishing, and our refineries in the Gulf need a new supply of Canadian oil in order to keep employing Americans.But this president is not interested in creating jobs. In my opinion, he\'s interested in creating benefits. He\'s interested in redistributing wealth and creating a dependency class. Government becomes your lifeboat.More and more of our budget is taken up with these entitlements that keep people dependent.When I was born, the military was 60 percent of the federal budget, and entitlements were 10 percent. Now, the military is just 17 percent of the budget, and entitlements are consuming most of revenues.America needs bold and sustainable entitlement reforms. In my budgets, each year\'s spending will be less than the year before until the budget is balanced. I\'ll cut at least $5 trillion over 5 years in non-defense related federal spending, and in five years I\'ll send Congress a balanced budget.Ultimately, the success of America is not found in managing the economy. It\'s in getting Washington off of the backs of ordinary Americans and creating the atmosphere for economic growth. We\'ve done it before, and we can do it again.'"

Barack Obama has been the Cap-and-Taxer In Chief, imposing onerous regulation after onerous regulation on American industry while claiming to want to rebuild America\'s manufacturing base. Likewise, Mitt Romney has fallen prey to the rhetoric of the environmental left and, while serving as Governor, imposed statewide cap-and-tax regulations on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""Government healthcare mandates, the big bank bailout and governmental takeover of religious freedoms are just a few of the issues where Mitt Romney has joined Barack Obama. And now we find out that radical environmentalism is no different. Governor Romney actually bought into and even supported the radical environmentalist\'s movement to pass job crushing cap and tax legislation. Studies show that if Mitt Romney had his way, and his legislation would\'ve been passed nationwide - for Michigan - as many as 90,800 jobs would\'ve been lost. Rick Santorum has never bought into the radical left\'s junk science, and has instead stood by the revolutionary American doctrine based on free people and free markets. Rick Santorum has stood up for opening the tundra of the North Slope of Alaska for drilling, exploring for natural gas, and expediting the approval of the Keystone Pipeline.

Mitt Romney to continue making such false statements about his own record is deeply concerning.""The American people can decide what\'s worse: Mitt Romney joining withPresident Obama to take away our religious freedoms or not telling the truth about it.""Romney ""Lied"" About Forcing Catholic Hospitals to Provide AbortifacientsBy Quin Hillyer, The American Spectatorhttp://spectator.org/blog/2012/02/23/romney-lied-about-forcing-cathThis report from the ""Boston Catholic Insider"" is so well documented, so well laid out chronologically, that I have no reason to doubt its veracity. It shows overwhelmingly that Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have been correct in accusing Mitt Romney of personally forcing Catholic hospitals into the requirement to provide abortifacients (morning after pills, specifically).Key points from a much longer column:Dec. 7, 2005: a week before the law was to take effect, the Boston Globe ran an article headlined, ""Private hospitals exempt on pill law"". The article said the state Department of Public Health had determined that the emergency contraception law ""does not nullify a statute passed years ago that says privately run hospitals cannot be forced to provide abortions or contraception.""Public Health Commissioner Paul Cote Jr. told the Globe: ""We felt very clearly that the two laws don\'t cancel each other out and basically work in harmony with each other.""....December 8, 2005: The Globe itself ruefully bowed to this legal analysis. It ran an editorial headlined: ""A Plan B Mistake."" ""The legislators failed, however,"" the Globe said, ""to include wording in the bill explicitly repealing a clause in an older statute that gives hospitals the right, for reasons of conscience, not to offer birth control services.""Liberals joined in attacking Romney\'s defense of Catholic hospitals. But that defense did not last long.The same day the Globe ran its editorial, Romney held a press conference. Now he said his legal counsel had advised him the new emergency contraception law did trump the 1975 conscience law.""On that basis, I have instructed the Department of Public Health to follow the conclusion of my own legal counsel and to adopt that sounder view,"" Romney said. ""In my personal view, it\'s the right thing for hospitals to provide information and access to emergency contraception to anyone who is a victim of rape.""....Lifesite News reported at the time, ""Romney Does Flip-Flop and Forces Catholic Hospitals to Distribute Morning-After-Pill"":In a shocking turn-around, Massachusetts\'s governor Mitt Romney announced yesterday that Roman Catholic and other private hospitals in the state will be forced to offer emergency contraception to sexual assault victims under new state legislation, regardless of the hospitals\' moral position on the issue.A constitutional law expert advising BCI says that the LEGISLATIVE INTENT was clearly to allow the 1975 statute to prevail. The formulation of the regulations is supposed to follow the legislative intent. Romney actually violated the law and his oath of office by NOT going with the legislative intent, and overruling the legislative intent (as well as the Constitution).But it was not merely a legal interpretation by the legal counsel to Romney. Romney said he personally thought it was the ""right thing"" for hospitals to provide access to emergency contraception for any rape victims.This is not mere ""gotcha"" stuff. And it has nothing to do with whether one believes rape victims should have access to the morning after pill. Just as is the case with Barack Obama\'s new order requiring Catholic hospitals to provide insurance coverage for free abortifacients, this is a matter of religious freedom. This Obama order is becoming, quite rightly, a central issue in this year\'s campaign. The record is that Mitt Romney was dead wrong on this issue. Period.'"

My friends\' families worked in the steel mills and my grandfather was a coal miner who worked hard so his children could taste freedom in America.  Back then, America made things, and that meant jobs, it meant strong families and it means a strong economy. The President tells us those jobs are gone, but he\'s wrong - and I\'m not willing to ever surrender those jobs to China. We can revive this economy immediately, if we cut taxes across the board and repeal the radical job crushing environmental policies of this Administration. If we create a level playing field - I will bet on the American worker above anyone else from any other country every time - and we will win. We must free our economy and put faith back in the American people, not in government. My plan does that and together we will rebuild America.""SANTORUM 100 DAYS ""MADE IN AMERICA""ECONOMIC FREEDOM AGENDAUNLEASH AMERICA\'S ENERGY: Approve the Keystone Pipeline for jobs and energy security, sign an order unleashing America\'s domestic energy production without picking winners and losers on Day One, and allow states to choose where they want to explore for oil and natural gas and to set their own regulations for hydrofracturing.STOP JOB KILLING REGULATIONS: Eliminate all regulations promulgated by the Obama Administration which have an economic burden over $100 million dollars, on Day One, including repeal of the EPA rule on CO2 emissions that has already shut down six power plants and furloughed 500 workers. Order a review of all regulations, making sure these regulations use sound science and common-sense cost benefit analysis.REIN IN SPENDING TO SECURE OUR FUTURE: Propose spending cuts of $5 trillion over 5 years, including spending cuts for the remainder of fiscal year 2013. Propose budgets that spend less money each year than the year before, and reduce the non-defense related federal workforce at least 10 percent, without replacing with contractors.REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE: Submit legislation to Congress to repeal ObamaCare and issue an executive order ending related regulatory obligations on the states on Day One. Work with Congress to replace ObamaCare with competitive choices of healthcare plans to improve the quality and limit the cost of healthcare, while protecting those with uninsurable health conditions.Repeal Dodd-Frank, which is making it harder for businesses to get access to credit and for Americans to buy houses and refinance.BALANCE THE BUDGET: Submit to Congress a budget that will balance within 4 years and call on Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution which limits federal spending to 18 percent of GDP.PRO-GROWTH AND PRO-FAMILY INDIVIDUAL TAX POLICY: Submit to Congress my comprehensive pro-growth and pro-family tax policies to strengthen opportunity in our country, with lower rates of 10 percent and 28 percent. To help families, will triple the personal deduction for children and eliminate the marriage tax penalty throughout the tax code.RESTORE AMERICA\'S COMPETITIVENESS: Cut the corporate tax in half to a flat-tax rate of 17.5 percent to make America competitive internationally, and allow corporations to expense all business equipment and investment. Eliminate taxes on IRS Code Section 199 manufacturing activity to attract manufacturing back to America. Take the lead on tort reform to lower the cost of doing business in America and to reduce the cost of products and services to consumers.NEGOTIATE AND SUBMIT FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS: Because a substantial portion of Americans work for companies which export, initiate negotiations in the first 100 days and submit to Congress at least five free trade agreements to increase our exports during my first year in office.REFORM ENTITLEMENTS: Cut means-tested entitlement programs by 10 percent across the board, freeze them for four years, and block grant them to the states as Senator Santorum did as the author of welfare reform. Reform Medicare and Social Security so they are fiscally sustainable for seniors and young people.REVIVE HOUSING: Submit a plan to Congress to phase out within several years Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\'s federal housing role, reform and make transparent the Federal Reserve, and allow families whose homes are ""underwater"" to deduct losses from the sale of their home in order to better get a fresh start in difficult economic times.'"

In an interview with CNN in 2009, as Washington was debating President Barack Obama\'s health care proposal, Romney said portions of the Massachusetts law could serve as a model for the country.""I think there are a number of features in the Massachusetts plan that could inform Washington on ways to improve health care for all Americans,"" Romney told CNN. ""The fact that we were able to get people insured without a government option is a model I think they can learn from.""When the president signed his health care plan into law, it no longer had a ""public option."" But it did have an insurance mandate, something many conservative Tea Party Republicans view as unconstitutional.The insurance mandate in ""Romneycare"" wasn\'t a major liability in the governor\'s first presidential run in 2008 because ""Obamacare"" wasn\'t born yet.... But in that 2009 interview, Romney clearly defended the mandate, referring to it as a ""requirement"" that allowed Massachusetts residents to secure a ""tax exemption."" In other words, if they didn\'t sign up for health insurance, residents would get hit with a tax.""In order to get a tax exemption that you would normally get, you gotta have health insurance because we want everybody in the system. No more free riders. Everybody is part of the plan. And that way, we get the costs down. We let people know that they never have to worry about losing their coverage,"" Romney said in the interview.... ""In fact, I agree with Mitt Romney, who recently said he\'s proud of what he accomplished on health care in Massachusetts and supports giving states the power to determine their own health care solutions,"" Obama said.There are signs the issue could dog Romney well into the 2012 primary season, much as Hillary Clinton\'s vote to authorize the Iraq War hampered her run among some 2008 Democratic voters.In his new book, ""A Simple Government,"" former Arkansas Gov.

In this piece written in 2009 for Newsweek, Romney argues that the individual mandate and its corresponding tax penalties be used as ""the basic plan"" for President Obama to follow.Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""It\'s one thing to pass a healthcare mandate in your state, it\'s another to beg the President to copy your idea, but it\'s quite another to not be truthful about it. We need to trust the Republican nominee will restore freedom not continue to take them away. It\'s obviously clear we cannot trust Mitt Romney\'s promises for the future when he cannot be truthful about his performance in the past."" The answer is unleashing markets--not government.By Mitt Romney; Newsweek.http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/01/the-answer-is-unleashing-markets-not-government.html... Get everyone insured. Help low-income households retain or purchase private insurance with a tax credit, voucher or coinsurance. Use the tens of billions we now give hospitals for free care to instead help people buy and keep their own private insurance. For the uninsured who can afford insurance but expect to be given free care at the hospital, require them to either pay for their own care or buy insurance; if they do neither, they would forgo the tax credit or lose a deduction. No more ""free riders.""This is the basic plan I proposed in Massachusetts. It has worked: 360,000 previously uninsured citizens now have private health insurance. The total number of uninsured has been reduced by almost 75 percent. The Massachusetts plan costs the state more than expected, largely because the legislature has been unwilling to further reduce state payments to hospitals for free care. The costs should be brought in line by eliminating these payments, by requiring sustainable co-premiums and by removing coverage mandates (for example, every policy is now required to include unlimited in vitro fertilization procedures)...'"

The goals of the bill were to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by at least 20% from 1988 levels by the year 2000, establish an International Global Agreement on the Atmosphere by 1992, and require the EPA and Energy Department to report within two years whether to pursue even higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions reductionsafter 2000.

Rick Santorum,R,p,"March 23, 2012",b'Press Release - Romneycare Offers Free Taxpayer Funded Abortions',"b'Verona, PA - Today marks the second anniversary of the signing of Obamacare -  So many of the Obamacare promises have been broken. We were promised that our healthcare costs would go down - broken. We were promised that we could keep your own insurance - broken.No one should be surprised in the least that these promises have been broken - the same promises were made and broken in Massachusetts with the blueprint of Obamacare, Romneycare. Since Romneycare = Obamacare, we know we can expect more of the same broken promises.  But most people probably don\'t realize that recent reports have exposed the most egregious broken promise of all in Romneycare - Romneycare now offers free taxpayer funded abortions. We can\'t afford to put the Etch-A-Sketch candidate in charge of our healthcare and an issue as important as life.With Romneycare, taxpayer funded abortions started as a $50 copay - and while partially subsidizing abortions is horrible enough, now we learn that some of Romneycare\'s healthcare plans offer completely free taxpayer funded abortions. ""Mitt Romney has misled voters on Romneycare; he said he was not for mandates at the federal level when in fact he was,"" Santorum said. ""He said he didn\'t require Catholic hospitals to provide services that were against their conscience, when in fact he did, and he said he didn\'t provide free abortions under Romneycare, when he did.""The following is a list of Romneycare copayments:Benefit / CopayPreventive Service / $0Office visit to your primary care provider (PCP) / $0Office visit to a specialist / $0Radiology, imaging (x-rays), lab work / $0Outpatient surgery at a hospital or ambulatory surgery center / $0Abortion / $0Amy Contrada labels Mitt Romney as ""The Enabler,"" writing ""This is how his government-dictated health plan is playing out.

Massachusetts has the highest premiums in the country, and they continue to grow.

Today, we take a look at the prototype of socialized medicine, Romneycare - and ask what have we learned from its failure and why should be duplicate it on the national level.We learned that Romneycare does not control costs. We learned that Romneycare has taken away individual control over healthcare decisions. We learned that Romneycare reduces the quality and availability of healthcare. If we know that, why repeat the same mistake?Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum says the Obama Administration should learn from Romney\'s failed healthcare experiment.Rick Santorum said, ""It didn\'t take long for people in Massachusetts to realize Romneycare was a failure and it is already proving to be the same on the national level. That\'s why I vow to repeal and replace Obamacare.""Michael Tanner is Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute and he writes, ""The answer to controlling health care costs and increasing access to care lies with giving consumers more control over their health care spending while increasing competition in the health care marketplace- not in mandates, subsidies, and regulation. That is the lesson we should be drawing from the failure of RomneyCare.""The Washington Posts\' Jennifer Rubin writes of Romney\'s mea-culpa ""Next up is his first semi-admission that his chosen system didn\'t work. (""Our experiment wasn\'t perfect -- some things worked, some didn\'t and some things I\'d change. One thing I would never do is to usurp the constitutional power of states with a one-size-fits-all federal takeover."") So what worked in his mind and what did not?

As Romney wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""Every uninsured citizen in Massachusetts will soon have affordable health insurance and the costs of health care will be reduced."" In reality, the plan has done neither.  Billion-Dollar Overrun According to insurance industry insiders, the plans are too costly for the target market, and the potential customers- largely younger, healthy men-have resisted buying them.  The Bureaucratic Connector Although there are undoubtedly many factors behind the cost increase, one reason is that the new bureaucracy that the legislation created-the ""Connector""-has not been allowing Massachusetts citizens to buy insurance that ""fits their needs.""

Government\'s first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.""

We need a leader like Reagan who believes that we achieve peace through strength and stand firm in that conviction.""Santorum addressed the following themes to highlight the \'Fight for Freedom:\'- Call on the leadership of the Muslim world to tear down the wall of tyranny and oppression; and stand for freedom of conscience, religion, equal treatment of women, the security of Israel, and stand against violent jihadists - and for the United States to stand with those seeking freedom.- Will never be ""flexible"" on issues like missile defense by whispering in the ears of foreign leaders with the security of America or her allies is at stake.- Without freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and a free-market economy - we can never be a free people.

Rick Santorum,R,p,"March 31, 2012","b""Press Release - Healthcare Freedom Agenda: Rick Santorum's Prescription for America""","b'OBAMACARE\'S BROKEN PROMISESPresident Obama said that ""If you like your plan, you can keep it."" That was then, this is now. Obamacare is already changing the nature of health plans and making some of them disappear. The Congressional Budget Office has said that 20 million Americans will lose their health insurance by 2019.President Obama said that his health care plan would lower health care costs to the country. But now CBO says that his health care plan is going to raise costs over the next decade, and increase the deficit.President Obama said that his health care plan would lower costs to families, because giving a government program to another 50 million people would keep health care costs down. Guess whatAmericans\' health insurance premiums are rising. The common thread is that President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid were willing to say anything to get Obamacare passed. And they did say anything, true or not. Nancy Pelosi even said that we had to pass the bill to see what was in it. Now we know.WHAT\'S IN OBAMACARE?Obamacare, based on Romneycare, features overarching regulation on insurance companies governing what benefits their policies must offer and what range of prices they could charge. It also includes an unconstitutional requirement that individuals buy conforming policies; $500 billion dollars of cuts in Medicare; a panel to determine the cost-effectiveness of the treatments your doctor wants to provide; and penalties for employers who don\'t offer the right kind of health insurance.SO WHAT SHOULD AMERICANS DO?Every American should have access to high-quality, affordable health care with health care decisions made by patients and their physicians, not government bureaucrats. The same will be true under Rick Santorum\'s health care plan. It will promote patient-centered health care rather than government- centered health care. Americans would take refundable tax credits and choose private insurance. All insurance plans that are licensed in a particular state would be eligible, and each company would be free to set its own premiums. Low-income individuals would get extra tax credits so they could buy the same kind of health care as other Americans. Health insurance companies could offer high-deductible plans carrying lower premiums combined with health savings accounts, or more traditional managed care or fee-for-service plans.Rick Santorum will not cut Medicare funding and choices (as did President Obama) in order to fund a new entitlement and disguise its real cost. Medicare needs to be improved and strengthened through premium support and expanded choice so it is on a sustainable path for everyone, young and old.Another approach is legislation sponsored by Georgia Representative Tom Price, a physician, which allows employers to purchase whatever insurance plan employees choose. Employers would still enjoy the same tax benefit for providing coverage, tax-free to the employee, but workers would be able to choose from an entire range of options, policies that they could carry with them when they change jobs. Currently employees are generally limited to one plan, sponsored by their employer, and lose that coverage when they change jobs. Employees could also purchase health insurance with tax-free dollars outside the system.The contrast with Obamacare could not be starker. Rather than turn the insurance industry into a federally-controlled public utility, the Republican plans would allow all Americans, including recipients of Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\'s Health Insurance Program, to shop around and get their health insurance on the open market - just as they buy other kinds of insurance.THE U.S. HAS THE BEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLDAny attempts to reform America\'s health care system should enhance and improve our existing system. During Rick Santorum\'s time in the Senate, he promoted choice and freedom in health care policy through the creation of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and promoted choice and private sector competition to improve and strengthen Medicare for our seniors. America should avoid following the same failed paths that Britain, Canada, and many other countries have pursued with their government-run health care systems. In fact, one study, by former CBO director June O\'Neill, showed that uninsured Americans have better access to some preventive tests and screenings than insured Canadians.By a variety of measures, America is the world\'s leader in innovative medicine. Since themid-1970s, American residents have won the Nobel Prize in medicine more times than residents of all other countries combined. The United States also holds more medical technology patents than all other countries combined.But America needs American style healthcare reform with more choice, innovation, and competition driven by the people -- families and employers, patients and doctors -- not Big Government or bureaucrats. Instead, in ObamaCare and RomneyCare, the government is driving people into government dependency. This is not life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness- this is dependency and coercion rather than freedom.HOW DO WE PAY FOR HEALTH CARE?The U.S. health care system\'s costs are so high, in part, because of frivolous lawsuits. One major objective of reform, not even seriously put on the table in Obamacare, should be promoting healthcare liability reform in the states and as it relates to federal programs like Medicare.One of the strengths of the U.S. health care system is our free-market approach. Where possible, we should enhance that approach, empowering individuals to purchase Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) rather than being dependent on employer-sponsored health insurance programs. These can be combined with high-deductible plans to address concerns over costs and the potential effect of severe or catastrophic illness at the same time.Real concerns of families and patients need to be addressed in a new system, including quality, cost, and access: e.g. rising costs, portability needs, pre-existing conditions, cost transparency, access to qualified medical personnel. We need to get this right for our personal health and well-being, our family budget, and our long term, fiscal health as a nation. We need to infuse these principles into any targeted health care reforms and into existing government health care such as Medicare and Medicaid.HOW WOULD COVERAGE WORK?What to do about Americans who are born with health conditions that make insurance companies unwilling to take them, such as Rick Santorum\'s daughter Bella?Senator Santorum\'s plan begins with coverage being easily affordable, so there will be fewer uncovered families with uninsurable conditions. If people are already insured, then their insurance company has to cover them when their health changes, or when they have a baby who is very sick. That was the law before Obamacare. People would be encouraged to purchase private insurance by getting a refundable tax credit to cover premiums, thereby being able to purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars (as with employer-provided health insurance). Insurance companies should be allowed to compete over state lines to offer health insurance, to expand the market for insurance.Once a person has insurance, he would be able to switch to another plan immediately if he has not allowed his coverage to drop, without having to go on COBRA. If he has a break in coverage, it would be more expensive to buy coverage afterwards. That gives people an incentive to keep their coverage. But there are still people who fall through the cracks. About 2 million to 4 million people a year have uninsurable conditionsabout one to two percent of the U.S. population of 313 million.GIVE POWER BACK TO THE STATESIn order to enable insurance companies to be able to offer low-cost premiums to Americans, those with severe illness need to be offered special health insurance programs through the state, known as risk pools. Some states have them, and others don\'t. States are laboratories of innovation and have different needs in their populations. They can also learn from each other as to what works best and what does not. Senator Santorum is also in favor of the federal government helping states set up risk pools if that\'s what they want. This would be dramatically less expensive than the impositions of Obamacare and provide more choice for those who really need extra help with difficult-to-insure conditions.Those with pre-existing conditions would receive health insurance, subsidized by the state, through regular insurance companies. They would be able to choose their health insurance, with the price of the premiums depending on income. Alternatively, states might select one insurance company to insure all those with uninsurable conditions. It would be up to states to choose.POWER SHOULD LIE WITH INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS, NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTObamacare, inspired by Romneycare, was designed to take health care away from Americans and make them dependent on the federal government and thus is an affront to freedom. This is why it garnered the sometimes begrudging support of only one party and why 27 states are now challenging its constitutionality in the Supreme Court this week. Unlike President Obama and Governor Romney, Senator Santorum has never supported government mandates to require people to buy health insurance. Rick Santorum\'s health care policy is the exact oppositeit moves responsibility and choice back where it belongs, to the American family and individuals. In our problem-solving, let\'s also stick with the principles our founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and in our Constitution rather than the mandates and edicts of King George by respecting and protecting Americans\' fundamental freedoms. Let\'s embrace freedom and opportunity together and address real challenges with American solutions. This is also a better prescription for American\'s health and future. -------Read more on Rick\'s healthcare freedom agenda: http://www.ricksantorum.com/health-care-freedom-agenda'"

Rick Santorum,R,p,"April 5, 2012","b""Press Release - The Media's Delegate Math is Wrong""","b""A memo detailing flawed delegate counts from John Yob, delegate strategist, to Mike Biundo, campaign manager:To: Mike BiundoFrom: John YobDate: April 5, 2012Re: Delegate MathThe Media's Delegate Math is WrongThere are a couple of fundamental flaws with the delegate counts that the media keeps that reveals that this race is much closer than they report:1) Florida, Arizona, and quite possibly Puerto Rico will be proportional rather than Winner Take All. They broke RNC rules by going winner take all before the window and therefore RNC Members and/or the convention will enforce the rules and make the delegations proportional. This will reduce Romney's delegate total substantially and increase the other three candidates' respective delegate totals.2) National Convention Delegates are elected at County, District, and State conventions rather than by the initial beauty contests in many states. For example, in Washington State Romney was allocated 25 delegates, Paul 8 delegates, Santorum 7 delegates, and Gingrich 0 delegates. The Santorum and Paul campaigns are working together in Washington State and the result will be more delegates for Santorum and Paul and a dramatic decrease in delegates for Romney. Santorum will also over perform in most other states that use this process and Romney will underperform.3) Unbound delegates  The media continues to put unbound delegates in their counts in the territories and other states. These folks can change their mind, or have yet to make up their mind, and should not be counted as if they are bound.The REAL CountOur current internal count that takes into account ongoing county, district, and state conventions is as follows:Romney  571Santorum  342Newt  158Paul - 91Texas is Going Winner Take AllThe state of Texas is in the process of announcing that they are going to go Winner Take All rather than proportional. This will have a dramatic impact on the delegate projections, tighten the race after Santorum wins Texas, and significantly hinder Romney's capacity to ever get 1144 delegates because he will not get his proportion of the state. Simply put, this is a Game Changer. The race is almost even if you account for a Rick Santorum win in Texas under a Winner Take All system, and there is a clear Conservative Majority with Newt Gingrich.The Calendar Moves to MayThe month of April was always going to be difficult but the calendar gets much more friendly for Rick Santorum in May. North Carolina, Indiana, West Virginia, Nebraska, Oregon, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas might lead to Santorum winning roughly 7 out of 8 states in May, and heading into the June 5th primaries with a freight train of momentum.Conservative Majority with Newt GingrichThe campaign continues to reach out to Newt Gingrich's team to work together on County, State, and District conventions to prevent Romney from achieving 1144 and to elect a Conservative Majority of delegates.ConclusionThis race is much closer than the media and Establishment Republicans would like to report and there and events such as Texas are dramatically changing the future landscape in a manner that is positive to Rick Santorum and negative for Mitt Romney.The other campaigns are beginning to work together more closely to prevent Romney from reaching 1144 and it is starting to pay dividends.The month of April was always going to be a difficult month for Rick Santorum but it will still be close enough so that when he wins the conservative states in the month of May the race will be approximately even going into the Republican National Convention."""

Rick Santorum,R,p,"July 2, 2015",b'Press Release - Santorum Outlines Conservative Response to Supreme Court Marriage Ruling',"b'Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) was the keynote speaker at the 2nd Annual National Organization for Marriage gala in Washington, DC.Senator Santorum outlined his response to the recent Supreme Court ruling redefining the institution of marriage and what his Administration will do to strengthen the traditional American family, which will include:The Court got it wrong and we must fight: The Court has a track-record of being wrong, and this case is no different. Just as Roe v. Wade launched decades of legal battles, so has this decision. The battle is not over.Fight to reclaim marriage as an institution: We must fight to rebuild marriage so that each year in America more children know the love of their married mom and dad. This is a struggle that begins in our own homes, our own families, our own communities, our own faith communities: to make our families an outward and visible sign that love is real, it is possible, and a child\'s heart can rely on their parents\' marriage. This is about lifting up hope, about keeping the faith, and about making the idea of marriage a real possibility, part of the American dream, and not surrendering it. The family is too important to our society and our economy to give up on.Fight to protect religious freedom: We are in the middle of a powerful effort by the Left to pivot from redefining marriage to redefining Christianity--and other traditional faiths--as the moral, cultural, and legal equivalent of racism. We cannot just stand by and let that happen. We cannot afford to nominate a candidate who says ""let\'s move on,"" or ""let\'s talk about something else,"" or worse denies the reality we see all along by saying there is no clash between the liberty of believers and the Left\'s vision of what redefining marriage means for religion.Fight to protect freedom of conscience: Rev. Rick Warren said \'our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someone\'s lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do. Both are nonsense. You don\'t have to compromise convictions to be compassionate.\' Justice Kennedy\'s decision has perpetuated these two ugly lies and people of faith will now be classified under the ugliest of terms. This cannot stand.Steps a Santorum Administration will take: As a candidate, Senator Santorum was proud to sign and fully support the National Organization for Marriage\'s presidential pledge. On day one the Santorum Administration will issue an Executive Order to implement elements of the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) to ensure no agency of the federal government will interfere with the religious liberty rights of faith-based organizations who oppose same-sex marriage. In the first 100 days, President Santorum work to pass FADA to protect the 501(c)3 status of Christian schools and charities and to protect people from losing equal access to government benefits because they disagree with Justice Kennedy\'s decision. Most importantly, President Santorum will use the Office of the President to begin a national discussion on reclaiming marriage - so that all children can be assured of their birthright of having the love and support of both a mother and a father in a stable healthy home.'"

The last years of the Bush presidency brought tremendous financial hardships. So have the Obama-Biden years. Taxes are soaring. Regulations are mounting. Spending and debt are out of control. Poverty is rising. And chronic economic weakness at home is inviting our enemies to test us abroad.Hardworking Americans don\'t see the system working for them, and many are losing hope. They increasingly fear that the American Dream is dying, that their children won\'t have more freedom or opportunities than they did, that America\'s best days are behind us, not ahead of us.America deserves better. Our nation is on the wrong track.This is why I am running for President: to fight every day to advance an Economic Freedom Agenda that will create more opportunity for everyone to rise in society and make life better and safer for all American workers  especially blue collar workers  and their families.The 20/20 Flat Tax PlanThe chief causes of low growth and the woeful lack of sufficient job creation are the hideously complex federal income tax code, sky-high corporate tax rates, and the scandal-ridden Internal Revenue Service. Massive job-killing regulations, a completely dysfunctional immigration system, runaway spending and debt, and a host of other foolish Big Government policies further compound the problem.But the disastrous federal tax code and the IRS that runs it have come to symbolize everything that is wrong with Washington.It\'s time to drain the swamp.My ""20/20 Flat Tax Plan"" is not the only element of my Economic Freedom Agenda. But it is the centerpiece. These are they key points:Scrap the Tax Code and Unleash Economic GrowthAbolish the anti-worker, anti-family, anti-growth, anti-freedom federal income tax code once and for all and replace it with a simple, honest, fair rate system - 20% flat tax on individual income / 20% flat tax on business income.Dramatically downsize, restructure, and reform the IRS.Fight for American WorkersAim to make the US, once again, the world\'s leading manufacturer by providing companies with a jumpstart to compensate for the current uncompetitive system in the form of a 100% income exemption to be phased out over two years and tax deductions for capital investments.Negotiate Free Trade Agreements with the goal of expanding access to foreign markets for American products and services.Audit the Federal Reserve and appoint a Fed Chairman committed to maintaining sound money and a strong dollar.Increase the minimum wage by $0.50 per year for three years to bring it back in line with historical standards.Cut Spending and Balance/Reform the Federal BudgetFully repeal Obamacare and all of the taxes that came with it.Call on Congress and the States to pass a Balanced-Budget Amendment to the Constitution, limiting federal spending to 18% of the GDP.Submit to Congress a plan that balances the federal budget within five years.Unleash America\'s EnergyApprove the Keystone Pipeline for jobs and energy security.Open up market access to all forms of domestic fuel production.Give states the freedom to choose where they want to explore for oil and natural gas and to set their own regulations for hydrofracking.Stop Job-killing RegulationVigorously protect the safety and security of American workers and their families while protecting and promoting commonsense conservationist policies to safeguard America\'s vital natural resources.Veto or repeal nonsensical laws, regulations, and excessive orders that claim to protect Americans but actually destroy jobs.Reform EntitlementsIntroduce work requirements for means-tested entitlement programs, including the federal food stamps program.Cut means-tested entitlement programs by 10% across the board, freeze them for four years, and block grant them to States.Reform and strengthen Medicare and Social Security so they are fiscally sustainable for seniors and future generations.Stop the Surge of Both Illegal and Legal ImmigrationSeal the Mexican border with an American-made wall.Rescind the Obama-Biden measure that expand and encourage illegal immigration.Reduce legal immigration by 25% to ensure that Americans get the first shot at new jobs and higher wages.Veto any legislation aimed at creating amnesty.'"

Rick Santorum,R,p,"November 15, 2015",b'Press Release - Santorum Responds to Syrian Refugee Crisis',"b'Calls on Congress to authorize funding to support our allies\' settlements in the Middle East and stop the flow of refugees from the region.Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum (R-PA) today called on Congress to pass legislation to halt any and all efforts to relocate Syrian refugees to the United States and to authorize funding to support our Middle East allies establish and operate refugee settlements in the region.Rick Santorum said: ""The atrocities we see in the Middle East are heartbreaking, but under no circumstances should the United States take in any of those displaced in Syria for two very important reasons.""""First, we have no idea who these people are, what their backgrounds are, and what caused their specific displacement. There is no tracking mechanism in place that will discern between a radical Islamist and persecuted refugee. As we learned this week, radical Islam is on the move and their motives are to destroy the western world. We cannot afford to make a mistake in relocating even one of these jihadists to our soil.""""Second, and just as important, by taking in persecuted Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims, we are complicit in helping ISIS accomplish their goal of establishing an Islamic caliphate. Without Christians, Jews, or moderate Muslims in the region, radical Islam will be allowed to run rampant. Instead, we must support those persecuted by assisting our friends in the region who have established settlements for refugees.""""My heart goes out to those who are being displaced. America is the beacon of freedom to the world, but that means we must be forward thinking and decisive in defeating radical Islam. Supporting our allies in the region with this humanitarian crisis is one important component of this effort. Keeping the refugees in the region so they can more easily return to their homes is essential to ensuring the Islamic caliphate\'s roots are not firmly planted.""Senator Santorum served for 8 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, authoring our current sanctions regimes against both Syria and Iran. After leaving the Senate, Rick Santorum led a program at the Ethics and Public Policy Center focused on the rise of radical Islam - lecturing internationally on the threat posed by the rise of radical Islam.'"
Rick Santorum,R,p,"November 19, 2015",b'Press Release - Op-Ed: Halt Syrian Refugees in the U.S.',"b""There are no other words I can think of to better describe what Barack Obama is trying to accomplish by bringing Syrian refugees to our shores. This is a horrible policy decision not just for American security, but also for the stability of the entire Middle East.The first reason why importing Syrian refugees is dangerous is obvious. As the Obama FBI Director admitted, we have holes in our intelligence network that make it nearly impossible to know for certain who these refugees are, what their backgrounds are, and what their intentions will be once they are here. If we cannot track who these refugees are, how can we be sure they are not radical Islamists? As we saw in Paris, it just takes one jihadist intent on destruction to upend the world.Making matters worse, approximately 70% of Syrian refugees are fighting-age males - not your typical refugee population. Does this sound strange, because it should. The Syrian refugee population is ripe for terrorist activity and we would simply be importing terror to our shores.The second reason why we should not be allowing Syrian refugees to enter our nation may even be more important, but has been lost on far too many on both sides of this debate.I have heard some of my Republican presidential rivals like Senator Cruz and Governor Bush discuss allowing Christians to come and simply exclude potentially radicalized Muslims.Not only is that impracticable, but it shows a fundamental misunderstanding about who our enemy is and what they are trying to accomplish. By ridding the region of Christians and Jews that have lived in these areas for 2000 years, we make it harder to stabilize the Middle East once ISIS is defeated. ISIS also wants to remove dissenters, including moderate Muslims - so they can run rampant across the Middle East and beyond. By bringing refugees to America, we are simply accommodating them.Instead, we must support our allies in the Middle East, the Turks, Jordanians and the Saudis in integrating refugees into neighboring counties and establishing and populating humanitarian settlement camps so that once the threat of ISIS has been degraded and destroyed, those refugees can easily return to their homes in the region. That is why I called on Congress to pass legislation authorizing funding to support our allies to help neutralize this threat to American security and regional stability.I have been consistent and I have been clear on this issue from the start. Months ago I said it was reckless to allow these refugees to come to America. Sadly, some Republicans like Ted Cruz and John Kasich argued that America has a long history of supporting the oppressed and providing refuge, and that policy should continue in this instance.Yes, America is a beacon of light and refuge for the oppressed, but we must have the foresight to understand the geopolitical context and ideological catalysts of the threats we face. We must understand that ISIS derives its power from the formation of a caliphate that only survives as long as it holds territory. Territory to a caliphate is like oxygen to the flame, without territory the caliphate fades.That is why I said President Obama's policies were not just dangerous and reckless, they are uneducated. Our next President must understand the threats we face, identify our enemies for who they are, and formulate policies that can best serve the long-term security interests of the American people. This President is a failure in accomplishing any of those three objectives.Does my heart go out to those Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims fleeing for their lives? Absolutely. It is hard not to be wrenched by the scenes we see on the nightly news. But to open our nation to refugees we cannot appropriately screen while being complicit in our enemy's wishes is disqualifying for anyone who seeks to be Leader of the Free World.Commander-in-Chief is not an entry-level position and the Oval Office is no place for on the job training. I am as upset as anyone about the impotence of Republican leadership in Washington and the ignorance of the liberal Left, but we need a President who understands the threats we face and what it will take to secure America for years to come.I was speaking out about the rise of radical Islam 10 years ago at a time America was weary with war. I demanded President Bush address this as a War with Radical Islam because we are not at war with terror - terror is a tactic no different than the Blitzkreig of World War II or trench warfare of World War I. I authored the law that imposed nuclear sanctions on Iran - sanctions Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Joe Biden all voted against, as well as a law imposing sanctions on Syria.We live in a moment that demands American leadership - leadership that is reasoned, leadership that is bold, leadership that is forward-thinking. That is the leadership I will provide in the Oval Office on day-one."""
