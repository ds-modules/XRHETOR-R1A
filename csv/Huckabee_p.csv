""October has been a great month for the campaign. We\'re heading into November with tremendous momentum, having outperformed in every category,"" said Huckabee, who had media interviews this week on every news network. His major appearances included ABC\'s ""Good Morning America,"" Fox\' ""The O\'Reilly Factor,"" MSNBC\'s ""All Politics Day,"" CNN\'s ""Weekend Edition,"" PBS\' ""The Charlie Rose Show""  and others. (All told, the governor had 15 broadcast interviews this week.) On Tuesday, October 30, the campaign surpassed the ""One Million Dollar Mark"" in terms of October on-line contributions  shoring up growing support with thousands of new supporters. The financial boost came as new polls released show the former Arkansas governor\'s national numbers climbing into  and staying  in the double-digits. The campaign\'s online monthly fundraising goal was also hit on Wednesday, October 31 -- surpassing the amount by $1.00 that the campaign had taken in through all direct mail, on-line efforts, and fundraising events for the Third Quarter combined. Huckabee said his high profile media appearances and favorable performance in four presidential debates in the past six weeks (Values Voter, PBS, MSNBC and FOX), coupled with movie star Chuck Norris\' endorsement, and his rise to third place in national polls, have contributed to the campaign\'s ""best-ever fundraising performance."" ""I\'m grateful to the people who attended the Values Voter Summit and gave me a 5:1 advantage over my nearest rival  as well as to Chuck Norris, and people all across America , like Eric Deussing, who support my message and candidacy for President,"" he said. Deussing\'s contribution on Tuesday evening put Huckabee over the one million dollar mark in terms of on-line contributions for the month.'"

""Senator Thompson\'s comments on \'Meet the Press\' were disappointing and disheartening for those who were expecting him to be a solid voice for conservatives. The marriage and life amendments are critical issues for those of us who have been on the front lines of these cultural battles. Sen. Thompson\'s philosophy seems to be more \'cut and run\' when it comes to these issues, rather than stand and lead. ""I\'ve always supported the passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life. As President, I will fight for passage of a human life amendment. My position on the sanctity of life has always been clear and consistent. No candidate has a stronger record on the sanctity of life than I do. As Governor of Arkansas, I successfully led efforts to promote a human life amendment and marriage amendment in my state. For me, it isn\'t just talk; it\'s a conservative record of leadership and conviction.""'"

Mitt Romney for third place, with 10 percent of the vote. The former Arkansas governor\'s polling numbers have doubled since a similar survey was taken on October 12-14. He is the only candidate experiencing a significant upward trend.""This poll confirms what we\'re feeling on the ground: that my message is really connecting with voters. We\'re on a surge, moving up five points in the past two weeks, while others have reached their peak,"" said Huckabee. ""I keep telling my staff and supporters  we need to keep doing what we\'re doing. With only two months to go before the Iowa caucus, we need to keep pressing forward,"" said Huckabee. The telephone survey of 1,024 registered Republican voters was conducted Nov. 2- 4, 2007 by the Opinion Research Corporation. There was a plus or minus margin of error of 1-3 percentage points.'"

""Republicans in Arkansas have a long track record of taking on difficult tasks, overcoming tremendous challenges and winning battles that no one thought we could win,"" Huckabee said. ""Despite being in a mostly Democrat state, we had great success in cutting taxes, passing pro-life legislation, fighting for the family, improving education and highways and making government more efficient."" ""I have known Governor Huckabee for many years, and at one time, I served as his Chief Legal Counsel,"" former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins said. ""He is a true leader, who makes firm, informed decisions based on simple standards of right and wrong and what is best for the citizens who elected him. He owns his decisions and doesn\'t need to take a poll before deciding to do what\'s right. He has been so successful with his straightforward approach that it makes you wonder why more of these people don\'t try it."" ""The two main reasons I support Gov. Huckabee for President are the fact that he has always been pro-life  and he has more than 10 years of executive experience,"" former Cong. Jay Dickey said. ""Gov. Huckabee far outdistances himself from the other candidates by his outstanding moral values and conservative convictions."" ""For the past 14 years, I have watched Mike Huckabee lead our state,"" former U.S. Rep. Asa Hutchinson said.

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"November 6, 2007",b'Press Release - Huckabee campaign sets the record straight with Paul Weyrich',"b'Little Rock, AR  Former AR Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee said he was disappointed that one of his political mentors endorsed another Republican candidate based on information that was factually incorrect. ""I love Paul Weyrich and he has been a political mentor to me. It hurts that he has accepted some misinformation as fact, but I will forever respect and appreciate him. I will continue to support Paul even if he doesn\'t support me, "" Huckabee said. ""One thing is for sure---when I was a 23 year old communications director for a Christian organization that helped launch Christian involvement in public affairs, Paul Weyrich was one of my heroes and I\'ll bet in the late 70\'s and 80\'s Mitt Romney wasn\'t listening to cassette tapes of Paul Weyrich speeches like I was. "" Weyrich wrote of Huckabee ""I like him and he certainly is somebody who can give a stemwinder but I have learned so many things about his waffling positions."" One of the virtues of the Huckabee campaign is that the issues he supports today are the same issues he supported while serving as lieutenant governor and governor of Arkansas. Huckabee participated in the annual Right-to-Life March down Capitol Avenue in Little Rock Huckabee successfully led efforts to promote a human life amendment and marriage amendment in Arkansas and, as President, would lead the charge for similar amendments at the federal level. ""My position on the sanctity of life has always been clear and consistent. It is the same with my views on marriage. The institution of marriage is between a man and a woman. I have never supported gay marriage or civil unions,"" Huckabee said. Weyrich took the word of two people outside the mainstream of Republican politics who falsely claimed Arkansas\' Republican Party is in shambles. Dennis Milligan, chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, strongly disagrees with the idea that the party is in shambles. ""The Republican Party of Arkansas is not in shambles. While the party has never held the majority of elected offices, the Republican Party reached a high-water mark while Mike Huckabee was governor. ""In 2006, when Governor Huckabee left office because of term limits and Lt. Governor Win Paul Rockefeller died, Democrats where able to win the top two state constitutional offices. Arkansas wasn\'t the only state where Democrats won a lot of state and federal elections that year. It was a national trend and blaming Mike Huckabee is just wrong. ""In 2008, Republicans in Arkansas will field strong candidates for the state Legislature, U.S. Senate, Congress, and a favorite son for the White House. That\'s not a party in shambles,"" Milligan said. Weyrich was also misinformed on Huckabee\'s stand on statehood for the District of Columbia. Huckabee has never supported statehood for the district, but does support citizens living in the District having a representative in the House of Representatives, but not the Senate. ""I have great respect for Paul Weyrich and I want him to know the truth,"" Huckabee said.'"

Pat Robertson\'s endorsement of former Mayor Giuliani proves once again that we are blessed to live in the greatest country in the world. People have the right to support the candidate of their choice, even when that candidate has sharp differences on the most fundamental issue of human life and the sanctity of the unborn. ""Regarding Senator Brownback\'s endorsement of Senator McCain, I respect his decision and believe wholeheartedly that Senator McCain is a great patriot and public servant. However, there are key differences between Senator McCain\'s record and my results-driven record of leadership as a twice-elected Republican Governor of the state of Arkansas. Sen. McCain and I share a positive vision for America\'s future but there are key differences. I urge Senator Brownback\'s supporters to take a close look at my record. I welcome and value their support.""'"

Mike Huckabee\'s presidential campaign:""I can\'t fathom the idea of the National Right to Life organization endorsing anyone in the field besides Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mike Huckabee has worked in the vineyards and trenches on behalf of the pro-life movement. His pro-life record is outstanding and it is more consistent than any other candidate for president. He is also arguably the most electable candidate in the field. ""If, in fact, they endorse Fred Thompson over Mike Huckabee, I\'m disappointed because Fred Thompson doesn\'t support a constitutional amendment protecting human life. It just goes to show that, at first blush, even the best of organizations may have yielded to Washington politics and made a mistake. In my opinion, this would be one of them.""I look forward to Mike Huckabee receiving the support of the grassroots pro-life movement around the country.""'"
Mike Huckabee,R,p,"November 13, 2007",b'Press Release - Chip Saltsman Comments On National Right To Life Endorsement',"b'LITTLE ROCK, AR  Huckabee for President Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman issued the following comment today regarding the National Right to Life Committee\'s endorsement of Senator Fred Thompson:""Mike Huckabee has been an ardent champion of the pro-life movement. He is the only candidate who has actually delivered on pro-life issues by pushing and signing and working to get them passed, including a life amendment to Arkansas\' constitution. In light of the Governor\'s passionate and lifelong dedication to promoting life issues, and Senator Thompson\'s recent statements that he does not support a constitutional amendment on life or the Republican Party\'s platform, this was a disappointing decision.""There are Washington insiders who say this decision was made because of politics. I want to address this point. With no money being spent on paid campaign advertising & little name ID to begin with, the Huckabee campaign has outworked the competition and has spent fewer resources more wisely, with a message that is resonating with the people. We are one of only two campaigns whose polling numbers were higher at the end of the month than they were at the beginning of the month of October, up 7 points to be exact, having more than doubled our starting number.""In fact, Rasmussen has shown Governor Huckabee ahead of, or tied with, Governor Romney and Senator McCain on a regular basis. Regarding the general election, Rasmussen shows Governor Huckabee in a statistical tie in a match-up with Senator Hillary Clinton, with Clinton ahead by 3 points (46% to 43%). He is the only one in the field  of either party  who has run against the Clinton political machine and he has won, not once but four times. The same poll shows Mayor Giuliani and Senator Thompson at 42% against Clinton.

The video is from an anonymous source and contains excerpts taken out of context from a speech when then-Governor Mike Huckabee was opening a special legislative session in 2003.""The governor called a special session. Several proposals had been made by legislators for raising the revenue to address a budget shortfall for necessary services. In the end, a state income tax surcharge was passed with the provision that it would be a temporary tax. Most temporary taxes become permanent. The governor made sure the legislature kept its promise to keep the tax temporary.""More than 90% of the state budget pays for prisons, education, and Medicaid. None of those would have been funded without that budget. The governor acted responsibly to protect Arkansans who are the most vulnerable but the least connected politically.""The fact is that Mike Huckabee cut taxes 94 times  including the first broad-based tax cut in the history of the state of Arkansas. While governor, he balanced the budget and returned almost $400 million to Arkansas taxpayers, and left office with almost a $1 billion surplus. The Huckabee Surplus\' enabled his successor to follow Huckabee\'s lead to begin the elimination of the state sales tax on food.""Despite what some Washington insiders who don\'t understand the fundamentals of governing or leadership will have you believe, when you discern the facts, the reality is that Mike Huckabee is a true fiscal conservative.""'"

Fred has been confused about being pro-life, but Governor Huckabee never has been. Governor Huckabee helped successfully lead the passage of human life amendment in his state and as governor signed numerous pro-life bills. Fred was taking money as a Washington lobbyist to be a mouthpiece for a pro-abortion group when Governor Huckabee was leading the March for Life. Governor Huckabee always has supported a Human Life Amendment, but also knows that the repeal of Roe v. Wade is better than the current laws. ""The Thompson campaign is also distorting Governor Huckabee\'s views on illegal immigration by failing to recognize that sealing the border is his top priority. Regarding legislation to stop illegals from getting drivers\' licenses, Act 2210 of 2005 was signed into law by Governor Huckabee. The legislation made it illegal for a driver\'s license to be issued to anyone who could not prove legal residency in Arkansas. ""It\'s not surprising that Fred has hired an attack dog to churn out the very kind of \'hit and run\' politics that Americans are sick of. Governor Huckabee is rising to Fred\'s fall precisely because he is telling America what he would do to solve America\'s problems while Fred is left to trying to resort to political dumpster diving.""'"

""Our campaign has nothing to do with the push polling and I wish they would stop. We don\'t want this kind of campaigning because it violates the spirit of our campaign. I don\'t want to become President because I disabled the other candidates, I want to become President because I am the best candidate,"" said Huckabee during a press interview in Iowa this morning. National Campaign Manager Chip Saltsman agreed: ""Anyone who has the slightest understanding of the race in Iowa and the mindset of Iowans would know this sort of activity is extremely counterproductive. It takes the campaign off message at a time when Governor Huckabee is resonating with voters as never before. It loses votes rather than gains them. It\'s an underhanded way of doing business that is not welcomed by the campaign and it flies in the face of what Governor Huckabee stands for: integrity and clean politics.

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who now leads the polls in Iowa and has vaulted to second place in national polls, also announced the support of Luana Stoltenberg, a Davenport pro-life activist. Hurley, the president of the Iowa Family Policy Center, is a former state legislator who has devoted his career to strengthening Iowa\'s families by championing traditional values. ""I\'m humbled and honored to support such a fine man for such a vital office at this vital time,"" said Hurley, who noted the endorsement was a personal one and not on behalf of the IFPC. Stoltenberg has been involved with Crisis Pregnancy Center in the Quad Cities. She also has been a board member and spokesperson for the Life and Family Coalition. A former supporter of Sen. Sam Brownback\'s presidential effort, Stoltenberg is active in Operation Outcry: Silent No More. Huckabee said he welcomed the support as candidates continue to battle for support as the Iowa caucuses are just 30 days away. The LaHayes are prominent national leaders who have provided a strong moral compass for America. ""During the 25 years I have known Mike Huckabee, he has proven himself to be a Christian conservative who stands without apology for the pro-life, pro-marriage platform that is so important in this time of moral collapse,"" Tim LaHaye said. Beverly LaHaye said, ""I support Mike Huckabee because he is genuinely pro-life  true to Biblical morality  a man of absolute faith in God and courageous enough to try to do something to bring America back to its foundation.""

LaHaye has written more than 50 non-fiction books on a wide range of subjects such as family life, Bible prophecy, the will of God, Jesus Christ, and secular humanism. His books have been translated into 32 languages, with more than 13 million in print. Beverly LaHaye is chairman of the board and founder of Concerned Women for America. The LaHayes have been married for over 55 years and live in southern California. They have four grown children, nine grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the pastors coalition, Pastor Brad Sherman of the Solid Rock Christian Church, Coralville, said he endorsed Huckabee because he was ""first struck by, not only his position on the issues, but his skill at communicating his position in way that made sense."" Sherman added, ""Then I noted that he is governed by principle, not by the direction of the political breeze. He holds the same positions today that he did yesterday.

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 7, 2007",b'Press Release - Mike Huckabee Unveils New Nine-Point Immigration Enforcement and Border Security Plan',"b'Little Rock, AR  Former Arkansas Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee is releasing ""The Secure America Plan: A Nine-Point Strategy for Immigration Enforcement and Border Security,"" it was announced today.Huckabee said he believes in adopting the best policy ideas to provide a ""tough, equitable and comprehensive approach"" to dealing with the current immigration crisis. The text of the plan is provided below: The Secure America Plan: A Nine-Point Strategy for Immigration Enforcement and Border SecurityOverview: Implement a broad-based strategy that commits the resources of the federal government to the enforcement of our immigration laws and results in the attrition of the illegal immigrant population.Build the Fence Ensure that an interlocking surveillance camera system is installed along the border by July 1, 2010. Ensure that the border fence construction is completed by July 1, 2010.Increase Border PatrolIncrease the number of border patrol agents.Fully support all law enforcement personnel tasked with enforcing immigration law.Prevent AmnestyPolicies that promote or tolerate amnesty will be rejected. Propose to provide all illegal immigrants a 120-day window to register with the Citizenship and Immigration Services and leave the country. Those who register and return to their home country will face no penalty if they later apply to immigrate or visit; those who do not return home will be, when caught, barred from future reentry for a period of 10 years.Enforce the Law on Employers Employment is the chief draw for most illegal immigrants and denying them jobs is the centerpiece of an attrition strategy. Impose steep fines and penalties on employers that violate the law. Institute a universal, mandatory citizenship verification system as part of the normal hiring process.Prevent the IRS and the Social Security Administration from accepting fraudulent Social Security numbers or numbers that don\'t match the employees\' names.* 5. Establish an Economic BorderMove toward passage of the FairTax. The FairTax provides an extra layer of security by creating an economic disincentive to immigrate to the U.S. illegally.6. Empower Local AuthoritiesPromote better cooperation on enforcement by supporting legislative measures such as the CLEAR Act, which aims to systematize the relationship between local law and federal immigration officials. Encourage immigration-law training for police. Local authorities must be provided the tools, training, and funding they need so local police can turn illegal immigrants over to the federal authorities.7. Ensure Document SecurityEnd exemptions for Mexicans and Canadians to the US-VISIT program, which tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors. Since these countries account for the vast majority of foreigners coming here (85 percent), such a policy clearly violates Congress\' intent in mandating this check-in/check-out system.Reject Mexico\'s ""matricula consular"" card, which functions as an illegal-immigrant identification card.8. Discourage Dual CitizenshipInform foreign governments when their former citizens become naturalized U.S. citizens. Impose civil and/or criminal penalties on American citizens who illegitimately use their dual status (e.g., using a foreign passport, voting in elections in both a foreign country and the U.S.). 9. Modernize the Process of Legal ImmigrationEliminate the visa lottery system and the admission category for adult brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. Increase visas for highly-skilled and highly-educated applicants.Expedite processing for those who serve honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces. Improve our immigration process so that those patiently and responsibly seeking to come here legally will not have to wait decades to share in the American dream. Governor Huckabee has always been grateful to live in a country that people are trying to break into, rather than break out of.*This policy will be drafted to comply with the final federal court decisions on this issue.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 8, 2007","b'Press Release - Presidential Candidate, Governor Mike Huckabee Statement on AIDS Funding'","b""Little Rock, AR - In the late 80's and early 90's we were still learning about the virus that causes AIDS. My concern, as a Senate candidate at the time, was to deal with the virus using the same public health protocols that medical science and public health professionals would use with any infectious disease. Before a disease can be cured and contained we need to know exactly how and with near certainty what level of contact transmits the disease. There was still too much confusion about HIV transmission in those early years. Recall that in 1991, Kimberly Bergalis testified in front of Congress after contracting HIV from her dentist, and that summer a study was published showing that HIV was transmitted through breastmilk more easily than had been thought. But the federal government provided some guidelines: Also in 1991 the Centers for Disease Control recommended restrictions on the practice of HIV-positive health care workers. At the time, there was widespread concern over modes of transmission and the possibility of epidemic. In the absence of conclusive data, my focus was on efforts to limit the exposure of the virus, following traditional medical practices developed from our public health experience and medical science in dealing with tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. We now know that the virus that causes AIDS is spread differently, with a lower level of contact than with TB. But looking back almost 20 years, my concern was the uncertain risk to the general population  if we got it wrong, many people would die needlessly. My concern was safety first, political correctness last. My administration will be the first to have an overarching strategy for dealing with HIV and AIDS here in the United States, with a partnership between the public and private sectors that will provide necessary financing and a realistic path toward our goals. We must prevent new infections and provide more accessible care. We must do everything possible to transform the promise of a vaccine and a cure into reality. Furthermore, I am proud that the United States has led the global battle against HIV/ AIDS. We have both a strategic interest as the world's only superpower and a moral obligation as the world's richest country to continue to do so until this scourge is a memory. I supported the current Administration's proposal to double our initial commitment from $15 billion to $30 billion over the next five years for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has already done an extraordinary amount of good, by providing drugs for over a million people and care for four-and-a-half million people, but it expires in 2008 and must be reauthorized. I support an increase in our commitment to the Global Fund. Through PEPFAR and the Global Fund, we can do our fair share to meet the Millennium Development Goals we affirmed in 2000, which include universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care."""

The announcement follows on the heels of the endorsement by another prominent Florida legislator, state Majority Leader Daniel Webster, who voiced his support for the governor on November 28. Speaker Rubio is Florida\'s first Cuban-American state House Speaker. ""I\'m honored to have the support from Speaker Rubio because we share the same conservative values,"" Huckabee said. ""Everyone running for president wanted his endorsement. I\'m glad he chose to join our efforts to seek the Republican nomination. Rubio began serving Florida\'s 111th House District in 2000 and has served as a City Commissioner from West Miami. He is a conservative Republican who shares Huckabee\'s views on pro-life and strong families. ""For those of us who consider ourselves to be Reagan conservatives, Mike Huckabee is our best chance to win the nomination,"" Speaker Rubio said. ""People are looking for genuineness and sincerity in politics. He has those qualities as well as the positive leadership skills needed to run our country."" Huckabee also received an endorsement from State Rep. David Rivera who serves Florida\'s 112th district, which includes Miami and parts of Naples and Fort Lauderdale. Rivera is chairman of the state House Rules Committee and is former director of the Hispanic Outreach for the Republican Party of Florida. ""Representative Rivera is a great leader and role model for Cuban-American citizens in Florida,"" Huckabee said. ""I\'m proud to have the backing from such a respected member of the Florida House."" ""Governor Huckabee understands the importance of freedom and democracy for all people throughout our hemisphere and our world,"" Rivera said. ""He is deserving of the support of Cuban- Americans like myself because he has articulated the most pro-active and bold policy geared toward hastening the demise of the Castro regime and promoting the cause of freedom and democracy in Cuba."" Senator Daniel Webster, a Republican member of the Florida state Senate since 1999 who has served as Majority Leader since 2006, has also endorsed Huckabee. Webster, who previously served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1981 to 1998, officially endorsed Huckabee earlier this year.

""My first priority is to bring our country together again. We are a polarized country, which has led to having a paralyzed government,"" said Huckabee. ""We are fighting each other  but who is fighting for this country?"" ""We need to stop fighting among ourselves  and put the interests of the people above our own. We need to be the united people of the United States. The job of the President is to somehow remind us that we are a great, resilient nation that has to work together to solve all of these problems,"" he said. On topics ranging from education reform to health care and energy and the environment, Huckabee outlined a results-driven agenda that reflects his optimistic vision for America. Huckabee, who served as governor of Arkansas for 10  years, said he had ""the most experience of anyone on the stage and an impressive record"" on education. ""We raised standards. We measured and held people accountable for results."" While the primary responsibility for education is with the states, Huckabee said the federal government can play a ""pivotal role by making sure that the best practices of what is working in the states gets to those states that are struggling. ""Any time you give governors the opportunity to know what works, they\'ll use it because it creates jobs and economic development,"" he said. Huckabee also asserted that a primary job of the President, besides being Commander-in- Chief, is to be ""Communicator-in-Chief."" As President, Huckabee said he would use the bully pulpit to reform education. ""For a President to say it\'s none of my business is recklessly irresponsible,"" he said. Noting that 6,000 students drop out of school every day and one-third of high school students do not graduate, he said ""it is unacceptable that so many kids leave our schools every single day."" Calling himself a passionate advocate of including music and the arts instruction as part of all students\' curriculum to increase creativity, he said: ""We need to unleash what I call the weapons of mass instruction\' During the debate, Huckabee affirmed that America\'s mounting national debt is indeed a national security issue. ""A country is not free if it can\'t produce three things for itself  its own food, its own fuel, and its own fighting apparatus. If we can\'t do those three things, our national security is very much at risk,"" said Huckabee. Huckabee also stated that America\'s health care system is ""upside down."" When 80 percent of the two trillion dollars we spend on health care goes to chronic diseases, ""if we don\'t focus on prevention, we\'ll never catch up,"" Huckabee said. Regarding federal tax policy, Huckabee asserted that over 80 percent of the Americans believe the tax code is unfair. ""That\'s why we need the Fair Tax,"" he said. When asked, Huckabee said he supported market-based efforts to combat climate change. Whether humans are responsible for the bulk of climate change or not, he said the ""reason that this issue should be important is that we don\'t own this earth, we are stewards. We\'ve done no harm if we take better care of this planet so it is in better shape for future generations when we give it back.""'"

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 18, 2007","b'Press Release - Mike Huckabee Charges Speaker Pelosi with Sending ""Lump of Coal to Troops in Iraq""'","b'LITTLE ROCK, AR  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her Democrat leadership failed to support American troops fighting the Global War on Terrorism yesterday by passing a $515 billion omnibus spending bill that included funding for all Cabinet agencies, except the Department of Defense, and specifically did not include funding for the Iraq war. The bill, passed in a hurry so Congress can go home for Christmas, allows spending to support our troops in Afghanistan, but not in Iraq. ""Last night, Speaker Pelosi and her fellow Democrats passed a spending bill that concealed a lump of coal for our troops serving overseas in Iraq,"" former Arkansas Governor and Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said. ""Democrats are signaling that they are unhappy with the fact that our surge in Iraq is working. Violence is down. Order is being restored. And terrorists are learning they are not welcomed by the people of Iraq."" The Senate is expected to add funding for the troops in Iraq in debate today. ""But why is the House leadership playing politics with funding for the war?"" asked Huckabee. Additionally, the spending bill, written by Democrats and passed 253-154 with mostly Democrat votes, undermines the 2006 Secure Fence Act. That act specifically required a two-tier barrier, like the one that has worked in California; the new version downgrades the provision to require only a single-tier barrier. The Pelosi spending bill also eliminated the list of locations where the fence would be built. ""This serious reduction in security along our southern border was buried in a massive, 3,500-page bill. Nancy Pelosi hoped it would go unnoticed by the American people. Republican are serious about making our borders secure,"" Huckabee said.

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 19, 2007",b'Press Release - Huckabee Campaign Refutes New Romney Ad',"b'Little Rock, AR - The Huckabee for President Campaign today issued the following ""Truth Squad"" response to a new TV ad by the Romney campaign: Response to Romney December 17 Attack Ad TRUTH: Governor Huckabee was tougher on methamphetamine manufacturers than Governor Romney In a new attack ad released today, Governor Romney attempts to contrast his position on drugs with that of Governor Huckabee. The ad says that Romney got ""Tough on Drugs Like Meth,"" while Governor Huckabee ""Reduced Penalties for Manufacturing Meth."" What Romney fails to mention is that -- even with the reductions -- Governor Huckabee was tougher on methamphetamine manufacturers than Governor Romney was.  The ""reduced penalty"" in Arkansas was a requirement that meth manufacturers serve 50 percent of their sentence rather than 70 percent before being eligible for parole. In Arkansas, the average meth dealer spends an average of 10 years in prison.  In contrast, the source quoted in the Romney ad that claimed Romney ""got tough"" on drugs notes, ""The punishment would be either 2 1/2 years in jail or five years in prison.""Let\'s compare: Under Huckabee, 10 years; Under Romney, 5 years The ad also states that Romney ""never pardoned a single criminal."" But this begs the question: how many clemency cases did he actually review while he was governor of Massachusetts? Or did he simply avoid his responsibility as chief executive of the state to review clemency cases and give petitioners a fair hearing? The ad also points out that Governor Huckabee granted more clemencies than the ""previous three governorscombined."" It doesn\'t mention that two of the previous three governors were Bill Clinton and convicted felon Jim Guy Tucker. Governor Huckabee\'s clemency rate, however, was in line with other governors who have served the state.Romney also fails to acknowledge that in Arkansas, every person who is convicted of a crime and every person in prison is eligible for clemency. Because of this, the number of clemency applications is extraordinarily high. Governor Huckabee had 8,698 applications during his 10  years in office. Some Governors are content to simply deny the vast majority of clemency applications without bothering to consider their merit. Governor Huckabee, however, believed that respect for the legal process required that he give them the consideration for which they were entitled. During his tenure, Governor Huckabee denied over 80 percent of the applications.Before granting clemency, the Governor issues a notice of intent and opens a 30-day public comment period in which people can protest the decision. Very rarely does the public oppose a clemency because almost all are granted for minor offenses, involve reductions in fines, or reduced prison sentences that were longer than the average for a particular crime. During the 10  years Mike Huckabee was governor the number of government agencies and businesses that conducted background checks increased at an incredible rate. The terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, have resulted in increased concerns regarding security. Potential job candidates and long-time employees considered for promotion are under increased scrutiny.Before the mainstream use of background checks, most people could have some youthful arrest, change their lives and become good, tax-paying citizens without that earlier arrest coming back to haunt them.Governor Huckabee found during his time in office that each year the number of people needing clemency to clear their record increased. Denying their request prevented them from continuing to earn a good living and pay taxes. The majority of the clemency requests he granted were for this reason.Nevertheless, on behalf of the Mike Huckabee for President campaign, we want to wish Governor Romney, his family and his staff, a very merry Christmas. Additional Notes: What is Clemency? Clemency is the process through which the Governor considers requests for granting reprieves, commutations of sentence, and pardons after conviction. What is a Pardon? A pardon is the exemption of a convicted person from the penalties of an offense or crime. A pardon can be requested by someone who is no longer incarcerated. Who May Apply for Clemency? Any person serving a term of any number of years, life, life without parole, or a sentence of death may apply for executive clemency. A person who is not presently incarcerated may also apply. What are the Steps in the Clemency Application Process? 1. Any person making a request for clemency must first have their application processed by the Board of Parole in what is called a screening. This will determine if there is any merit to the application. A victim can only make written recommendations to the Board of Parole during this step of the process. 2. If the application is found to have merit, it will most likely be scheduled for a hearing before the Board of Parole. A victim will be notified (if they have requested these notifications) when a hearing is scheduled and can contact the Board of Parole about providing written or oral recommendations. Once the hearing is complete the Board will vote on a recommendation to send to the Governor for final action. 3. The Governor will review the application, the recommendation of the Board of Parole, and all other pertinent materials before making his decision. If the Governor intends to grant the application for clemency, he will announce his intent and allow a 30 day period for public comment. If the Governor decides to deny the application it will be announced and no further action will be taken. http://www.acic.org/justice/Clemency%20Process.htm'"

During the interview, Huckabee asserted his support for the surge saying: ""I think we\'ve got to give him a chance to let it work. Whether it\'s the right decision, I honestly don\'t know because I don\'t have the access to the kind of military and intelligence information that he does. But he\'s the commander-in-chief, and we\'ve got to give him an opportunity."" January 28, 2007/ NBC\'s ""Meet the Press"" Interview When asked about the President\'s troop surge tactic on NBC\'s ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert, Governor Huckabee stated: ""I think that\'s a dangerous position to take, to oppose a sitting commander-in-chief while we\'ve got people being shot at on the ground. I think its one thing to have a debate and a discussion about this strategy, but to openly oppose, in essence, the strategy, I think that can be a very risky thing for our troops.""

March 27, 2007/ Real Clear Politics Interview Although Governor Huckabee did express some concern over the use of an over-extended National Guard and Reservist Corps, in an interview with Real Clear Politics in March of 2007, Huckabee stated: ""I support the President\'s right as Commander-in-Chief to make the decisions that he feels like will work and General Petraeus is the person in whom he has placed his trust. I have to respect that he\'s looking at information that I don\'t have and he\'s based this decision on those intelligence reports and the reports that he\'s getting from his generals in the field.""

I look forward to their continued testimony tomorrow. I have deep respect and admiration for both of these outstanding men, who have staked their lives and reputations on a successful outcome in what, I believe, is the defining battle, not only of our time, but for Western civilization itself. From their testimony, it is clear that the surge is working; their military objectives are being met; and that a quick or precipitous withdrawal will have dire consequences, not only in terms of massive human suffering in Iraq  but for the region. Undoubtedly, Iran would be a winner in this scenario  rendering the whole world vulnerable. This scenario is unacceptable. September 28, 2007/ Center for Strategic and International Studies Speech In a speech given to The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington , D.C., in September, Governor Huckabee stated that he had supported and continued to support the surge. ""Now is not the moment to lose heart or lose faith, too much has been sacrificed and too much is at stake. By not projecting beyond pre-surge levels, we send a strong signal to the Iraqis that we will be there for them and to our enemies that they can\'t just wait us out."" On the other hand: Mitt Romney supported a timed withdrawal, and now he says he did not. During the Jan. 5, 2008, presidential debate, Mitt Romney claimed he never supported a timed withdrawal in Iraq . Governor Huckabee challenged this claim and Romney responded, ""I do not support and have never supported a timed withdrawal."" However, in an April 2007 interview with ABC News\' ""Good Morning America,"" Romney voiced support for ""a private timetable and benchmarks for U.S. troops to get out of Iraq ."" Governor Huckabee restated his charge that Romney can\'t have it both ways saying that ""time tables, whether public or private, is a withdrawal. This was the Democrat\'s position in Congress, which I am entirely against."" Romney\'s claim that he never supported a timed withdrawal, when in fact he did, begs the Governor\'s question last night: ""Which position is it, Mitt?"" Furthermore, after attacking Governor Huckabee for weeks on his criticism of some elements of the Bush administration\'s approach to foreign policy -- and demanding that Huckabee apologize to President Bush  yesterday, Mitt Romney changed his tune at a New Hampshire house party. He publicly stated that U.S. diplomacy has been dominated by an ""our way or the highway approach."" This is very similar to what Governor Huckabee has been arguing.

But South Carolina and the rest of the nation need some bigger changes if we are to reverse the trends of the last few years,"" Governor Huckabee said today while campaigning through South Carolina in advance of tomorrow\'s Republican presidential primary. Last Monday, Governor Huckabee released his own five-point ""Fair Deal"" stimulus package aimed at creating jobs: 1) More income, better jobs, more secure home ownership for middle-class families, 2) work with the Federal Reserve for a pro-growth, low-inflation economy, 3) increase defense spending to 6 percent of Gross Domestic Product in response to real threats to America\'s security, 4) invest in energy independence and 5) move toward a Fair Tax that eliminates the current distorted tax code. The South Carolina unemployment rate jumped to 6.6 percent in December, up from 5.9 percent the previous month, according to the state Employment Security Commission. It was the largest one-month increase since at least 1990, state officials said. One major problem, Huckabee said, is the current unfair tax code. ""If we replace the IRS with the Fair Tax, we lift the burden off of the small- and medium-sized businesses who create most of the jobs.

Difficult as it has been, we are making progress in Iraq and Afghanistan. All Americans should take pride in the accomplishments of our warriors, under the superb leadership of General Petraeus. We need -- and must provide for -- the strongest and most effective military in the world, to protect ourselves and our key allies. In addition, here on the homefront, we must continue our vigilance in the war on terror -- and insist on the best possible care for veterans, their spouses and their dependents -- beginning with my Veterans Bill of Rights. ""Furthermore, I applaud the President\'s efforts on behalf of an economic stimulus packageit\'s a valuable first step. And I hope that the Democratic leadership in Congress will cooperate with the President in a swift and responsible manner. And I applaud the President\'s determination to prune back Congressional earmarksI have long believed that we need more transparency on spending. Moreover, I agree that we must hold the line on taxes, and we must make the Bush tax cuts permanent. Furthermore, I wholeheartedly agree that those who believe that we are paying too little in taxes may contribute to the federal Treasury. This reminds me of the ""Tax Me More"" fund I created in Arkansas during my tenure as governor. ""We have much work to do ahead of us in the years to come: eliminating wasteful spending here at home, improving education, creating consumer-based health care, totally restructuring our tax code and abolishing the IRS, enforcing free but fair trade, and significantly boosting defense spending. ""In addition, we must make more progress to protect fundamental freedoms here at home: We must build a border security fence along our Southern border, by a date certain, using American labor and American materials. No holes, no loopholes, and no amnesty for illegals. ""And we must reaffirm Second Amendment rights, even as we redouble our efforts toward the protection of Life, from conception to natural death. To secure those vital freedoms, we must work toward a judiciary that no longer legislates from the bench, but rather, interprets the Constitution and the law. ""It is to the achievement of all these goals, and more, that I will dedicate my presidency -- a presidency that offers hope, opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.""'"

Campaign Chairman Ed Rollins issued the following statement: ""The Huckabee campaign is deeply disturbed by the obvious irregularities in the Washington State Republican precinct caucuses. It is very unfortunate that the Washington State Party Chairman, Luke Esser, chose to call the race for John McCain after only 87 percent of the vote was counted. According to CNN, the difference between Senator McCain and Governor Huckabee is a mere 242 votes, out of more than 12,000 votes countedwith another 1500 or so votes, apparently, not counted. That is an outrage. ""In other words, more than one in eight Evergreen State Republicans have been disenfranchised by the actions of their own party. This was an error in judgment by Mr. Esser. It was Mr. Esser\'s duty to oversee a fair vote-count process. Washington Republicans know, from bitter experience in the 2004 gubernatorial election, the terrible results that can come from bad ballot-counting. ""Frankly, I am disappointed in the way that Mr. Esser has handled this urgent matter. So I call upon Mr. Esser and his colleagues to cooperate fully with the Huckabee campaignand all Republicans, everywhere, who care about honest and transparent vote-countingto make sure that every vote is counted and that all Republicans in Washington have the chance to make their votes count. Attempts by our campaign to contact Mr. Esser have been unsuccessful. Our lawyers will be on the ground in Washington State soon, and we look forward to sitting down with Mr. Esser to evaluate this process, to see why the count took so long, and why the vote-counting was stopped prematurely. ""It would be a disservice to every voter in Washington State to not pursue a full accounting of all votes cast. ""This is not about Mike Huckabee. This is not about Senator John McCain. This is about the failings of the Washington State Republican Party. All Republicans should unite to demand an honest accounting of the votes, so that Republicans can have full confidence in the results, and full confidence in the eventual Republican nominee. As I said, we are prepared to go to court, and we are also prepared to take our case all the way to the Republican National Convention in September. ""Our cause is just. We must reemphasize the sacred American principle that all ballots be counted in a free, fair, and transparent manner.""'"

As one of the founders of the modern conservative movement, William Buckley helped turn the intellectual and political tide, shifting America from liberalism to conservatism. Our country, and our world, are better for his 82 years on this earth. Bill Buckley was also one of a kinda scholar, an activist, a wit, a harpsichord player. As a young man, he wrote God and Man at Yale, an enduring critique of secular liberalism. In 1955, his National Review burst into prominence, influencing many millions of young conservatives, including one youngster from a little town in Arkansas. To this day, his magazine stands as one of the most important voices of conservative opinion. In addition, he produced a seemingly endless quantity of books, novels, articles, columns, and TV shows. So all conservatives owe Bill Buckley a great debt. Today, while our thoughts and prayers are with the Buckley family, we conservatives continue to draw inspiration from his life and work. But there is more to be done. It is up to us to carry on, fulfilling his enormous legacy.""'"

Two weeks after terrorist attacks rocked Paris, he is visiting France, not to focus on fighting global terrorism, but to tackle the global warming ""security imperative."" America needs a commander-in-chief, not a weather-obsessed meteorologist-in-chief.The federal government cannot control the weather. Period. We can control borders, military assets, critical airspace, and American intelligence. We can also kill Islamic terrorists and radical ISIS murderers. America needs a president focused on what we can control, not fixated on weather patterns which we cannot.Even if we could control the weather, 95 percent of the world lives outside America, and we cannot control the behavior of seven billion people across the globe. Put another way, other countries refuse to tackle simple, dangerous threats like nuclear weapons proliferation. So how does Obama expect to persuade massive polluters like China, Russia and Pakistan to embrace expensive, job-killing global warming regulations?Obama\'s obsession with global, utopian collaboration and building a personal climate change legacy has made him allergic to common sense. Meanwhile, the real ""security imperative"" keeps metastasizing.ISIS keeps swelling in size and power and Obama still has no strategy. In the Syrian city of Raqqa, which serves as the ISIS capital, Islamic radicals have established a treasury department with an elaborate system of taxes, public services and real estate rental agreements. Between oil production, smuggling, antiquity dealing and kidnapping, ISIS is building a comprehensive infrastructure.What will it take for Obama to wake-up to this menace? Maybe he would take ISIS seriously if he discovered they didn\'t recycle.Homegrown terrorists and radicalized immigrants continue to pop-up across Europe. The Department of Homeland Security refuses to reform a dangerous travel program that allows unscreened foreign passengers from 38 countries, including France and Belgium, to enter the U.S. without a visa.Illegal immigrants continue to cross our porous borders and thousands of immigrants overstay their visas each year. America\'s cyber-defenses remain incredibly vulnerable and the White House has endless excuses for security breaches, intelligence failures and routine Washington incompetence.Now more than ever, America needs a commander-in-chief focused on the global war on terrorism, instead we have a community organizer focused on global warming. Obama\'s blindness is beyond baffling, it\'s dangerous. It shouldn\'t take another Paris attack for this White House to open its eyes: radical Islamic terrorism is a much greater threat than a sunburn.Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.This op-ed was originally published on FoxNews.com HERE.ACTIONSSign up to make calls from home for Huckabee for President here.Iowa voter?

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 4, 2015","b'Press Release - ""End Hypocrisy Over Ethanol""'","b'By Mike Huckabee Washington is at war with American farmers and the rural way of life.That\'s alarming because a country that can\'t feed itself, fuel itself, or fight for itself can never truly be free.It\'s no secret President Obama\'s radical mandates have been strangling farmers and rural communities. Worse still, some Republicans support policies that hurt Iowa farmers and kill Iowa jobs.Enough hypocrisy. Republicans cannot attack Obama for punishing farmers, and then support job-killing regulations or double standards that hurt corn-growers. Punishing ethanol and biofuels at the expense of other energy sources is not fair. Republicans should proudly support American farmers and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).I governed a rural state for ten years and 25% of our economy was agriculture. I was also born and raised in rural America. I know first hand, one-sized-fits-all Washington rules have been punishing rural communities for years. I also know ethanol makes sense.Ethanol employs more than 70,000 Iowans and provides $5 billion in wages to workers across the state. Ethanol strengthens small towns, communities and economies across America. It has also reduced gasoline costs by at least 16 percent and decreased pollution.With so much uncertainty around the world, we need an ""all-of-the-above"" American energy strategy that includes renewable fuels. Why would we import from Saudi Arabia and Russia basic energy necessities if we can produce them here at home?Self-reliance is the best way to make America strong and ethanol reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Put another way, homegrown American-made energy means power and influence. Imagine America\'s strength if we were the breadbasket AND the energy barrel for the world?America\'s farmers never ask for handouts. In fact, farmers are usually the first to lend a hand to neighbors and strangers in need. Republicans who think Iowa farmers and ethanol producers want handouts should apologize.Given a fair playing field, our farmers can compete with anyone in the world. Unfortunately many in Washington, including some Republicans, seem to be rooting for the wrong team. We cannot surrender more of our economy to Asia, Europe or the Middle East.The stakes are too high. Since 2000, America has lost five million manufacturing jobs and closed 60,000 manufacturing plants. As we have seen in manufacturing, reckless policies kill jobs and punish rural communities. American farmers should not suffer the same fate. It\'s time we stop the spin and end the hypocrisy: we must champion Iowa farmers and renewable fuels.This op-ed first appeared in the December 4 edition of the Des Moines Register.

From foreign policy to Obamacare, Washington's idiocy and insanity flows faster than a California flash flood, but with much more regularity.More than two centuries ago, we fought a revolution against unaccountable, out-of-touch tyranny. Sadly, Washington has preserved federal land management practices that operate more like a feudalistic property arrangement from King Arthur's era. Nevadans and citizens from across America have a right to be furious.Why does the federal government still own and manage 84 percent of Nevada, 66 percent of Utah, and 53 percent of Oregon? When we deprive states and citizens the power to control their destiny, we undermine the essence of our Constitution.Presidents have deployed American troops to overthrow oppressors and empower foreigners with the power to control their future. Yet today, Washington politicians deny the same basic right to American citizens living in Western states. This is crazy.The American people, in every state, have a constitutional right to equal protection and equal treatment under the law. But in Hillary Clinton's native New York, the federal government owns less than 1 percent of the state. In Massachusetts, the home state of John Kerry and Elizabeth Warren, it's less than 2 percent. Does Washington think that New Englanders are more trusting and responsible than folks in Western states? These massive discrepancies in federal land management practices are unfair, unconstitutional and un-American.Federal land generates no property tax revenue for states, but it certainly burdens states with infrastructure and law enforcement costs. In Nevada, Washington controls 56 million acres, which is nine times the size of Vermont. In return, Washington provides $25 million in payment in lieu of taxes. That's a meager 50 cents an acre. What a rip-off.The American people have lost faith in a broken, blind Washington that no longer represents us. It's time we burn down the corrupt Washington political machine and the federal land management power grab that has persisted for too long.As the governor of state who battled Washington for over decade, I believe government closest to the people is the most accountable, responsive and fair. I also believe the people of Nevada should control and manage their land  not detached Washington bureaucrats living thousands of miles away.We need to shift power back to state and local governments. We need to empower Americans to control their own destiny. We need to restore the fundamentals our Founding Fathers fought to establish because the nonsense we have now is not it. Let's start by letting Nevadans control Nevada.Mike Huckabee, a Republican, is the former governor of Arkansas and a candidate for president.This op-ed ran in the Reno Gazette-Journal on December 10, 2015."""

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 18, 2015","b'Press Release - Republicans Get Only Embarrassment From Budget Deal. Reject It, America'","b'By Mike Huckabee In Washington\'s latest 2,000-page budget deal, Planned Parenthood, ObamaCare recipients, illegal immigrants, lobbyists, lawyers, and potential terrorists received everything they wanted. Republicans got one thing: embarrassment.Yet Republicans in Congress think we should celebrate? This is crazy! Instead of passing this disastrous ""fiscal cliff"" budget deal, maybe Congress should throw it off a cliff.As the civilized world watches the horrors of Paris, Syria, and San Bernardino, the cancer of radical Islam continues to spread. Yet this $1.1 trillion new spending bill fully-funds President Obama\'s refugee relocation program, protects Obama\'s unconstitutional executive amnesty, preserves the dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, strengthens federal support for sanctuary cities, and completely absolves Obama from any responsibility to secure the border. It also includes a $1.6 billion earmark to resettle illegal immigrants in the U.S.The American people are frustrated and furious because the louder we scream; the more Washington politicians plug their ears and ignore our voices. Why are we building mosques in the Middle East while roads and schools in Middle America crumble? Why are we robbing seniors and veterans of their hard-earned benefits to give handouts to illegal immigrants? It\'s time we put Americans first.Instead of holding President Obama accountable, Congress transformed this budget deal into a Christmas tree covered with shiny ornament handouts and presents underneath for every lobbyist, well-connected corporation and liberal interest group. But everyday Americans didn\'t get anything, but a slap in the face. If this is a ""victory"" for Republicans, then why waste time electing Republicans to the House and Senate?Tucked away in this deal is also a massive assault on America\'s workers. It expands the pro-amnesty, H-2B foreign worker program by increasing the number of visas for foreign workers by 400 percent. I have no idea why any Republican would support immigration programs that import foreigners to replace American workers and drive American wages lower than the Dead Sea!Why would we import foreigners to steal blue-collar jobs for Americans in trucking, construction, dining, and the hotel industry? Why would we drive down middle-class wages and increase the number of unemployed Americans? Obama\'s job-killing agenda has done enough damage, and it\'s time for Republicans to wake-up and reject these horrible H-2B programs. Americans come first.The Washington establishment attacks me as a ""protectionist."" But when it comes to America, I will never apologize for protecting us militarily, economically, culturally and spiritually.I will wear this label as a badge of honor because the stakes are too high.Since 2000, America has lost five million manufacturing jobs and closed 60,000 manufacturing plants. As we have seen in manufacturing, reckless policies kill jobs and punish rural communities.This latest fiscal deal is a disgusting embarrassment, even for Washington. It must be rejected, killed and buried. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.'"

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"December 26, 2015","b""Press Release - Everybody's Wrong: Cruz & Huckabee Are on Opposite Sides of the Ball""","b'By David Shedlock Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee\'s camp says that U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has two different messages on social issues, one for Blue states, another for red states. That is true, but not for the reason Huckabee says. It is because he and Cruz look at abortion and ""gay marriage"" from two different points of view. The Cruz position is the same as Ron Paul\'s was in 2012. It is essentially libertarian. The reason Cruz can appear to be on both sides is because he can tailor his message to the audience. He can tell blue states audiences that they can keep their liberal laws, and red states that they can keep their conservative ones. He is not flip-flopping. He is being consistent, as Shane Vander Hart has shownThe ""state\'s rights position"" is totally unworkable on marriage, for previous laws have always required that states accept every other state\'s standards. The Cruz position is actually a step backwards for the pro-life movement, as well. Morally, abortion is a national sin. Cruz can say he has done all he can to stop abortion. But Ron Paul\'s pro-abortion supporters knew that his position would not stop abortions at all. He could brag all he wanted about proposing laws that would outlaw abortion nationally, but he knew they would never see the light of day,Huckabee should hammer this home during the remainder of the presidential primary season. 2015 is the time to make this clear, not 2016. Cruz position is pro-choice, Huckabee is the pro-life alternative.(Disclaimer: Governor Huckabee wrote the Foreword for my book, With Christ in the Voting Booth. I will likely support him again this time around)This blog originally posted on Caffeinated Thoughts here.'"

That is exactly why Ivan Moore drove from Story City to hear Huckabee speak. \'He has the experience as a governor, and I really think that governors have a real advantage over senators and representatives because he has actually governed something and they haven\'t,\' Moore said. One of those issues that Moore was glad to hear Huckabee speak of was tax reform and his support of the FairTax... \'I think that would be so beneficial to our country,\' Moore said.""Des Moines Register: ""Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Monday blasted President Obama\'s plan to use executive authority to tighten gun rules in the United States. Huckabee, during his first of five Monday campaign stops, also had strong words for Republicans in Congress: \'Grow a spine and stand up to Obama and tell him \'no\' rather than wring your hands and say \'there\'s nothing we can do.\' Well, if there\'s nothing you can do, resign and send other people to Congress who would be willing to oppose it.\'""Siouxland Matters: ""Janet Huckabee hosted a meet and greet at a local indoor shooting range and expressed her reaction to President Obama\'s executive action gun plan.

It seems clear though, that some campaigns do.What does it say about our politics when the media values the campaigns raising millions of dollars in big donations from special interests, while devaluing the candidates who survive and thrive on small donations of $1, $3, $5 and $10 from seniors, students and Moms and Dads who just want a better life tomorrow than they have today.It says the process is broken. And to me that\'s just another reason why voters are expressing their visceral hatred for all things Washington in poll after poll.As President, I want to fix the hate and encourage Americans to dream big again, tackle tough problems and get things done. After seven years of Obama, we\'ve lost the ability to do any of these things. Our politics are small and petty and our nation is declining before our eyes.Let me be clear, talking about fixing Washington, isn\'t a political calculation for me and let me explain why. A nice couple in Iowa this morning asked me why I was running for President and I got choked up. I went on to talk about my grandkids and how much they mean to me and how their future means more than my own. The thought of my leaving behind a declining America to my children and grandchildren is unacceptable to me. And I won\'t. I will fight until I can\'t anymore and I hope and pray you will be with me.If you can afford to donate $1 today in support of my campaign, please chip in here:https://www.mikehuckabee.com/donateIf you can\'t afford to donate, but you still support my campaign, please just click on my website link here:http://www.MikeHuckabee.com/ActionYour donation or your click to my website ""Action"" page will let me know all I need to know as I crisscross Iowa and as I prepare for our upcoming presidential debate in South Carolina this Thursday.Knowing you are standing with me will mean the world to me.

Ted Cruz. ""But I don\'t think American needs a good lawyer right now, it needs a good leader. My question to you would be can you name me what efforts (Cruz) has been a leader in ... He\'s been a senator. He\'s been a lawyer and a lobbyist  What has Ted Cruz done in his life that prepares him to be president of the United States?""Huckabee\'s comments came during a 12-minute exchange with Joseph Brown, pastor of Marion Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, Iowa. Brown, who started a coalition of Iowa pastors who support Cruz, began the conversation with a question about why the candidate has said Cruz tailors his comments about same-sex marriage to the audiences he addresses.""He\'s saying the same things you are saying,"" Brown said.Huckabee politely disagreed.Cruz has said ""he would leave marriage issues up to the states and therefore would not support a federal marriage amendment,"" Huckabee said. ""He knows, like good lawyers do, how to say things that sound almost the same as something else.""During a question-and-answer session with New York donors in December, Politico reported Cruz as saying, ""People of New York may well resolve the marriage question differently than the people of Florida or Texas or Ohio. ... That\'s why we have 50 states  to allow a diversity of views.""

Brown cited Mojave Memorial Cross, a case Cruz argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. ""He fought and won that issue,"" Brown said. ""He\'s stood up for the Second Amendment.""Replied Huckabee: ""Sounds like he\'d be a great lawyer ... I\'m asking you, what has he done that gives you reason to believe he would be a great executive, which is a very different job than a lawyer.""Answered Brown, who caucused for Huckabee in 2008: ""That\'s what I like about you  you\'ve been an executive for 10 years.""After the exchange, Huckabee and Brown shook hands and talked privately for about 5 minutes.Huckabee said later he didn\'t know whether Brown had been swayed. But while many Iowa pastors support Cruz, he said, many continue to support him.""Some of the most prominent pastors are still with us and a lot of the rank and file people still are,"" he said.This story ran in the Des Moines Register as well as USA Today.'"

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 13, 2016",b'Press Release - Huckabee Stresses Importance of Stable Families in Combatting Poverty',"b'By Carrie Sheffield, OpportunityLives.com The war on poverty isn\'t fought and won with a monthly check from the government. In discussing the war on poverty at the Kemp Forum last week, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee spoke of the emotional and psychosocial deprivation that comes when government crowds out the family, a key variable in preventing poverty.Huckabee cited statistics showing how a child born to married parents who have finished high school and are working has an 88 percent chance of never entering poverty. Reverse those variables, the former Arkansas governor said, and there is a 91 percent chance that child will experience poverty.""The reversal is dramatic,"" Huckabee explained. ""We sometimes are even pilloried, those of us who say marriage matters, family matters, stable marriages and stable families matter. And it sounds like we\'re coming at it just from trying to tell people how to live.""""It\'s an economic issue,"" he continued. ""You want to eliminate poverty? We can eliminate most of it by instilling in people the idea that there is a virtue. And I know that virtue is a politically incorrect word. But it is based on what this country is founded on, the idea that some things are right, some things are good and wholesome and virtuous and we should elevate and uphold them.""House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), who moderated the conversation, said that while government can provide supply lines in the war on poverty, it should not be on the front lines. By spending trillions of government dollars on anti-poverty measures, Ryan said this effectively crowds out civil society leaders, who are better able to take a holistic approach.""The reason we speak about family, the reason we speak about marriage is because that is a beautiful support structure that is there for a person to teach them, to connect them, to equip them with the skills so that, and this is what we do as parents, so that when your kids get up they have the tools they need to succeed,"" Ryan said.""But that\'s missing in so many parts,"" he added. ""And this isn\'t something that just hits people of certain income groups, whether it\'s heroin or alcohol or drugs, it hits everybody. And it\'s breaking families.""Ryan asked Huckabee to discuss how Huckabee\'s time as a pastor had influenced his time in government.""Government can give you a sandwich, but government cannot give you a hug. Sometimes people need affirmation,"" Huckabee said.""We\'ve made the huge mistake in this country that we should create this huge separation between faith and government, and we cannot function as a society,"" he said.Huckabee, who served as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, spoke of how he was able to bring reforms to welfare in the mid-1990s to his state. State autonomy was crucial.""We were given a lot of flexibility of how we did it, and it worked because we knew our demographics,"" Huckabee recalled. ""We knew our people and we moved over half the people who had been on welfare, not just off welfare  that\'s easy, you can just cut off the funds  but to get them to transition where they\'re going to work every day. That\'s the challenge, and we did that.""""Government can give you a sandwich, but government cannot give you a hug. Sometimes people need affirmation""Huckabee spoke of what Ryan referred to as the ""poverty trap,"" where families have little or no incentive to work and lift themselves out of poverty and instead hover around the basic threshold of government-subsidized living expenses that allow them to scrape by but not thrive. He said that structuring programs that way from a distant federal bureaucracy is harmful to working families.""There is an industry of poverty that is built around the organizations, that if we have organizations and the advocacy groups, that that will resolve poverty,"" Huckabee said. Referring to the federal War on Poverty that President Lyndon Johnson launched in 1964, he argued, ""We didn\'t really do much to move the needle. Part of the reason was we didn\'t really attack some of the fundamental purposes and that\'s the reason people can\'t get out of the hole.""Huckabee said beyond properly structuring work and assistance programs, broader tax reform could help bring back jobs for working families.""I believe that there is an incredible opportunity for us in this country to reclaim that spirit of America, where people are rewarded for their work,"" Huckabee said. ""And when that happens and we give them opportunities, we\'ll see the growth, not just of our economy, but the growth of our people being able move upwardly.""""But I just think sometimes the government policies that we\'ve created are created people who never spent a day poor,"" he said. ""And they don\'t understand. And it\'s one of the reasons why we need a new vision, a new approach.""'"

Great debate performance tonight, but the real work begins tomorrow morning in sunny South Carolina. A few excerpts from tonight, where moral clarity shined bright, and some updates from the roadMorality...""America needs a different kind of leadership. We need leadership that addresses, not just the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say \'God bless America.\' But how can He do that if we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day? I believe some of those old ideas, where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet, might be the best solutions we ever saw as a country.""U.S. Military...""The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets. It\'s to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe. That is the purpose.""2nd Amendment... ""There is no gun show loophole. I promise you, I\'ve been to more gun shows than President Obama. The president also says that \'it\'s easier to get a gun than it is to get groceries.\' Again, I can assure you, it\'s much more difficult to purchase a firearm than purchase the ingredients for a salad in a supermarket"" Gun Free Zones...""The one common thing in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun-free zones where law-abiding citizens, who could have stood-up and at least tried to stop it, were prohibited under the law.""Social Security... ""Remember, Social Security is not the government\'s moneyit belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives...Our problem is NOT that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\'t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created policies that would create economic growth."" FairTax... ""I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code, pass the FairTax and supercharge the economy It\'s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer or a twist of a screw. We need to pass the FairTax. It\'s built on the same commonsense that we raise our kids and train dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And you punish behavior you want less of.""""Huckabee to speak at renewable fuels summit""  The Des Moines RegisterMike Huckabee will be one of four Republican presidential candidates who will speak at Tuesday\'s 10th Annual Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit...

Huckabee met with about 70 people Wednesday at the Iowa Machine Shed, the 37th of 150 stops the campaign plans to make in the final month... Huckabee also was critical of rivals who he said are currently holding elective office, but are straying from them to campaign. ""I\'ve never personally had a job that would pay me $174,000 a year where I didn\'t have to show up,"" Huckabee said. ""If you don\'t want the job, then have the integrity to resign from that job and go seek the job you want.

In 2008, Huckabee won Iowa. And a Tipton man who backed him then and was at the Machine Shed on Wednesday said he\'ll support him again. ""I still believe in what he says,"" said Ernie Jennings, who is retired. Jennings said he had considered Cruz, but ""Gov. Huckabee seems a little deeper.""

During the discussion, the wife commented regarding Huckabee (who was a Christian minister before he was Governor of Arkansas for more than 10 years, ""We need a Commander in Chief, not a Minister in Chief."" I assume the candidate/husband, who said nothing, holds the same view.As a Christian who understands the spiritual significance of our nation\'s founding and the necessity of spiritual virtue to maintain our freedom, I take issue with the notion that having been a Christian minister is somehow a negative and that it cancels out a successful political career. Consider this:The nation is like a ship sailing toward a destination. The president and other political leaders are like the captain and crew of that ship. The people are the wind. When the captain and the crew understand the destination (destiny) of the ship (nation) and when the wind (people) is blowing toward the destination, all is good.But when the wind blows another direction, as it inevitably will, it is more important than ever for the captain and crew to know the destination of the ship - and if need be, go against the wind. This is the difference between a democracy and a republic. In a democracy, the wind of the people is the final word. In a republic, we recognize that 51% can be wrong and the law of the land is the final authority.The problem with our nation right now is that most of our political leadership (on both sides of the aisle) have no idea of the spiritual destiny of our nation. As a result, the captain of the ship has steered away from our destiny - sailing with the wind of a people who also do not understand the destiny of the nation. Neither do most of the political leaders that we Christians consider ""good,"" and their efforts only slow the ship down instead of changing the direction of the ship toward the proper destination.Yes, we need a spiritual revival. But we also need a captain and crew who understand spiritual destiny. We need a captain who is a good communicator - who can speak to the wind and convince it to blow in the right direction. This is primarily the job of church leaders, but church leaders who will speak to the people regarding politics, are relatively few. We need a captain and crew who will drop the sails, man the oars and fight the wind. We need a president who will speak to the people and teach them the destiny of the nation.Do we need a Minister in Chief or Commander in Chief? Why not both? Having been a pastor and a governor, Mike Huckabee has the experience to be both. I suppose there is a reason why some nations refer to their primary leader as the Prime Minister.'"

Some brief clips below and be sure to check the last story.-----Republican Debate 2016  The Telegraph... Mike Huckabee may have had the most poignant moment of the night, nearly breaking into tears describing the people who had worked for 40 years ""on a cement floor"" but may have to wait longer to retire because of social security shortfalls. To sum it up in a sentence..Mr. Huckabee was the most engaging.""Huckabee: Need Clearly Defined Goal in the Middle East""  Wall Street Journal  During Thursday\'s GOP debate, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the U.S. needs to be in the Middle East to ""destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization"" ""When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked the \'The Flinstones.\' It was desolate and barren. It\'s been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that. We don\'tWe need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal. And we can\'t make sure we win unless we have a military that\'s the strongest in the history of mankind.""  ""Obama Policies Under Fire at GOP Evening Debate, Huckabee Calls Gun Rules \'Insane\'""  Fox News President Obama\'s policies on everything from gun control to counterterrorism got hammered by the Republican candidates... with Mike Huckabee calling recently announced firearm regulations ""completely insane."" ""I promise you, I\'ve been to more gun shows than President Obama,"" the former Arkansas governor said at the evening Fox Business Network debate -- claiming the gun show loophole, which allows people to buy firearms at gun shows without undergoing a background check, is a myth. ""He keeps pushing ideas that never work."" Huckabee also commented on the progress of the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan, saying he was skeptical about efforts to rebuild a country he likened to ""the land of the Flintstones."" Huckabee, who was responding to a question about whether the United States should continue to aid the Afghanistan government, said, ""You can\'t create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy""...Huckabee called for a fair tax to ""transform our economy""...Huckabee: ""There is no gun show loophole""  The HillMike Huckabee said he\'s been to more gun shows than President Obama has and ""there is no gun show loophole."" The former Arkansas governor...said Obama is wrong in suggesting it is easier to buy a gun than groceries. ""I\'ve been to more gun shows than Obama, and I\'ve bought more weapons at them,"" Huckabee said. ""I\'ve purchased guns, and I can assure you it is much more difficult to buy a firearm than to get ingredients in a supermarket."" Obama last week announced new executive actions intended to require all sellers at gun shows to perform background checks on buyers. Huckabee has called Obama\'s action to close the gun show loophole ""unconstitutional"" and ""completely insane.""Huckabee: \'We Don\'t Buy\' That Obama Says You Can Keep Your Guns  The Daily Caller Huckabee blasted Barack Obama\'s credibility for allowing you to keep your guns saying ""we don\'t buy it, we don\'t believe it.""...Huckabee said Obama ""has lost his credibility and his inept inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor and that\'s just going and doing it my own way."" While discussing getting rid of the visa waiver program, Huckabee said while it ""may slow it down"" international commerce ""a slowed down commerce that is making us safer is worth it."" ""This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer and passed three background checks and that\'s why a lot of Americans didn\'t buy it when the President said, \'We\'ll bring in Syrian refugees, but don\'t worry, we\'ll check them out.\'"" Do Mass Shooters Target Gun-Free Zones? It\'s Complicated  NewsweekAt the debate on Thursday night, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee repeated an oft-heard claim that most mass shootings happen in places where guns are banned and potential victims can\'t return fire. Asked by Fox Business Network moderators about what the federal government can do to stop Americans who pose a risk to public safety from obtaining guns, Huckabee claimed that some mass shootings might have been prevented if more Americans were armed with firearms. ""Of course we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun-free zones, where people who would have been law-abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it...were not allowed to under the law,"" Huckabee said to applause from the crowd gathered in South Carolina...""Huckabee: Taxes Like Training Dogs, Raising Kids, Reward Good Behavior""  NewsMax Former Arkansas Gov.

""You reward behavior you want more of, and you punish behavior you want less of,"" he said.""We now punish behavior we want more off, by taxing it and reward the behavior we want less of. If you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and rest of taxpayers help subsidize you and help bail you out."" The tax system moves people into a higher tax bracket when they improve their lives by getting a better job, he noted... ""No matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\'s productivity, you\'re still taxing their works, their savings, you\'re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends. Taxing everything that produces something,"" he said, touting his ""fair tax"" with ""no payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.""""Obama More Interested in Protecting Islam Than Americans, Most Religious Hate Crimes Against Jews, Huckabee Says at GOP Debate""  Christian Post Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee argued President Barack Obama is more interested in not offending Islam than he is in protecting Americans, and most religious hate crimes are against Jews, not Muslims.former Arkansas governor asserted that President Obama focuses too much time on not offending Islam. ""We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us,"" said Huckabee. Huckabee went on to note that despite the attention Obama gives to hate crimes against Muslims in the United States, Jewish American experience a higher rate of hate crimes. ""He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims""There are far more hate crimes against Jews than Muslims in the U.S."" Washington ExaminerMike Huckabee during Thursday\'s debate noted that there are far more hate crimes against Jews in the U.S. than there are against Muslims  and he\'s absolutely right. Though the media and many political figures have focused the nation\'s attention on anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S., according to FBI hate crime statistics, Jews are targeted far more than Muslims, both in absolute terms and proportionately. In 2014, the FBI reported 1,092 hate crimes based on religious bias  58 percent of those crimes were against Jews, compared with 16 percent that were against Muslims. There are about 3.3 million Muslims and 5.8 million Jews in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center. ""GOP Debate 2016: \'Obama Should Worry About Jews, Not Muslims,\' Huckabee Says""  International Business TimesFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Thursday criticized President Barack Obama\'sState of the Union plea for American citizens and politicians to treat Muslims fairly... Huckabee used recently released FBI statistics about 2014 hate crimes in the United States to back up his argument that Obama should be condemning anti-Semitic comments instead of defending Muslims. While responding to a debate moderator\'s question about the U.S. visa waiver program, which was criticized after recent mass shootings for allowing tourists to enter the country unchecked, Huckabee alleged that Obama was prioritizing Islam over Americans\' safety. He went on to denounce Obama\'s Tuesday night statement encouraging people to have open minds about diversity. ""[When Obama] makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don\'t want to offend Muslims, he needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year,"" Huckabee said""Mike Huckabee Tells Heckler: Abortion Is the Ultimate Form of Child Abuse""  Lifesite News Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee once again strongly affirmed his pro-life convictions at a campaign stop in Iowa...When confronted by an antagonist trying to make a scene...

""I\'ll leave that to Hillary. I\'m not a practicing physician, so I\'m not going to diagnose anything with her,"" Huckabee responded to a question referencing a recent Breitbart News story revealing medical professionals and security officials raising concerns about the former Secretary of State\'s health status. Huckabee added, ""I\'m concerned for her political health."" I hope that people continue to realize that she has been very dishonest about many of the things she\'s done as Secretary of State. I think that is a greater concern to me that she would become a credible candidate for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of our military when she left people stranded in Benghazi begging for help and never sent the help. Why that happened, I don\'t know, but that is a greater concern to me than her last medical checkup. Huckabee\'s comments on Benghazi come the day before the premier of ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,"" which tells the story of what happened that night surrounding a stand-down order preventing military personnel from aiding the U.S. consulate under attack during Clinton\'s watch as Secretary of State.Huckabee Eyes Obama  Fox Business...

""It\'s time for some integrity. In the Scriptures, James says we should be doers of the Word and not just hearers.

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 21, 2016",b'Press Release - I Was Asked These 3 Questions',"b'By Mike Huckabee Everyday on the campaign trail voters and reporters ask me all sorts of questions. Below are three that were asked of me by the Christian Post. As you consider who you will support for President, I hope you will take my answers to heart and strongly consider my campaign for President when it is time to vote.If you have friends and/or family living in Iowa, please share this message with them today. Over 2/3rds of Iowa voters say they are still undecided about who to caucus for. Your personal email to one of these voters or perhaps someone who is wavering in their support of someone else can make a profound difference for our campaign.Below are my answers to three questions from the Christian Post.Christian Post (CP): Do you think President Obama and Washington are pushing us in the wrong direction morally?Huckabee: Yes! America has witnessed the slaughter of over 55 million babies in the name of choice. Politicians and unelected judges threaten the foundation of religious liberty by criminalizing Christianity. We even have Republicans demanding that we abandon Biblical principles of natural marriage.CP: What does judicial supremacy mean to you?Huckabee: It\'s the Supreme Court, NOT the Supreme Branch and it\'s sure not the Supreme Being. Many politicians have surrendered to the false god of judicial supremacy. This is wrong. It leads to judicial tyranny. We should not allow black-robed and unelected judges the power to make law and enforce it-upending the equality of our three branches of government and the separation of powers so very central to our Constitution.CP: In your ""Pledge to the People,"" you promise to defend the ""sanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave"" and to push to ""defund Planned Parenthood"". Is this critical to your campaign for President?Huckabee: We\'ve lost our way morally. I refuse to surrender on fundamental issues like life and marriage. As I have said, the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being and that can\'t overturn the laws of nature or of nature\'s God.'"

He started by talking about the economy and the nation\'s military. ""As president, one of my goals would be to get this country back on track monetarily, fix the economy, make it so people aren\'t punished for working and rewarded for sitting on their backside and doing nothing,"" he said. He also stressed the country needs to get its military back. ""I tell everyone even if we succeed in getting the country back monetarily and military, we are not going to be the America we need to be, want to be and have to be if we don\'t get ourselves back in shape morally. Because that\'s where the heart and soul of this country comes from,"" Huckabee said. In response to what he would do about Common Core in education, Huckabee said education should not be governed at the federal level. ""The federal government should have zero role in education. There is no federal role in education. That agency shouldn\'t be there,"" he said. ""You don\'t want that decided by the president and Congress. You don\'t want the federal government dictating education. You want it decided by the parents, local school boards and the states."" ""You cannot create a one-size fits all. That\'s the logic of Obamacare and that\'s a failure as well,"" he said. One audience member asked his views on renewable energy. ""The RFS in place is a program that works. The federal government wants to end it cause it works."" He said getting rid of the RFS would put over 75,000 Iowans whose jobs depend on ethanol out of work. One of the quickest ways to do that, is vote for a candidate who opposes RFS. Other topics included the Veterans Administration and its healthcare, Federal Reserve policies and the national debt.CBS, Mason City, IowaSeveral presidential candidates will be calling Iowa home until voters cast their votes in the state caucuses... and that includes former Gov.

Huckabee told those gathered that it would be a more fair tax, because it would also collect taxes from some who avoid taxes now by accepting wage payments under the table. He said that, not only do those workers avoid paying income tax, but their employers avoid paying Social Security taxes, as well. Huckabee then spent about thirty minutes or so answering questions from the crowd, that ranged from Second Amendment issues to dealing with ISIS. Huckabee left the gathering after about 45 minutes to head to two additional campaign appearances that were scheduled for Thursday evening.""Mike Huckabee: God Will Judge Ted Cruz\'s Christian Faith""Brietbart NewsGOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov.

Huckabee told Fox News\'s Bill O\'Reilly, ""Nobody has caught me saying something different in New York than I say in Sioux Center. If I tell somebody something in Marshalltown, Iowa, they will hear the exact same things in Manhattan."" Huckabee, a former Southern Baptist Minister, was referencing an earlier report from Politico that Cruz allegedly said he would make protecting marriage a priority while on the campaign trail, but said something different during a fundraiser in New York. ""I have been asked a lot of questions,"" Huckabee told O\'Reilly about Cruz. ""And I have pointed out that if someone is going to say they are consistent, they need to be consistent. One of the things that I feel I have brought to this race is that nobody has caught me saying something different in New York than I say in Sioux Center."" O\'Reilly said, ""You are a straight-talking guy.Campaigning Safely in Iowa Winters- Sioux City JournalThe Iowa caucuses occur every four years in the midst of winters that can be filled with cold and snow...Republican Mike Huckabee was the first candidate to come through Sioux City following the sad death. I asked him Thursday about how candidates juggle the desire to meet as many people as possible with trying to keep safe during travels. Presidential candidates typically plan out events days in advance, when the weather ahead may not be known. Huckabee said safety governs all decisions on whether to hold to a campaign event during poor winter conditions. ""There is no event that is worth taking a chance with....We have to put the people first,"" Huckabee said.He said he immediately sent an email to all campaign workers reminding them to be careful, and if they encounter dicey driving conditions to pull back and wait for a better time. Huckabee noted some of the staffers are not from Iowa and may have limited experience in driving on snow. He told the workers, ""We want to run with every ounce of energy...but put your safety first.""Huckabee said the weather during his Iowa stops during the 2015-16 winter months have worked out well, as no bad conditions have necessitated cancellation of a planned event...FoxNews Local Broadcast ""Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee: You Decide 2016""Family: Married to Janet Huckabee with three children...Religion: Southern Baptist...On the issues:...Economy: Huckabee wants to abolish the IRS and create FairTax, which he says would lower taxes, bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and guarantee criminals pay their share. He prides himself on his track record of cutting taxes as Arkansas\' governor.Education: According to Huckabee, the high cost of college threatens middle class families and students. He says colleges must be reformed and the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished.Environment: The former Arkansas governor supports the Keystone pipeline, exploring the Arctic, and pursuing wind and solar energy options.Gun control/rights: As president, Huckabee says he will defend the Second Amendment, oppose new gun control laws and protect the rights of gun owners. ""This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because some people drive drunk,"" he says on his website.Health care: He wants to repeal Obamacare and tackle what he calls out-of-control health care costs. Huckabee says he believes life begins at conception.Immigration: Huckabee opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and supports securing the board. ""If you reward people who play outside the rules and punish people who live within the rules, pretty soon nobody is going to play by the rules. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,"" says the former TV host.National security: As president, he wants to rebuild U.S. military superiority, restore our country\'s role as leader of the Free World and defeat radical Islam.Social issues: He says he will defend and protect traditional marriage.Bill O\'Reilly Confronts Mike Huckabee Over Controversy Surrounding Cruz\'s \'Tithing\' HistoryThe BlazeFox New host Bill O\'Reilly confronted Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee on Thursday night... O\'Reilly questioned whether Huckabee has been too critical of Cruz, with the candidate pushing back and defending himself after a BuzzFeed story in which he was quoted saying that ""it\'s hard to say God is first in your life if he\'s last in your budget.I was asked a question generally and I said, \'I don\'t think you can put God last in your budget if you claim that he\'s first in your life,"" Huckabee told O\'Reilly. ""Christian stewardship is something that I believe in""...As TheBlaze previously reported, some critics are taking aim at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz\'s ""tithing"" history, claiming that he contributed less than 1 percent of his income to charitable causes between 2006 and 2010  much less than the 10 percent that is embraced as the standard by many Christians...A new evangelical group called Americans United For Values is slamming Cruz in a 60-second radio ad, questioning the Texas senator\'s authenticity and dubbing him a ""phony."" The spot comes as the state\'s caucuses are just two weeks away, according to Politico.'"

I\'m reminded of Proverbs 22:28: ""Remove not the ancient landmark which your fathers have set."" This verse refers to ancient boundary stones that served as critical navigation points - the GPS of Biblical times. If these landmarks were moved, travelers might become hopelessly lost. Our culture has inherited invaluable political boundary stones from the Founding Fathers. What looks like confusion and darkness in America is a result of moving cultural boundary stones. We have moved the boundary stones of freedom, by trading liberty for government dependency. We have moved the boundary stones of marriage and family, by redefining them. We will become hopelessly lost as a culture unless we return to the Judeo-Christian values this country - by the providence of God - was built on.""Huckabee continues 150-event Iowa campaign whilrwind Sun., Mon. & Tues."".DES MOINES, IowaMike Huckabee will continue his 150-event January campaign schedule for Iowa, with events tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday.""Authenticity and conviction matters, and I will never say one thing in Marshalltown, Iowa and another in Manhattan,"" said Gov. Huckabee. ""As others launch nasty attacks, our positive message is resonating and our momentum continues to grow across Iowa with a week remaining before the caucuses."" Since January 19, Huckabee has held Iowa events every single day, and he will continue campaigning daily in Iowa until the caucuses. Huckabee will be joined by actor, Jim Labriola, often noted for his role in the popular television show ""Home Improvement,"" from January 2631.""Huckabee joins Firehouse at the Surf""Mason City Globe Gazette...Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee took some time off from traditional campaigning Friday night when he took the stage to perform with FireHouse at the Surf Ballroom. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and 2008 winner of the Iowa caucuses, played the bass guitar with the rock band. It marked a return appearance for Huckabee at the Surf. In 2008, he played with Boston\'s Barry Goudreau...""Janet Huckabee campaigns and greets voters"" Mason City Globe Gazette...Several presidential candidates will be calling Iowa home until voters cast their votes it the state caucuses and that includes former Gov. Mike Huckabee and wife, Janet. We caught up with her today in Mason City at Cabin Coffee. There she helped campaign on behalf of her husband, by speaking with voters about the values her family stands for. Janet says she enjoys meeting voters one on one, because it creates a more open and honest dialogue about the issues they want to see fixed. ""We have some major problems in America. This is not the time for on-the-job training. We need people with leadership skills people back and say I\'ve been there and done that. We have some difficulties in America. Mike has a proven record. You can look at the state of Arkansas and see that he has been through difficulties,"" said Janet Huckabee. Friday, you can catch the Huckabees in Clear Lake at the Surf Ballroom. Mike is scheduled to play bass guitar for the 80\'s rock band Firehouse. Janet says beyond playing the bass, Mike sets himself apart from other candidates by having conviction toward issues like abortion. ""We have been saying for a long time that we are pro-life. Others are pro-life, but Mike wants to use the constitution, the fifth and the 14 amendment to say now we can use the Constitution to protect life and that is because the Constitution guarantees people or persons due process,"" said Huckabee. The Huckabee campaign has 150 Iowa events planned for the final month before the caucuses...""Huckabee\'s 5 grandkids inspired him to seek presidency""Des Moines Register... Mike Huckabee stood in the middle of the moving RV and pointed to the 23 photos of his five grandchildren stuck onto the walls around the inside of the vehicle. The photos ""remind me about why I\'m doing this,"" the former Arkansas governor and Fox News talk show host said as he rattled off the children\'s names and ages, their likes and dislikes. He sees the photos each time he gets onto the RV and each time he disembarks to talk with Iowans about why they should support him in the Feb. 1 Republican caucuses.None of Huckabee\'s grandchildren had been born eight years ago when he made his first run for president.""I\'m not convinced that the America they are growing up in is one that is going to give them the same level of opportunity and freedom that I have been so blessed in this country to have grown up with,"" he told a group at the Ogden senior citizens center in January. He left his job at Fox News a year ago and in May announced he was running for president. The day after his announcement, Huckabee was in Iowa. Since then, he\'s spent 65 days in the state, stopping in all 99 counties... What gives Huckabee hope is that the poll also showed that 56 percent of likely caucusgoers could either change their minds about their first-place choice or had not settled on a first choice. ""He surprised us all in 2008; it could happen again,"" said Jayme Neiman, assistant professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa. Huckabee was trailing in the polls until a month before the 2008 Iowa caucuses but pulled out a win, garnering nearly 41,000 votes, the most ever for a Republican... Huckabee remains optimistic. ""My sense is, folks haven\'t nailed it down yet,"" he told The Des Moines Register. ""Some of them won\'t until the night they go to the caucuses."" That\'s why at each town hall, he tells audiences to go the caucuses regardless of the weather. ""But, if you\'re not going to caucus for me,"" he says, only half-jokingly, ""stay home and watch it on TV because it will be cold outside.""""Huckabee tells Fort Dodge group there\'s always a surprise caucus night""Des Moines Register...If you aren\'t going to caucus for him, then don\'t caucus at all, former Gov. Mike Huckabee told a group that gathered to him here on Saturday...Halfway through his stump speech, one of the ""I Like Mike"" signs taped to the window behind him fell. ""There\'s always a surprise on caucus night. Just go ahead and prepare for another one,"" Huckabee said. He told them to encourage people to caucus, unless they aren\'t supporting him.""I really believe one of the things you hire a president to do is to react to things they don\'t know are coming,"" Huckabee said. He later added that his governing philosophy is to follow the Golden Rule. The former governor of Arkansas came down heavily on the U.S. Supreme Court, criticizing it for its ruling on same-sex marriage. When a president sees a ruling as unconstitutional, it is his responsibility to ignore it, Huckabee said. ""Courts can\'t make law,"" Huckabee said, adding that responsibility belongs to elected officials. He later told the Register that a court can review law, but giving it an absolute iron-clad say would be tyranny. ""I\'ve followed Huckabee ever since I first heard of him,"" said Marcia Johnson, a Fort Dodge resident who attended the event. ""He has never changed his mind on anything."" Johnson said she plans on caucusing for Huckabee. Jim Oberhelman, Webster County chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, said projections he has seen for Webster County anticipate there will be 25 percent more participation than the last caucus. ""Weather may dictate that,"" said Oberhelman, who does not endorse any candidates. After his speech, Huckabee took answers from the crowd. When a man asked where he stands on the Renewable Fuel Standard, Huckabee said he supports it.""Candidate touts experience, laments political correctness""Fort Dodge The MessengerNearly 11 years as the governor of Arkansas helped to prepare him to be president of the United States, Mike Huckabee told a group of Fort Dodge supporters Saturday. Governors, the Republican candidate said, ""know what it is like to have to make tough decisions in a crisis""...The candidate, who was a Baptist minister for 12 years, said he\'s not a career politician financed by corporate donors.""I\'m a guy that got fed up with a system that I saw walking all over people,"" he said. He said he\'s heartbroken by the deep divisions he sees in American politics today, and frustrated by the climate of political correctness. ""We\'re turning this country into a politically correct warehouse of nonsense,"" he said. Huckabee said he wants to impose term limits on members of Congress and federal judges. He said Congress will never do that on its own, so he believes the states should press for a constitutional convention to impose that change. The president, he added, should ignore Supreme Court rulings that are unconstitutional. As an example, he cited the ruling which legalized same-sex marriage. He said if he\'s elected, he\'ll appoint an attorney general who will ""start protecting human life from conception."" The candidate said he supports the Renewable Fuels Standard, which he described as a government mandate that actually worked. He said it helped to drive fuel prices lower and stabilized the farm economy. The Renewable Fuels Standard requires a certain amount of ethanol to be used in the nation\'s gasoline supply..Huckabee won the 2008 Republican caucus and on Saturday he raised the possibility that he\'ll repeat the feat this year. ""There\'s always a surprise on caucus night,"" he said. ""Just go ahead and prepare for another one."" In a brief interview following his speech, Huckabee said national defense, preserving Social Security and taking care of veterans would be his budget priorities.He described his focus on veterans as ""keeping our promise to the people who keep us free.""""Every breath of free air we all take is thanks to them,"" he said. The replacement of the income tax with a nationwide sales tax he calls the fair tax would be one of the major changes all Americans would see during a Huckabee administration, the candidate said.He added that he would secure the nation\'s borders in less than a year.Huckabee also said he would rebuild the nation\'s military. The candidate was joined by his wife, Janet.""Huckabee expecting Iowa caucus voters to shock national media,"" Spencer Daily ReporterDon Andrews, opened with prayer before introducing former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to a group gathered at the Terrazzo Coffeehouse in the Spencer Dream Center Friday morning. The GOP presidential candidate\'s visit kicked off a day of travel as part of his 150-city schedule with the Iowa caucus 10 days away. Huckabee kept the crowd laughing, reminding, ""It\'s so cold ... by Feb. 1, it will probably be colder and there will probably be another foot of snow."" He insisted that regardless of the conditions those who are going to caucus for him need to overcome any of nature\'s obstacles. He also suggested bringing a friend or family member on his behalf.He added, ""If you\'re going to caucus for someone else, remember it\'s going to be very cold, and there could be another foot of snow. You might want to just stay home and watch it on TV."" This marked Huckabee\'s second visit to Spencer during the campaign. The former Arkansas governor was joined by a longtime family friend who has joined Huckabee for these final days on the caucus trail, Debbie Hack, spoke to the audience about her support for Huckabee.""Mike is a leader. He has lead us as a pastor. He lead us as a governor. He doesn\'t lead from behind. ... His wants to be elected, but he wants you to see his heart,"" she said...Hack shared a story about talking to a young woman on the campaign trail yesterday who didn\'t know one person running for president. ""The country is counting on you, get out and caucus,"" she said... ""Shock the media in New York. They think they\'ve got it figured out. It never works out like they tell it. Every four years the people of Iowa vote their conscience,"" he said. ""There has never been a short cut to the Iowa caucus. If this year marks the first time someone can buy the election, it\'s the end of the Iowa caucus."" After doing so well in the 2008 caucus, Huckabee said the country has economic and military issues, but he said an even bigger concern is the moral issue of the ""uncivilized surgery that has become normal in America. In this country we kill 4,000 babies a day. How can we ask for ... or sing \'God Bless America?\'"" From an economic standpoint, he noted, ""That\'s 60 million people who would be in the workforce."" Huckabee fielded a series of questions while sitting on a stool on the coffeehouse stage. Questions covered the Affordable Healthcare Act, Syrian refugees, immigration, medical marijuana and his flat tax plan. The Arkansas native said he would focus health care dollars on a 10-year target to eradicate heart disease, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer\'s with as much dedication as America demonstrated to put the first man on the moon and eliminate polio. ""That\'s not a Democrat or a Republican issue,"" he said. ""There\'s a lot of things we don\'t agree on, but we can agree on this. Let\'s go to work."" Huckabee took time from his campaign topics to recognize the dream center, speaking about his relationship with Rev. Tommy Barnett and Matt Barnett who founded the dream center concept in Los Angeles. ""It was the most amazing place I\'ve ever been,"" he said of the West Coast outreach. ""People who have no hope find there is hope when they get to know the Lord."" ""... And they do it without a dime from the government,"" Huckabee added.Addressing the Spencer Dream Center, the lone site not built in a metropolitan area, ""What a blessing. It gives life. Pray for them. Support them. And be thankful to God they\'re in your community"".""Huckabee: Prove pundits wrong again""WCF Courier...Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee praised Iowans for ignoring the ""talking heads in New York,"" who have already decided the Iowa caucuses before the first vote has been cast. And as the 2008 surprise winner in the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee also urged them to make up their own minds as they have in previous cycles. ""I would love for you to just shove it up the nostrils of the national media on Feb. 1,"" Huckabee told a crowd of about 40 people at Jack & Arnie\'s Steakhouse in Reinbeck on Saturday, earning amens from the audience. ""I like the independent, stubborn streak in Iowa farmers."" Huckabee knows better than most that 10 days before the caucus is plenty of time to make his case to Iowans, and he spent his town hall Saturday showing he\'s got his own independent and stubborn streak. ""If there is any short cut, I\'ve never found it,"" Huckabee told The Courier after the event about winning over Iowans. ""I\'ve always believed that you don\'t win the caucus just by throwing a bunch of New York-raised money at TV and radio ads, that you have to go meet voters."" It\'s a strategy that has worked before, particularly in Grundy County, where Huckabee won all seven precincts eight years ago as part of his 2008 win...Amanda Aswegan, an organizer in Grundy County for Huckabee now and in 2008, said she\'s hoping for a repeat again in 10 days. ""We\'ve seen a lot of repeat support, but we certainly don\'t take it for granted, because there are a lot of candidates running this time,"" Aswegan said. ""It\'s a week out; this is when we\'re starting to be serious about making a decision, so the timing of this event is great."" Huckabee is holding 150 events across the state in the final month before the caucus and has so far completed about 80 of them. Huckabee contrasted himself with the other Republicans running, without naming them, in trying to make his final pitch to voters..He said he is one of ""only about three"" contenders who are not getting their funding from Wall Street and blamed big money influences for why Republicans have seen so few changes even after electing members of their own party. ""I think it\'s time to say that big money in politics has really corrupted our system,"" Huckabee said. ""Folks, there\'s a bunch of politicians that have been bought and paid for by the same check writers."" In answering one of several questions on saving Social Security, Huckabee also criticized the United States senators running for the presidency who he said have neglected doing their jobs. He proposed, to applause, that elected officials should resign their current position before running for the next one. ""It\'s getting out of hand,"" Huckabee said. ""People use their public paycheck so they can go campaign and ask for another job. If somebody wants to be a senator, they\'ve asked for a six-year job; on their sixth minute in office, they turn around and start running for president, I just don\'t think that\'s fair to the taxpayers who sent them."" Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are all first-term senators who are running for the presidency. Donna Cannon of Reinbeck said she likes Huckabee because of his experience and would like him to be, if not the president, the vice president. Cannon said some of the other younger candidates are ""brilliant"" but could use a mentor like Huckabee before they\'re ready for the presidency. ""He\'s got the heart. He\'s really got a good heart,"" Cannon said of Huckabee. ""We need somebody like that.""""Defunding Planned Parenthood not enough, Huckabee says in Cedar Rapids""Cedar Rapids Gazette - Taking a strong stand against abortion, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told the audience Sunday at an Iowa Right to Life event that he isn\'t satisfied with just ending government funding for Planned Parenthood. For more than 40 minuteshe said he\'d put a stop to abortion  contrasting himself with other GOP candidates calling to defund the women\'s health provider. ""If all a candidate can promise is stop funding to Planned Parenthood, that isn\'t enough for me. That\'s low-hanging fruit,"" Huckabee said. ""Let\'s do something bolder than that. Let\'s stop abortion completely."" Iowa Right to Life is the largest organization in the state opposing abortion rights.""I was very pleased with the turnout, and the messages Gov. Huckabee said,"" Executive Director of Iowa Right to Life Jenifer Bowen said. ""It was a great opportunity for the people in the Cedar Rapids area to hear more about Gov. Huckabee\'s pro-life issues. I am very grateful he made the time to speak to our organization."" Huckabee said he is passionate about the issue. ""The question of protecting life transcends any political views I have,"" he said. ""I have been involved in the pro-life movement far before I got into politics""... Giving him hope this time, he said, are the people who can still be persuaded in the week before the caucuses. ""We have been going full throttle, calling supporters and making sure they will come and try to close the sale with as many people they can,"" Huckabee said. ""We all know it\'s a last- minute decision for a lot of people."" The day after Huckabee announced his campaign for presidency in May, he left for Iowa and has spent 65 days in the state, making stops in all 99 counties. ""I have watched and listened to Gov. Huckabee for years. He is the only candidate that is walking the nearest on the path with my Lord,"" Craig Kroupa of Cedar Rapids said'"

Just six days left till the Iowa caucuses and adrenaline at HQ is rising fast. The Gov. had a fantastic performance last night with country-music star Josh Turner here in Des Moines. Despite the arctic blizzard that blew through town, Huckabee supporters from across the state were cutting rug and having a blast! Today, we had great events across the state and a caucus night training session here at HQ. Cable news is wall-to-wall political attack adsalthough I haven\'t seen any anti-Bernie (or pro-Bernie) Sanders ads on Fox. A few minor clips below----""Huckabee jams hits with country star Josh Turner""  The Des Moines Register ... A little snow in central Iowa didn\'t stop Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee from slapping the bass with American country star Josh Turner. ""It\'s an honor to be here in spite of the weather,"" Turner said to the Des Moines crowd as he took the stage. The award-winning singer-songwriter performed six songs at Wooly\'s in the East Village. He warmed the crowd with hit tunes including ""Why Don\'t We Just Dance?,"" ""Your Man"" and ""Everything Is Fine."" Huckabee joined Turner and his accompanying musicians for two tracks, including ""All Over Me."" Turner told the audience he backs Huckabee because he ""cares about people."" ""He\'s about as genuine as the day is long,"" Turner said. ""He cares about each and every one of you. He cares about our nation."" Before busting out the bass, Huckabee addressed the crowd of about 150. He praised the crowd for braving the weather and talked about the importance of caucusing. ""People are tired of seeing this country governed with disregard,"" Huckabee said before introducing Turner. New York-born comedian Jimmy Labriola  best known as Benny from \'90s popular sitcom ""Home Improvement""  opened the evening\'s event with jokes ranging in topic from his Italian father to funerals to Osama bin Laden. ""We can see a license plate from outer space but it took us 10 years to find bin Laden?"" he joked. What brought the comedian to Des Moines for the former governor of Arkansas? ""I totally believe in him,"" Labriola said. ""They don\'t come more real than this guy. This guy believes in what he says."" Turned closed the evening with ""Long Black Train,"" a song off his debut record of the same name. Before digging into the number, he said he wrote the song with ""no commercial ideas of aspiration in mind,"" and that it\'s been ""awfully good"" to him. ... ""He\'s the right man for the job,"" Turner said about Huckabee before closing his set.""Huckabee super-PAC to voters: Get serious""  The Hill ... A super-PAC that supports former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is running a radio ad in Iowa urging Republican voters to ""consider someone serious"" for the White House. The ad criticizes Republican presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and calls Huckabee a conservative with a ""record of achievement and respect for public service."" ""At times, this presidential campaign has been downright hard to watch,"" the ad says. ""It\'s as if Trump and Cruz have completely forgot they\'re running for the highest office in the land, an office held by great men, great Republicans."" The ad, released by Pursuing America\'s Greatness, said Huckabee balanced budgets, cut taxes, fought corruption and created jobs during his time as governor. ""Mike Huckabee is a serious conservative leader and a man of faith we can always trust,"" the ad says. ""Mike Huckabee for president.""Opinion: ""You\'ll Be Shocked Which GOP Candidate This NYT Bestselling Author Likens To Ronald Reagan ... they are master communicators.""  Western Journalism ... A few years ago I wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan. I spent hundreds of hours extensively researching, studying and interviewing people close to President Reagan. Now, I have spent countless hours getting to know, observe and study many of the GOP presidential candidates. And I\'ve been struck by an uncanny likeness between Reagan and Mike Huckabee. Not only are their personalities, styles and temperaments much alike, but they share many of the same principals, beliefs, talents and gifts, on top of having many similar experiences in their lives. I don\'t make these comparisons lightly. Here are some of the reasons why I think they are so similar. The common thread begins in their backgrounds. Reagan and Huckabee successfully held the political office of governor of their state for two terms. Less well known is that before politics, Huckabee, like Reagan, worked in TV and radio. The leadership strength both share is they are master communicators. The main essence of communication is to connect with others, and impart and share information or ideas. Both men share the keen ability to take complex ideas and difficult-to-understand problems and explain them in clear, concise and easy-to-understand ways. ""A leader,"" Huckabee explains, ""is the one who can outline the broad vision and the direction, and say here\'s where we are going to go, here\'s why we need to go there, and here\'s how we are going to get there."" Reagan and Huckabee are deep thinkers, but they both explain things in a very natural and easy-to-understand manner, often using metaphors and analogies. Pundits and journalists make the mistake of assuming them not to be deep thinkers, but this is contrarily so, because it takes a great deal of intelligence and unique ability to take the complex and paint word pictures and stories with examples to help clearly explain a multifaceted situation, or take a gigantic numerical figure and relate it to a common object as a way of explanation. Early on, some intellectuals erroneously assumed the ability to speak clearly and naturally to everyday people, as Reagan did, was the result of simple thinking. However, quite the opposite was true. It takes a very gifted and skilled communicator to achieve this ability. Another huge leadership quality and advantage both share is their optimism, cheerfulness, sense of humor and storytelling. In fact, what might come as a surprise to some is the importance storytelling can play in the lives of extraordinary leaders. Think Lincoln, Churchill and Roosevelt in addition to Reagan. Another shared trait is Reagan\'s and Huckabee\'s sense of humor. Leadership studies have shown it\'s a powerful tool and sign of intelligence. A cleverly placed joke can ease stress, decrease conflict and increases comradery, cohesiveness and bonding in groups. Motivational speaker Mike Kerr says humor can boost morale, motivate people, increases communication and builds trust and relationships. After almost 8 years of Barack Obama, division and strife have grown rampant among Americans. Our nation sorely needs to unite. Reagan was masterful at uniting Americans, as now Huckabee seeks to do. By having a great sense of humor, Reagan and Huckabee found a good way to express something that\'s hard for some people to hear, but softens it while getting the idea or message across without sounding too harsh. Neither Reagan or Huckabee are narcissistic and self-centered, like some politicians. ""Candidates don\'t run for themselves; they run for the future,"" Huckabee said in October. And Reagan had a saying on his desk in the White House that read, ""There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn\'t mind who gets the credit.""""Conservative national groups battle in the states over Constitution redo""  The Center for Public Integrity ... It\'s only a short phrase buried in the U.S. Constitution, but it enables an unprecedented avenue to change the law of the land: If two-thirds of the states demand it, Congress ""shall call a convention"" for proposing constitutional amendments. A hopeless pipe dream? Actually, no; the issue is front and center right now. ... So suddenly such a meeting, not held since the earliest days of this country, is becoming a real possibility. Even GOP presidential candidates are seizing on the burgeoning movement, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.endorsing this unconventional process and rallying their supporters as legislative sessions start up again. While the legislation appears to be a grassroots effort bubbling up from the states, in reality it\'s quite the opposite. National groups have been holding workshops, publishing tips and even crafting model legislation for years to persuade legislators to use their states to circumvent the logjam in Congress.""Mike Huckabee in the news""  Cleveland.com ... Huckabee has been particularly hostile toward Ted Cruz: he clearly thinks Cruz is fundamentally untrustworthy and deceptive, and he would likely support Donald Trump over Cruz: (National Review). Huckabee said... ""I just think it\'s hard to say God is first in your life if he\'s last in your budget,"" Huckabee said in an interview with Buzzfeed. ""If I can\'t trust God with a dime out of each dollar that I earn, then I\'m not sure how I can tell him that I trust him with my whole life."" (Buzzfeed) In a follow-up interview with Fox News\' Bill O\'Reilly, Huckabee said he\'s not sure he\'s been too ""critical"" of Cruz, but he said people who claim to be consistent must act as such. When O\'Reilly asked whether Cruz is being ""phony"" when it comes to Christian charitable giving, Huckabee replied, ""I think it\'s something he needs to answer. What are his parameters of stewardship?"" (The Blaze) ... Huckabee will play bass guitar in Des Moines on Monday alongside country music artist Josh Turner. Actor Jim Labriola, best known for playing donut-loving delivery man Benny Baroni on the 1990s sitcom ""Home Improvement,"" will also join Huckabee on the Iowa campaign trail through the end of the month. (Des Moines Register) Huckabee and Trump bumped into each other in an Iowa hotel hallway last Wednesday, according to a tweet from Huckabee\'s daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Huckabee. ""Only in IA can 2 pres candidates randomly bump into one another in a hotel hallway,"" the tweet read. No word on what the pair talked about: (Des Moines Register).""Mike Huckabee returning to Ames Wednesday""  Iowa State Daily ... Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is planning on a stop in Ames this week during his final tour of the state before the Iowa Caucus. Details about the event, which is free and open to the public, are below: WHO: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, 2016 Republican presidential candidate; WHAT: Huckabee Huddle - Moral Clarity; WHEN: 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 27; WHERE: Jeff\'s Pizza, 2420 Lincoln Way, Ames; RSVP for the event at MikeHuckabee.com. Huckabee was in Ames just before the start of the spring semester, talking to supporters at a town hall at Oakwood Road Church.""Mike Huckabee sticks to his guns in Iowa""  The Guardian ... ""I killed it, whatever it was,"" says Janet Huckabee as she lifts her AR-15 rifle away from the suburban shooting range in Iowa and inspects a shredded paper target. In the neighbouring lane, her husband and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is having less luck. A variety of handguns jam, his safety glasses mist up, and he wants to know why all his shots are pulling to the left. In fairness, both seem more than comfortable with the firearms on offer during what is largely a photo opportunity for journalists... what he likes to hunt: duck, turkey, pheasant, deer and antelope. ""The second amendment is not about hunting though,"" he wants to make clear. ""It has to do with protecting ourselves, our homes, our families and our country from tyranny. Whether it\'s the tyranny of a burglar or the tyranny of a government that wants to take our liberty away."" Just in case Barack Obama\'s recent order to introduce more background checks for those buying firearms is not proof enough of this existential threat, the governor goes on to claim it was a fear of armed American civilians that deterred the Japanese from invading California after the Pearl Harbor attack. ""It might take the sheriff 20 minutes to get to where I live,"" he says, outlining a hypothetical scenario. ""So I would call 911 - I am not just going to be some vigilante - but in those next 20 minutes, I am not sitting around helplessly waiting to be a victim. The reason I call 911 is to tell the sheriff where to come to pick up the carcass of the idiot who tried to break into my home at 2 o\'clock in the morning."" ...This soft-spoken conservative won the Iowa caucus in 2008, with strong backing from the state\'s evangelical faithful, and is making 150 stops in the state this month to try to prove that the opinion polling is wrong this time. ""I know the New York media already decided who is going to win on caucus night,"" Huckabee concludes in his pitch to the small room of supporters. ""They have already got it figured out, but every time we have a caucus here in Iowa, they get it wrong."" It\'s a relatively unsophisticated message, even by the standards of 2016. ""I like Mike,"" reads one poster. Apart from mentioning the second amendment, he speaks only of his plan to abolish income tax...Press adviser Hogan Gidley bristles when the Guardian suggests that the fun of messing about with country stars and shooting ranges might be part of what keeps the campaign going: ""He\'s doing 150 stops. It\'s hard work. This is just a bit of relief.""""Mike Huckabee: \'Sick Day in America When Our Government Punishes Those Who Expose Evil\'""  Breitbart ... GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee slammed Houston prosecutors for indicting the activists who used hidden cameras to record Planned Parenthood officials allegedly attempting to trade body parts from aborted babies. ""Harvesting human organs is beyond barbaric, it\'s unimaginably grotesque and evil,"" Mike Huckabee said. ""And it\'s a sick day in America when our government punishes those who expose evil with a smartphonewhile accommodating those who perform it with a scalpel."" After a two-month-long investigation into Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, the Harris County District Attorney\'s office in Houston, Texas, indicted the two individuals who created the undercover videos. They did not indict Planned Parenthood officials. David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were indicted by a grand jury for ""tampering with a governmental record, a second degree felony."" WMUR reports, ""Daleiden was also indicted on the count of prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs, a class A misdemeanor, according to the Harris County district attorney.""""THE ENDORSEMENTS SCORECARD""  Powerline Blog ... How important are endorsements by office holders when it comes to nominating a presidential candidate? I think the conventional wisdom is that this year, at least on the Republican side, they won\'t count for much. On the other hand, Aaron Bycoffe of FiveThirtyEight cites research showing that in presidential nomination contests between 1980 and 2004, early endorsements by members of the party elites were the most important cause of candidate success in the state primaries and caucuses. Accordingly, FiveThirtyEight is keeping track of endorsements this cycle. Even if dndorsements end up not helping successfully to predict the nominees, the scorecard is fascinating, at least to me. FiveThirtyEight\'s scorecard awards 10 points for endorsements by governors, 5 points for endorsements by U.S. senators, and 1 point for endorsements by U.S. representatives. The winner, as of now, on the Republican side is Jeb Bush with 51 points. He is followed by Marco Rubio (43), Chris Christie (26), Mike Huckabee (26),...Ted Cruz, said to be ""hated"" by his GOP Senate colleagues, hasn\'t picked up any Senate endorsements. ... Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie benefit from home cooking...""Gov. Mike Huckabee Plays Bass Guitar With Country Music Star Josh Turner In Downtown Des Moines""  Breitbart ... DES MOINES, Iowa  With snow blanketing Iowa\'s capitol city outside, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabeea 2016 GOP presidential candidate and the winner of the 2008 Iowa GOP caucusestook the stage with country music star Josh Turner here in Wooly\'s downtown to play bass guitar. Under high ceilings with the rafters showing, the packed downtown honky-tonkdimly lit with hightop tables surrounding a hardwood dance floor, long bar off to the left and higher-top booths lining the right wall  buzzed with Huckabee supporters as they waited for their candidate and Turner to take the stage. Huckabee volunteers passed out campaign stickers and sold bright red #ImWithHuck tee-shirts. ""I want to say thanks to all of you for coming outfor us, this is horrible weather,"" Huckabee told the 150 or so supporters gathered inside Wooly\'s a few blocks from the Iowa State Capitol building while inches of snow piled up outside. ""I know you\'re from Iowa, you\'re saying \'This is great. This is normal.\' Look, a lot of us on this campaign and the campaign staff, we\'re all from the South. I\'ll tell you, our blood is not as thick as yours is and we really admire you guyswe were in Cedar Rapids earlier today and coming to Des Moines tonight it was just like a blinding snowstorm the whole time and I\'m just always amazed. This would have just shut everything down in Arkansasand it wouldn\'t take this much. We\'re always amazed when we hear on the news about people who have heart attacks while they\'re shoveling snow, and we think why would anyone shovel snow? That\'s the problem with yankees: They\'re always out there shoveling snow. We\'re thinking this is dumb because snow will melt except for you it doesn\'t melt for weeks or months, for us it melts tomorrow. It\'s really, I mean, everything closes. The government closes, school closes. Washington, D.C., closed last week for several days."" The crowd cheered. About 150 people came out to Wooly\'s for the Huckabee eventmore than double that had RSVP\'d before the snow started pelting Iowa roadsfor the free concert. When Turner took the stageHuckabee joined him mid-sethe didn\'t say much besides singing. ""I just wanted to say it\'s an honor to be here despite the weather,"" Turner told the crowd. ""We\'re out here at Wooly\'s, we\'re indoors and the heat\'s working so everything\'s fine."" Turner, a conservative Christian, did say why he\'s supporting Huckabee for president. ""He\'s about as genuine as the day is long,"" Turner said. ""He cares about each and every one of you. He cares about our nation."" While on stage, Turner played six songs for the Huckabee team. He kicked it off with""Why Don\'t We Just Dance?,"" then shifted to ""Everything Is Fine"" before turning to ""Would You Go With Me?"" and then ""Your Man."" After that Huckabee joined him on stage to play bass for ""All Over Me"" and ""Long Black Train."" Huckabee was also joined by his wife, former Arkansas First Lady Janet Huckabee. ""I want to thank you all for comingI know the weather was a little less than sunshiny today,"" Janet Huckabee said on stage before comedian Jimmy Labriolawho\'s starred on shows like Home Improvement and in movies like The Santa Clauseperformed to open up the night. When Gov. Huckabee was on stage, the 2008 caucus winner said that he expects to do a lot better than polling currently shows and the media predicts he\'ll do in the caucuses next Monday. ""Folks, we are one week away, one week from tonight the Iowa caucusestonight is sort of a practice for the caucuses,"" Huckabee said. Not that Josh Turner will be at the caucuses singing at all 800 locations and not that Jim Labriola will be there. But I hope you\'ll be there. One of the things, I don\'t know if it ticks you off, but the media from the east coast has already figured out who you\'re going to vote for. They\'ve already told you who you\'re going to vote for. Why is it that every four years they\'re wrong? They have been since Jimmy Carter won the Iowa caucuses all the way back in the 70snobody saw that coming. Time after time after time, the people of Iowa have made up their own minds. Once again, we are believing that something very surprising will happen a week from tonight. The media will once again have it wrong and we are going to have the opportunity to shock the nation and launch from Iowa on to the White House. The crowd cheered again. Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill, who endorsed Huckabee for president and joined his team at Wooly\'s on Monday night, told Breitbart News backstage that he\'s backing Huckabee because he\'s a strong Christian conservative. ""Cindy and Imy wifewe\'ve been very, very fortunate to meet all of the candidates that are running because as part of the SEC primary we\'ve been able to host all of the candidates that come down to Alabama,"" Merrill told Breitbart News. Every time that we met one and we started at the Red State Gathering in Atlanta, and we\'ve had personal interaction time with each one of them, we always found ourselves comparing each one of them to Mike Huckabee. How do we like this guy as compared to Gov. Huckabee? We couldn\'t find anybody that we had more confidence in, had more faith in or believed in stronger than we did in Gov. Huckabee. So we just made a commitment that we were going to offer our support to other candidates as they come to Alabama because of my role but my personal endorsement and personal support has been with Gov. Huckabee. We\'ve made phone calls, visits, we\'ve come to Iowa to campaign with him for this last week. We\'re just honored to be with himbecause what I want in my president is I want a committed conservative Christian who believes that Jesus Christ is the living son of the living God who has Christ as a center point for his life and I want that person to be someone who has proven to me to be a conservative fiscal manager, a conservative moral leader, a conservative leader in our government who is a strong manager and Gov. Huckabee has proven that as a very conservative governor of a Democrat state. Merrill added that he\'s confident Huckabee will do a lot better than the media predictions have him doing. ""So the question comes, why are you helping somebody who can\'t win?"" Merrill said. That\'s what everybody sayswhy are you for Mike Huckabee?and this is what I say \'if everybody who thinks that Mike Huckabee would be a good president supports Mike Huckabee, he\'ll be the next president.\' So for me, not doing it because I didn\'t believe he could make it would mean that I didn\'t believe enough in the future of our government and what I expect the government to be. So I have to be one of those people that steps up and says I support this guy because this guy is the kind of guy we need. Merrill, who\'s been in Iowa with Huckabee for just two days so far, told Breitbart News too that ""there\'s no doubt about it to me"" that the energy for Huckabee ahead of the 2016 caucuses is stronger than what\'s showing up in the mainstream media. He continued, ""So what has to happenthe caucus vote is just like it is on any electionwho gets their people out?"" Merrill said. ""So if we can get our team out to the caucuses on Monday, our team supports our guy, then our guy can finish in the top three. If our guy finishes in the top three, all bets are off. If he makes it to South Carolina, he\'ll win South Carolina. And if he wins South Carolina, he\'ll win the SEC primary. And if he wins the SEC primary, then he\'s on his way to the nomination."" And if that scenario plays out for Huckabee, Merrill notes, ""he\'s the only one that\'s running as a Republican that defeated the Clintons not just once but several times."" As such, that\'s why when Huckabee was on stage, he pushed for his supporters to show up at the caucuses for him since most of the politicians in Washington, D.C., don\'t care about American workers like them. I know there are lots of choices in this election, I get that there are 327 Republicans running nowI would simply say to you in all seriousness, one of the things that I think makes this year\'s voter so angry is that it seems to not matter whether Democrats or Republicans are occupying Washington,"" Huckabee said. ""It\'s the same stuff. Which is always for their best interest and never for yours. Many of you work all day standing on your feet all day working on a concrete floor. You lift heavy things. You sweat to do what you do. Somehow it just seems like to the folks that make the decisions that they end up making decisions that ship your jobs to Mexico or to China or to Indonesia. [They have] no idea how hard you\'re working or what little you have to show for it thanks to policies that have turned into six of the richest counties in America being right around Washington, D.C.""Huckabee announces Wednesday campaign events""  The Des Moines Register ... Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has announced his campaign events for Wednesday. The events, which are free and open to the public, include: Des Moines: 8:30 to 9 a.m., address at the Iowa Pork Producers Association\'s ""Pork Congress Forum,"" Iowa Events Center Hy-Vee Hall, 730 Third St.; Marshalltown: 10:15 to 11:30 a.m., meet and greet, Marshalltown Senior Citizens Center, 20 E. State St.; Ames: 12:30 to 2 p.m., meet and greet, Jeff\'s Pizza Shop, 2402 Lincoln Way.; Boone: 5:30 to 7 p.m., meet and greet, Saints Avenue Caf, 1312 S.Story St.""Huckabee pans power of polls""  The Gazette... the former governor of Arkansas and 2008 Iowa caucuses winner has a point when he argues that polling is becoming too powerful in shaping the presidential campaign, from media coverage to candidate debates. The need for a campaign focused on ideas and issues, Huckabee contends, is being swallowed in a sea of survey-driven spectacle. Huckabee, who met with our editorial board Monday, compared our current politics to people who watch NASCAR races mainly to see spectacular wrecks. ""I\'m really fearful that we\'ve created a situation where people are watching this election cycle for the wrecks, not for the performance of the cars,"" he said. It\'s a vicious vortex of polls, celebrity and TV ratings. Polls are used to limit and position candidates on the main stage at televised debates, where, as he puts it, ""it\'s all about the circus."" Moderators ask questions designed more to spark conflict and stoke ratings than to chart a course for the country. And in this election cycle, candidates who excel at making a spectacle tend to climb in the polls, grab the spotlight and command center stage... ""Well, first I\'m going to come over there and punch you in the nose and get a lot of publicity, and people will love me for that and my poll numbers will go up."" If only Huckabee had done it, he might be a contender. This is, clearly, the polling-est campaign I\'ve ever seen. When the Republican front-runner spends remarkably long stretches of his public bloviations lauding his amazing poll numbers and denigrating polls that don\'t show his lead as adequately yuge, something\'s seriously amiss.""Huckabee to Screen \'God\'s Not Dead 2\' For Voters in Iowa On Eve of Caucuses""  Townhall.com ... Many would argue that Gov. Mike Huckabee\'s (R-AR) strongest issue on the campaign trail is his fight for religious freedom. In his pursuit of defending Americans\' right to worship, the presidential candidate announced Tuesday that he will be showing a screening of the new film God\'s Not Dead 2 this Sunday on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. While the original movie centered on a student\'s courage to stand up to his atheist teacher, the sequel, out April 1, follows a high school teacher who is forced to defend her Christian faith in the courtroom after daring to speak the name Jesus in her classroom. Huckabee makes a cameo in the powerful story. In 2014, God\'s Not Dead stunned the box office by becoming the highest grossing independent faith film of the year, proving audiences were hungry for its message. In a statement, Huckabee explained why he is eager to bring the second installment to Iowa voters: ""The success of GOD\'S NOT DEAD stunned Hollywood, but not the people of middle America,"" Huckabee said. ""On the eve of the Iowa caucuses, this screening will be a great opportunity for people in Iowa to be among the first in the nation to see the film before it gets to theaters and be reminded why this election is so important to preserving religious liberty. Since there is limited seating, we hope people contact us early to be there."" ""Christians across the United States feel like their voice has been taken,"" saysGod\'s Not Dead 2 Director Harold Cronk. His film will answer the question: What is really at risk?""Report: Republican Strategist Henry Barbour Wants Mike Huckabee To Attack Ted Cruz""  Breitbart ... Establishment Republicans and donors are seeking to coalesce around whichever candidate is not Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), according to the New York Times. One influential Republican strategist says he wants to see former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to go after Cruz. ""Whoever is not named Trump and not named Cruz that looks strong out of both Iowa and New Hampshire, we should consolidate around,"" said veteran Republican strategist Henry Barbour.Huckabee: Iowa caucuses\' grassroots impact in danger  Globe Gazette ... ANKENY, Iowa  Mike Huckabee said he fears a poor showing for him in Monday\'s Republican presidential caucuses could portend an end to Iowa\'s first-in-the-nation influence. Huckabee, speaking to reporters Tuesday after giving an address at Faith Baptist Bible College, said the caucuses historically have rewarded candidates who campaign on the ground, visiting as many areas of Iowa as possible and shaking as many Iowans\' hands as possible. Huckabee, who won the 2008 caucuses, has resumed that style of retail politics this year, visiting each of Iowa\'s 99 counties and holding 138 campaign events since April, according to Drake University\'s Iowa Caucus Project... Huckabee said if candidates learn they can win the Iowa caucuses without spending time on the ground here, the presidential nominating process will be dominated by big-money donors, not voters. ""It always has paid off. There\'s never been an Iowa caucus in which people could win (taking) the shortcut. If they can this year, I think it\'s the end of the Iowa caucus as we know it,"" Huckabee said. ""Because if in the future a candidate can go to Wall Street, go to the big banks, raise a bunch of money, come down here and throw some TV ads together, make a few appearances, just enough to say we were here, put a flag down, if they can win that way then why will candidates go and do what I\'ve done, which is to go to all 99 counties and do the grassroots, person-to-person approach? They won\'t."" Huckabee said if presidential candidates learn they can win Iowa without devoting time on the ground, the presidential primary will become a race more about who can garner the most money to spend on advertising. ""It will become a process like any other, and they people will spend their time in New York, California, Texas and Florida getting money. And it\'ll be a shame,"" Huckabee said. ""The real losers are the American people who won\'t have the benefit of somebody filtering these candidates through the questions and the lenses of farmers and housewives and factory workers. Where else in America do candidates have to be held accountable in this kind of setting, face to face? I think that could be a real tragedy for the country."" Unlike other presidential candidates who have spoken here, Huckabee\'s address Tuesday to roughly 200 Faith Baptist Bible College students was more sermon than campaign speech. He challenged students to stand up for Christian values in a world in which he said Christianity is being ""virtually criminalized."" ""If you think the world in which you live is a morally dark world, then all the more reason for you to be the light of the world,"" Huckabee said. ""If you are unwilling to be the light, then darkness will prevail.""Fox NewsJustice With Judge Jeanine...From the campaign trail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Republican Presidential Candidate Governor Mike Huckabee. Good evening, Governor...How\'s it going out there for you? [Huckabee] ""Well, it\'s going great. We\'re in the middle of a 150-event month in January. Just in Iowa.

Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 27, 2016",b'Press Release - Does Iowa Pick Winners Or Losers?',"b'By Pastor Brad Sherman Picking Winners or Losers.Fellow Iowans,I am so tired of hearing certain talking heads recount Iowa\'s history of not picking the candidate that ended up winning. They say things like: ""Iowa picks losers..."" - or - ""Iowa picks corn, not presidents.""God help us if we fall for that mindless drivel based on the faulty premise that winning the election is the end goal. Since when did the ultimate winner of the election serve as proof positive of being ""correct?"" I thought the good of the nation was the end goal. Case and point: Just look at the condition of our nation and we can see that Obama is a loser, even though he won an election.Who ultimately wins the nomination is not proof of who I should have supported. If that was the case, then I should have supported Mit Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008 for the nomination. Well, I did not and I am glad I didn\'t. Neither of those guys represented my values.I\'m not suggesting we always get it right. But I believe we Iowans have a pretty good record of picking winners while the rest of the process goes on to pick a loser to be the nominee? I believe that is exactly what happened in 2008 when Mike Huckabee won the Iowa Caucus and we ended up with John McCain as the nominee. I picked Mike Huckabee in 2008 and I am picking Mike again in 2016. Why? Because I already know he is a winner!To learn more about his campaign and where he stands on the issues click here:http://www.MikeHuckabee.com/IssuesTo help Mike finish strong in the Iowa caucus, please share this message to friends, family and neighbors across Iowa and ask them to learn more about Mike and his campaign for President today!'"
Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 27, 2016","b""Press Release - You'll Be Shocked Which GOP Candidate This NYT Bestselling Author Likens To Ronald Reagan""","b'By Mary Beth Brown A few years ago I wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan. I spent hundreds of hours extensively researching, studying and interviewing people close to President Reagan.Now, I have spent countless hours getting to know, observe and study many of the GOP presidential candidates. And I\'ve been struck by an uncanny likeness between Reagan and Mike Huckabee.Not only are their personalities, styles and temperaments much alike, but they share many of the same principals, beliefs, talents and gifts, on top of having many similar experiences in their lives. I don\'t make these comparisons lightly. Here are some of the reasons why I think they are so similar.The common thread begins in their backgrounds. Reagan and Huckabee successfully held the political office of governor of their state for two terms. Less well known is that before politics, Huckabee, like Reagan, worked in TV and radio.The leadership strength both share is they are master communicators. The main essence of communication is to connect with others, and impart and share information or ideas. Both men share the keen ability to take complex ideas and difficult-to-understand problems and explain them in clear, concise and easy-to-understand ways.""A leader,"" Huckabee explains, ""is the one who can outline the broad vision and the direction, and say here\'s where we are going to go, here\'s why we need to go there, and here\'s how we are going to get there.""Reagan and Huckabee are deep thinkers, but they both explain things in a very natural and easy-to-understand manner, often using metaphors and analogies. Pundits and journalists make the mistake of assuming them not to be deep thinkers, but this is contrarily so, because it takes a great deal of intelligence and unique ability to take the complex and paint word pictures and stories with examples to help clearly explain a multifaceted situation, or take a gigantic numerical figure and relate it to a common object as a way of explanation.Early on, some intellectuals erroneously assumed the ability to speak clearly and naturally to everyday people, as Reagan did, was the result of simple thinking. However, quite the opposite was true. It takes a very gifted and skilled communicator to achieve this ability.Another huge leadership quality and advantage both share is their optimism, cheerfulness, sense of humor and storytelling. In fact, what might come as a surprise to some is the importance storytelling can play in the lives of extraordinary leaders. Think Lincoln, Churchill and Roosevelt in addition to Reagan.Another shared trait is Reagan\'s and Huckabee\'s sense of humor. Leadership studies have shown it\'s a powerful tool and sign of intelligence. A cleverly placed joke can ease stress, decrease conflict and increases comradery, cohesiveness and bonding in groups. Motivational speaker Mike Kerr says humor can boost morale, motivate people, increases communication and builds trust and relationships.After almost 8 years of Barack Obama, division and strife have grown rampant among Americans. Our nation sorely needs to unite. Reagan was masterful at uniting Americans, as now Huckabee seeks to do. By having a great sense of humor, Reagan and Huckabee found a good way to express something that\'s hard for some people to hear, but softens it while getting the idea or message across without sounding too harsh.Neither Reagan or Huckabee are narcissistic and self-centered, like some politicians. ""Candidates don\'t run for themselves; they run for the future,"" Huckabee said in October. And Reagan had a saying on his desk in the White House that read, ""There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn\'t mind who gets the credit.""This column originally ran on WesternJournalism.com.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 29, 2016",b'Press Release - A Closing Argument for Mike Huckabee',"b'By Adam Graham Every politician makes promises, but only a few keep them. If you want to know if you can trust a candidate, examine their character.Too often we\'ve defined character too narrowly as if it were only a question of whether a candidate has been faithful to their spouse and avoided trouble with the law. Yet, our character is built one decision at a time over the course of our lives, and these decisions establish patterns. A wise man has said, ""You make decisions and those decisions turn around and make you.""Each candidate has made decision that show the type of president they would be. When you examine the truly important decisions Mike Huckabee made in his life, you see a man who is well-prepared to be a great leader for our country.When Huckabee became Governor, Arkansas had an onerous car registration process that required many people to take a day off from work to register their cars. Governor Huckabee streamlined the process so people could renew their registrations online. That means nothing to those of us who don\'t live in Arkansas, but that\'s why it matters. When Mike Huckabee became Governor, his goal wasn\'t to grandstand so he could impress future Iowa Caucus voters. Governor Huckabee decided to be a servant to the people of his state rather than using his office as nothing more than a means to climb the political ladder..We need someone who will serve the people of this nation, not just their own agenda. Aren\'t you tired of politicians who look at people suffering, losing their jobs, losing their homes, and say, ""Never let a good crisis go to waste""? That\'s how the Obama Administration made a pork-laden stimulus bill that paid off big contributors as its first major ""accomplishment.""In a similar way, politicians in both parties have refused to secure the border. Instead, they insist Congress pass an amnesty bill that promises to secure the border eventually. Americans are being killed by criminals who entered this country illegally while politicians continue to play games with the lives and safety of the American people.Mike Huckabee believes the safety and security our country isn\'t a bargaining chip, it is the first responsibility of the President of the United States. The President already has the tools to secure the border. Within one year of taking office, Mike Huckabee would get the job done.Our veterans continue to suffer at the hands of the incompetent VA with waiting lists that go on for months, with many veterans dying while waiting for care. The veterans\' problems are barely talked about on the Presidential campaign trail. Why? They may have served our country honorably and been promised care, but they don\'t have $100 million to give to a Super PAC.To Mike Huckabee, their care is a top priority. They\'ve served us and we owe them the best. Using his experience from governing Arkansas and reforming bureaucracy, he\'ll reform the VA and end the crisis of long wait times.As a result of the choice to use his office to serve, Governor Huckabee earned the respect of the people of Arkansas. He won four straight statewide elections, which was unprecedented for a Republican. At the same time, ninety percent of his legislative agenda was enacted including education reform, the first broad-based tax cuts, and a partial birth abortion plan. He did this with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. Many candidates promise to fight for legislation, but Governor Huckabee has a record of actually winning.In 2008, American conservatives panicked in the midst of the financial crisis. It was hard to find a fiscal conservative who believed consistently in small government. Most of Congress believed only big government could save America\'s most powerful corporations from going under. President Bush said at the time, ""I\'ve abandoned free market principles to save the free market.""In contrast, respectfully but forcefully, Mike Huckabee stood against the betrayals of conservative principles that were so readily made during that crisis. Governor Huckabee made a decision to stand for principle rather than to panic. Long before Rick Santelli made his famous rant on CNBC in February 2009 that keyed the start of the Tea Party movement, Governor Huckabee was standing firm against the heavy hand of big government intervention to ""save our economy"" from the free market.It\'s easy to be conservative in good times at a conservative conference or in a town hall meeting. It\'s a crisis that tests your dedication to principle. Presidents are elected for the crisis, and Mike Huckabee has shown he will not lose his head or his principles when times are tough.Governor Huckabee came of age in a time when the South was coming to terms with integration. Mike Huckabee chose time and time again to be a leader in bringing about unity and racial reconciliation. He helped integrate his high school. Then as a young pastor of a small church, he welcomed the church\'s first Black member. When dealing with a few members who didn\'t like it, he said, ""If he goes, I go."" His efforts to serve, reach, and bring healing was reflected in his 1998 re-election bid when he won nearly half of the Black vote in his state.During the last eight years, we\'ve had a President who promised to bring us together, but he has instead torn us apart and stoked the fires of racial hatred and division and set race relations back decades in order to help his political fortunes. Mike Huckabee has had a focus throughout his life and career in bringing healing and reconciliation and as a president will work to heal the damage done by this administration.Governor Huckabee has many great skills that even those who don\'t agree with him recognize. He\'s a great public speaker with an ability to emotionally connect with people, and he has more than a decade of executive experience. If he had a huge campaign budget, he\'d be unstoppable. And he had a chance for that. Three different billionaires offered to support him through their own contributions and through people they could raise money from. But they wanted him to stop talking about the sanctity of human life and the sanctity of marriage. He refused, and the billionaires chose to endorse other candidates.It\'s a decision that shows that, if president, Mike Huckabee will be a leader on the issues of life and marriage. The most powerful tool a President has is the bully pulpit, the ability a President has to use the power of his office to advocate for great values and ideas. Mike Huckabee has shown he would use that power well and faithfully. He has shown the willingness to stand up and advocate for traditional values at locations as unfriendly as the View and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. If you\'re only willing to advocate for traditional values before a friendly audience, that\'s not leadership, it\'s pandering.We can\'t afford another person in the White House whose looking out for the interests of well-connected special interests. We need a President who cannot be bought, whose interest is doing the right thing for the American people rather than big donors who are looking for a big payoff.Many people who had come to him urging him to run and promised to support him didn\'t. They were disappointed by the money he hadn\'t raised, money he could have raised by selling out his principles. The media and the establishment has counted him out. He could have chosen to pack it in, to call it a campaign, and he could have spent two weeks lounging around at his lovely Florida home before restarting his media and public speaking career.Governor Huckabee\'s made of sterner stuff than that. He chose to endure. He didn\'t retire from the race, he hit the ground running with 150 events in the month of January in the freezing weather of Iowa. The political insiders and establishment believe in the power of big money and big endorsements to win the day. He\'s chosen to trust the people of Iowa. He believes on Caucus Night, people will cut through all of the hype and all of the clever packaging. He believes, when people Caucus, they will vote based on hope rather than fear, and they\'ll think who they can trust with the high responsibility of righting our country after the disastrous age of Obama.Some candidates are trusting in massive campaign contributors and a phalanx of well-healed consultants. Governor Huckabee still believes ordinary citizens working hard for what they believe in can do extraordinary things.Ronald Reagan called America ""a shining city on a Hill,"" and it should be our goal to make it that again. In his Farewell Address, he explained what he meant. ""It was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity,"" and it speaks to our highest hopes and aspirations for America. The question Iowa must answer is, ""Who can lead America back to being that sort of city?""Decisions are not only powerful for individuals but parties and states. Eight years ago, the other party held a Caucus and were presented with a lot of promised by a young inexperienced Senator named Barack Obama. He had a big ego and made big promises he couldn\'t keep but managed to inspire a fan base so fanatical it was more suited to Comic Con than in the political life of a free people. The result has been eight of the most divisive and damaging years in American history. They made a decision that has helped to make America into a gloomier, angrier, and less free nation.Now, eight years later, Republicans have a choice, and it will help make the future of our nation. If Iowa decides for Mike Huckabee, it will decide America needs a proven statesman who will lead our country towards liberty, respect for the inherent worth of every person, and the rule of law, and away from the hatred, anger, lawlessness, and division stirred up by power-hungry demagogues over the past eight years.Remember, the decision you make will help make the future of our nation.This column originally posted to the popular Iowa based blog Caffeinated Thoughts.'"

""We are not just hanging on, we are fighting to the end and I want you to believe that there is a real possibility for a stunning upset,"" Huckabee told a gathering of family, friends, elected officials and backers from all over the country who gathered at his headquarters for a final rush of phone calls, door knocking and media interviews aimed at convincing Iowans to support his presidential bid.Huckabee said he isn\'t the only one expecting good things Monday in a state he called ""ground zero"" for his campaign the past month. He noted that Gov. Terry Branstad advised earlier in the week for people to keep their eyes Huckabee as somebody who might post a surprise finish similar to an upset GOP Iowa caucus win he engineered in 2008.""There is nobody who is a more astute observer of Iowa politics,"" said Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor who noted Branstad has never lost an election in Iowa and currently is the longest-serving U.S. governor in history.""We\'re going to prove that he is not only a great politician, but he is a prophet of biblical proportions,"" Huckabee said at the start of his ""super Saturday"" of campaigning activities that included a visit to a shooting range to ""get out a little frustration."" It was his second campaign stop at the Johnston gun shop.Huckabee has been ""all in"" in Iowa, where he has visited all 99 counties -- some more than once -- after he began the final month of campaigning leading up to the Feb. 1 caucuses with the expectation he would have to end among Iowa\'s top three finishers to stay in the race for the 2016 GOP nomination..""Folks, we\'ve got a lot of work to do, a short time to do it,"" he told his supporters Saturday, ""let\'s shock the world on Monday night. Let\'s come out with a big surprise victory."".Huckabee later told reporters he has to be ""up in the top of the cluster"" but he said expectations are ""sky high"" for some of the other GOP frontrunners, which may make them more vulnerable in Monday\'s caucus outcome..""If they don\'t end up winning, people are going to say \'maybe there was just more air that there was juice,\' so that\'s an issue for them,"" he said..""For me, we\'ve got to exceed the expectations. I think we have a real opportunity to be a contender on Monday night. We could win. It\'s not inconceivable at all that a person that nobody is picking to be in the top two or three ends up winning the Iowa caucuses,"" he added. ""We\'ve put most of our resources and investments here in Iowa. I believe we have a shot to pull this off.""""Huckabee note to daughter draws tears"", Des Moines Register...Mike Huckabee brought tears to the eyes of his daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday with a note he penned on a paper shooting target. ""To Sarah  my little girl  and always a straight shooter  she hits the bullseye of her Daddy\'s heart!"" Sanders, who is her father\'s campaign manager, wiped tears from eyes as she read the note. ""I didn\'t expect to come to the shooting range and cry,"" she said to no one in particular. Huckabee, his wife Janet, and about a dozen campaign staffers and friends spent about 45 minutes Saturday afternoon shooting targets at CrossRoads Shooting Sports in Johnston. The range has been a popular place for Republican presidential candidates to visit.Huckabee: \'The people of Iowa know me\' Des Moines Register...While many candidates running for president crisscrossed Iowa Saturday, Mike Huckabee met with volunteers, did media interviews and spent more than an hour at a Johnston shooting range.""We\'ve already been to the far corners of the state and to every county,"" Huckabee told The Des Moines Register Saturday afternoon. The media interviews will ""reach more people than we would have reached if we had gone back to places we were two weeks ago."" Huckabee has spent 73 days in Iowa since May when he announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The former Arkansas governor on the 2008 Iowa caucuses, garnering nearly 41,000 votes, the most ever for a Republican. Huckabee has been back to the state every year since 2008, he said. ""The people of Iowa know me  I\'ve kept coming back here and I\'ve been in their homes on weekends,"" said Huckabee, who for several years hosted a show on Fox News. ""They don\'t know some of these other guys ... and they\'re starting to have questions."" Huckabee on Sunday afternoon will host a town hall gathering with Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley; Sunday evening the campaign is hosting an exclusive showing of the yet-to-be released moving ""God is Not Dead 2."" Demand for the free tickets prompted the campaign to rent a second theater, Huckabee said.Earlier Saturday, Huckabee meet with campaign volunteers, several from out of state. One was Gil Buenrostro, who vowed in 2008 to do whatever he could to help Huckabee become president if he ever ran again for the office Buenrostro has a wedge-shaped red, white and blue vinyl banner that reads ""Mike Huckabee For President 2016"" on the top of his green-gray Volkswagon Passat. Buenrostro, of Clearwater, Fla., has been driving around the country with the nearly 3-foot tall sign on his vehicle since spring...He estimates he\'s put about 30,000 miles on his Passat, which is missing the ""A"" and ""T"" from the vehicle name above the rear bumper. On Saturday, Buenrostro and his wife Jeanette were at Huckabee\'s Iowa headquarters in Urbandale.""People stop us a lot,"" Buenrostro said. ""I hardly ever find anyone who doesn\'t like the governor. So when the media says he\'s not on top, I find it hard to believe.""...""One of the things I always remind people  at least the East Coast media  is that people never pick exactly what is going to happen,"" Huckabee told supporters. ""They get it wrong every four years. And folks, we are not just hanging on, we\'re fighting to the end..""I want you to believe there is a real possibility for a stunning upset and it\'s just not me saying that. Gov. Terry Branstad said the person who might surprise people is Mike Huckabee,"" the candidate said as the room erupted in applause and whistles.Huckabee Keeps the Faith as Iowa Caucuses NearTime Magazine.Mike Huckabee may be feeling like a zombie, but he\'s still got some fight left in him. At least that was the message from the former Arkansas Governor during a meeting with supporters Saturday morning at his campaign headquarters in Urbandale, Iowa...Huckabee began the day with a story, with his three-year-old granddaughter clinging to his side in an oversized campaign T-shirt...""Thursday night we were up very late because we had a lot of late interviews after the debate and then the veterans rally, and got about three hours of sleep yesterday,"" he said. ""But we had appearances all day long, and by the end of the day the three guys traveling with me we were all like zombies by about 5 o clock.  By the time we started wrapping things up, it was truly we were thinking we should inject high-octane coffee in our veins. And it was the night that we had committed that we would keep our granddaughter Scarlett. So we took her to dinner late last night and then we took her home, thinking that she was as tired as we were. Wrong.""..The crowd chuckled and Huckabee wound up for his punchline: ""Finally, she was sleepy,"" he said. ""And by then, we were dead."".But exhausted as he is, Huckabee maintains a relentless optimism about his prospects Monday night, at least in front of volunteers and members of the media. ""People never pick exactly what\'s going to happen,"" he said of Iowa polls. ""They get it wrong every four years. And folks, we are not just hanging on, we are fighting to the end. And I want you to believe that there is a real possibility for a stunning upset."".Huckabee supporters and strategists alike seem to share his vision. Linda Bauer-Lohmeier was sitting eagerly in the front row, and could barely contain her excitement when Huckabee walked in. She sprang up to hug him and as he walked away she said, almost to herself, ""He\'s my rock star.""...Bauer-Lohmeier, 59, grew up in Arkansas and now lives in Peoria. She said she used to schedule her evenings so she could be home to see Huckabee on Fox, and that she supported him in 2008, as well.""I think [Huckabee] hasn\'t gotten as much publicity, but things like this help a lot. I\'m expecting him to do well. He did well last time, and I think people will get wise and realize we need a strong person that\'s not a show person."" Pat Harris, 62, is another die-hard Huckabee fan who was with him on the trail in 2008. But her loyalty runs even deeper: she\'s also his sister. ""At this point, familiar,"" she joked, when asked what it\'s like having a sibling run for president...""Everybody loves him. I think they\'re just so confused because there are so many candidates,"" Harris said of what she\'s seen in Iowa this year..As for why her brother isn\'t getting nearly the traction in the state that he did in 2008, she said, ""I don\'t know. And that\'s honest. I don\'t get it. Because I can\'t find anybody that\'ll step up and say, Here\'s what\'s wrong with your brother. And people that don\'t know that I\'m kin, or they do or whatever, they\'ll all say, Well I really like the Huckabee guy. Well are you going to caucus for him? Well I don\'t know,"" she said, imitating conversations she\'s had with voters.Still, she\'s hopeful about Monday night. ""They don\'t know who they\'re going to be for,"" she said of Iowans. ""So they may be for him.""FANTASTIC Debate Answer=> Poverty: ""I know a little bit about poverty. My sister is here tonight. Both of us can tell you we both did not grow up rich. My mother grew up in a housethe oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn\'t have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, \'Oh, people are poor because they want to be.\' No, they are not. Nobody wants be poor. And that\'s a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don\'t know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn\'t push them back in the hole."" => Iowa Manufacturing: ""The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built...There was a guy in my forum that day who lost his job.Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that, care about a guy like that?...People who live in bubbles of the New York world of high finance, the government world of Washington, and the entertainment world of Hollywood don\'t have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day."" => Hello Iowa: ""This week there was a little dust-up about a video we put together with music of Adele. So I thought it would be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, \'Hello, Iowa. It\'s me!\' You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucuses eight years ago. I think you did it because you trusted me. You believed that I had your best interest at heart. When I was governor, I had a plaque in my office. And it said this, \'Come. Let us reason together.\' I believe the next president needs to put that plaque in the Oval Office. And needs to lead this country by saying, \'Come. Let us reason together.\'""Parkersburg mayor backs Huckabee""  Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier ... PARKERSBURG, Iowa - Parkersburg Mayor Perry Bernard announced Thursday he is endorsing Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. ""It\'s time for our country to restore the United States and reject the divided states we have been moving towards,"" Bernard said in a statement. ""America needs Gov. Huckabee\'s moral clarity, executive leadership and conviction in the White House."" Bernard continued that he shares the same values as Huckabee, and uses them to run the community of Parkersburg. ""As president, I\'ll lead America with conviction, common-sense and moral clarity, and I\'m excited to have Mayor Perry Bernard\'s support in our final push before the Iowa caucuses,"" Huckabee said in a statement. Huckabee is a former governor of Arkansas and was the 2008 winner of the Iowa caucuses.Iowa Gazette ""Mike Huckabee is good for country\'s future"" ""Apparently, many Iowans have not decided who to vote for. Perhaps, it\'s because they haven\'t settled on the most important criteria for making a choiceI believe character and experience are critically important qualifications for the person we elect for the president of the United States. So, we should be asking ourselves: Which candidate can we trust and who has the integrity, values and experience needed to make wise decisions?.As governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee cut taxes, balanced the budget, increased family income, fought for life, family, marriage and religious liberty; and he defeated the Clinton machine. As president, he will work to rebuild U.S. military superiority, restore our country\'s role as leader of the free world and defeat the evil forces of radical Islam. He will pass a FairTax and abolish the IRS (an annual cost to the taxpayers of $431 billion). He will protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And, he will defend the Second Amendment, oppose new gun control laws and protect the rights of gun owners. He says, ""This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because a drunken driver kills someone."" He opposes amnesty for immigrants here illegally and supports securing the border. He supports traditional marriage, parental rights, rights of unborn children and home schooling. He\'s a great communicator; he says what he means and he means what he says. Let\'s assure our county\'s future by supporting Huckabee for president. -Gary Fischer, Iowa City""""Huckabee: Cruz is a chronic flip-flopper who can\'t be trusted""  CNN ... Washington (CNN) -Mike Huckabee painted Ted Cruz as a non-stop flip-flopper Friday, saying that raised questions about whether the Texas Republican can be trusted. ""Ted Cruz has changed his positions on ethanol, immigration, H-1B visas. He\'s changed it on whether marriage is a state or a federal issue. He\'s changed it on whether he\'s going to be a real champion for religious liberty or whether that\'s going to be way down the road and it\'s not important,"" Huckabee told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""I think it\'s pretty clear while Ted Cruz has questioned the integrity of a lot of different candidates on that stage, if you look at how many different things, including trade -- he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying it was the greatest thing since toothpaste, then he came out when the political wind shifted and said he was against it."" ... Huckabee, who has repeatedly accused Cruz of offering varying stances on issues to different audiences, said that when a candidate shifts positions so frequently it raises an issue of whether voters can trust that person. ""When people change their views depending on geography of where they happen to be, if they say one thing in Manhattan and another thing in Marshalltown, Iowa, that\'s when you start wondering whether you can trust them,"" Huckabee said on ""New Day."" ""When a person changes views time after time and is always moving with the political wind vane, when a person is a thermometer instead of a thermostat, that person is not a leader and, no, you cannot trust them.""""Huckabee, Santorum Unite With Donald Trump at Iowa Fundraiser Raising $6M for Veterans""  CP Politics ... In a rare show of solidarity Donald Trump\'s Republican presidential rivals Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum joined the billionaire frontrunner Thursday night at a benefit event for veterans in Iowa, which raised some $6 million for several veteran organizations. ""Rick Santorum, Donald Trump and I may be competitors in a presidential race, but tonight, we are colleagues in unison, standing here for the people who let us breathe every breath of free air that we breathe,"" said Huckabee after Trump invited him to speak at the podium..""It says something about him that he would bring us here to his own event because bigger than even the election is the fact that we wouldn\'t have free elections in this country if it weren\'t for the people who stood between bullets, bombs, and our freedom,"" said Huckabee who told Trump ""thank you"" for the invitation. ""I want to say how grateful I am to Donald Trump for inviting us here because the easy thing for him to do is to simply ignore that anybody else cares about veterans and he is not that kind of person..""Huckabee looks for Iowa revival""  ArkansasOnline ... URBANDALE, Iowa - Trailing badly in all of the polls, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is counting on friends from Arkansas and voters in Iowa to help him shock the pollsters and keep his presidential hopes alive. Borrowing a racetrack analogy, he says it\'s possible the front-runners will hit a wall or blow a tire before reaching Monday\'s finish line. Thursday, Arkansas Treasurer Dennis Milligan and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge arrived at Huckabee 2016 headquarters in Urbandale, Iowa, and prepared to join the final push. They were joined by former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Home Improvement actor Jimmy Labriola and a host of Huckabee\'s relatives. ""This is the insane part of the Iowa caucus as we get to the funnel,"" Huckabee said before exiting the office Thursday afternoon. ""Every four years, nobody really knows what\'s going to happen until it happens."" Unlike eight years ago, when he won the Iowa caucuses, this time there aren\'t hordes of reporters trailing Huckabee wherever he goes. Right now, he concedes, the throngs are chasing New York billionaire Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, focusing on that increasingly heated rivalry. ""There\'s a focus on that battle that is unquestionable, but there\'s also the possibility that people will say, \'I\'m tired of that.\' That\'s our strategy. In a NASCAR race, if you\'re driving around the track and there\'s some folks in front of you and they have a car wreck, you can go get the checkered flag,"" Huckabee said. Finishing first isn\'t essential, he suggested. ""There are some of us that need to exceed the expectations, which for me, right now, are not high,"" he said. ""There are others, for example, Cruz. If he doesn\'t win here, then this inevitability stuff is gone and I think he has as much to lose here as we do here."" Campaign staff members say they\'re reaching out to undecided voters and that there are positive signs as the vote nears. ""The last couple of days on the ground, we\'ve seen more people coming to our events. I\'d say the volume has been turned up a little bit. You can tell people are starting to make some decisions,"" said campaign senior adviser Chip Saltsman. There\'s ground to make up between now and Monday. ""Look, we know where we are in the world. We\'re not the front-runner right now. We know we\'ve got to close like a freight train, but the good news is there\'s been a lot of people in Iowa that\'s voted for him before and they know who he is,"" Saltsman said. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor\'s daughter and his campaign manager, said he needs ""a strong showing,"" adding, ""We need to beat expectations and I think we\'ll do it."" It\'s a good sign, she said, that so many volunteers are showing up at Huckabee headquarters. Thursday, dozens of supporters traveled to the site, sandwiched between Midwest Mattress and Hungry Boyz restaurant, in strip-mall country 10 miles northwest of Des Moines. As others loaded up on a free barbecue luncheon, Labriola, the actor and comedian, earnestly praised his friend from Arkansas. The TV star appeared on Huckabee\'s TV show a few years ago; he says they quickly became pals. ""What I love about him is the realness. What you see is what you get and, obviously, he has a great sense of humor or I couldn\'t hang with him, no matter who he was,"" the New York native said. ""I really believe he could be the Reagan of our time, what we really need. So I\'m willing to do whatever I can."" Huckabee\'s Arkansas allies said they\'ll also do anything they can to help. ""If it means sweeping the floor, I\'ll be jumping in sweeping the floors,"" Milligan said. ""Mike\'s been a great leader for Arkansas, a great influence on me and we\'re just proud to be up here helping him out any way that we possibly can. He\'s demonstrated a great ability to be able to lead our state and I have no doubt in my mind he\'s very capable of leading our country."" Although Huckabee later joked about getting a broom for Milligan, campaign officials said Milligan\'s primary task, at least Monday evening, would be to speak on the candidate\'s behalf at one of the caucus sites. Thursday, Milligan and Rutledge had tickets to the night\'s Republican debates and were scheduled to appear and praise Huckabee\'s performance later in the evening. Officials have printed ""talking points"" to help Huckabee surrogates make their case in the coming days, but Rutledge didn\'t refer to them as she praised Hope\'s most famous Republican earlier in the day. ""Gov. Huckabee\'s experience. No one can match it,"" she said, praising Huckabee\'s decade of leadership and his ability to work with Democrats as well as Republicans. ""That\'s what Americans are fed up with right now. They\'re fed up with government not working and the divisiveness that we see in Washington and he has a proven record of reaching across the aisle, working with people to get things done. ... He did amazing work in Arkansas and he needs the opportunity to do that across America."" In addition to Arkansas elected officials, Huckabee family members also have been deployed and will speak on his behalf at caucus gatherings Monday evening. The ex-governor\'s sister, Pat Harris of Bryant, said she\'s been told she can stray from the talking points, because ""they\'d rather we speak from our hearts."" The retired schoolteacher gave a similar speech here in 2008, the night Huckabee claimed victory. Asked how her brother will do this time, Harris said ""I truly have no idea. We\'re more about miracles than math, so we\'ll just have to see. All you can do is do your best, keep a happy face and keep rolling.""""Overwhelming Response to Huckabee\'s \'God\'s Not Dead\' Screening in Iowa Leads to Second Showing""  TownHall.com ... Religious freedom has proven to be a popular concept in Iowa. Not long after Mike Huckabee\'s presidential campaign announced they would be offering a pre-release screening of the film ""God\'s Not Dead 2"" for Iowans on the eve of the caucuses, they find themselves having to offer a second screening to meet the overwhelming demand. Tickets sold out within just 24 hours. The sequel to ""God\'s Not Dead"" tells the story of a history teacher, Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart), who is punished for answering a student\'s question about Jesus. Because she spoke about Him in the classroom, she was forced to the courtroom. Huckabee, who makes a cameo in the film, said the story is a good reminder why this year\'s election is so important to ""preserving religious liberty."" Producer and Pure Flix Entertainment founding partner Michael Scott echoed Huckabee\'s comments, insisting the film offers a ""critical"" message for today\'s culture: ""Cases like these - where the religious freedoms of everyday men and women are being restricted by courts and government agencies - are sadly quite common today,"" explained Scott. ""Our hope is that we can start a conversation in the country with this movie about how critical the right to believe, and to talk about that belief in public, is to our nation."" Check out this exclusive clip from the film, in which Grace\'s lawyer Tom Endler, played by Jesse Metcalfe, boldly asks the principal if Christians are excluded from the ""tolerance"" her school supposedly preaches. It\'s encouraging that so many people are excited to see a film that teaches how important it is to stand up for one\'s faith. Seats are limited. To sign up for the screening, participants are encouraged to visit MikeHuckabee.com/godsnotdead.""SD Senator Mike Rounds Sticking by Mike Huckabee for President""  WNAX Radio 570 ...South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds is sticking with [Mike Huckabee] ...

Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee spent much of Friday morning making the rounds to the morning cable news shows that have set up temporary sets around downtown Des Moines.

GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who dropped in at Donald Trump\'s veterans\' fundraiser."" ""Many [of them] are getting gut punched every day by a system who does not want to give them what they not only deserve, but what they desperately need,"" the former Arkansas governor told CNN\'s ""New Day"" program. ""None of us want to see a suicide rate of 22 a day, which is just disgraceful in this country."" Huckabee said he doesn\'t understand skeptics who are saying that real policy reform, not special events to use veterans for political reasons, should be the focus. ""Last night over $6 million was raised for veterans groups  $6 million towards helping these people,"" Huckabee said. ""The truth is there shouldn\'t have to be any outside veterans groups to help veterans. There shouldn\'t be any. That is a responsibility of the United States of America. ""They should be getting the first fruits of our treasury. Everyone else ought to wait in line until the veterans gets served and then everyone else lines up behind them. That\'s not how it is happening. People are waiting three months, six months to get treated."" Trump chose not to come to the debate because of his disagreement with Fox News\' refusal to remove Megyn Kelly as a moderator, but Huckabee pointed out he showed up and he doesn\'t ""have a beef"" with the network, where he had his own show for six and a half years. ""They don\'t treat me any way special because I was there,"" he said. ""Sometimes I feel like they go out of their way making sure I don\'t get special treatment . . . I offered to take [Trump\'s] podium last night, which I think they should have let me do. Unfortunately, that didn\'t go over very well."".Meanwhile, Huckabee told MSNBC\'s ""Morning Joe"" program that he disagrees with offers from Ted Cruz\' super PACs and Carly Fiorina to give veterans\' causes millions in exchange for one-on-one debates with Trump. ""If it\'s conditioned upon a debate then is it about the veterans or is it about them getting a debate?"" he said. ""I went and I got nothing out of it other than just to go and I got  by a lot of people  criticized for showing up at some other candidate\'s event. ""I\'m sure that there will be people who say I shouldn\'t have. In fact, even on my own Facebook page I had criticism from some of my own supporters. But you know what? I didn\'t ask for anything other than he\'s going to do a salute to the vets.""The Hill ... Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee says primary rival Ted Cruz cannot be trusted to be a conservative leader in the White House, accusing the Texas senator of flip-flopping on several issues. ""Ted Cruz has changed his positions on ethanol, immigration, H-1B visas,"" Huckabee said Friday on CNN\'s ""New Day."" ""He\'s changed it on whether marriage is a state or a federal issue. He\'s changed it on whether he\'s going to be a real champion for religious liberty or whether that\'s going to be way down the road and it\'s not important,"" he added. The former Arkansas governor said voters shouldn\'t trust candidates who repeatedly change their stances based on what\'s popular.He had previously accused Cruz of hypocrisy for campaigning at the New York penthouse of two gay businessmen, despite his staunch opposition to gay marriage. ""When people change their views depending on geography of where they happen to be, if they say one thing in Manhattan and another thing in Marshalltown, Iowa, that\'s when you start wondering whether you can trust them,"" Huckabee said Friday. After the GOP primary undercard debate on Thursday night, Huckabee attended an event hosted by Republican primary front-runner Donald Trump.""A Closing Argument for Mike Huckabee""  Caffeinated Thoughts ... Too often we\'ve defined character too narrowly as if it were only a question of whether a candidate has been faithful to their spouse and avoided trouble with the law. Yet, our character is built one decision at a time over the course of our lives, and these decisions establish patterns. A wise man has said, ""You make decisions and those decisions turn around and make you."" ...Governor Huckabee decided to be a servant to the people of his state rather than using his office as nothing more than a means to climb the political ladder. We need someone who will serve the people of this nation, not just their own agenda. Aren\'t you tired of politicians who look at people suffering, losing their jobs, losing their homes, and say, ""Never let a good crisis go to waste""? That\'s how the Obama Administration made a pork-laden stimulus bill that paid off big contributors as its first major ""accomplishment."" In a similar way, politicians in both parties have refused to secure the border. Instead, they insist Congress pass an amnesty bill that promises to secure the border eventually. Americans are being killed by criminals who entered this country illegally while politicians continue to play games with the lives and safety of the American people. Mike Huckabee believes the safety and security our country isn\'t a bargaining chip, it is the first responsibility of the President of the United States. The President already has the tools to secure the border. Within one year of taking office, Mike Huckabee would get the job done. Our veterans continue to suffer at the hands of the incompetent VA with waiting lists that go on for months, with many veterans dying while waiting for care. The veterans\' problems are barely talked about on the Presidential campaign trail. Why? They may have served our country honorably and been promised care, but they don\'t have $100 million to give to a Super PAC. To Mike Huckabee, their care is a top priority. They\'ve served us and we owe them the best. Using his experience from governing Arkansas and reforming bureaucracy, he\'ll reform the VA and end the crisis of long wait times. As a result of the choice to use his office to serve, Governor Huckabee earned the respect of the people of Arkansas. He won four straight statewide elections, which was unprecedented for a Republican. At the same time, ninety percent of his legislative agenda was enacted including education reform, the first broad-based tax cuts, and a partial birth abortion plan. He did this with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. Many candidates promise to fight for legislation, but Governor Huckabee has a record of actually winning. In 2008, American conservatives panicked in the midst of the financial crisis. It was hard to find a fiscal conservative who believed consistently in small government. Most of Congress believed only big government could save America\'s most powerful corporations from going under. President Bush said at the time, ""I\'ve abandoned free market principles to save the free market."" In contrast, respectfully but forcefully, Mike Huckabee stood against the betrayals of conservative principles that were so readily made during that crisis. Governor Huckabee made a decision to stand for principle rather than to panic. Long before Rick Santelli made his famous rant on CNBC in February 2009 that keyed the start of the Tea Party movement, Governor Huckabee was standing firm against the heavy hand of big government intervention to ""save our economy"" from the free market. It\'s easy to be conservative in good times at a conservative conference or in a town hall meeting. It\'s a crisis that tests your dedication to principle. Presidents are elected for the crisis, and Mike Huckabee has shown he will not lose his head or his principles when times are tough. Governor Huckabee came of age in a time when the South was coming to terms with integration. Mike Huckabee chose time and time again to be a leader in bringing about unity and racial reconciliation. He helped integrate his high school. Then as a young pastor of a small church, he welcomed the church\'s first Black member. When dealing with a few members who didn\'t like it, he said, ""If he goes, I go."" His efforts to serve, reach, and bring healing was reflected in his 1998 re-election bid when he won nearly half of the Black vote in his state. During the last eight years, we\'ve had a President who promised to bring us together, but he has instead torn us apart and stoked the fires of racial hatred and division and set race relations back decades in order to help his political fortunes. Mike Huckabee has had a focus throughout his life and career in bringing healing and reconciliation and as a president will work to heal the damage done by this administration. Governor Huckabee has many great skills that even those who don\'t agree with him recognize. He\'s a great public speaker with an ability to emotionally connect with people, and he has more than a decade of executive experience. If he had a huge campaign budget, he\'d be unstoppable. And he had a chance for that. Three different billionaires offered to support him through their own contributions and through people they could raise money from. But they wanted him to stop talking about the sanctity of human life and the sanctity of marriage. He refused, and the billionaires chose to endorse other candidates. It\'s a decision that shows that, if president, Mike Huckabee will be a leader on the issues of life and marriage. The most powerful tool a President has is the bully pulpit, the ability a President has to use the power of his office to advocate for great values and ideas. Mike Huckabee has shown he would use that power well and faithfully. He has shown the willingness to stand up and advocate for traditional values at locations as unfriendly as the View and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. If you\'re only willing to advocate for traditional values before a friendly audience, that\'s not leadership, it\'s pandering. We can\'t afford another person in the White House whose looking out for the interests of well-connected special interests. We need a President who cannot be bought, whose interest is doing the right thing for the American people rather than big donors who are looking for a big payoff. Many people who had come to him urging him to run and promised to support him didn\'t. They were disappointed by the money he hadn\'t raised, money he could have raised by selling out his principles. The media and the establishment has counted him out. He could have chosen to pack it in, to call it a campaign, and he could have spent two weeks lounging around at his lovely Florida home before restarting his media and public speaking career. Governor Huckabee\'s made of sterner stuff than that. He chose to endure. He didn\'t retire from the race, he hit the ground running with 150 events in the month of January in the freezing weather of Iowa. The political insiders and establishment believe in the power of big money and big endorsements to win the day. He\'s chosen to trust the people of Iowa. He believes on Caucus Night, people will cut through all of the hype and all of the clever packaging. He believes, when people Caucus, they will vote based on hope rather than fear, and they\'ll think who they can trust with the high responsibility of righting our country after the disastrous age of Obama. Some candidates are trusting in massive campaign contributors and a phalanx of well-healed consultants. Governor Huckabee still believes ordinary citizens working hard for what they believe in can do extraordinary things. Ronald Reagan called America ""a shining city on a Hill,"" and it should be our goal to make it that again. In his Farewell Address, he explained what he meant. ""It was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity,"" and it speaks to our highest hopes and aspirations for America. The question Iowa must answer is, ""Who can lead America back to being that sort of city?"" Decisions are not only powerful for individuals but parties and states. Eight years ago, the other party held a Caucus and were presented with a lot of promised by a young inexperienced Senator named Barack Obama. He had a big ego and made big promises he couldn\'t keep but managed to inspire a fan base so fanatical it was more suited to Comic Con than in the political life of a free people. The result has been eight of the most divisive and damaging years in American history. They made a decision that has helped to make America into a gloomier, angrier, and less free nation. Now, eight years later, Republicans have a choice, and it will help make the future of our nation. If Iowa decides for Mike Huckabee, it will decide America needs a proven statesman who will lead our country towards liberty, respect for the inherent worth of every person, and the rule of law1, and away from the hatred, anger, lawlessness, and division stirred up by power-hungry demagogues over the past eight years. Remember, the decision you make will help make the future of our nation.'"
Mike Huckabee,R,p,"January 31, 2016",b'Press Release - Chuck Norris: This Man Should Be Our Next President',"b'By Chuck Norris This man should be the next U.S. presidentBy Chuck NorrisFirst of all, the next president of the United States should not be Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Hillary will send us down the same path of destruction as Obama, and Bernie will send us down an even worse path - if worse is even possible!Every adult American needs to see the movie ""13 Hours,"" then ask yourself: ""Where was Hillary during the Benghazi attacks and does her type of AWOL leadership demonstrate what we need as commander in chief, especially with ISIS and al-Nusra on the hunt for Americans here and abroad?""To me, any one of the GOP candidates would make a good president. Some of them could even be great. All of them would be far superior to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.Of course, my personal favorite is Mike Huckabee. Most know my wife, Gena, and I were on the campaign trail with Mike for five months in 2008. During that time, we clearly saw his vision and concern for our country as well as his executive experience to unite and lead our country forward. Mike had, and continues to have, a message that resonates with the American people and is a man of great authentic character.Chuck Norris provides real solutions to our county\'s problems and a way to reawaken the American dream in his best-seller, ""Black Belt Patriotism.""Mike\'s qualifications include:He has supreme executive leadership experience as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007.He has already run against the Clinton machine multiple times throughout his years as governor of Arkansas.He is pro-Israel, pro-military and knows the Middle East better than any candidate.He has already won the Iowa caucus (2008).He\'s been fighting conservative causes his entire adult life. The 22 conservative leaders cited in the National Review could never make a case against Huckabee as a principled consistent conservative.He\'s rallied millions of citizens for years behind various fights for freedom, family and faith via his Fox News ""Huckabee"" show.In 2008, very few people knew who Mike Huckabee was, but because of the ""Huckabee"" show, over the last six years Mike has become very well known and has his own notoriety to draw crowds to hear his message.What most people seem to have forgotten is that Mike came in second place behind John McCain in the 2008 GOP primaries. In fact, when the totals came in, Mike had ""more than 20 percent of all the votes cast nationwide."" He not only won Iowa, but swept many of the southern states on Super Tuesday.I believe Mike would have won the nomination if Sen. Fred Thompson had not jumped in the race at the last minute to siphon off votes in South Carolina. It appeared to be a strategy implemented by the GOP establishment.Historian Dr. Timothy Stanley agreed. He cited Aaron Blake from the Washington Post, who explained how Huckabee ""had a tremendous potential that went unrealized in \'08. Huckabee quit early due to a shortage of cash, so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states. Moreover, his early performances were hindered by the candidacy of Fred Thompson - a dour, sour old stick who only seemed to be in the race to hurt Huckabee. It\'s fair to say that Thompson denied Huckabee a win in South Carolina and thus the momentum he needed to go the distance.""And to the person who might say, ""But Mike is presently trailing in the polls,"" I\'d ask: ""Since when have polls hijacked the American voter before he or she even votes?""Just because the media have tried to narrow down the choices doesn\'t mean the voters have to. We all want to be on a winning team, but we should never hand over our convictions and votes because media or pundits tell us there are only two or three viable candidates.Mike may not be the ""flavor of the day"" to the temperamental media or cause a media frenzy like certain candidates do. However, highlighting hype is no substitute for substance, and substance is what we need more than ever in the Oval Office. We already know what voting for smoke and mirrors can get us: Obama.One of the things I repeatedly tell people is: Vote your conviction even if it\'s not what\'s most popular, and rest assure that America\'s founders and God Himself back you because you\'re being true to who you are and what you believe.I\'ve wondered if Ronald Reagan himself could be elected in today\'s political environment. I would propose that Huckabee is actually more like Reagan than any other candidate, and I\'m not alone.In his article, ""Is Huckabee the Next Reagan?,"" historian Dr. Timothy Stanley summarized Mike\'s uniqueness among the presidential candidates: ""But none of these men has Huckabee\'s unique ability to speak through the television cameras and straight to the viewer at home. And, aside from Santorum, none of them has run for the nomination before. Republicans are typically cautious voters who encourage a candidate to run twice, or even thrice, before nominating them:  George H.W. Bush and Reagan were veterans of the presidential primaries. As such, Huckabee enters this race with a key asset: He\'s a conservative statesman. His history alone ought to guarantee him top-tier status.""Few knew Ronald Reagan better than Ed Rollins, who served in the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, including serving two tours of duty at the highest level of the White House as assistant to the president and White House political director. Rollins also served as the national campaign director to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election in which Reagan won 49 states.Rollins described Huckabee in this way: ""Gov. Huckabee has probably inspired me as much as Ronald Reagan  he can connect with ordinary voters. I was with the old Reagan and I can promise you this man comes as close as anyone to filling those shoes.""Mike truly is a first-class patriot and a renowned man of integrity. Our country can use his caliber of character in the White House, not only to help restore the Oval Office but also our nation.In the end, whoever the American voters decide will be their choice for the Republican candidacy, I will certainly support and encourage others to do the same. Like I said, any of them will be good for our country. And it is only by rallying around that single GOP candidate that we are going to ensure the presidential win and restoration of our country.'"

America loves Gary\'s tractor..=> Iowa caucus: hologram eagle and Jesus star on America\'s most patriotic tractorThe Guardian ""In Des Moines on Sunday, the Guardian was given a tour of the world\'s most patriotic tractor. The 1957 860 Ford, complete with hologram eagle whose eyes follow passersby...is the creation of Gary Leffler of West Des Moines...""Underneath the hood of the tractor is all the names of our family that served in the military,"" Leffler said as he conducted a tour of the vehicle, noting that his son had just been promoted to captain and would thus need to have his title on the tractor updated. The top of the hood features a Bible verse, John 3:16, and a cross, Leffler said, ""and if you look in the clouds right here you can see Jesus in the clouds."" ""It\'s all airbrushed in,"" said Leffler, who did not paint the tractor himself. He\'s a man of God and when you look at the credentials of what he can do, I have to go with Mike Huckabee...Continuing the tour, he added: ""My wife says, \'Really? You put a snake on the tractor?\' I said that\'s for Isis, al-Qaida and the Taliban.I\'m a principled man, and that\'s the reason I\'m going for Mike Huckabee. No1 his stand on guns: perfect. His stand on pro-life: perfect. He\'s the only man who can stand up and say, \'I\'ve beaten the Clinton machine.\' Thirdly, as Ronald Reagan said, our best presidents have come from the governors program. ""When you add it all up, he\'s a man of God and when you look at the credentials of what he can do, I have to go with Mike Huckabee. To me it\'s not even a choice, it\'s just clear-cut.""Huckabee Speaks in West Des MoinesDes Moines Register...WEST DES MOINES, Iowa -- With the Iowa caucuses about 24 hours away, all of the candidates are campaigning at full-throttle, especially ones at the back of the pack.Those candidates include 2008 Iowa caucus winner Mike Huckabee.""I\'m going to be glad when we finally start basing this whole election on voters rather than on some east coast pollster who has never spent a night in Iowa and doesn\'t have a clue what matters to people who will be going to vote tomorrow night in the caucuses,"" Huckabee said.Governor Huckabee addressed a packed room at Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines and took shots at rival candidates like Ted Cruz without ever mentioning their names.He told voters to remember he supports the renewable fuel standard and is a strong defender of the second amendment.Huckabee says he\'s not scared of his low polling performance this cycle. In fact, he reminds voters that Governor Terry Branstad even suggested he will surprise the state on caucus night. ""I trust Governor Branstad and his political predictions a whole lot more than some guy sitting on Fox today saying I\'m going to endorse one of the other candidates,"" Huckabee said. ""That guy has air in his head, on the side it says to inflate to 32 PSI because I want you to know, I\'m not getting out of the race. I\'m staying in, we\'re going to do great tomorrow night and keep polling and win the White House, folks.""At the gun range, political targets, literally JOHNSTON, Iowa  As political memorabilia goes, it\'s a little unusual. In a back hallway near the restrooms at CrossRoads Shooting Sports, a gun range here in the suburbs of Des Moines, a group of old shooting targets, some marred by dozens of bullet holes, are hung like posters on the wall. They belong to the Republicans who have stopped here over the last year while campaigning for the presidency. All of the targets are autographed by the political celebrity who used them, including Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee and Huckabee\'s wife, Janet. While many in the GOP field brag of their love of hunting and firearms in order to woo gun enthusiasts, the targets here offer some clues as to whether they were telling the truth or just pandering for votes.And then there are the Huckabees  Mike and Janet  who have made frequent visits to CrossRoads. The couple most recently campaigned there Saturday, reporters in tow. But the range displays targets from previous stops. The former Arkansas governor, who has gone on numerous pheasant hunting trips here while campaigning, was mostly a center shot, though he seems to have missed his aim a few times. Janet Huckabee appears to be the most precise shooter among all the Republicans, obliterating the bull\'s-eye with a barrage of shots  and even landing a few in the head of the body outline on her target. ""Practice makes perfect!"" she wrote after a visit in November 2015.NBC NewsDes Moines, Iowa""Mike Huckabee, if he\'s been to every single county in Iowa, it\'s tiring. No one does this if they don\'t believe in something, if they don\'t believe in what they\'re saying,"" said Liz Mitchell. Jim Labriola believes in what Huckabee is saying. ""I love the realness. It just comes through,"" said Labriola, who played Benny on the TV show, ""Home Improvement."" Jim is also a comedian from New York and he\'s on the road stumping for Huckabee. ""Governor Huckabee has a phenomenal sense of humor. He could\'ve been a stand-up comedian,"" said Labriola. He calls Huckabee the ""Reagan of our era,"" and says he\'ll never forget his time on the campaign trail in Iowa. ""I admire the people here. I admire that they can\'t be bought. Like New York,"" said Labriola, as he laughed. Jim was only kidding about New York, but was being honest when he called Iowa the ""true America."" On Monday, all of America will be watching what happens.Huckabee...Des Moines Register...An enthusiastic crowd Sunday afternoon greeted Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who was introduced to the standing-room-only audience by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. About 150 people were at the event, held at a coffee shop in West Des Moines\' Valley Junction. Huckabee was cheered when he emphatically told the group...""I\'m staying in, and I\'m going to do great tomorrow night and keep going and win the White House""Huckabee will be in South Carolina on Wednesday, campaign spokesman J. Hogan Gidley said.Huckabee, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses, told the group that the way to ""win the caucus is the old-fashioned way  hard work and a lot of handshaking.""Brody File Exclusive: Mike Huckabee Says More Christian Tithing Will Lead To Less GovernmentChristian Broadcast News""In an exclusive interview with The Brody File, Mike Huckabee says if Christians would tithe more than they do currently, the federal government wouldn\'t be as big and intrusive financially in people\'s lives. Huckabee told us, ""If, as a believer I think the real responsibility for taking care of poor people, people who are hungry, children who have real needs, if I truly believe that that ought to be a church function not a government function and I think government\'s too big and I want smaller government, you know how to get it? Make my giving bigger to the church. So if my giving to the church is small then guess what? I\'m going to have a bigger chunk of government coming after my paycheck""Mike Huckabee: ""A lot of Christians are very frustrated that the government is taking fifty cents out of every dollar for taxes. Have they ever realized that if all the people who said, \'I\'m a believer and I love Jesus.\' If they gave God a dime out of the dollar and they took care of the poor and they took care of the widows and the orphans as we\'re supposed to biblically, government wouldn\'t be so big and government wouldn\'t be doing these programs and government wouldn\'t be taking fifty cents out of the dollar so this is a bigger issue than the church issue. Here\'s what it really comes down to: if as a believer I think the real responsibility for taking care of poor people, people who are hungry, children who have real needs, if I truly believe that that ought to be a church function not a government function and I think government\'s too big and I want smaller government, you know how to get it? Make my giving bigger to the church. So if my giving to the church is small then guess what? I\'m going to have a bigger chunk of government coming after my paycheck.Hopefuls wooing faithfulArkansas Democrat GazetteHuckabee spent time at his campaign headquarters in Urbandale, encouraging volunteers who were preparing to wave his signs near intersections or to telephone potential caucus attendees. He held out hope that he\'ll pull off a come-from-behind win. ""People never pick exactly what\'s going to happen. They get it wrong every four years. And folks, we are not just hanging on. We are fighting to the end, and I want you to believe that there is a real possibility for a stunning upset,"" Huckabee said. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has predicted the Hope native might do better than expected, Huckabee said, adding, ""We\'re going to prove that he\'s not only a great politician, but he is a prophet of biblical proportions.""...Huckabee also has been stressing faith on the stump and in his campaign materials, even posting his supporters\' prayers on his website, MikeHuckabee.com. (Lea Wilson-Reynolds of Virginia, for example, asked that God give Huckabee ""wisdom to answer his naysayers and take him safely to all of his campaign locations."")...Huckabee spent much of Saturday giving media interviews, but took time in the afternoon to travel to a gun range for target practice. The candidate and several of his supporters showed off their marksmanship during a visit to Crossroads Shooting Sports in Johnston, outside Des Moines.Huckabee planned to worship this morning at Walnut Creek Church, which has four locations in the Des Moines area. Its pastor, Terry Amann, endorsed Huckabee in August. He also was scheduled to appear this evening at a screening of God\'s Not Dead 2, a faith-friendly movie that was shot, in part, in Little Rock. David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University and a former Des Moines Register political reporter, said the election year mix of prayer and politics makes sense politically in Iowa. ""Evangelicals make up over half the likely Republican caucusgoers, and it was true four years ago and eight years ago when Huckabee won,"" he said. That voting bloc is ""just a huge part of the Republican base right now, and it\'s true nationally as well.""Mike Huckabee: ""Let\'s Get Rid of Abortion Once and for All""LifeNews...former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee took a strong stance defending the right to life of unborn children. Here\'s his comment and video of his remarks: ""I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we\'re going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let\'s do something bolder. Let\'s get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process.

Mike Huckabee appeared in a West Des Moines eatery in front of a packed crowd and touted the fact that he did very well in Iowa in 2008, racking up more support in that caucus than any before or since. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley gave Huckabee a gracious introduction, noting his many political successes in Arkansas, and Huckabee\'s political stamina and time spent in Iowa, getting to know voters in all 99 counties. And Huckabee has been loyal to Iowa, spending much of the past eight months in the Hawkeye State, meeting with citizens from corner to corner. He recognized the hard economic realities some Iowans are facing, noting the Maytag plant closure in Newton some years earlier. Returning to Newton, many former Maytag workers still had not found new work. ""We can fix this,"" he said. ""But we can\'t do it by electing people who have never fixed a thing in their entire political life."" Huckabee urged those in the room to get out and caucus for him on Monday night and send a shockwave to the establishment. Regardless, he said, he noted that it is now in God\'s hands and the hands of the citizens. ""I\'m not getting out of the race,"" Huckabee said, flashing his trademark, Gomer Pyle grin. ""I\'m going to keep on going.""Mike Huckabee\'s Wife Janet Hits Bullseye with AR-15GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee - along with many of his campaign surrogates - had some fun at a shooting range in Johnston, Iowa on Saturday afternoon, just about 48 hours ahead of the Iowa caucus, where his wife, Janet Huckabee, hit a bullseye while shooting an AR 15. ""We had a great time,"" Huckabee told Breitbart news. ""We had a bunch of our surrogates [join] who are in town."" Some of Huckabee\'s campaign surrogates attending the event were Arkansas first female and first Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and former Congressman Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA). Huckabee\'s wife, Janet Huckabee, who also attended the event, hit a bulls-eye with an AR 15. ""We had some great folks that came out with us and then a lot of our volunteers had a shoot off - just really had a great time,"" Huckabee added.Gov. Mike Huckabee: Hillary Clinton\'s Emails \'Ought To End\' Her Campaign... Mike Huckabee says the discovery that 22 emails found in Hillary Clinton\'s home-brew email system are too secret to even release ""ought to be the end"" of her 2016 campaign. ""She has no excuse,"" Huckabee said of Clinton\'s email server, which she used while serving as the nation\'s Secretary of State. ""This is not someone who just got elected to something last year and is still trying to feel her way through the rules and through the lawsgoing back over 40 years, she was a staff member of the Watergate committee - she understood full well what federal law was about,"" he said. ""She\'s a Yale trained attorney for heaven sakesit\'s not like she\'s under educated,"" he added. Huckabee also cited Clinton\'s decades-long turns as a First Lady, a U.S. Senator and as Secretary of State, adding, [With] that kind of over 40-year time, for her to pretend that she just wasn\'t aware that she may be mishandling public documents or state secrets is utterly absurd - beyond absurd - and she has no defense over that, so I think she shows more culpability than a whole lot of people. ""I think there\'s no doubt,"" Huckabee responded when asked if Clinton\'s email scandal will help her competitor Sen. Bernie SandersWe Went to the Gun Range With Mike Huckabee  and He Sent a Blunt Message to Hillary ClintonWith just about 50 hours to go until the Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee headed to a Des Moines firing range Saturday to ""get out a little frustration."" When TheBlaze asked Huckabee if he had a message for Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders regarding the Second Amendment, the former Arkansas governor quoted the ""late, great Charlton Heston."" ""You can have my guns when you pry them from my cold, dead fingers,"" Huckabee said.Mike Huckabee will host the upcoming film ""God\'s Not Dead 2"" a day before the Iowa caucusesChristian Times ""The Republican candidate will host the exclusive screening in order to showcase the cultural and social landscape that challenges religious liberty in the modern age, particularly for Christians. Huckabee, 60, who is also a Christian minister, will host the film several months ahead of its April 1 premiere theaters in front of GOP leaders. It featured a college professor who tries to debunk the existence of God through philosophy, although by the end of the film, it was revealed that he was holding a grudge against God for the bad things that happened to him. In the new film, where Huckabee is set to make an appearance, the plot revolves around a history teacher who faces controversy and the danger of termination from the school where she teaches because of an answer she makes to a student. The student reportedly asks her about the similarities between Jesus\' teachings and that of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. She then replies that Christ\'s teachings were an inspiration to King in his \'non-violent activism\'. The school officials would then include a civil rights group to find the teacher guilty for violating \'separation of church and state.\' ""Cases like these - where the religious freedoms of everyday men and women are being restricted by courts and government agencies - are sadly quite common today,"" explained the film\'s producer, Michael Scott.'"
