Rand Paul,R,p,"May 13, 2015",Press Release - Upholding the Right to Privacy is a Core Constitutional Value,"The Washington TimesBy Andrew P. Napolitano May 13, 2015A decision last week about National Security Agency spying by a panel of judges on the United States Court of Appeals in New York City sent shock waves through the government. The court ruled that a section of the Patriot Act that is due to expire at the end of this month and on which the government has relied as a basis for its bulk acquisition of telephone data during the past 14 years does not authorize that acquisition.This may sound like legal mumbo jumbo, but it goes to the heart of the relationship between the people and their government in a free society. Here is the backstory and the latest.The Patriot Act is the centerpiece of the federal government's false claims that by surrendering our personal liberties, it can somehow keep us safe. The liberty-for-safety offer has been around for millennia and was poignant at the time of the founding of the American republic.The Framers addressed it in the Constitution itself, where they recognized the primacy of the right to privacy and insured against its violation by intentionally forcing the government to jump through some difficult hoops before it can capture our thoughts, words or private behavior.Those hoops are the requirement of a search warrant issued by a judge and based on evidence  called probable cause  demonstrating that it is more likely than not that the government will find what it is looking for from the person or place it is targeting. Only then may a judge issue a warrant, which must specifically describe the place to be searched or specifically identify the person or thing to be seized.Click here to continue reading the full article: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/andrew-napolitanio-rand-paul-and-ted-cruz-on-the-p/"
Rand Paul,R,p,"May 20, 2015",Press Release - The Kentucky Republican Spoke on the Senate Floor Until He Could No Longer Stand. Here's Everything That Happened,"National JournalBy Dustin Volz and Kaveh WaddellMay 20, 2015 - Sen. Rand Paul has just wrapped a ten-and-a-half hour long speech on the Senate floor in what his office called a filibuster against the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, as part of an apparent stand against efforts by some of his Republican colleagues to extend the Patriot Act's expiring spy powers.""There comes to a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer,"" Paul started. ""That time is now. And I will not let the Patriot Act, the most un-patriotic of acts, go unchallenged.""Paul took the podium at 1:18 p.m. and left the floor at 11:49 p.m. Here's what happened, and what's coming next.12:26 a.m.: A very tired Rand Paul, off the floor, opens up.After he walked off the Senate floor, the Kentucky senator told reporters he was ""tired, voice is worn out, ready to go home.""But Paul didn't feel like his time and energy were for nothing. Business shoes in hand, a weary Paul said ""we accomplished something by having, you know, it was kind of nice to have bipartisan support.""Paul said that even though he didn't last until midnight, he still believed he had slowed down the clock by a day on procedural advancement on any Patriot Act reauthorization. But an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the theatrics matter little. ""Cloture on trade would be tomorrow either way. Patriot Act is after that,"" the aide said.Because McConnell did not file for cloture by Tuesday evening, it was already unlikely the Senate could act on the Patriot Act before the House goes on recess tomorrow, given the drawn-out parliamentary process of the upper chamber. Unless the Senate is willing to stay in town over the weekend and approve the House-passed Freedom Act, it appears increasingly likely that we are headed for a full expiration of the law's three surveillance authorities, which sunset on June 1.Paul, while talking to reporters, took a jab at President Obama for not ending the NSA's bulk phone-records program unilaterally. Obama ""needs to step up and be a little more of a leader in getting us out of this mess,"" he said.Noting support from Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, his presidential rival, Paul said ""We're not exactly [on] the same page but I think we're all opponents of the bulk collection."" Both Lee and Cruz support the USA Freedom Act, while Paul says it does not go far enough.11:49 p.m.: It's over. Thanking his staff, Sen. Rand Paul has relinquished the floor after 10 hours and 30 minutes.Since Paul didn't speak past midnight, the week's schedule appears to remain unchanged. Earlier in the night, an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if Paul talked into Thursday, it would hold up possible consideration of a Patriot Act extension and throw off the Senate's calendar before breaking for recess.11:45 p.m.: We're winding down. After Sen. Ted Cruz's fiery speech, a tired Paul took the podium for a final hurrah. ""My voice is rapidly leaving, and my bedtime has long since past,"" he said, before launching into a summary of what he's been saying for almost 10 and a half hours. ""Bulk collection must end, and I think we have the votes to end it now,"" Paul said.Click here to continue reading the full article: http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/rand-paul-filibuster-live-blog-20150520"

However, the legislation is not actually under consideration yet, since the Senate is still working on trade legislation, making Paul's takeover of the Senate floor -- which began shortly after 1 p.m. on Wednesday -- more of a long speech than a filibuster.""The president began this program by executive order, he should immediately end it through executive order,"" Paul, who is a candidate for president in 2016, charged.

His speech underscored deep divisions over the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, which was revealed by former contractor Edward Snowden in June 2013. The Obama administration warned Wednesday that the NSA's bulk collection of phone records would have to start winding down by the end of the week if Congress does not act, and several programs under the Patriot Act would lapse at the end of the month, when the act itself expires.

Rand Paul,R,p,"June 2, 2015",Press Release - The New Randroids,"SlateBy David AuerbachJune 2, 2015Every time Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul assails mass government surveillance on the floor of the Senate, it is surprising to see who emerges to praise the erratically unorthodox Republican, from Edward Snowden to Glenn Greenwald to true-blue progressive reporter Marcy Wheeler. This support comes with caveats, of course. But the lefty applause for Paul also arrives at a moment of a distinctly lacking enthusiasm for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. More importantly, these plaudits align with many of the concerns of a quiet but influential contingent of liberal-leaning techies who might one day become Rand Democratsor Democrats willing to support some other, future right-wing firebrand with lefty-compatible ideas about civil libertiesmuch in the way disaffected blue-collar workers became Reagan Democrats. Think of them as the New Randroidsand definitely not because they admire Ayn Rand, which they don't. Progressives and loyal Democrats would be wise not to ignore them.Rand Paul's father, Ron Paul, has long enjoyed a libertarian following within what I call the tech laitythe vast number of tech workers who don't work for buzzy startups or dominate the tech press. This group of engineers and other research and development workers, far less white and somewhat less male than what's portrayed in the media, clusters around industry hubs in the Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, North Carolina's Research Triangle, Austin, Los Angeles, and so on. The libertarians among them, who hate the Federal Reserve and have funded the presidential ambitions of Paul pere, make up a tiny minority of the whole. What's been surprising is how hard Rand Paul has worked to broaden that small following in the hopes of reaching disaffected Republicans and Democrats. He has about as much chance of winning the nomination as Howard Dean, Paul's closest antecedent, did in 2004. But Dean came closer than most people remember, and he ended up impacting the Democratic agenda (anti-war, expanded health care, gay rights) for years. Paul hopes to do the sameand perhaps make another run at the presidency in 2020 or 2024.One way for him to do this is with the backing of a large chunk of the tech community. Paul and others noticed the large amounts of tech money that helped fuel Ro Khanna's Democratic primary challenge to longtime Silicon Valley congressman Mike Honda last year. They rightly see the tech demographic as ready to get a lot more politically engagedand not necessarily on just one side. Khanna lost, but he's trying again in 2016, and there is no shortage of wealthy, left-libertarian techies who could become a lot more influential should they find the right candidate. Paul wants to be that candidate.Click here to continue reading the full article: http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/06/rand_paul_and_the_tech_vote_why_he_wants_it_and_could_just_get_it.html"
Rand Paul,R,p,"June 5, 2015",Press Release - Hundreds Pack Manchester Office To Hear Rand Paul Bash 'Arrogant Washington Machine',"BreitbartBy Matthew BoyleJune 5, 2015MANCHESTER, New Hampshire  At least two hundred people packed into a tiny office space in downtown Manchester to hear 2016 GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) bash the ""Washington machine"" and hammer both parties in Congress for failing to read legislation like Obamatrade before voting on it.He also touted his big victory this past week against the National Security Agency (NSA) bulk data collection program, and the PATRIOT Actwhich he forced to expire. Paul said as the crowd of hundredswhich started arriving more than an hour before the senator camecheered:Tonight we've got a message, a message for the Washington machine: We've come to take our liberty back. Some in Washington say that you have to trade your liberty for security so we had a big grand debate, 10 and a half hours on one day then we came back for a few more hours. Now some in the Washington machine didn't want me to be there and they didn't want to be there. They wanted to be on vacation. We caused them to give a little bit of their vacation up to have a very important debate: Can you have your liberty, can you keep your liberty and can you also have security?Paul recounted several details from his battle against the NSA and then quoted several intellectuals to back up his argument:We did send a message to the president: The courts told him it was illegal and last week Congress told him, no more, you cannot collect our information. If we want to win again, if we want to be able to win New Hampshire, if we want to win the states we haven't been winning, the states President Obama that we should be winningNew Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado, Pennsylvaniawe are the only candidate right now that leads Hillary Clinton in all of those states.The crowd went wild  even more so as Paul called for term limits in Congress and hammered Congress for not reading legislation  like Obamatrade  as several members of Congress get exposed for supporting Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which would fast-track the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) THAT most of them haven't read.Paul's 2016 opponent Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) voted for Obamatrade without reading TPP's textor at least that's the impression his staff, which has continually refused to answer whether he read TPP before voting to fast-track it while making it a pillar of his foreign policy agendanor have many supporters of Obamatrade throughout House GOP leadership. Paul said:The way we're doing it is we're running against the Washington machine. This is the machine that the biggest reform we could probably have that would break the inertia, break the status quo is guess what? They all ought to come home. Let's have term limits for every single one of them. The other thing we're going to need is rules. They don't obey the rules, they don't read the bills, they don't obey their own rules. About a year ago we got a bill that was about a thousand pages plopped on our desk with two hours to read it and vote on it. Even the Senate rules say it's supposed to be 48 hours but when I objected you know what the response was? The response was let's vote to change the rules for this bill.' And that's the problem, that's the arrogance we have in Washington.

Paul joined Mayor DeAndre Windom for an 'Unleash the American Dream' event on location at the Midland Development 91 project. Other local elected officials, business leaders and religious leaders also joined Sen. Paul in this discussion as they seek to end the cycle of poverty that has plagued our nation's inner cities. ""As the leader of this city, I am always exploring opportunities to communicate with local, national and global audiences about the challenges we face relating to economic development.

We welcome Senator Rand Paul and the delegation as we continue our pursuit to the Rebirth of Highland Park,"" said Mayor Windom.""I agree with Mayor Windom's belief that transparency opens doors and encourages conversations which then lead to solutions - and not just in Highland Park, but cities across the nation. I came to Highland Park to see how Washington's policies are impacting our nation's urban cities. It's time to empower our communities. It's time to make Washington work for our communities,"" Sen. Paul said.""It's time for new models to help more Americans live the American Dream- models like my 'Fair and Flat Tax' plan, and Economic Freedom Zones. New models that let working Americans keep more of their hard-earned money. It's time for the men and women of Highland Park to make decisions for their communities, not the folks in Washington who have never stepped foot in Highland Park.

Sen. Rand Paul has been consistent in the polls, and recently beat Hillary Clinton in several key swing states, according to the Quinnipiac University poll. Recent polls such as the McClatchy poll, the Fox News Presidential poll and the Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll also found that Sen. Paul is the Republican candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 general election. This polling suggests that Sen. Rand Paul is the only Republican candidate capable of making the party bigger, better, and bolder.""Poll after poll shows that I am the strongest candidate, and I believe it is because I am unwilling to dilute my constitutional conservative message. We must be boldly for conservative principles like a 'Fair and Flat tax' plan, protecting the entire Bill of Rights, and balancing the budget. The Democrats have no qualms stampeding all over our civil liberties, but it is clear that the 'Live Free or Die' has had enough.

Rand Paul,R,p,"August 13, 2015",Press Release - The Party of Tomorrow,"HUFFPOST POLITICSBy Sen. Rand Paul August 13, 2015 We live in the greatest, freest, richest, most humanitarian country on earth -- and I'll be damned if I sit around and watch my generation screw up the future of our nation's young people.When I visit college campuses, I am encouraged. The students I meet are among the most passionate defenders of liberty anywhere.I'm running for president to protect economic and personal liberty so that your generation can make the most out of your lives in a way you see fit.I believe the path forward for our country -- and the Republican Party -- is rooted in respecting the Constitution and acknowledging the dignity of the individual. If the Republicans want to be the party of tomorrow, it needs ideas that excite young people. Only a candidate who is a socially tolerant, fiscally responsible and principled leader can reinvigorate the Republican brand.Starting today, we are launching ""Students For Rand"" and will be recruiting the ""300 in 30"" initiative. We have the goal of starting 300 chapters in just 30 days to show how strong the youth support is for my presidential campaign.We must stand for something so powerful and so popular that it brings people together -- whether they lean left, right or find themselves squarely in the middle. My message of liberty, opportunity, and justice is for all has resonated everywhere, especially in the places Republicans are too scared to go, such as Detroit, the South Side of Chicago, Ferguson, or even UC Berkeley.Government has no business in your business, period.Today, the economic outlook is bleak for too many young people. Our nation's youth unemployment rate is approaching 14 percent and more millennials are forced to live with their parents, much more than the generations that preceded them. On top of that, young Americans are starting their working life with an average student loan debt of $30,000. Things need to change.Government should help you succeed rather than get in your way. Most people agree that high taxes and excessive regulations affect your ability to land a job. It doesn't have to be this way. I have proposed a fair and flat tax rate of 14.5 percent for all Americans, rich and poor -- everyone is treated equally and no one can trade campaign donations to corrupt politicians in exchange for tax loopholes.I don't want the government that regulates the Internet. I don't want a government that tells you where you can hail Uber. I don't want a government that bans you from renting out your apartment or opening a food truck. How can you change the world if we hinder young entrepreneurs by picking winners and losers?What I want is a government that tracks terrorists rather than innocent Americans.Young people inspire me because they firmly believe that we can have freedom and security. The government has no business peering through your records, combing through emails, or monitoring your social media. President Obama maintained that the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect any of your records -- but I fought him until he ended the government's illegal spying. We don't have to trade the Bill of Rights and the Constitution to stop threats against us.I'm inspired because the youth of America believe in justice, and I'm leading the fight to reform our criminal justice system.Of the 1.1 million prisoners who entered America's prisons since 1990, an increasingly large percent have been held on non-violent charges. Almost half of state prisoners are incarcerated for non-violent crime. Drug offenders make up over half of those behind bars in federal penitentiaries.There is something wrong with a system that releases hardened, violent criminals to make room in prison for someone caught smoking marijuana. We need to reform our criminal justice system so that the punishment fits the crime while keeping violent offenders behind bars. That's why I have proposed bills to make many non-violent drug offenses misdemeanors that do not permanently damage a person's work potential.I will not rest until all Americans, white and black, rich and poor, are treated equally under the law. My record demonstrates that I will work with anybody who honestly wants to fix things: Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey and I have teamed up on criminal justice reform. I have a bill with Senator Harry Reid that allows people to get their voting rights back. I've worked with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York to get justice for soldiers who've been sexually assaulted. We've also worked together to remove federal prohibitions on medical marijuana.Your generation expects and deserves solutions, not more government directed by out of touch politicians. It's time for a new set of ideas. We need new kind of leadership, one that listens to the people rather than controlling them.Some in the GOP ignore the youth vote because they don't think it matters. My campaign wants to recruit you so that together we can make a difference. We will have 300 new student chapters in the next 30 days, and I hope your school will be among the first. It's time for the students of America to have a voice again and that's why I'm asking you to join my movement for opportunity, liberty, and justice for all Americans.Join me and #StandWithRand as we fight together for our liberty.Click here to read more"

Rand Paul,R,p,"September 17, 2015","Press Release - In Debate Showdown, Rand Paul The Only Adult on Stage","Chicago TribuneBy John KassSeptember 17, 2015Donald Trump wanted to kick him off the debate stage. Fox News ignored him. CNN limited his time, then called him a loser.But Rand Paul won the Republican presidential debate.It wasn't even close.Is he perfect, or some savior on a white horse? No. Yet the others on the debate stage talked like angry children determined to show the world how tough they'd be. They promised to rip up the Iran deal and either push Vladimir Putin around or ignore him completely.But Paul, the senator from Kentucky, spoke like a thoughtful grown-up, overshadowing them all on foreign policy, explaining that intervening in Middle East civil wars is a recipe for disaster.""If you want boots on the ground, and you want them to be our sons and daughters, you've got 14 other choices,"" Paul said during the debate. ""There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you if you want to go back to war in Iraq.""Clearly the media don't like him. And Trump doesn't like him, singling Paul out for attack at the outset.Trump is the front-runner. So why attack Paul, who's been so starved of media oxygen? Because New Hampshire approaches, and Trump will fade eventually, having demonstrated to Americans that he lacks the requisite depth for the job.The GOP establishment can afford a Carly Fiorina, pretending to be an outsider, or even a Marco Rubio, thrilling a few of the TV talking heads by morphing into some Leonidas of Sparta from Miami, eager to kick those insolent Persian envoys down the well.But what the Republican establishment cannot afford is Paul as their nominee. That would expose the neocons and the war party, and the security surveillance state.And it might help remind Americans that conservatives once opposed foreign adventures, meaning wars, because wars by definition lead to the aggrandizement of federal power.It is the universal law of political arithmetic that as the government gorges and muscles up, individual liberty fades.Paul doesn't have buzz, but buzz is overrated, as is snark and hair.Former President George W. Bush had buzz when he plunged foolishly into Iraq and that led to the terror of ISIS. President Barack Obama had buzz, just about the time he drew that ""red line"" in the sands of Syria, and before the dictator in Libya was toppled.Obama began to lose buzz with the growth of ISIS, which he dismissed as some kind of terrorist junior varsity.The flood of refugees from North Africa and Syria the forerunners of a larger stampede threatening Europe  has both Bush and Obama's name on it.But you won't hear that on CNN (the Democratic network) or Fox News (the Republican network), or from other establishment Democratic or Republican candidates.""I've made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War,"" Paul said. ""I was opposed to the Syria war. I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies.""Iran is now stronger because Hussein is gone (from Iraq). Hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians. So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse ""We have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire. The Iraq War backfired and did not help us. We're still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.""Click here to read more: http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-kass-debate-wrapup-met-0918-20150917-column.html"

Rand Paul today proved that he is the only candidate willing to stand up to the Washington Machine and put an end to its out-of-control spending.

He is not afraid to stand alone in Washington as one of the only senators willing to fix our debt and end big government spending. Today, Sen.

Rand Paul said.The Caucus Leaders supporting Rand Paul for President include:Nevada Assemblywoman Shelly Shelton - Shelton represents Nevada's 10th district and serves on the Assembly education committee, government affairs committee, and legislative operations and elections committee.""We have broken this government and it will take a strong, consistent leader like Rand Paul to begin the process of fixing it. His record proves he is a man of his word who is not afraid to stand up to the establishment and take on special interests that prey on Americans,"" Assemblywoman Shelton said.Nevada Assemblyman John Moore - Moore is a former United States Army Airborne Ranger who fought in the Iraq War. He was elected to the Assembly to represent the 8th District of Nevada in 2014. He currently serves as the Vice Chair of the Assembly Government Affairs Committee.""I am endorsing Rand Paul for President because he is a man of integrity and action. He believes in a country where our personal freedoms and liberty are paramount. I am proud to stand with him in defense of our civil liberties,"" said Assemblyman Moore.State Senator Roger Chamberlain, Minnesota - In 2010, in his first run for any public office, he was elected as a state senator representing senate district 53. He has served on various committees, including taxes, K-12 education, state departments and veterans' affairs, and commerce. He was vice chair on local government. During the 2012 session Chamberlain served as assistant majority leader, and in 2013 - 2014 he served as assistant minority leader.""Whether it's a common sense and fair tax plan, supporting education, reining in the abuses by the NSA, or sound foreign policy; Sen. Paul's priority is freeing citizens and putting the people back in charge of their lives. This means taking power back from a Washington ruling class that has run amok and empowering the individual. I am proud to stand with Rand in defeating the Washington Machine,"" Sen. Chamberlain said.State Senator Branden Petersen, Minnesota - Petersen represents Minnesota's 35th district. Since taking office in 2010, his legislative priorities include funding equity for schools with high needs but insufficient revenue and ""value-added"" teacher evaluations that measure effectiveness by student progress, not teacher proficiency. Petersen also believes the state needs to learn to budget and make ends meet in a tougher economy just as his constituents have had to do.""Rand Paul is the only candidate in this race who consistently stands up for constitutional limited government. His positive vision for America will attract new voters to an aging Republican Party and put us in the best position to win back the White House. I proudly stand with Rand,"" said Sen. Petersen.Minnesota Republican Liberty Caucus Chairman Neil Lynch - Current Chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus and former CD3 Vice Chair. Neil Lynch was also a candidate for MN GOP State Party Chair in 2015. Professionally, Neil is a seasoned sales engineering and technology manager.""Rand Paul is the candidate best positioned to beat the Democratic Party's nominee in November. Not only does Sen. Paul unapologetically stand up for the Constitution and against government overreach, he also has the ability to win over independents and conservative Democrats, much like Ronald Reagan did in 1980. I want to win in 2016, so I enthusiastically stand with Rand,"" said Chairman Lynch.State Representative Brett Hildabrand, Kansas - Hildabrand is a fourth generation Kansas native originally from Fort Scott. He is a graduate of Kansas State University with a bachelor's degree from the College of Agriculture. Brett is a conservative constitutionalist who believes in limited government, protection of personal liberties, fiscal responsibility, states rights and honoring human life at all stages of development. Brett is an active member of the St. Joseph Catholic Church in Shawnee.""I stand with Senator Rand Paul because he fearlessly addresses the issues we face as a nation. While other candidates shift their positions based on public opinion polls, Senator Rand Paul will always abide by the principles of the United States Constitution,"" State Rep. Hildabrand said. State Senator Mark Madsen, Utah - Senate Chair, Utah International Relations and Trade Commission, Chairman Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee. Three-term Senator Mark Madsen is consistently ranked as one of Utah's very most conservative Senators, yet also enjoys the highest ranking from the ACLU.""Rand Paul understands that Washington has hobbled our economy with oppressive regulations and confiscatory taxes, putting American business at a disadvantage compared to countries which embrace entrepreneurs and respect success. Rand Paul's 'Fair and Flat Tax' would go long way to level the global playing field for American business and American jobs,"" Sen. Madsen said.State Representative Jacob Anderegg, Utah - Leader of the Utah House Young Guns, Member of the House Business and Labor Committee, House Rules Committee, and House Transportation Committee.""In today's world evil is often called good and good is often called evil. As a member of a historically persecuted faith, I believe Rand Paul, among all the candidates, understands and will resolutely defend Religious Liberty,"" said State Rep. Anderegg.Utah County Commissioner Bill Lee - Utah County Commissioner, Former Deputy State Director for Senator Mike Lee, and small business owner.""As a Commissioner in a county with a very high growth rate, I understand that we cannot afford to keep adding debt onto our children and grandchildren. I support Rand Paul for president because he is the only candidate serious about reining in our out-of-control spending,"" Commissioner Lee said."

Rand Paul,R,p,"October 15, 2015",Press Release - MEMO: Rand Paul for President Campaign Standing,"MemorandumTo: Interested PartiesFrom: Doug Stafford, Chief StrategistChip Englander, Campaign ManagerRe: Summary of Campaign StandingDate: October 15, 2015There are some in the media who are pushing a false narrative that Senator Rand Paul (SRP) is on the ropes.Here are the facts and why SRP is here to stay.Political OrganizationGround game and political organization have a disproportionate impact in primaries and especially caucuses - and SRP has the best organization in America.Three times SRP has competed against the other contenders in presidential straw polls - and every time he has won. He won at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the same straw poll Reagan won that helped launch his 1980 candidacy. He won at the Republican Leadership Conference, the largest straw poll in America. And he won this past weekend at the largest New Hampshire straw poll. At all of these straw polls, other contenders competed, paid for supporters, and went in to win it. Each time they failed.In New Hampshire, where SRP won over the weekend, our organization has a statewide Leadership Team of over 300 members-nearly triple the size of our closest rival. This well-respected team of veteran grassroots organizers were the catalyst of this weekend's win and will be vital to future victories.SRP's strength in New Hampshire comes from his continued legwork in the state. He's been there more than most of the candidates. He was there last weekend, he will be there next weekend, and he will be there a third time at the end of this month. Like John McCain in 2008, Senator Paul's campaign isn't showing up in October polling, but will be there when it counts-on Election Day.Our campaign is similarly well-positioned in Iowa. SRP has already announced co-chairs in each of Iowa's 99 counties and has 600 precinct captains that are actively recruiting supporters and volunteers. This team has been able to call over 100,000 voters in the past few weeks alone.Like New Hampshire, our Iowa team provides the backbone of the ground force needed to win a trench warfare campaign. As demonstrated in both parties' campaigns for President, to win in Iowa, a strong ground force, not money, is the true game changer. In 2012, Rick Santorum was vastly outspent by Mitt Romney, yet he won Iowa. In 2008, Mike Huckabee was vastly outspent and won Iowa. In 2004, Democrat Howard Dean had all the money and resources, but John Kerry's in-state volunteer force propelled him to the top. That's how Iowa campaigns are won-through the hard work of motivated, well-organized, and passionate grassroots supporters.SRP is also making a historic effort to build a Students for Rand organization that will play heavily in Iowa and change the way Republicans treat the youth vote. Nationally, the organization established over 350 chapters since launch. Students make the calls and walk the doors. They also give the campaign the ability to organize cheaply in later states.And in Iowa, Students for Rand will have a huge impact.In 2012, 121,000 Iowans participated in their Republican caucus. In 2008, 119,000 Iowans participated in their Republican caucus. Although Iowa is not one of the most populous states in the country, large schools such as the University of Iowa and Iowa State University are part of a student population of over 120,000.Yet this sizable student population factored little in the last two Iowa caucuses because they occurred during winter break on January 3. Due to a change in RNC rules, the 2016 caucuses will occur on February 1 when school is in session. With 120,000 voters and over 120,000 students, students are set to dominate the caucuses in an unprecedented way and we are set to dominate this demographic. While the media fixates on ad buys and fundraising, we are the only campaign organizing on campuses. For example, when the University of Iowa kicked off back-to-school week we were the only campaign tabling and signing people up. There are twenty Students for Rand chapters across Iowa. Every campus event sees hundreds, if not thousands, of excited students ready to stand with Rand. Just this week, SRP crisscrossed Iowa as part of an 11-campus barnstorm, hitting schools in every corner of the state, signing up hundreds of caucus attendees and volunteers at every stop.You will not see this student advantage show-up in polls, but you will see it show-up in elections-just like the straw polls we keep winning.Debates, Polls, and FundraisingThe media can be forgiven for not grasping the significance of the ground organization we are building because it is not highly visible except on the few occasions we mobilize (and win). Some reporters have covered the fact that SRP always comes in first when people are actually voting, although most have ignored it altogether.What makes less sense, though, is that the media plays up any drop in the polls SRP experiences, while ignoring his momentum and the precipitous decline of other candidates.Since the last debate, SRP has moved up three spots in the polls. The two most recent polls determining who makes the next debate-conducted by CBS and Fox-had SRP outpolling Christie and Kasich. SRP is well within the criteria for the next debate-no question, he will be on the stage. Moreover, earlier this monthReuters-which independent analysts called the most accurate pollster of the last presidential election-had SRP in fifth place ahead of Rubio, Cruz, and others.Although the criteria to make the cut for the next debate requires a 2.5% average in the polls, you never read anything about Christie, who currently sits at 1.9% in the RCP average of polls. The media is fixated on insisting that SRP should get out of the race even though he continues to win every time votes are counted and the polls show him on the rise.The timing of the next two debates gives SRP an advantage because viewers will be able to decide the narrative for themselves. While each of the first three debates experienced 5-6 week breaks between them, the next two debates are separated by only 13 days - a significant opportunity for SRP to have some repetition before voters for the first time.This gives SRP the opportunity to further build on his recent momentum following the Reagan Library debate. Two of the three straw polls SRP has won have come since the debate, and SRP raised nearly a million dollars in the final twelve days after the last debate.SRP currently has over $2 million cash-on-hand and is running a lean campaign heavy on organization and light on expensive advertising. SRP has the financial resources to continue indefinitely and will keep racking up wins once the voting begins.If you were SRP - with $2 million, little overhead, the best organization in America, always on the debate stage, and you were winning 100% of the time votes were counted - would you bet you're closer to dropping out or that you were nearing a breakthrough? We bet on breakthrough-and the continued passion and dedication of our team to fight for Senator Paul's vision of liberty, opportunity and justice for all Americans is what will bring us success when it actually counts - on Election Day."

Rand Paul,R,p,"October 25, 2015",Press Release - Sen. Rand Paul: The Only Fiscal Conservative In The Room,"BOULDER, CO- Sen. Rand Paul tonight proved that he is the only fiscal conservative on the CNBC Republican Primary debate stage. Since taking office, Sen. Paul has implemented common-sense solutions that will solve our nation's fiscal crisis-- solutions like a Balanced Budget Amendment, an Audit the Fed bill, spending cuts, and was named the 'most frugal' legislator by the National Taxpayers Union. Sen. Paul has also introduced a Fair and Flat Tax Plan that would repeal the entire IRS tax code-more than 70,000 pages-and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5 percent on individuals and businesses.""Tonight we saw nine politicians and one statesman discussing the critical economic issues faced by our great nation. Sen. Paul's message of economic freedom, a fair and flat tax rate of 14.5 percent for all Americans, and fighting Washington corruption stands in stark contrast with big spending Republicans who shared the stage. Republicans have to answer one question in this primary: what kind of message will most likely defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sen. Paul's message of liberty continues to resonate across the country because he is the best candidate to take on the Washington Machine,"" said Doug Stafford, Chief Strategist."

Rand Paul,R,p,"November 16, 2015",Press Release - Sen. Rand Paul Introduces Legislation to Prevent Terrorists From Entering the U.S. as Refugees,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Rand Paul today announced legislation that would suspend visa issuance for countries with a high risk of terrorism and impose a waiting period for background checks on visa issuance from other countries until the American people can be assured terrorists cannot enter the country through our immigration and visa system. This legislation is based off language first proposed by Sen. Paul in 2013. ""The time has come to stop terrorists from walking in our front door. The Boston Marathon bombers were refugees, and numerous refugees from Iraq, including some living in my hometown, have attempted to commit terrorist attacks. The terrorist attacks in Paris underscore this concern that I have been working to address for the past several years. My bill will press pause on new refugee entrants from high-risk countries until stringent new screening procedures are in place,"" Sen. Paul said.Sen. Paul's legislation would suspend issuance of visas to nationals of countries with a high risk of terrorism until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) certifies and Congress votes to approve that:1) Aliens already admitted from high-risk countries have been fingerprinted and screened, pose no terrorist risk, and are being monitored for terrorist activity2) Enhanced security measures are in place to screen future applicants and prevent terrorists from entering the country3) DHS' visa entry-exit system is 100 percent complete and a tracking system is in place to catch attempted overstaysAdditionally, the legislation would impose a 30-day waiting period for all entries to the U.S. in order for background checks to be completed, unless the traveler has been approved through the Global Entry program. This requirement will be lifted after DHS certifies and Congress approves that:1) Screening of entrants is sufficient to prevent terrorists from entering the country2) DHS' visa entry-exit system is 100 percent complete and a tracking system is in place to catch attempted overstays"

Rand Paul,R,p,"December 3, 2015",Press Release - This Attack Represents a Fundamental Problem With the Media and Politics in General,This cover on the New York Daily News is a deplorable example of the media putting their political agenda over the suffering of victims and their families. The genuine thoughts and prayers offered to victims in need are not political fodder. This attack represents a fundamental problem with the media and politics in general. Attacking religious sentiments to promote an agenda as tragedy strikes is despicable.

Rand Paul Introduces Legislation to Secure the Homeland,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Earlier today, U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul introduced the Stop Extremists Coming Under Refugee Entry Act (SECURE Act) as an amendment to H.R. 3761.

Rand Paul,R,p,"December 4, 2015","Press Release - Earlier Today, the United States Senate Voted on Senator Rand Paul's ""SECURE Act"" and ""The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015""","WASHINGTON, D.C. - Earlier today, the United States Senate voted on Senator Rand Paul's ""SECURE Act"" and ""The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015.""Amendment No. 2899, known as the Stop Extremists Coming Under Refugee Entry Act (SECURE Act), would havesuspended visa issuance for nations with a high risk of terrorism and imposed a waiting period for background checks on visa issuance from other countries.

Instead of standing up for the Second Amendment, some of my colleagues chose to keep in place restrictive gun control laws. I will keep fighting to bring much needed change to our legislative priorities and continue in my efforts to defeat the Washington machine."""
Rand Paul,R,p,"December 12, 2015",Press Release - Debate Criteria,"WASHINGTON, D.C.- Prior to CNN's Republican Presidential debate announcement, Rand Paul for President has had discussions with the RNC and CNN in which the campaign indicated that Rand Paul should be on the main stage on Tuesday. Our campaign asserts that fairness in dealing with polling variances, which previously allowed for amended rules for Carly Fiorina for CNN's August Republican Presidential debate, would indicate Rand Paul should be on the main stage during Tuesday's debate. Some of the points include:1. Polling criteria has been amended in the previous CNN debate in a similar manner to what we are urging be done today.In August, polls were all over the place. Older polls had one result, while newer ones had another. Even in contemporaneous polls, there were different people ahead and behind. Thus it was determined that additional time periods and criteria were warranted for fairness. We ask for the same process today.A. In addition to the previously announced criteria, if a candidate qualified via the polling between the last debate and this debate, they are on the main stage.B. In addition to the previously announced and above criteria, if a candidate is above other main stage participants in multiple polls, they are on the main stage. Senator Paul is in the TOP FIVE in multiple polls, including the newest New York Times national poll. 2. Senator Paul has a national, first-tier campaign, organized in all 50 states. He is on the ballot everywhere that has had filing. He has over 400 fully operational grassroots groups, and his campaign and related entities have raised $22 million for this race. It is simply not consistent with facts to attempt to force the campaign off of the main debate stage.3. Rounding up should be applied. Polling margins are simply too wide to allow a quarter or half a point to determine the outcome. 4. The campaign is not asking for special treatment, but simply fairness in criteria, whether it be time frames, allowances for poll variances, or rounding, all of which have been applied to other debates. Senator Paul is eager for Tuesday's CNN debate, and looks forward to his fair and rightful place on the main stage."

Rand Paul,R,p,"January 11, 2016",Press Release - By Any Reasonable Criteria Senator Paul Has a Top Tier Campaign,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top tier campaign. He will not let the media decide the tiers of this race and will instead take his message directly to the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa.Multiple national polls including CNN, CBS, Fox, Marist and others have him in 5th or 6th place, one had him just a single point out of 4th. In multiple polls he scores ahead of Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich and Carly Fiorona. In yesterday's Marist Iowa poll he was alone in 5th place. In fact his numbers are on the rise in recent weeks. Even the pollsters are concerned that the media is using their polls incorrectly. Polls are at best an estimation, and include a standard of error that the media and the RNC are ignoring. A poll number of five is no different than a poll number of 8 if the standard of error is +/- 3. To exclude candidates on faulty analysis is to disenfranchise the voter.Creating ""tiers"" based on electoral results of real votes might make sense but creating ""tiers"" on bad science is irresponsible.This race is hitting its final stretch and Rand Paul is in it to win it. He is on the ballot in every state. He has over 1000 precinct captains in Iowa and a huge 500 person leadership team in New Hampshire. He is an important voice and has a unique message to share. He will hit the ground running this week to double down on his efforts to talk straight to the voters. See you in New Hampshire and Iowa."
