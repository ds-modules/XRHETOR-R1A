Rand Paul,R,c,"April 7, 2015","Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Louisville, Kentucky","I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back.We have come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank, the special interests that are more concerned with their personal welfare than the general welfare.The Washington machine that gobbles up our freedoms and invades every nook and cranny of our lives must be stopped.Less than five years ago I stood just down the road in home town in Bowling Green and said those same words. I wasn't supposed to win, no one thought I would.Some people asked me, then why are you running? The answer is the same now as it was then. I have a vision for America. I want to be part of a return to prosperity, a true economic boom that lists all Americans, a return to a government restrained by the Constitution.A return to privacy, opportunity, liberty. Too often when Republicans have won we have squandered our victory by becoming part of the Washington machine. That's not who I am.That's not why I ran for office the first time just a few years ago. The truth is, I love my life as a small-town doctor. Every day I woke up, I felt lucky to be able to do the things I loved. More importantly, I was blessed to be able to do things that made a difference in people's lives.I never could have done any of this, though, without the help of my parents who are here today. I'd like you to join me and thank my mother and dad.With my parents' help, I was able to make it through long years of medical training to become an eye surgeon. For me there is nothing that compares with helping someone see better. Last August I was privileged to travel to Guatemala on a medical mission trip together with a team of surgeons from across the U.S.We operated on more than 200 people who were blind or nearly blind from cataracts. I was grateful to be able to put my scrubs back on, peer into the oculars of the microscope, and focus on the task at hand, to take a surgical approach to fix a problem.One day in Guatemala, a man arrived and told me that I'd operated on his wife the day before. His wife could see clearly for the first time in years, and she had begged him to get on the bus, travel the winding roads and come back to our surgery center. He too was nearly blind from hardened cataracts.After his surgery, the next day, his wife sat next to me. As I unveiled the patch from his eyes, it was a powerful emotional moment for me to see them looking at each other clearly for the first time years to see the face they loved again.As I saw the joy in their eyes, I thought, ""This is why I became a doctor.""In that moment, I also remembered my grandmother, who inspired me to become an eye surgeon. She spent hours with me as a kid. We would sort through her old coin collection, looking for wheat pennies and Indian heads. But as her vision began to fail, I became her eyes to inspect the faintness of the mint marks on the old weather-worn coins.I went with my grandmother to the ophthalmologist as she had her corneas replaced. I was also with her when she received the sad news that macular generation had done irreparable harm to her eyes.My hope my hope that my grandmother would see again made me want to become an eye surgeon, to make a difference in people's lives.I've been fortunate. I've been able to enjoy the American Dream.I worry, though, that the opportunity and hope are slipping away for our sons and daughters. As I watch our once-great economy collapse under mounting spending and debt, I think, ""What kind of America will our grandchildren see""?It seems to me that both parties and the entire political system are to blame.Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration.And it's now tripling under Barack Obama's watch. President Obama is on course to add more debt than all of the previous presidents combined.We borrow a million dollars a minute. This vast accumulation of debt threatens not just our economy, but our security.We can wake up now and do the right thing. Quit spending money we don't have.This message of liberty is for all Americans, Americans from all walks of life. The message of liberty, opportunity and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor.In order to restore America, one thing is for certain, though: We cannot, we must not dilute our message or give up on our principles.If we nominate a candidate who is simply Democrat Light, what's the point?Why bother?We need to boldly proclaim our vision for America. We need to go boldly forth under the banner of liberty that clutches the Constitution in one hand and the Bill of Rights in the other.Washington is horribly broken. I fear it can't be fixed from within. We the people must rise up and demand action.Congress will never balance the budget unless you force them to do so. Congress has an abysmal record with balancing anything. Our only recourse is to force Congress to balance the budget with a constitutional amendment.I have been to Washington, and let me tell you, there is no monopoly on knowledge there.I ran for office because we have too many career politicians. I believe it now more than ever.We limit the President to two terms. It's about time we limit the terms of Congress!I want to reform Washington. I want common sense rules that will break the logjam in Congress.That's why I introduced a Read the Bills Act.The bills are thousands of pages long. And no one reads them. They are often plopped on our desks only a few hours before a vote.I've proposed something truly extraordinary  Let's read the bills, every page!The bills are 1,000 pages long and no one reads them. They are often plopped on our desk with only a few hours before a vote, so I propose something truly extraordinary. Let's read the bills every day.From the time I was a very young boy I was taught to love and appreciate America. Love of liberty pulses in my veins not because we have beautiful mountains or white sand beaches, although we do, and not because of our abundance of resources. It's more visceral than that. Our great nation was founded upon the extraordinary notion that government should be restrained and freedom should be maximized.America, to me, is that beacon. We are unique among the nations that our  that our country stands for freedom. Freedom nurtured our country from a rebellious group of colonies into the world's greatest nation.When tyranny threatened the world America led the way to rid the world of Nazis and fascist regimes. Resolutely we stood decade after decade against Communism, the engine of capitalism finally winning out against the sputtering, incompetent engine of socialism.We won the Cold War.America and freedom are so intertwined that people literally are dying to come here. The freedom we have fostered in America have unleashed genius and advancement like never before. Yet our great nation still needs new ideas and new answers to old problems.From an early age I worked. I taught swimming lessons, I mowed lawns, I did landscaping, I put roofs on houses, I painted houses. I never saw work though as punishment. Who always gave me a sense of who I am.Self-esteem cant be given; it must be earned.Work is not punishment; work is the reward.Two of my sons work minimum wage jobs while they go to college. I am proud of them as I see them realize the value of hard work. I can see their self-esteem grow as they cash their paychecks. I have a vision for America where everyone who wants to work will have a job.Many Americans though are being left behind. The reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties, the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer. Trillion-dollar government stimulus packages has only widened the income gap.Politically connected crones get taxpayer dollars by the hundreds of millions and poor families across America continue to suffer. I have a different vision, an ambitious vision, an ambitious vision, a vision that will offer opportunity to all Americans, especially those who have been left behind.My plan includes economic freedom zones to allow impoverished areas like Detroit, West Louisville, Eastern Kentucky to prosper by leaving more money in the pockets of the people who live there.Can you imagine what a billion-dollar stimulus could do for Detroit or for Appalachia? I'm convinced that most Americans want to work. I want to free up the great engine of American prosperity.I want to see millions of Americans back at work. In my vision for America, we'll bring back manufacturing jobs that pay well. How? We'll dramatically lower the tax on American companies that wish to bring their profits home.More than $2 trillion in American profit currently sits overseas. In my vision for America, new highways and bridges will be built across the country, not by raising your taxes, but by lowering the tax to bring this American profit home.Even in this polarized Congress, we have a chance of passing this. I say let's bring $2 trillion home to America, let's bring it home now.Liberal policies have failed our inner cities. Let's just get the facts straight. They have failed our inner cities. Our schools are not equal, and the poverty gap continues to widen. Martin Luther King spoke of two Americas. He described them as two starkly different American experiences that exist side-by-side.In one in America, people experience the opportunity of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In the other America, people experience a daily ugliness that dashes hope and leaves only the fatigue of despair.Although I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity, my trips to Detroit, to Appalachia, to Chicago have revealed what I call an undercurrent of unease.It's time for a new way, a way predicated on justice, opportunity and freedom.Those of us who have enjoyed the American dream must break down the wall that separates us from the other America. I want all our children to have the same opportunities that I had. We need to stop limiting kids in poor neighborhoods to failing public schools and offer them school choice.It won't happen, though, unless we realize that we can't borrow our way to prosperity. Currently some $3 trillion comes into the U.S. Treasury. Couldn't the country just survive on $3 trillion?I propose we do something extraordinary. Let's just spend what comes in.In my vision for America, freedom and prosperity at home can only be achieved if we defend against enemies who are dead set on attacking us.Without question we must defend ourselves and American interests from our enemies, but until we name the enemy, we can't win the war.The enemy is radical Islam. You can't get around it.And not only will I name the enemy, I will do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind.We need a national defense robust enough to defend against all attack, modern enough to deter all enemies, and nimble enough to defend our vital interests. But we also need a foreign policy that protects American interests and encourages stability, not chaos.At home, conservatives understand that government is the problem, not the solution.Conservatives should not succumb, though, to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow succeed in building nations abroad.I envision an America with a national defense unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by overseas nation-building.I envision a national defense that promotes, as Reagan put it, peace through strength.I believe in applying Reagan's approach to foreign policy to the Iran issue. Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength.We've brought Iran to the table through sanctions that I voted for. Now we must stay strong. That's why I've cosponsored legislation that ensures that any deal between the U.S. and Iran must be approved by Congress.Not  not only is that good policy, it's the law.It concerns me that the Iranians have a different interpretation of the agreement. They're putting out statement that say completely the opposite of what we're saying. It concerns me that we may attempt, or the president may attempt, to unilaterally and prematurely halt sanctions.I will oppose any deal that does not end Iran's nuclear ambitions and have strong verification measures.And I will insist that the final version be brought before Congress.The difference between President Obama and myself, he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness. Yet everyone needs to realize that negotiations are not inherently bad. The trust (inaudible) verify is required in any negotiation, but then our goal always should be and always is peace, not war.We must realize, though, that we do not project strength by borrowing money from China to send it to Pakistan.Let's quit building bridges in foreign countries and use that money to build some bridges here at home.It angers me to see mobs burning our flag and chanting ""Death to America"" in countries that receive millions of dollars in our foreign aid.I say it must end. I say not one penny more to these haters of America.To defend our country, we do need to gather intelligence on the enemy. But when the intelligence director is not punished for lying under oath, how are we to trust our government agencies?Warrantless searches of Americans' phones and computer records are un-American and a threat to our civil liberties.I say that your phone records are yours. I say the phone records of law-abiding citizens are none of their damn business.Is this where we light up the phones?The president created this vast dragnet by executive order. And as president on day one, I will immediately end this unconstitutional surveillance.I believe we can have liberty and security and I will not compromise your liberty for a false sense of security, not now, not ever.We must defend ourselves, but we must never give up who we are as a people. We must never diminish the Bill of Rights as we fight this long war against evil. We must believe in our founding documents. We must protect economic and personal liberty again.America has much greatness left in her. We are still exceptional and we are still a beacon for the world. We will thrive when we believe in ourselves again.I see an America strong enough to deter foreign aggression, yet wise enough to avoid unnecessary intervention.I see an America where criminal justice is applied equally and any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color is repealed.I see an America with a restrained IRS that cannot target, cannot harass American citizens for their political or religious beliefs.I see our big cities once again shining and beckoning with creativity and ingenuity, with American companies offering American jobs. With your help, this message will ring from coast to coast, a message of liberty, justice and personal responsibility. Today begins the journey to take America back.To rescue a great country now adrift, join me as together we seek a new vision for America. Today I announce with God's help, with the help of liberty lovers everywhere, that I am putting myself forward as a candidate for president of the United States of America."
Rand Paul,R,c,"April 18, 2015","Remarks at the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire","[joined in progress]Paul: ...sometimes people will ask me, Why did you decide to run for office? And I tell them I got tired of throwing things at the televisision. [laughter]But the real answer is, I actually got tired of looking up and seeing people in my party get in charge and then not really doing what they promised to do. [applause] I was disappointed that Republicans doubled the size of the debt when we were in charge. I was disappointed that Republican doubled the size of the Department of Education. I was disappointed the Republicans were even supporting Common Core. I was disappointed that Republicans were voting for bank bailouts.And so I said, I've either got to do something or shut up. I got to either complain, quit throwing TV  things at my TV, or I've got to show up and try to participate.And so I had a decision to make, and it wasn't an easy decision. I'm a physician. I live in a small town, Bowling Green, Kentucky, about 50,000 people. And I do eye surgery, and I really loved what I did. I spent a lot of my life trying to get into medical school, training and becoming a doctor, and so I miss it.Sometimes when I'm frustrated, I still go back and I still do some practice. So last year, I went to Guatemala. And there's a difference between being in politics and looking at the results and being in medicine and looking at the results.When we were in Guatemala, we were with the University of Utah, and we did about 200 cataract surgeries. One man sticks out in my memory. He was about my age, actually, or a little older. People get cataracts pretty young down there. And he was completely blind. He had lost everything. He lost his wife. He lost 40 pounds. He lost his house. He lost his kids. He had nothing. The church had taken him in, but he was completely and totally functionally blind.But the next day, when we took his patch off, to see the look on his face and the tears of joy and see him fall to his knees and thanking God for getting his vision back, I was, like, Man, this is a lot better than Washington. [laughter]The only time they ever thank God in Washington is when Congress is not in session. [applause]There is a difference, though. There is a big difference. I think maybe sometimes, we may need more of a physician's perspective, a perspective that we can solve problems, figure out the problems and get to a solution somehow, get something done.But so often, it doesn't seem to happen that way. Groucho Marx put it this way. He said the art of politics is looking for problems everywhere, finding them, misdiagnosing them, and applying the wrong remedy.So often, we pick politicians who all look alike. They all sound alike. They all dress alike. And guess what? Nothing ever changes! Government gets bigger and bigger and bigger.So we ask ourselves  we have a decision now. We need to find someone who is going to represent us, someone who's going to be the leader of the Republican Party and make the country a better place.How are we going to get that? Some in our party say, Well, let's just dilute the message. Let's become Democrat lite, and then we'll get more votes.I couldn't disagree more. I think what we need to do is be boldly for what we are for! [applause]We used to be the party that believed in smaller government in Washington, which means lower taxes. When's the last time you heard a Republican run for president who said they were going to cut taxes or actually follow through with it? Our last two nominees  I don't remember any tax cuts being part of their program at all.I'm in Washington now and I listen to them. The Republicans in charge of all of these committees  you know what they want? Revenue-neutral tax reform. I tell people, if that's what we're for, I'm going home. If that's all we're for is revenue-neutral tax reform, that means half of you are going to pay more and half of you pay less, and the net effect for the economy is zero.Why don't we be Reagan Republicans again? Why don't we cut taxes for everybody? [applause]I think we can have manufacturing jobs in our country again, and one of the ways we can do it is by becoming competitive. People aren't going to build stuff here. Companies aren't going to be here if the taxes are higher than the rest of the world.Our corporate income tax is 35 percent. So people don't want to incorporate in America anymore. They want to incorporate overseas. And even the great American companies that are making a lot of profit, they make profit here and they're making it around the world. They won't bring it home. There's $2 trillion of American profits sitting overseas.What I have proposed  and we've done this one time before  what I've proposed is let's lower the rate dramatically to encourage that money to come home. I think there's $600 billion to $700 billion that could come home as a cash infusion, a private stimulus for the marketplace.What I would do with the taxes on that  I would tax it at a low rate, but then I'd take the tax revenue and I'd put it in the highway fund. We're $15 billion short in the highway fund every year.They call it the Highway Trust Fund. Here's a news alert. There is no trust in the trust fund. We're $15 billion short. I think we could actually lower tax, bring money home and build roads all at the same time. I think it's a win, win, win. [applause]I think that's an example of not diluting our message but looking for common ground. My co-sponsor is Barbara Boxer. Now, she and I don't agree on a lot, but we do agree that cutting this tax rate will bring more money home for infrastructure.The president wants more money for infrastructure. I raised my hand at the White House and said I'll help. You voted for this in 2005. The president voted for the same concept for one year, and I said, I'll help. I've got a bill, Mr. President. Will you help? Maybe not so much anymore, but we'll see.We're going to try to put it on the highway bill. Maybe he won't veto the highway bill. If so, we could actually cut our tax and have more revenue coming in.The other reason why I think we ought to be actually tax cuts  why don't we be for tax cuts to help poor people? If you want to help Detroit  Detroit's got 20 percent unemployment. It's devastation. You've got abandoned housing everywhere.If you want to help Detroit, why don't we leave more money in Detroit? So I have something called economic freedom zones. It's kind of like what Jack Kemp talked about years ago, but I say it's John Kemp's plan on steroids.We lower the rate of federal taxes, but if you live in an area of poverty, to almost zero, and we do it for 10 years. There are some employment requirements. You got to hire some people who live in these poor areas to try to help. But for Detroit alone, it would be $1.3 billion. For Appalachia, my state, the poor rural folks that live in the mountains, be nearly a billion dollars.So then we can have a plan for poverty. We can have a plan for poor people. We can have a plan for unemployment. And instead of, let's say, Oh, well, we can get all the votes of people who own business  we're already doing that. If you want to win elections, you got to get the people who work for the people owning the businesses.You got to get out there and say, How are you going to help unemployment? And you could just be like the Democrats and create a new government program, or we could be like Republicans of old and be for tax cuts to help the poor.I think we could create millions of jobs again. When Reagan did this in the early '80s, we created over 20 million jobs. I think a lot of the jobs in the '90s were still being created because of the policies of Reagan in the '80s. To win again, for us to be the dominant party, for us to win not just Texas, not just Georgia, for us to win Ohio, for us to win Michigan, for us to win Pennsylvania, Colorado, all these purple states  New Hampshire  to win these purple states that aren't so easy anymore, I think we need to be the party that defends the entire bill of rights. [applause]We've been  we've been pretty good at defending the 2nd Amendment. You probably won't see anybody coming through here who's not for defending the 2nd Amendment. OK, maybe one or two, but  most of them are going to come through here, and they're for defending the 2nd Amendment. So am I. But you know what? I also want to defend the 4th Amendment. In fact, I don't think you can defend the 2nd Amendment if you don't defend the 4th Amendment. [applause]I'm a Republican who does believe in the right to privacy as enshrined in the 4th Amendment. The 4th Amendment says you can't get into someone's records without naming the person, naming the records, and going to a judge, an independent judge, and saying, I've got probable cause of a crime.But it doesn't mean collecting 300 million people's phone records. The 4th Amendment is not consistent with a warrant that says ""Mr. Verizon on"" it. Last I heard, Mr. Verizon's not a person, and collecting hundreds of millions of records is not right.I tell people, Look, your phone records are yours. You have a privacy interest you maintain no matter who's holding them. Your phone records are yours. And the government  it's none of their damn business what you're doing on your phone. [applause]You can say ""damn"" in New Hampshire, can't you? [laughter]We got to defend the 4th Amendment, the 2nd Amendment, the 1st Amendment. You know what? We need to defend the 5th Amendment. 5th Amendment says everybody gets due process, no matter who you are. Government can't take your stuff, your property, your things without just compensation. And you say, Well, surely they don't. [laughter]Civil forfeiture  this is where the government can take your stuff without you ever being convicted of a crime. The Washington Post has done a series on this for the last six months. You know what they found? Disproportionately, the people affected by it it are minorities. Disproportionately, the people affected by it are poor. Disproportionately, they're people who live in cities where the police have more patrols. I'll give you an example. Cris Sourovelis lives in Philadelphia. His teenage son was selling $40 worth of illegal drugs. OK, punish the kid. Do something to the kid.You know what they did? They came and barricaded the house and took the house and evicted the family from the house. Often, this is a poor family living in the city. The only one that's holding the family together is Grandmother, who owns the house. And her grandkid's selling marijuana out of the back, and you're going to take Grandma's house? It is insane. It ought to stop.But you know who is the biggest purveyor of it? You know who's the biggest hero of civil forfeiture and who defended it recently in committee hearings? Loretta Lynch. Loretta Lynch confiscated  this is the main reason I oppose her. She confiscated... [applause]Loretta Lynch, as U.S. attorney in Manhattan, confiscated over $100 million worth of people's stuff, with no conviction. She went one step further. We passed a reform about 10 years ago letting prosecutors know that they had to file paperwork so the person whose stuff had been taken could get a lawyer and could get a time certain for a date and trial. She took their stuff and never filed the paperwork on purpose so the clock would never start.One company, the Hirsch brothers, were a snack food candy company. She took a half a million dollars from them and kept it for two years.This shouldn't happen in America. I'm part of a movement and part of a bill that says we will reverse and turn justice back the way it should be, that in our country, you should be presumed innocent until found guilty. [applause]Realize that the people you're often talking to, and that we will be talking to if we defend the entire Bill of Rights  the 5th Amendment, the 6th Amendment  may not be the people who've been listening to us so far, may not already be Republicans, but they may want someone to champion their cause.Kalief Browder comes to mind. The New Yorker did a story on Kalief Browder a couple months ago. Kalief Browder's a 16-year-old black kid in the Bronx. He's poor. He's so poor that when he was arrested, parents couldn't make $3,000 bail.He spent three years in Rikers, a 16-year-old kid. I don't know if he was guilty or not, but in America, nobody deserves to be in prison for three years without a trial date. 6th Amendment says you get a trial. It also says you get a speedy trial.I don't know what happened to him in prison. I can only imagine. But he tried to commit suicide four times. This should not happen America. It's disproportionately happening to African-Americans, to Hispanics, to poor people, to people who live in cities who are crowded, where the police come more often, are being treated this way.You know what? If we were all of a sudden the party that cared about the entire Bill of Rights  nobody on the Democrat side's been doing a damn thing about this. All of a sudden, if we were the party of the entire Bill of Rights, the party that was once the party of emancipation, became the party of the entire Bill of Rights again, I think you'd see a sea change. [applause]People ask me, what's the worst thing going on in Washington? Is it ""Obama care""? Is it what the president's done to immigration or war powers? And I say, frankly, it's all of the above, but the category I would lump it all under is that the separation of powers is collapsing.Our founding fathers were so prescient in the sense that they said, we're going to set up these coequal branches. And Madison said, we will pit ambition against ambition. That the ambition to maintain power through the legislature will be pitting against the courts and pitted against the president. Everyone will jealously guard their power.Guess what? Not so much anymore. This is one of the most disappointing things about partisan politics, is Democrats just side with the president. They're not going to stand up to him on immigration because they like what he did. And I think you should stand up to him even if you agree with what he did because you can't have a president who just creates the law on his own!One of our philosophers that our founding fathers looked to was Montesquieu. And Montesquieu wrote and said that when the executive begins to legislate, a form of tyranny will ensue. And people say all the time, well, the president, you know, he's a good man. He won't do anything wrong. That's what his supporters say. [laughter]All right, we'll get beyond that. But here's the thing, is even if you want to accept that, the reason we have rules as for who comes along after that. Madison also said that if government were comprised of angels, we wouldn't have to have any rules or restraint.This is the same kind of thing that went on  a few years ago, we had a debate. In 2011, we had a debate over whether or not an American citizen could be detained without a trial. And people said, well, we've got get terrorists, so we just have to do this. And I said, well, you realize the terrorist could be you. Some of the descriptions of who terrorists might be are people who have changed the color of their hair recently. Anybody in the room? I'm not going to ask. No, that's too personal. [laughter]All right, stains on your clothing, likes to pay in cash, has ammunition at home, has more than one weapon at home. You think there might be a time when you might say, I want my trial, I want my lawyer, and I want my due process?But we had this debate in the Senate, and you'll hear from some of these people because when you hear the loudest critics of me, these are these people. One of them said, well, when they ask for a lawyer, you just tell them shut up. Really? That's the kind of discourse we're going to have in our country, when someone asks for a lawyer in our country, you're going to tell them to shut up?The thing is, is that this debate went on. One of the other senators said, Well  I acted incredulous. I said, you think  you would send an American citizen to Guantanamo Bay without a trial, without a lawyer? He said, yes, if they're dangerous. I said, sort of begs the question, doesn't it? Who gets to decide who's dangerous and who's not dangerous?Have there been a time in our history when we decided who was dangerous based on the color of your skin? Has there been a time in our history when we decided someone was dangerous because of different beliefs, didn't look like us or had a different religion? Are we going to give up on our right to trial so easily?I think of Richard Jewell. Remember Richard Jewell? Everybody said he was the Olympic bomber. The media convicted him. In fact, he won millions of dollars from the media because they convicted him within hours. He fit the profile. He had a backpack on. He was an introvert. He wore glasses.My goodness! Whoo! We're going to be arresting a lot of people.So he's arrested oh he isn't arrested but he's convicted in the media, but he didn't do it. He wasn't the bomber. He had nothing to do with the bombing.But I tell people, the reason why you have due process  think about if Richard Jewell had been a black man in 1920 in the South, what would have happened to him. He might not have survived the day.We were once the party of the Bill of Rights! Let's be that party again because it's the party of the unpopular. The Bill of Rights is more for the unpopular than anyone else. The high school quarterback's always going to do  everything goes well for the high school quarterback. Everything goes well for the prom queen. The Bill of Rights is for the least among us. It's for the least popular among us. It's for the potential... [applause]Of all the things that's gone on in the last six years, of all the scandals  and when I think of those scandals, I think of Old McDonald's farm of scandals. Here a scandal, there a scandal, everywhere a scandal. [laughter]But when I think of the scandals, the one that probably bothers me the most is Benghazi. [applause]The reason is this. We have a potential nominee on the other side who wants to be the commander-in-chief. There is a bar you must cross. Will you defend the country? Will you provide security when it's requested?To me, it has nothing to do with the talking points. Everybody talked about the talking points. That was spin. It was disingenuous. It was politics as normal. But that to me wasn't so important.Even the day of, I could grant that mistakes could be made, and maybe we couldn't get adequate support there because of the distance. However, someone made the mistake of having the support systems too far away. Someone should be told about that and it should be corrected.But really, what I fault Hillary Clinton for most is, is that for nine months, they pleaded. Day in, day out they pleaded for help. In February, you have a six-man  or six-person special operations unit brought home. A month later, another six-person operation unit brought home. You get to April, and they're saying  this is the ambassador, Stevens  We want a DC-3 to go to get around the plane in case of emergency. And as you recall, when the emergency came, they were begging the Libyans to use a plane.So they didn't get the plane. Hillary Clinton's State Department turns down the plane. And you know what she approved three days later? An electrical charging station for the Chevy Volt... [laughter] for the embassy in Vienna. It seems the ambassador in Vienna was greening up the place, wanted to show off how green he was. So he got Chevy Volts, which you all paid to subsidize. We send them over there. Then they discovered the plug doesn't work. So we spend another $100,000 on charging stations to prove how green we are, and yet not enough money for a 50-year-old plane to fly the ambassador around in case of emergency.This goes on all summer long. Hillary Clinton's State Department sent three comedians to India on the ""make chai not war"" tour. [laughter]She spent $650,000 on Facebook ads. It seems the State Department does not have enough likes on their Facebook. [laughter]She spent $5 million on crystal barware. All along, not enough money for security. Time after time after time, the soldiers were told not to wear their military-style boots because they didn't want to offend the Libyans. They didn't want a show of weapons because it's politically incorrect to show weapons. They were in the middle of a war zone, which gets me even farther back. Why the hell did we ever go into Libya in the first place? [applause]This is something, if you watch closely, will separate me from many other Republicans. The other Republicans will criticize the president and Hillary Clinton for their foreign policy, but they would have just done the same thing just 10 times over. Every one of the ones who will criticize me wanted troops on the ground, our troops on the ground in Libya.I think it was a mistake to be in Libya. We are less safe. Jihadists swim in our swimming pool now! It's a disaster! We should have never been there! [applause]So we go through the summer. Security request after security request denied, denied, denied. We get to August. Ambassador Stevens is sending his own cables directly to Hillary Clinton  we are worried about being overrun by the jihadists.So when she came before my committee, that's the question I asked her. I said, Mrs. Clinton, did you read the cables? And her answer was, like, oh, no, that's way below my pay grade. Really? Libya is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, and you didn't read the cables directly from the ambassador?I think that her dereliction of duty, her not doing her job, her not providing security for our forces, for our diplomatic missions should forever preclude her from holding higher office! [applause]Thank you. Thanks you.If we want to protect and continue our prosperity at home, we do have to defend ourselves. Without question, the number one priority of the federal government is national defense. When I look at spending, no matter what it is, I think the priority is defending the country. It's the one thing you have to do at the federal level. [applause]But we have to decide when getting involved is good and when it's not so good. There's a group of folks in our party who think it's always good. There's a group of folks in our party who would have troops in six countries right now, maybe more. There's people in our party who supported giving arms to Gadhafi before they supported giving arms to the freedom fighters, who turned out to be al Qaeda.So the thing is, is I'm not saying don't be involved around the world. I'm not saying don't defend our interests. We do have to do something. But think about it. As a physician, we're taught first do no harm. Think about it before we get involved. Libya was a mistake. In fact, if you can say one thing that is probably true in the Middle East, every time we have toppled a secular dictator, a secular strongman, we've gotten chaos and the rise of radical Islam.If we want to defend our country, we have to know the enemy, and we have to name the enemy! [applause]The president won't name the enemy, but I will. It's radical Islam. Until we name it, we cannot defeat them. And I can tell you this, that if I'm ever the commander-in-chief, I will do everything it takes to stop and defend the country against radical Islam. [applause]As we move forward in the process, you'll hear from a lot of folks from all different spectrums of the party. But one thing I'd like to leave with you is I'd like you to think about how we're going to move forward and how we're going to win. And I think we need to stay true to principle. I don't think we need to dilute our message, but I do think that our message needs to be carried to new people.We need to talk to... [applause]We need to talk to business owners. We need to talk to the workers. We need to talk to rich, poor, white, black, brown. We've got to get out there and go places we haven't been going.And as we take our message forward, as we proclaim our message, I like to think of the image of  Robert Henri was a painter, and he said to young painters, he said, ""Paint like a man coming over the hill singing."" I think when we proclaim our message with the passion of Patrick Henry, but also like a man coming over the hill singing, then I think we'll be the dominant party again.Thank you very much.Thank you. Thank you. [applause]Do we have time?Unknown Speaker: [off-mike]Unknown Speaker: [off-mike]Paul: OK, I'm told we have time for two or three questions, as long as they're easy questions. [laughter]Unknown Speaker: [off-mike] Unknown Speaker: On the day that Hillary Clinton announced that she was running for president, Elizabeth Warren was on television announcing that she was not running for president. Do you believe that the Democrats will run Elizabeth Warren as Hillary's vice president? And if so, how do we respond to that challenge?Paul: I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes, one for her and her entourage and one for her baggage. [applause]I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering. [laughter]And I'm concerned really that there probably will end up being more of a primary than anybody thinks over there because here's the thing. I mean, the whole e-mail thing  she just sort of above the rules. She doesn't have to use a government server. And it's, like, Oh, well, the  my server was protected by the Secret Service. Does she think there's, like, floppy disks in her basement? [laughter]I mean, I'm  there's a lot going on. There's more coming, too. The Clinton Foundation's been involved in a lot of things, so have their donors. There's going to be a lot of conflict of interest.And I think it really  if she wants to be this candidate that proclaims about women's rights, taking money from Saudi Arabia, Brunei  a woman... [applause]A few years ago, a woman was raped, gang raped by seven men in Saudi Arabia. They arrested the woman and probably gave her 90 lashes for being in a car with an unmarried man.Does anybody remember South Africa and apartheid and how everybody rose up and people quit investing? You'd think she'd be leading a disinvestment program against Saudi Arabia instead of taking their money.But she's got a lot going on, so I think it'll be more spirited. Probably maybe Elizabeth Warren's not running, but I wouldn't preclude anybody yet in the Democrat primary because I think there's a lot going on over there. And she's had a pretty difficult month or two. I think she's going to have more when she finally starts taking questions.Unknown Speaker: Woman in the red right here.Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is probably more of a states question, but you made me think of it when you brought up the house in Detroit and how it was taken from the grandmother, and we have seen several situations lately. In fact, there was one right in the Boston area, where a child goes into the hospital. The doctor and the parents disagree, and the child is taken away from the parents, not for good reason.And then the courts get involved, and the child's away from parents for a year-and-a-half. In Arkansas, it's happening because it's a home schooling situation.Is there anything presidential level or senatorial level that  these kind of things  we're not talking about children...Unknown Speaker: [off-mike]Paul: Well, I think  I  I'm very aware of the circumstances you're talking about. And I can tell you, like with home schooling, in my state, I have a friend who was home schooled 30 years ago, and his parents were arrested. This was before any of the laws changed. But it sparked the change in law. And Kentucky was one of the first states to allow home schooling. But his parents were indicted and were threatened with a year in prison, were on their way towards court when the legislature finally changed the law.Some of this stuff with medical questions gets very complicated, but I would courts would want to start out with parental rights, and it'd be very, very rare, if ever, that children taken away from parents. But you can't say never because there are  there are times when it happens. But I'm a big believer in the family and that the rights originate from the family.Unknown Speaker: Last question. We'll go right here [off-mike]Unknown Speaker: Thank you for coming to New Hampshire, Senator. Recent reports indicate that ISIS has camps just south of the border, and some people say they're actually in the United States in camps.The military doctrine of the United States is to attack them before they get that close to our borders. Will you use military force to prevent ISIS from moving closer to us?Paul: The short answer is yes. The longer answer is, is that in December of this year, I actually introduced a declaration of war against ISIS. My main complaint has been that we dither along and the president does it unilaterally, I mean, that Congress isn't involved. The Constitution's very clear. When we go to war, it has to be through representatives and it has to be through Congress.And so they wouldn't bring it up. So in December, they were passing a water bill for water aid to Africa, and I attached a declaration of war against ISIS. They weren't very happy with me. [laughter]But I've told people that had I been president last summer as ISIS began its onslaught and began its movement  and the main reason for me to say we should be involved  I  I do look for an American interest, not just bad people, but an American interest.Our consulate in Irbil, which is in Kurdistan  it's close, and I thought it was endangered and I thought Baghdad was increasingly in danger, and the Iraqis are sort of our erstwhile allies. I'd say erstwhile because I think they need tear-away uniforms so they can run quicker. [laughter]Yes, ISIS is a threat. But I would also put ISIS into the context of things, and if we don't do this, we're never going to learn. Why did ISIS grow stronger and how did ISIS grow stronger?Well, we put 600 tons worth of weapons in the Syrian civil war. You've got Assad on one side. You've got two million Christians living under Assad. And then you have the Islamic rebels.All the weapons we gave were to the Islamic rebels. Now, we say we didn't give them to ISIS, but a lot of them wound up in the hands of ISIS. I voted against arming the Islamic rebels because I said the irony is one day, we'll be back fighting against our own weapons. And now it's true.So we do have to think when is intervention good or bad? There's nobody good in that civil war. There's not one of the Islamic rebel groups that would recognize Israel, OK? So that's one side of the war. The other side is Assad.But I've met a lot of Syrian Christians. And the next time you come across somebody who's either from Syria or is a Syrian Christian or related to one, you ask them, which would you pick, ISIS or Assad ? No question they'd pick Assad because he's tolerated Christians to a certain extent. And he's not a great guy. He's a tyrant. But compare that to ISIS, you know? But yes, now we do have to do something. So I  I support military action against ISIS.Unknown Speaker: [off-mike] one last question from Alexandria Knox. Alexandria, raise your hand. You have the last question.Unknown Speaker: Thank you so much, Senator, for taking my question. I noted  I remember your issue on the national right to work. You were going to pass the National Right to Work Act. Is that your plan as president?Paul: Yes. I'm a big fan of right to work either at the local level... [applause] local level, state level or national level. I think we will get a vote on it. I've been there four years, and we haven't gotten a very many votes because a certain senator from Nevada's been in charge. But now there's a  now there's a change of leadership, and my hope is to get votes on several things, and national right to work's one of them.Thanks, everybody. [applause]Thanks for having me."
