Bobby Jindal,R,s,"June 25, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal on Today's Supreme Court Ruling,"Today, the Supreme Court had its say; soon, the American people will have theirs.President Obama would like this to be the end of the debate on Obamacare, but it isn't. The debate will continue because the law has failed to accomplish its prime objective: Containing health care costs.Republicans must outline a clear and coherent vision for health care to win the trust of the American people to repeal Obamacare. And right now, I am the only candidate to put forward a comprehensive plan.Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, the debate will grow. Conservatives must be fearless in demanding that our leaders in Washington repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that will lower health care costs and restore freedom."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"June 26, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal on the Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling,"Today, Governor Jindal released the following statement on the gay marriage ruling issued by the United States Supreme Court:Governor Jindal said, ""The Supreme Court decision today conveniently and not surprisingly follows public opinion polls, and tramples on states' rights that were once protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution. Marriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that.This decision will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision. This ruling must not be used as pretext by Washington to erode our right to religious liberty.The government should not force those who have sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage to participate in these ceremonies. That would be a clear violation of America's long held commitment to religious liberty as protected in the First Amendment.I will never stop fighting for religious liberty and I hope our leaders in D.C. join me."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"June 29, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Change Course or the Greek Economic Collapse Will Happen Here,"BATON ROUGE  Today, Governor Jindal released the following statement about Greece and its economy:Governor Jindal said, ""Every American should pay close attention to the economic collapse that is occurring in Greece. People's savings are wiped out, banks are shuttered, ATM's are out of money, and there is nowhere to turn.""This is the American future if we continue going down the road that President Obama has us on, and that Hillary Clinton wants to continue and even accelerate.""We never balance our budget, we never cut federal government spending, our federal government wastes money irresponsibly, the President has nearly doubled our debt to an unthinkable 18 trillion, our entitlement programs are on the way to bankruptcy, and yet we just created a new one in Obamacare.""Greece will happen here if we do not change course. Anyone who disagrees with this is a 'math denier'.""Greece is now coming to the pot of gold that awaits at the end of the socialist rainbow, and Hillary Clinton pledges to take America further down the road to socialism.""We can win the future by shrinking the government economy and growing the American economy. Or, we can destroy our future by continuing on our present course. This is the choice the American people will have to make in November of 2016."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"June 30, 2015","Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Secretary Clinton Breached National Security, U.S. Only Superpower Not Seeing Secretary Clinton's E-mails","WEST DES MOINES, IA  Governor Bobby Jindal said Secretary Hillary Clinton has ""created a major breach of national security"" by hiding her e-mails on a personal server and that the United States may be the only superpower in the world who hasn't seen the Secretary's e-mails.Governor Jindal said, ""Today the State Department plans to release more of Hillary Clinton's e-mails from her private server. Every time this happens, it gets treated as breaking news. But there are two very important things in this continuing drama that are routinely overlooked.""First, the American public is only getting the emails that Hillary Clinton herself is allowing us to see. She has already edited the e-mails, and has already destroyed the ones she did not want us to see, which makes the whole thing a meaningless charade.""Secondly, and far more importantly, by choosing to use her own server in her own house she created a major breach of national security. Everyone seems to focus on the dishonesty, the lack of transparency, and the fact that she destroyed all these records. But those are standard practices for the Clintons. ""The real issue is that while the American people will never see these emails, it is likely that the Russians and the Chinese already have all of them. This is the real consequence of having a Secretary of State who unlawfully chose to conduct America's foreign policy business on her own private email system.""If the Congressional leaders really want to see all of Hillary Clinton's e-mails, they would have a better chance of getting them from the hackers working for foreign governments. We are likely the only superpower in the world that will never see Hillary Clinton's e-mails."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"July 16, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal on the Chattanooga Shooting,"Today, Governor Jindal issued the following statement on the shooting in Chattanooga:Gov. Jindal said, ""This apparent act of terrorism has taken the lives of four American heroes, and our hearts and prayers are with their families. While it's too early to know for sure what happened, it certainly looks like an act of terrorism. We must pursue justice on their behalf and stop at nothing to hunt down and kill these evildoers abroad before more of them come here to kill our people.""This shooting underscores the grave reality of the threat posed to us by Radical Islamic terrorism every single day. It's time for the White House to wake up and tell the truth...and the truth is that Radical Islam is at war with us, and we must start by being honest about that. ""There have been many bad things that have happened under President Obama. One that stands out to me was the horrible shooting at Ft. Hood...which was clearly an act of terrorism by a Radical Islamist. Yet the White House labeled that horrible act as 'workplace violence.' ""This is grotesque. You cannot defeat evil until you admit that it exists."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"July 17, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Tell the Truth on Radical Islam,"Today, Governor Bobby Jindal called on the President to tell the truth on Radical Islam. Gov. Jindal said, ""It's time to stop pretending that things are fine in the world of Islam. America's political correctness must now come to an end. And America's President must stop pretending and he must speak clearly and plainly about the fact that Islam has a problem, and that problem is Radical Islam. You cannot defeat evil until you admit that it exists.""Islamic leaders must do more than simply condemn violence. They must clearly say to every Muslim in the world that murder will not be rewarded in the afterlife, but rather it will be severely punished. They have to say that these acts are evil and will be punished.""I've said this before and it gets glossed over. This must happen. We have no idea how many people are being wooed by Radical Islam, with the sick and deceitful promise of glory in the afterlife if they will murder innocent people.""Islamic leaders must put a stop to this. This is not too much to ask, and President Obama should demand this of all Islamic leaders."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"July 24, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal on the Shooting in Lafayette,"Whenever a horrific incident like this happens, it makes me both sick and furious. I think I speak for every parent, when I say that this makes you want to hug your own children. This could have been my family, it could have been yours.""I would ask everyone to take a moment and pray for the injured and for the families that have lost a loved one.""The evil that exists in our world is shocking and appalling. But let us not forget the good that exists in people's hearts. There were acts of enormous bravery and heroism during this terrible incident.""From the two teachers who shielded one another and sounded the alarm, to the fast response of our law enforcement officers, brave men and women helped end this horrific incident.""One of the great things about America is that when one of us is hurting, all of us are hurting. We are going to wrap our arms around them and show them the love that is the foundation of our character as a nation.""Lafayette is a great American city and the people here are very strong. I know they will come through this as law enforcement officials conduct their investigation."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"August 11, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Hillary Clinton Is One Email Away from Prison,"Hillary Clinton is already under investigation by the FBI. Now she's signed a sworn affidavit to a federal judge, under penalty of perjury, that she has handed over all of her government business emails.Which means that she's one email away from prison time. She'd better pray the Chinese government doesn't do a document dump.Maybe her friend Martha Stewart can stop giving her interior decorating advice and give her jailhouse survival tips instead. Orange really will be the new black."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"August 18, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Governor Walker's Health Care Plan is New Federal Entitlement Program,"SIOUX CITY, IOWA  Governor Bobby Jindal said today that Governor Walker endorsed the ""fundamental underpinning of Obamacare"" and called for a new entitlement program in the proposal he outlined today to repeal Obamacare. Governor Jindal was the first presidential candidate to offer a detailed plan to repeal and replace all of Obamacare in April 2014.Governor Jindal said, ""In a health care plan that is light on specifics, Governor Walker endorsed the fundamental underpinning of Obamacare  the notion that America needs another entitlement program.""In Governor Walker's plan, a new entitlement is created for every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare[1]. It is frankly shocking that a Republican candidate for President would author a cradle to grave plan like this.""Governor Walker has taken the bait laid out for him by the President, and has accepted the notion that we need a new federal government entitlement program, and now he is merely quibbling over the details. So here we are again, not standing on free market principles, but rather, establishing ourselves as 'cheaper Democrats.'""Yes, there are good features to Governor Walker's plan. But, his plan is fundamentally accepting the premise of Obamacare  that we need a new federal entitlement program.""I think this may be what Jeb Bush was referring to when he said we need to be willing to lose the primary. Surely we as Republicans have more courage than this. Surely we can do better than simply producing our own versions of Obamacare lite.""In fact we can, I outlined a detailed conservative plan to repeal and replace Obamacare without a new federal entitlement program. My plan focuses on driving down the cost of health care by embracing free market reforms.""And now for the real kicker  Governor Walker's new entitlement plan is very Washington in that it fails to tell us what it will cost. It looks to me to be roughly $400 billion dollars a year. And we all know what that means, either raise taxes or add to the debt, which is so very Washington.""When did conservatism die? When did we accept the idea of dependence on government? Governor Walker is confused here. In his stump speech he has some clever lines about how the Fourth of July is about independence, not dependence. I like those lines. But with this Obamacare lite health care proposal, he's going to have to drop those lines from his speech.""[1] The Day One Freedom Plan, My Plan To Repeal and Replace Obamacare, Chart on Page 9, Walker for President Website,https://www.scottwalker.com/obamacare-plan/files/Day-One-Patient-Freedom-Plan.pdf"
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"August 28, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Secretary Clinton Should Take a Look in the Mirror,"Comparison of pro-life Americans to terrorists exposes Clinton's hypocrisy on women's rightsNew Orleans, LA  Reacting to Hillary Clinton's comparison of Americans to foreign terrorists, Governor Bobby Jindal today released the following statement.""Secretary Clinton must be very confused. She seems to think that the 50% of Americans who oppose abortion are 'terrorists'. She thinks the people who make money killing unborn babies and selling their body parts are noble.""Before Hillary Clinton talks about the treatment of women, she should take a look in the mirror and reflect on her own actions. Her foundation has raised money from countries that prevent women from driving, legalize spousal rape, and allow for genital mutilation.""Here's the amazing thing when it comes to terror  while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, her foundation received money from one of the world's leading financial sponsors of Hamas, a group on the State Department's own list of banned terrorist organizations.""###BackgroundSecretary Clinton's comments can be viewed here:Qatar has pledged more than $400m to terror group Hamas since 2012:http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-foundation-hamas-share-major-donor/Hamas was on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and at the time it made donations to the Clinton Foundation:http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm"
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"August 31, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Immigration Without Assimilation is Invasion,"Yesterday on CBS, I said those who come here should want to be Americans  they should assimilate, roll up their sleeves and get to work. I said that immigration without assimilation is invasion. When did it become politically incorrect to say immigrants should want to be Americans? You either want to become an American and be all in, or you don't. Let's insist on being the melting pot. Let's forget this politically correct liberal notion that we're not a melting pot anymore."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"September 2, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Republicans Surrendered to Obama on Iran Deal,"Every single Republican Senator in D.C. except for Sen. Tom Cotton supported the Corker framework. That's when Republicans surrendered to President Obama on the Iran deal. Many have argued that bill paved the way for Obama to only need 34 votes to win.By endorsing the Corker-Cardin framework, the Senators allowed the deal to go ahead. Amazingly, only one Senator had the sense to oppose this. It was not any of the four Republican Senators running for President, it was not Ted Cruz, it was Tom Cotton. He was the only one who had the guts to stand up and say no. The vote was 98-1 by the way.Here's the real problem  Republicans in Washington got conned by the President. The Iranians conned the President, and the President conned the Republicans in the Senate. Senate Republicans are the only ones who are worse negotiators than President Obama."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"September 9, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Demand Senate Republicans Force a Vote on the Iran Deal,This deal with Iran is the equivalent of the United States negotiating with terrorists. Every United States Senator must be forced to vote and show the American people whether they support or oppose this dangerous new strategy.
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"September 22, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Why is Harry Reid Still Running the Senate?,"Today, Senate Democrats blocked Senate Republicans from passing a 20-week abortion ban. It appears that even though voters gave Republicans control of the Senate in 2014, Harry Reid is still running the Senate.I wish Senate Republicans showed half the fight that Senate Democrats did."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"September 23, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: President Obama Lied to Pope Francis,"BATON ROUGE  Today, Governor Jindal said that President Obama lied to Pope Francis this morning when he said Americans must be free to live out their faith. Governor Jindal pointed out that simply is not reality in America today:Governor Jindal said, ""President Obama lied to Pope Francis. The President told the Pope that, in America, people must be free to live out their faith without fear of intimidation. That's the opposite of reality in America today, Mr. President. We have Christians who are jailed for their closely-held religious beliefs. We have Christians fined thousands of dollars by the government simply because they didn't bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.""Meanwhile, liberals are spending their time excoriating Christian conservatives, demanding that they publicly profess their support for a theoretical Muslim president that doesn't exist. Here's a reality check: Christians are Americans, too, with the same rights as everyone else. This President has not protected Christians and their constitutionally-guaranteed religious freedom, and it's time we have a president who will.""Background:You can read President Obama's comments here."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"September 24, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: DC Needs Term Limits,"America needs term limits. Both parties have done a terrible job in DC, and it's time we clean house. DC was not designed to have a permanent political class like we have today."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"October 14, 2015","Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Nationally-Focused Debate Criteria Ignores Reality, Hurts Early States, Helps Trump","IOWA CITY, IOWA  Governor Bobby Jindal spoke out today on the Republican National Committee's upcoming sanctioned presidential debate, hosted by CNBC, and its unfair criteria for candidate participation.Governor Jindal said, ""Two weeks ago, I was surprised to learn that the criteria for participating in the upcoming RNC-sanctioned presidential debate do not take into account performance in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.""No candidate for President has won the nomination of my party without winning in either Iowa or New Hampshire in the modern era, and I suspect that pattern will continue this year. I've been gaining ground and campaigning hard in the state where Republicans will cast the first real votes for President in 2016: Iowa.""While some in Washington have wrongly suggested that Iowa and NH should not be the first states in future elections, they are in fact the first states in this election. By ignoring the early states and instead only looking at meaningless national name ID polls, the networks are in effect trying to create a national primary. They are attempting to winnow the field long before the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire get to cast their ballots by restricting access to debates.""The primary beneficiary of this process is Donald Trump, a candidate completely devoid of substance, but a candidate who is well known nationally for his TV show and his juvenile antics. What he lacks in depth or seriousness he more than makes up for with national name recognition from his long career as an entertainer.""Just as Chairman Priebus was the only person with the power and authority to attempt to correct the problems he saw in our 2012 nominating process, he is also the only person with the power and authority to force the networks to measure progress in Iowa and NH, and stop ignoring the reality of how we nominate our nominee for President."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"October 16, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Stand with Israel,"Over the past week, Israel has faced a wave of terrorist attacks from radical, violent Palestinians. The Obama Administration is unable to determine who is right and wrong between Palestinian terrorists killing innocent Israelis and the Israeli government protecting its' citizens. Just this week, a State Department spokesman said ""I would say certainly individuals on both sides of this divide are  have proven capable of and in our view guilty of acts of terror.""That is despicable.And unfortunately, this is just another incident in a pattern of anti-Israel behavior and rhetoric by the Obama administration.It has to stop. The United States must have a President who will once again say clearly to the world that Israel is our friend, and we stand firmly with them.When Hillary Clinton calls for ""dialogue"" as the solution to end the terrorist attacks against Israel, she implies that Israelis are responsible for terrorists attacking them. In fairness to Hillary, she probably actually believes that, but it is flat out wrong.Israel shouldn't engage in ""dialogue"" with terrorists. Israel should destroy terrorists - and the United States should stand with Israel when it does so."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"October 16, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Hillary Clinton Now Supports Gun Confiscation,"Today, Governor Jindal slammed Hillary Clinton for saying the federal government should look at confiscating the guns of law-abiding citizens. Governor Jindal said, ""Today in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton came out in favor of gun confiscation, further cementing her support for socialism in America. Secretary Clinton's comment takes the phrase gun control to a whole new level. Calling it gun control doesn't event do this justice  this is gun seizure. Secretary Clinton's comment is an example of the nanny state on display. She won't stop with just taking away our guns and our Second Amendment rights, she will come for everything else that she and her big government elitist colleagues think is bad for us dim-witted Americans. ""When the government confiscated guns after Katrina, I passed a law so it would never happen again  and I won't let Hillary do it now. Hillary Clinton can't dictate our religious beliefs, and she certainly can't take our guns."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"November 3, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal: Make Intelligence a Criteria For Next Debate,"BATON ROUGE  As candidates call for new debate criteria, Governor Jindal has a new suggestion  make intelligence part of the criteria for the next Republican presidential debate.Governor Jindal said, ""Amidst all this chatter about criteria to participate in debates  I've got a suggestion.""How about this  if you want to participate in the next Republican debate, you should be required to be smart enough to have a plan to replace Obamacare and restore freedom and sanity to America's health care system.""I introduced a detailed plan to replace Obamacare over a year ago, and only one other candidate has even attempted to write a plan.""Ted Cruz likes to try to shut down the government over Obamacare, but he's never even bothered to come up with a replacement plan.""All the candidates complain about Obamacare and campaign against it, but they don't apparently have the smarts or the courage to produce their own plan.""Most of these candidates simply have stale talking points on Obamacare and health care reform.""The Democrats' government takeover of American health care is the most significant domestic policy event of the past decade, and is the tip of the spear in the drive toward transforming the American economy into a socialist economy.""And yet, most of our candidates can't even figure out or think through how they would replace it.""If you want to lead the free world, you should be required to tell the voters how you will do it."""
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"November 12, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal on the Absurdity of Political Correctness on College Campuses,"I don't know all the details of the situation at the University of Missouri, and I've never tolerated racism of any kind and never will.But it's time for someone to speak truth here  the absurdity of political correctness on college campuses is laughable, but the consequences are not.President Obama has encouraged a culture of professional victimhood and grievance. Everyone is encouraged to be a victim.This PC atmosphere is turning students into intellectual toddlers who will be unprepared for life in the real world.They will be completely incapable of dealing with any adversity and unprepared to handle freedom of thought or expression.How will these emotional juveniles be able to compete with the rest of the world? Imagine them negotiating with the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians. Perhaps they will ban certain words? Or demand the establishment of a ""safe zone.""Our colleges and universities should be defenders of free speech and the First Amendment. They should prepare students for the simple fact that in the real world you do not get to dictate what you will and will not deal with. If they don't do this, they are hurting the students."
Bobby Jindal,R,s,"November 17, 2015",Statement by Governor Bobby Jindal Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities,"I cannot tell you what an honor it has been to run for President of the United States of America. My parents came to this country 45 years ago searching for freedom and a chance.When I was born, we lived in student housing at LSU, and never in their wildest dreams did they think their son would have the opportunity to serve as Governor of Louisiana or to run for President.They raised me to believe Americans can do anything, and they were right, we can. But this is not my time, so I am suspending my campaign for President.Going forward, I believe we have to be the party of growth and we can never stop being the party that believes in opportunity. We cannot settle for The Left's view of envy and division. We have to be the party that says everyone in this country - no matter the circumstances of their birth or who their parents are  can succeed in America.One of the things I will do is go back to work at the think tank I started a few years ago - where I will be outlining a blueprint for making this the American century.We must show the way forward on growing our economy and winning the war against terror, and especially defeating radical Islam.I realize that our country is off on the wrong track right now. Everyone knows that, but don't forget, this is still the greatest country in the history of the world  and every single one of us should start every day by thanking God that we are fortunate enough to be US citizens.Now is the time for all those Americans who still believe in freedom and American exceptionalism to stand up and defend it. The idea of America  the idea that my parents came here for almost a half a century ago - that idea is slipping away from us. Freedom is under assault from both outside our borders and from within. We must act now, we do not have a moment to spare."
