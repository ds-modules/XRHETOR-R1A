George Pataki,R,s,"July 14, 2015",Statement by Governor Pataki on the Iran Nuclear Deal,"New York, New York - The Iran deal announced today is a colossal catastrophic capstone to the failed Obama - Clinton foreign policy. Rewarding the world's leading sponsor of state terror with billions in funds and the currency of legitimacy is as dumbfounding as it is dangerous.The accord makes the region and the world less safe and poses an unacceptable threat to our allies and friends especially Israel.""Trust but verify"" has been a hallmark of America's nuclear non-proliferation policy since President Reagan. National Security advisor Susan Rice actually promised that an agreement with Iran would go beyond and ""distrust but verify."" This agreement with Iran fails to meet either standard and in the end will only deepen the distrust of America with our allies.For example, the accord provides that if International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors find something suspicious at a military they must bring its concerns back to a joint commission for review. That commission, which is required to seek an explanation from Iran, has in total twenty-four days to render an opinion whether an actual inspection is warranted. The Obama administration's straight-faced assertion that twenty-four days is not enough time to cover up a violation is about as logical as their claim that an obscure video ignited the riots in Benghazi.Finally, while separated by oceans and a continent we know terror knows no borders. With this deal Israel is less safe but so too is America. It should be painfully obvious that a government that endorses the credo ""Death to America"" is a danger to our safety security.America must never forget the lessons of September 11th and as the Governor of New York during those dark days I pledged to do whatever was in my power to keep us safe from further attacks. I'm saddened and shocked that in endorsing this deal Senator Clinton has so clearly forgotten the lesson of those days. We know that whether it's ISIS or Iran, America can never give quarter or condone any state that supports radical Islamic terror.Congress should act immediately, reject this deal and send a message to President Obama, Secretary Clinton the UN and leaders throughout the globe that America does not reward terror."
George Pataki,R,s,"November 5, 2015",Statement by Governor Pataki on the Fox Business Debate,"I am very disappointed tonight that early national polls are shaping the election choices for the American people. This new trend is a danger to our primary system, a disservice to voters everywhere  especially those in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina  and a clear boost to the worship of celebrity over accomplishment and ideas.""Running for the most important leadership position in the world shouldn't be reduced to the level of ""American Idol"" or ""Survivor."" The voters  not networks driven by ratings or national polls that are statistically irrelevant  should decide our next president."""
George Pataki,R,s,"November 13, 2015",Statement by Governor Pataki on the Paris Attacks,"In every way and manner the attacks of September 11, 2001 caught America and the world by surprise. Tonight's attacks in Paris, while a shock are sadly, tragically predictable. They are not the result of a video or in retaliation for some other perceived affront  they are a natural outgrowth of unchecked aggression by radical Islamic extremists.The Obama-Clinton-Kerry axis of evasion, equivocation and error has left America and our allies around the world at the mercy of these cowards. Whether ISIS is ultimately directly responsible or not, radical Islam is not contained; it is a cancer that is metastasizing across Europe and today threatens our own shores.The random, abject horror of Islamic terror has washed red upon our shores before and I'm running for President to ensure it never does again. For the past year I have repeatedly warned that America is more at risk of attack than anytime since 2001. Sadly that is clear to everyone today, except of course our President. The days of September 11th have never left me. The senseless loss, the hell on earth, the inconsolable and unimaginable sense of loss. Hillary Clinton was there with me, but you wouldnt know it today.ISIS claims ""American blood is best."" We know their plan  they intend to do here what they did in Paris.We must take action. The Clinton-Obama foreign policy is a disaster. ISIS, al Qaeda and their branches are recruiting, planning and plotting to kill us here  we must kill them there. We must put an immediate halt to granting asylum to Syrian refugees. We must stop the travel of Syrian refugees travelling to the United States from Europe. We must end sanctuary cities. We must end their recruitment on social media.First, we must stand together as Americans and then we must unite with our allies who are resolved to bring the full force of the civilized world down on ISIS.Tonight the Freedom Tower shines with ithe colors of America's oldest ally. As they stood with us, we stand with them. Our thoughts, our prayers and our hearts are with the people of France."
