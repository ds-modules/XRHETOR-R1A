Jeb Bush,R,c,"June 15, 2015","Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President at Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida","Thank you all very much. I always feel welcome at Miami-Dade College. This is a place that welcomes everyone with their hearts set on the future  a place where hope leads to achievement, and striving leads to success. For all of us, it is just the place to be in the campaign that begins today.We are 17 months from the time for choosing. The stakes for America's future are about as great as they come. Our prosperity and our security are in the balance. So is opportunity, in this nation where every life matters and everyone has the right to rise.Already, the choice is taking shape. The party now in the White House is planning a no-suspense primary, for a no-change election. To hold onto power. To slog on with the same agenda under another name: That's our opponents' call to action this time around. That's all they've got left.And you and I know that America deserves better.They have offered a progressive agenda that includes everything but progress. They are responsible for the slowest economic recovery ever, the biggest debt increases ever, a massive tax increase on the middle class, the relentless buildup of the regulatory state, and the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making.I, for one, am not eager to see what another four years would look like under that kind of leadership.The presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next.So, here's what it comes down to. Our country is on a very bad course. And the question is: What are we going to do about it?The question for me is: What am I going to do about it?And I have decided.I am a candidate for President of the United States.We will take command of our future once again in this country.We will lift our sights again, make opportunity common again, get events in the world moving our way again.We will take Washington  the static capital of this dynamic country  out of the business of causing problems.We will get back on the side of free enterprise and free people.I know we can fix this. Because I've done it.Here, in this great and diverse state that looks so much like America.So many challenges could be overcome if we just get this economy growing at full strength. There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of four percent a year.And that will be my goal as President  four percent growth, and the 19 million new jobs that come with it.Economic growth that makes a difference for hard-working men and women  who don't need reminding that the economy is more than the stock market.Growth that lifts up the middle class  all the families who haven't gotten a raise in 15 years. Growth that makes a difference for everyone.It's possible.It can be done.We made Florida number one in job creation and number one in small business creation. 1.3 million new jobs, 4.4 percent growth, higher family income, eight balanced budgets, and tax cuts eight years in a row that saved our people and businesses 19 billion dollars.All this plus a bond upgrade to Triple-A compared to the sorry downgrade of America's credit in these years. That was the commitment, and that is the record that turned this state around.I also used my veto power to protect our taxpayers from needless spending.And if I am elected President, I'll show Congress how that's done.Leaders have to think big, and we've got a tax code filled with small-time thinking and self-interested politics. What swarms of lobbyists have done, we can undo with a vastly simpler system  clearing out special favors for the few reducing rates for all.What the IRS, EPA, and entire bureaucracy have done with overregulation, we can undo by act of Congress and order of the President.Federal regulation has gone far past the consent of the governed.It is time to start making rules for the rule-makers.When we get serious about limited government, we can pursue the great and worthy goals that America has gone too long without.We can build our future on solvency instead of borrowed money.We can honor our commitments on the strength of fiscal integrity.With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation  and with Presidential leadership, we can make it happen within five years.If we do all of this, if we do it relentlessly, and if we do it right, we will make the United States of America an economic superpower like no other.We will also challenge the culture that has made lobbying the premier growth industry in the nation's capital.The rest of the country struggles under big government, while comfortable, complacent interest groups in Washington have been thriving on it.A self-serving attitude can take hold in any capital, just as it once did in Tallahassee.I was a governor who refused to accept that as the normal or right way of conducting the people's business.I will not accept it as the standard in Washington.We don't need another President who merely holds the top spot among the pampered elites of Washington.We need a President willing to challenge and disrupt the whole culture in our nation's capital.I will be that President because I was a reforming governor, not just another member of the club.There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd or filing an amendment and calling that success. As our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that.We are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it.In government, if we get a few big things right, we can make life better for millions of people, especially for kids in public schools. Think of what we all watched not long ago in Baltimore where so many young adults are walking around with no vision of a life beyond the life they know.It's a tragedy played out over and over and over again.After we reformed education in Florida, low-income student achievement improved here more than in any other state.We stopped processing kids along as if we didn't care  because we do care, and you don't show that by counting out anyone's child. You give them all a chance.Here's what I believe.When a school is just another dead end, every parent should have the right to send their child to a better school  public, private, or charter.Every school should have high standards, and the federal government should have nothing to do with setting them.Nationwide, if I am President, we will take the power of choice away from the unions and bureaucrats and give it back to parents.We made sure of something else in Florida  that children with developmental challenges got schooling and caring attention, just like every other girl and boy. We didn't leave them last in line. We put them first in line because they are not a problem. They are a priority.That is always our first and best instinct in this nation filled with charitable hearts. Yet these have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience. And the leading Democratic candidate recently hinted of more trouble to come.Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary those beliefs, quote, ""have to be changed."" That's what she said, and I guess we should at least thank her for the warning.The most galling example is the shabby treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Christian charity that dared to voice objections of conscience to Obamacare. The next President needs to make it clear that great charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor need no federal instruction in doing the right thing.It comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother, and I'm going with the Sisters.It's still a mystery to me why, in these violent times, the President a few months ago thought it relevant at a prayer breakfast to bring up the Crusades.Americans don't need lectures on the Middle Ages when we are dealing abroad with modern horrors committed by fanatics.From the beginning, our President and his foreign-policy team have been so eager to be the history makers that they have failed to be the peacemakers.With their phone-it-in foreign policy, the Obama-Clinton-Kerry team is leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unraveling.This supposedly risk-averse administration is also running us straight in the direction of the greatest risk of all - military inferiority.It will go on automatically until a President steps in to rebuild our armed forces and take care of our troops and our veterans.They have my word  I will do it.We keep dependable friends in this world by being dependable ourselves.I will rebuild our vital friendships. That starts by standing with the brave, democratic State of Israel.American-led alliances need rebuilding too, and better judgment is called for in relations far and near. Ninety miles to our south, there is talk of a state visit by our outgoing President.But we don't need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba.We need an American President to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people, and I am ready to be that President.Great things like that can really happen. And in this country of ours, the most improbable things can happen. Take that from a guy who met his first President on the day he was born, and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital. The person who handled both introductions is here today. She's watching what I say  and frankly, with all these reporters around, I'm watching what she says. Please say hello to my wonderful Mom, Barbara Bush.Long before the world knew my parents' names, I knew I was blessed to be their son.And they didn't mind at all that I found my own path. It led from Texas to Miami by way of Mexico.In 1971, 8 years before then-candidate Ronald Reagan said that we should stop thinking of our neighbors as foreigners, I was ahead of my time in cross-border outreach.Across a plaza, I saw a girl.She spoke only a little English. My Spanish was okay but not that great.With some intensive study, we got that barrier out of the way in a hurry.In the short version, it has been a gracious walk through the years with the former Columba Garnica de Gallo. Whatever else I might or might not have going for me, I've got the quiet joy of a man who can say that the most wonderful friend he has in the world is his own wife.And together, we had the not-so-quiet joy of raising three children who have brought us nothing but happiness and pride: George, Noelle, and Jeb.The boys have also brought us more Bushes  their wives, Mandi and Sandra, and our grandchildren Georgia, Prescott, Vivian, and Jack.Campaigns aren't easy, and they're not supposed to be. And I know that there are good people running for President.Quite a few, in fact.And not a one of us deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family, or family narrative. It's nobody's turn. It's everybody's test, and it's wide open  exactly as a contest for President should be.The outcome is entirely up to you - the voters. It is entirely up to me to earn the nomination of my party and then to take our case all across this great and diverse nation.As a candidate, I intend to let everyone hear my message, including the many who can express their love of country in a different language:Aydenos en tener una campaa que les da la bienvenida. Trabajen con nosotros por los valores que compartimos y para un gran futuro que es nuestro para construir para nosotros y nuestros hijos.Jntense a nuestra causa de oportunidad para todos, a la causa de todos que aman la libertad y a la causa noble de los Estados Unidos de Amrica.In any language, my message will be an optimistic one because I am certain that we can make the decades just ahead in America the greatest time ever to be alive in this world.That chance, that hope requires the best that is in us, and I will give it my all.I will campaign as I would serve, going everywhere, speaking to everyone, keeping my word, facing the issues without flinching, and staying true to what I believe.I will take nothing and no one for granted. I will run with heart.I will run to win.It begins here and now.And I'm asking for your vote.Thank you. God Bless You."
Jeb Bush,R,c,"July 30, 2015","Remarks to the National Urban League Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida","Thank you all very much. I appreciate your hospitality, and your excellent choice of the best state to hold your annual conference.The Urban League movement runs deep here, with seven affiliates from Tallahassee to Broward County and Greater Miami. If you all were hoping to find the most diverse, dynamic, forward-looking site for your convention, you came to the right place  and you're always welcome in Florida.Marc, I especially thank you and the trustees for the kind invitation. I'm honored to be your guest.I'm pleased to see the other candidates here as well  Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, Senator Sanders and a good man who's bringing a lot of wisdom to the Republican side, Dr. Ben Carson. By the way, I am glad he will make it into the top ten for next week's debate. Before that thing's over we might just need a doctor.For my part, I'm working for every vote, and in politics the best kind of support begins in friendship and fellowship. My Florida friends and partners in the Urban League include some of the most formidable people that any of us know  among them a national trustee, education leader, and great woman, Julia Johnson.And also a man who basically built this movement from the ground up in South Florida, my friend T. Willard Fair. He first came to our state for a job interview with the Miami affiliate. As he tells the story, and I quote, 'I didn't know if they intended to hire me, but I intended to be hired.' That was 55 years ago. And as we've all learned since, when Tal Fair intends for something to happen, don't be too surprised when it does. He's an unstoppable leader, and I'm honored to call him my friend.After I lost my first election in 1994, I went through a period of what some might call 'self-reflection' but I referred to it as 'listening and learning.' I converted to my wife's Catholic faith. I went to family courthouses where there were cases of children abused or neglected. And parents trying but unable to meet their obligations because of barriers  language, skills, or otherwise  that held them back.In my next campaign, I visited 250 schools across Florida, many of them in low-income communities. I also partnered with Tal to do something that was totally new to me. Together we built the Liberty City Charter School. At the time there were no charters in Florida. So we said, let's change the law, let's go build a charter school, let's start something new and hopeful for people who shouldn't have to wait for a real opportunity. And together we got it done.That first year, 90 black children in Liberty City began their journey toward success. And the day that school opened was one of the happiest, proudest moments of my life. Through that listening and learning, what I found were children who had the God-given ability to achieve. Yet for reasons out of their hands  structural, historical, economic  they didn't have the same chance at success as their peers. I'm indebted to Tal, and to many others across Florida, for giving me that perspective. It made me a better person, a better candidate in 1998, and a better governor in the 8 years that followed.That experience still shapes the way I see the deep-seated challenges facing people in urban communities today. I know that there are unjust barriers to opportunity and upward mobility in this country. Some we can see, others are unseen but just as real. So many lives can come to nothing, or come to grief, when we ignore problems, or fail to meet our own responsibilities. And so many people could do so much better in life if we could come together and get even a few big things right in government. I acted on that belief as governor of Florida. It's a record I'll gladly compare with anyone else in the field.Just for starters, leaders know there are plenty of tough calls we have to make, so we should not be wasting time agonizing over the easy ones. So, 14 years ago, when the question was whether to keep the Confederate flag on the grounds of the Florida State Capitol, I said no, and put it in a museum where it belongs.Another easy call was reaching out for talent wherever I found it  for my cabinet and staff, state agencies, and the courts. You're not going to get good judgment in government when everybody comes from the same life experience. We increased the number of black Floridians serving in the judiciary by 43 percent. And I was particularly proud that during my governorship, the state's use of minority owned businesses tripled. You can't serve all the people unless you represent all the people. And we did. With the most diverse appointments this state ever saw. From my first day as governor until the last, respect was the rule, and opportunity for all was the goal.In most lives, 'opportunity' is a hollow word unless you've got the dignity of a job and a paycheck. It becomes real when people are hiring and the economy's growing, and that's what we accomplished here in Florida. We got this state's economy growing at 4.4 percent, average family incomes went up, in every income group, and we made Florida the number-one job-creating state in this whole nation.We applied conservative principles, and applied them fairly and without wavering. We found that with fewer obstacles imposed by government, more people had the opportunity to achieve earned success. We gave more people the tools to move up in the world through adult education and workforce training. We expanded our community college system and made it more affordable for low-income families. Florida in those years helped thousands more first-generation college students make it all the way to graduation.We didn't lose sight of the ones who had missed their chance at a better life, or maybe even lost their way and landed in jail. In Florida, we didn't want to fill prisons with non-violent offenders. So we expanded drug courts and prevention programs. I took the view  as I would as president  that real justice in America has got to include restorative justice. I opened the first faith-based prison in the United States and signed an executive order to promote the hiring of ex-offenders. In this country, we shouldn't be writing people off, denying them a second chance at a life of meaning. Many ask only for a chance to start again, to get back in the game and do it right  and as a country, we should say yes whenever we can.We also went after the real enemy that afflicts our cities  the smugglers, drug cartels, and violent criminals that profit from the undoing of so many lives. We passed tough sentencing laws for gun crimes and ensured that dangerous people were kept off our streets. As a result of all this, we brought violent crime in Florida down to a 27-year low, and drug abuse way down as well.Social progress is always the story of widening the circle of opportunity. For that reason, I gave the challenge of school reform everything I had as governor. Because if we fail at that responsibility, it's a bitter loss. I believe in the right to rise in this country. And a child is not rising if he's not reading.When I took office, Florida was down near the bottom in student achievement. Almost half of all fourth graders were functionally illiterate, and half of all high-school kids never even graduated. So we overhauled the whole system, set clear standards, and brought out the best in our great teachers. We insisted on testing and accountability. We created the first statewide private school choice programs in America. We expanded high-performing charter schools. And we ended social promotion in 3rd grade, the practice of just passing unprepared kids along as if we didn't care  because we do care. And you don't show that by counting out anyone's child. You give them all a chance.A lot changed here in those years. Graduation rates went up by 50 percent. The number of black and Hispanic students passing AP exams increased four times over. We also became the nation's leader in early-childhood education, and we still are today. Among minority children, Florida saw the greatest gains anywhere in the United States. And what does that show? It shows every child can learn  no matter their race, no matter their background, no matter where they live. I know this can be done.The debate is changing, old orthodoxies are falling away. But we can never forget that long-term reform doesn't help a child right now. Years of not learning are years that are lost forever. I think of the kids in Washington, D.C. who've received Opportunity Scholarships. A couple thousand boys and girls, almost all of them black, have been given a chance to leave the worst schools and go to the best. Yet, every year, unions and politicians want to shut it down  because they don't like parental choice, period.Every parent should have choices. Every school should have high standards and high expectations, and the federal government should have nothing to do with setting them. Washington should support reform and provide resources, especially where the need is greatest. But building knowledge and shaping character is the job of principals, teachers, and parents  that's where the power belongs.When President Obama says that, quote, 'for too long we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present,' he is speaking the truth. But we should be just as candid about our failures in addressing the injustices of a more recent origin. In our cities, we've got so many people who have never known anything but poverty... so many young adults with no vision of a life beyond the life they know. It is a tragedy for them, and such a loss to our country, because every one of them has a God-given purpose to live out, and God-given talents that this world needs.Every one of them was also promised at least one big break in life, in the form of a public school to help them learn who they are and what they can do. For millions, it's a false promise. As technology advances, the first rung of the ladder is getting higher and higher. If we don't create an education system that allows young people to reach it, we're setting them up for a lifetime of failure. So you and I have to call this situation what it is  the worst inequality in America today, and the source of so many other inequalities.I want to work with the Urban League movement to end this injustice once and for all. For a half century, this nation has pursued a War on Poverty and massive government programs, funded with trillions of taxpayer dollars. This decades-long effort, while well intentioned, has been a losing one. And the casualties can be counted in the millions who never had the chance at work, and whose families fell victim to drugs, violence, and a crushing of the spirit.One of the best anti-poverty programs is a strong family, led by two committed parents. As the family breaks down, so does opportunity. Poverty among dual-parent families is about 7 percent  among families with single mothers, it's about 35 percent. The reason is simple: it is a lot tougher to raise a family alone.Too many kids are growing up without a dad. Fathers who are absent in their child's life  need to step up and take responsibility, and it is incumbent on us, to exert the positive societal pressures that can turn the tide in the breakdown of fatherhood in America.But for many that is not an option  and there is no tougher job in the world than being a single mom. So as governor of Florida, I tried to do something about it. I doubled our efforts to collect child support payments, and we increased collections by 90%. Together with a quality education and a family support system, ending the cycle of poverty requires access to jobs.I have set a goal that will define my economic agenda should I become president. I do not for one moment accept the supposed 'new normal' of anemic two percent growth. I believe we are ready in America to achieve annual economic growth of four percent. A lot rides on the difference. And that difference is pretty simple to state. The new normal is more businesses going under rather than starting up. Four percent growth is a true revival of the private sector, and 19 million new jobs. The new normal is the static present for struggling cities. Four percent growth is more enterprise in urban areas, more people moving in, a higher tax base and more revenues  in other words, a better chance to save our cities. We can do this as a country. We can grow at a pace that lifts up everybody, and there is no excuse for not trying.Big audacious goals are second nature to the men and women of the Urban League. That spirit is needed most when things break down, as we know they do, in anger and violence. We've seen that yet again this year. When all these issues I've discussed, make it harder and harder for people to imagine a hopeful future, then it's easy to see why there's anger and disillusionment. Trust in our vital institutions is at historic lows. It is up to all of us to work diligently to rebuild that trust. That happens one person at a time. One politician at a time. One police officer at a time. One community leader at a time. It begins with respect, dialogue, and the courage to reach out in peace.Those were exactly the qualities we saw in two of your affiliate presidents, Michael McMillan of St. Louis and J. Howard Henderson of Baltimore. These good men were tested, and they showed us the way. 'Strength to love,' as Martin Luther King called it, always shows the way. And sometimes, as in Charleston last month, it shines as a true light in the darkness.In the community of that city, we found such grace, such purity of heart, such heroic goodness, such boundless mercy, all gathered up in one story. We like to think that Charleston's response to evil told the world something good and right about this nation and our people, and it surely did. Yet even more, that congregation of believers, and that city, gave witness to the character that built a movement and inspires it to this day. I will endeavor to live up to the goodness of Charleston and work with you to better our communities, whether as your neighbor or your President.I know there are great and lasting things we can achieve together, maybe only together, to keep America faithful to its ideals of equality and justice for all. Your support in that effort is something I will work every day to earn. I welcome your friendship, and I ask for your vote.Thank you very much. God bless you all."
Jeb Bush,R,c,"August 11, 2015","Remarks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California","Thank you very much. It's good to be with all of you, and I appreciate the kind hospitality of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.I bring greetings from the wonderful guy who is still very proud to have been Ronald Reagan's vice president. A competition turned into friendship, and the better my Dad got to know Ronald Reagan, the more he admired and loved him. On my way here this afternoon, I made a call to Nancy Reagan, to thank her for this honor and let her know how much we all love her.Seven elections have come and gone since the Reagan name was last on the ballot. Yet in many ways, that name, and the qualities it brings to mind, is still the standard. A leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words, it was President Reagan who took command of events, rebuilt America's strength, and moved the world toward peace. Strategically and morally, he conceded nothing to America's enemies. He believed that the Cold War could be won, not just endlessly managed, and in the end he put an age of conflict behind us. They don't always give out peace prizes for that, but peace is what Ronald Reagan left behind, and that is the legacy of a good and great man.In our time as well, it is strength, and will, and clarity of purpose that make all the difference. Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes. We've seen in recent years how critical each one of these principles is to our security, because when it counted most, they were missing.To really grasp what the next president will face, we have to look candidly at a few policies that have gone very wrong in these years above all, in what we used to call the global war on terror. Despite elaborate efforts by the administration to avoid even calling it by name, one of the very gravest threats we face today comes from radical Islamic terrorists. The terrorists are possessed by the same violent ideology that gave us 9/11, and they are on the offensive and gaining ground. It is not true, and was wishful thinking by the Administration to claim, that 'the tide of war is receding.'The reality is that radical Islam has been spreading like a pandemic  across the Middle East, throughout Africa and to parts of Asia, even in the nations of the West, finding recruits in Europe and the United States.Here's another stark reality: Seven years ago, the long-awaited jihadist caliphate existed only in the fevered imagination of the terrorists. Today, the radicals' caliphate exists as an actual place, occupying a stretch of land larger than Indiana.ISIS, a genocidal terrorist army, controls large parts of two countries, and is gaining influence in others. And yet well into this nightmare, President Obama's administration, by its own admission, has no strategy to stop it. In place of one, they are pursuing a minimalist approach of incremental escalation. The results have been a creeping U.S. involvement, without any strategic results  the worst of both worlds.A year of limited strikes and other half-measures has made little discernible difference in the sum total of the ISIS danger. A halting, ineffective effort against them has only emboldened these terrorists, leaving the pandemic unchecked.Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, and other cities that American and allied troops died to liberate, are now under the black flag of ISIS. Inside the caliphate, non-believers are forced to convert, and those who do not, can expect a horrible fate. A special hatred is reserved for Christians and other religious minorities. In the Middle East today, we are witnessing a mass persecution and exodus of the followers of Jesus Christ. Nor is any allowance made for adherents of Islam found lacking in zeal by ISIS, which has filled mass graves with innocent Muslims.Potential recruits of ISIS, ready for their own taste of violence, can even follow it all on social media. It's a time when mass murderers have Twitter handles, Facebook and Instagram pages, using these to add a veneer of glamor to their exploits. We need to work with the owners of the relevant companies, and give careful thought to how we address this problem.Among followers worldwide, ISIS is hailed as the strong horse, the glorious cleanser and restorer of Islam, and that word is getting out on Western-based social media. This helps explain the spread of ISIS and the terrorist pandemic in the Middle East and beyond, including thousands recruited from Europe, and more than a hundred from America, giving us ISIS terrorists with Western passports.The Islamic State and its followers are an asymmetric threat needing just one big strike to inflict devastation. What we are facing in ISIS and its ideology is, to borrow a phrase, the focus of evil in the modern world. And civilized nations everywhere, especially those with power, have a duty to oppose and defeat this enemy.No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially. Yet in a long experience that includes failures of intelligence and military setbacks, one moment stands out in memory as the turning point we had all been waiting for. And that was the surge of military and diplomatic operations that turned events toward victory. It was a success, brilliant, heroic, and costly. And this nation will never forget the courage and sacrifice that made it all possible.So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary? That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill  and that Iran has exploited to the full as well. ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton  the storied 'team of rivals'  took office? So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else's problem. Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone. Another terrible miscalculation, unfolding right now, is a different story. That would be the Obama-Clinton-Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force in the region when in fact they are deceitful dictators causing nothing but instability.Whenever bad things happen in the Middle East, from Israel's borders to the shores of Yemen, the influence of the mullahs is rarely far from the scene. Here is a regime that supports terrorism, threatens to destroy Israel, has for years been trying to develop nuclear weapons, routinely commits human rights violations, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq, and even now is unlawfully detaining American citizens.Iran, its ally Assad, its terrorist proxy Hizballah, and the sectarian militias it sponsors have fueled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, that have helped give rise to ISIS. Yet the president's deal with Iran confronts none of these problems. And least of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. In fact the deal prepares the way for that capability. With the lifting of sanctions, the deal also frees up more than 100 billion dollars for Iran's security services to use as they wish. In effect, the primary investors in a violent, radical Middle East have just received a new round of funding, courtesy of the United States and the United Nations.And, this is President Obama's idea of a diplomatic triumph. It is a deal unwise in the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme. It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America.If the Congress does not reject this deal, then the damage must be undone by the next president  and it will be my intention to begin that process immediately. Knowing what has gone wrong, however, is not the same as knowing how to set it right.The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity, and confidence that only American leadership can provide. Radical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming, and I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected President of the United States. We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace. Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail.In all of this, the United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region. Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the most populous Arab country and the wealthiest, are important partners of the United States. Those relationships have been badly mishandled by this administration. Both countries are key to a better-coordinated regional effort against terrorism. We need to restore trust, and work more closely with them against common threats. We have very capable partners, likewise, in the United Arab Emirates, who are willing and able to take the fight to the extremists. We have a moderate and quite formidable leader in King Abdullah of Jordan. We have an ally in the new democratic government in Tunisia, and a fragile democracy in Lebanon  nations that are both under assault by radicals and terrorists. Across the region, responsible governments need no persuading of what the moment requires.It requires action, coordination, and American leadership to bring it all together. My strategy meets the unique circumstances in each of the two countries, Iraq and Syria, in which ISIS now has territory. And let's start with Iraq, and the five broad actions I would take as president to help remove the threat from that country.First, we must support the Iraqi forces, which right now have the will to win, but not the means. As matters stand, the United States has been helping to reconstitute Iraqi security services and to aid the Kurdish peshmerga. We need to broaden and expedite our efforts to help ensure Iraqis rebuild their security sector  not only to win against ISIS, but to break free of Iranian influence. And that effort should also involve even greater engagement with the Sunni tribes, whose fighting units served side-by-side with Americans to defeat al-Qaeda-in-Iraq and were then disbanded by the Maliki government.Second, we must give these forces the consistent advantage of American air power, to cover their operations and to strike with fierce precision. The strategy has to include forward air controllers, whose skill and accuracy would severely hinder the enemy's freedom of movement. This would greatly improve the ability of fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to provide necessary close air support to local ground forces. ISIS fighters try blending into the civilian landscape. Our spotters on the ground will enable us to hit them hard and rarely miss.Third, we must make better use of the limited forces we have by giving them a greater range of action. Right now, we have around 3,500 soldiers and marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed. We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces. But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country. Our unrivaled warfighters know that it is simply not enough to dispense advice and training to local forces, then send them on their way and hope for the best. Canadian troops are already embedded in Iraqi units to very good effect. Our soldiers and marines need the go-ahead to do that as well, to help our partners outthink and outmaneuver the enemy.Fourth, we should providemore support to the Kurds, giving them decisive military power against ISIS. In Iraq's Kurdish region, we have loyal friends and brave and skilled fighters. If I am commander in chief, the United States will make certain that the Kurds have everything they need to win.And finally, our strategy in Iraq has to restart the serious diplomatic efforts that can help that country move in the right direction. Only Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can decide if they will live together and share power and resources in a way that will serve their interests, assuring the survival of their country. But these partners have to know that while the United States is there in measure, we are also there in earnest and for the long haul. They will come through for their country, but they've got to be certain that we have their back.Now, the situation in Syria is quite different from the one in Iraq. In some ways, it is even more complex because we have no large, cohesive force to work with. And here, too, we have seen what ruin and suffering can follow when America doesn't lead.Of 23 million Syrians, about 11 million have been displaced or fled the country altogether. More than two hundred thousand people have so far been killed in the mayhem. The regime of Bashar al-Assad is deploying every ruthless means to stay in power. Long brutalized by that regime, now under assault from ISIS, Syrian moderates want to fight against both enemies, and they view the regime as the greater evil. It's a sorrowful picture when you think back on how it could have been avoided.Exactly four years ago, we heard words that still hang in the air of the Middle East  when President Obama declared that 'the time has come for President Assad to step aside.' Then, three years ago, came another pronouncement  that any use of chemical weapons by Assad would be a 'red line,' inviting tough consequences for the regime.If the choice was between silence and these idle, grandiose words, it would have been better to say nothing at all. What followed is that Assad used those weapons, again and again, and there were no serious consequences whatsoever. Having lost our credibility on such an epic scale, it is hard to get it back. But we had better try, because the longer we do nothing, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and the more directly our friends and our interests are threatened.Our ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long-term political stability in that country. Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its plan-less aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Syria will need a stable government, and a transition free of more sectarian blood-letting will depend on the credible moderate forces we help unite and build up today. To that end, my strategy would bring American influence to bear in four all-important areas of action.First, a coordinated, international effort is essential to give Syria's moderate forces the upper hand. As it is, the Qataris, the Turks, the Saudis, and others have been supporting fighting groups in Syria. But these groups are not always working to common purpose. And if there's anything that moderate forces in Syria cannot afford right now it's confusion and disunity.Under my strategy, the aim would be to draw the moderates together and back them up, as one force. And we should back that force up all the way through  not just in taking the fight to the enemy, but in helping them to form a stable, moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone. It's a tough, complicated diplomatic and military proposition, even more so than the current situation in Iraq. But it can be done. We saw in the Iraq surge how Islamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces. And the strategic elements in both cases are the same  we have to support local forces, and we must stay true to our word.Second, we have to expand and vastly improve the recruitment and training of Syrian forces fighting ISIS. At the moment, too many in Syria doubt that they can count on us, which explains why our recruiting and training have basically come to nothing. When a five hundred million dollar program gets you 54 recruits, you know the plan's not working out. The reality is, our recruitment efforts have been failing in Syria because we are not respected anymore as a reliable actor in the region. And we have to change that impression with the kind of clear, consistent, and credible action that every nation should expect from the United States of America.Third, we must over time establish multiple safe zones in Syria. It's a measure of progress that we have joined with the Turks to create a small, 'ISIS-free zone' in the northern part of the country. But we need to go beyond well this, by establishing safe zones to protect Syrians not only from ISIS, but also from Assad.Fourth, we and our partners should declare a no-fly zone in Syria, and then work to expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime. Enforce that no-fly zone, and we'll stop the regime's bombing raids that kill helpless civilians. It could also keep Iranian flights from resupplying the regime, Hizballah, and other bad actors. A no-fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it.When we talk about no-fly zones in Syria, precision airstrikes in Iraq, or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats, all of this assumes that such power is there when we need it. Yet here as well, the shortsightedness of the present administration will leave a cost. We are in the seventh year of a significant dismantling of our own military, in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying. And I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America.A winning strategy against the Islamic State, or against any threat to ourselves and our friends, depends ultimately on the military strength that underwrites American influence. Let that slip away, and what would America be in world affairs, except one more well-intentioned voice at the United Nations? In any effort of ours to overcome violence and secure peace, a winning strategy depends on maintaining unequaled strength, and we can never take it for granted.I might add that this includes strength among our intelligence services, military and civilian. No men and women receive so little credit for doing so much to track dangers and keep us safe. These skilled and brave Americans can be sure of this: If I become commander in chief, they will receive the tools they need and the gratitude, respect, and support they deserve.A good many people who serve in our military and intelligence agencies are at mid-career. And I venture to guess that for quite a few of them, their calling has something to do with their coming of age in the Reagan years. Yet any nostalgia for that time has to recall, not only a falling wall and collapsing evil empire, but also the fear, and tension, and dead-serious challenges that could all have played out so very differently. From the distance of decades, even the greatest successes in security and foreign policy can look almost inevitable. Of course, nothing had to happen as it did. Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it. But then along came, one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most.It's that way for us too, in having to deal with long conflicts and serious threats that are again on the offensive. And in living up to our responsibilities, we can always use a little more of the Reagan spirit  rejecting with contempt the idea that conflict must be endless, or that the spread of danger and violence is inevitable. It is not.For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace. This is the way forward in our time as well, led by a president who is resolute  as I will be  in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears.We can protect our people, put adversaries back in retreat, get things moving our way again, and win back the momentum for freedom's cause. In all of this, let us never forget that in fighting evil, we are doing good; in stopping the merciless, we are delivering justice; and in destroying the violent, we are defending the innocent.This is the work that America is in this world to do. Let us meet that duty with confidence, faith, and resolve.Thank you very much."
Jeb Bush,R,c,"September 9, 2015","Remarks in Garner, North Carolina","Thank you very much. I appreciate your hospitality today, and I'm glad to be here.Today as we meet, America's economy is barely moving forward and American working families are falling behind. We've had six full years of tax increases, endless new regulation, vast new federal programs, and eight trillion dollars borrowed and spent. And what has it gotten us? This so-called ""new normal"" of slow growth, flat wages, and millions of men and women  often people in the prime of their working lives  who've lost all hope of a good, full-time job.It's easy for politicians and academics to go on and on about this ""new normal"" in America, and how we all might just have to get used to it. They talk as if it is the best our country can do, when in truth it is just the best the progressive liberals can do. And to state the obvious, the new normal is not good enough, and not even close.Hillary Clinton doesn't believe that we can grow faster than two percent, because she doesn't believe in your ability to rise to the challenge. This is a debate I welcome, because the difference between the Democrats' new normal, and my vision for high, sustained economic growth is pretty simple to state. The new normal is more businesses going under than starting up, which is where we are right now.My plan for the entire economy will create a true revival of the private sector, and 19 million new jobs. The new normal is a comfortable ride for affluent people living on their portfolios. My plan will help those who live on their paychecks and who haven't seen a raise in a while. And it means the American dream will be possible for millions who have forgotten what it looks like.The point is that some numbers matter a great deal, and our nation's economic growth rate is one of them. The difference between 2 percent growth and 4 percent growth is this: At 2 percent, we stay where we are, with millions on the sidelines falling behind. At 4 percent, we grow at a pace that lifts up everybody, and there is no excuse for not trying.We need to jump-start our economy, and we can do that by fixing our broken tax code. It's a disaster. We all know it. Eighty thousand pages. Two otherwise identical taxpayers could have hugely different tax bills, because of all the deductions, credits, and exclusions that apply to some but not to all. It's a tax code only an army of accountants and lobbyists would love, because they've written it. It's full of special favors, carve-outs, phase-outs and subsidies  that you pay for, one way or another.Of all the terrible things that can be said about our tax code  and I can think of a few  the worst is probably this: It punishes people for doing things we should encourage and rewards people for doing things that may not be so good. It taxes paychecks hard but gives companies a write-off for debt. The current tax code makes it easier to borrow than to build. I believe it's time we build for the future, not borrow from it  so I am here today to explain how I want to fix our broken tax code.My plan works whether you're on Main Street or Wall Street. No special favors. No special breaks. Fixing the tax code will take constant attention and effort. And I know what that requires. Because I did it when I was governor. I cut taxes every year I was in office, totaling 19 billion dollars, and we didn't even have an income tax to cut. We were one of two states to see our credit rating go up to Triple A. Compare that to the sorry state of affairs in Washington D.C., where we sadly have seen a downgrade. And our economy blossomed, growing at 4.4%. Florida created 1.3 million new jobs. Household incomes rose 1,300 dollars. And that prosperity was shared. That is a record I plan to repeat in Washington D.C.Here are the key elements of the plan that I will submit to Congress and sign into law as the Reform and Growth Act of 2017. Let's start with personal taxes. Taxes should be lower, simpler, fair, and clear.We will start by reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The new rates will be 10, 25, and 28 percent. With the highest rate set at 28 percent, we will have returned to the structure enacted in President Ronald Reagan's monumental and successful 1986 tax reform. It worked before, and it can work again now.Next, we will nearly double the standard deduction  which roughly two-thirds of all tax filers claim. Retire the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is a phantom tax increase on millions of Americans every year. Expand and reform the Earned Income Tax Credit. Eliminate the worker's share of Social Security tax for seniors who have already sent enough of their paychecks into the system. End the Marriage Penalty. And End the Death Tax once and for all. We will limit the amount of deductions that wealthy people and other itemizers can take, other than charitable contributions. Finally, we will improve the climate for savers in this country by removing the 3.8 percent Obamacare savings tax. And we will cut the rates on capital gains back to 20 percent, the rate they were at when President Clinton was in office.I think we all know the same old song the left will sing about this plan. So let's get the record straight up front. Under my plan tax bills will be going down, but those earning $200,000 or more will bear a greater share of our income tax burden than they do today. So the top 5% will bear a greater share. And the top 10% as well.Meanwhile, here's the impact on working families: They are already nickled and dimed by a government that taxes everything under the sun  sales taxes, gas taxes and property taxes. So under my plan, a family of four with an income below $40,000 won't pay any income taxes at all.Taken together, this plan moves money out of the hands of the politicians in Washington, and gives it back to hard-working Americans like you who will use the money they save for their own priorities, not the government's. And while we help make it easier for individuals and families to make ends meet, we're going to help American companies compete as well. For too long, U.S. businesses have operated with the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It's no wonder that so many have moved overseas  and taken thousands of jobs with them.There's a simple way to fix this problem. First, we will bring the corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest corporate rate in the industrial world, down to 20 percent, which is below China's. Next, we will end the extra taxation of profits earned overseas. We will stop the practice, which most of the world has already abandoned, of worldwide taxation. We will allow the 2 trillion dollars now held overseas to come home with a one-time tax.These moves will end the insidious trend of what they call inversions  where small overseas companies buy bigger U.S. companies so that both can enjoy the lowest possible tax rate  costing us jobs and tax revenue. For once, the U.S. will be a low-tax place to do business and create high-wage jobs.Finally, we will put Main Street and Wall Street on even footing. We will allow businesses to fully deduct new capital investment in the first year  something which will help businesses buy equipment, build factories and invest in other growth.At the same time, we will take away the tax deductions for corporate borrowing. If your business model depends on heavy debt and leverage, that's your choice. Under my plan, you'll pay for it. Taken together, this plan will bring tax revenue and high-wage jobs back to America where they belong.Now those on the left, and even some people who call themselves Republicans, will tell you that to save U.S. jobs, we have to throw up a bunch of walls and tariffs and protect our businesses from competition. That's a siren call of surrender, and I won't go for it. Protectionism never works. It forces prices up. It restricts choices. It kills jobs. Sales there create jobs here, and fighting to get rid of trade restrictions overseas is the best way we can help our companies compete, win and create good jobs right here in North Carolina.It's Washington that is holding us back. Giving bureaucrats more power over the economy is only going to make it worse. The way we bring jobs back to America is to take power out of Washington, give it back to the American people. Through hard work, ingenuity, and know how, we will compete with the world and we will win.Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump may not believe we can do it, but I do.A radical change to our tax code like this will mean so much for so many Americans. It will lead to prosperity that everyone will share in. I'm thinking of two folks from South Carolina: Jonathan and Reagan Love. What a great name. Reagan Love. Jonathan serves our nation in the Army National Guard. Reagan's a school teacher. They're from Chester, South Carolina but are living in Oklahoma this year while Jonathan's on duty. This tax plan would save them 2,300 dollars a year, cutting their income tax liability in HALF. And that's money they would use to open a business when they come back home. For Jonathan, Reagan, and millions of others like you, a plan like this will make all the difference. Making it easier for workers to earn success, and when they do, they will keep more of what they earn.It will also help businesses like this one. Morris & Associates makes products that are part of people's lives  they help cool everything from chickens to nuclear power plants. And it's a growing company with 100 employees, 70 of them right here in Garner. When you're a business owner, the federal government is your partner.But Uncle Sam only shares in your profit and none of the costs and none of the risk. My plan will make it easier for a business like Bill's or yours to buy more equipment, hire more workers, and increase wages. Precisely what you all deserve, and precisely what it takes to grow our economy.That's the direction we should move. That's an aspiration we should share. That's a goal we can all achieve. And that's what I will do as your president.Thank you."
Jeb Bush,R,c,"November 2, 2015","Remarks in Tampa, Florida","Thank you. It's great to be in Tampa with so many friends.Today, we begin a three-day trip across Florida, South Carolina, and New Hampshire to tell the Florida story.The story of a big, diverse state, shaped by conservative, results-oriented leadership.Reforming government. Disrupting the status quo. Challenging the special interests. Restoring opportunity. Refusing to compromise in the defense of freedom. Lifting people up, not tearing them down.Standing up for everyone.Our story is about action.Doing, not just talking.Listening, not just lecturing.That is my story. And I'm so grateful and honored to have had the opportunity to lead this great state as your governor.Last year, I decided that I wanted to share my story with people across the country.So, I wrote a book.Well really, I didn't write it. Not in a traditional sense. I emailed it!They used to call me the e-governor.For eight years, I gave out my email address to anyone who wanted to talk to me.And email they did!People across the state told me their stories.Sometimes they asked questions.Sometimes they asked for help.One lady asked me to get a raccoon out of her attic, and I got my team right on it!But Floridians always gave me their opinions.And man, they didn't hold back.So, I listened. I tried to answer every email.It wasn't something I could have predicted at the start of my time in office, but this 8-year conversation with Florida shaped my governorship.So, in writing my book, I used my email exchanges to tell the Florida story. To tell about the work to turn one of America's largest states into an economic engine where people could live, work and raise their family in safety and security...With huge promise for the future and free from the heavy hand of government.That is what my book is about.Here is my shameless plug:The book is called ""Reply All."" It's out today and you can get it on Amazon.com.Going back and re-reading these emails reminded me of the challenges we tackled together and how much can be accomplished with strong, conservative leadership.That is why I am running for the Presidency of the United States.You see, America is in a time of testing, at home and abroad.People are frustrated.People are worried about what the future holds for our nation.And I share that sentiment with them.Our economy has suffered its slowest recovery since the Great Depression.One in ten able-bodied Americans can't find full-time work, or have given up looking altogether.One in seven Americans lives in poverty.One in five children is on food stamps.Barack Obama has given us two trillion dollars of new taxes, but still managed to grow the national debt by eight trillion  placing an immoral burden on working families and the next generation.The world is in turmoil, as America withdraws from its responsibilities.ISIS has declared a Caliphate the size of Indiana.In Syria and Iraq, they are indiscriminately killing moderate Muslims, Christians, Western journalists ...anyone who stands in the way of their fanatic ideology.Red lines get crossed without consequence, unleashing a humanitarian crisis as four million Syrian refugees flee their native land.Vladimir Putin is siding with the brutal Syrian dictator; sending weapons systems to Iran; and continuing to defy the Western world in Ukraine.All the while, our President has negotiated an agreement that gives legitimacy to Tehran and does nothing to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.For the first time in the history of Israel, its greatest existential threat has been created by its greatest ally.The 2016 election arrives at the juncture of our failures abroad, and restlessness at home.And soon, Americans will once again enter a time for choosing ...A chance to set a new course for the country.As you may have heard, last week, I was in Colorado for the third Republican presidential debate.If you watched the debate, you probably came away thinking this election is about sound bites...or fantasy football...or which candidate can interrupt the loudest.I'm here to tell you it's not.This election is not about a set of personalities. It's about a set of principles.It is about leadership.It is about the right vision to lead America through turbulent waters, after two terms of a divider-in-chief who has sliced and diced the electorate by class, income, grievance and creed.So the choice we face is whether to summon the courage to give rise to an era of new possibility or to indulge this new age of cynicism.For all his promise, perhaps President Obama's greatest accomplishment is that of creating competing pessimisms.Members of his own party are left explaining how two percent growth, massive debt, and increasing global isolation are really the best we can do.They speak in delusional terms about containing ISIS; about trusting the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism; about how the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian soil doesn't underscore the president's empty words and total inaction.It's not working.And all President Obama has left is the politics of divide and conquer. Signing lawless executive orders that ignore the Constitution and launching partisan attacks, such as comparing his critics to Iranian hard-liners.Americans have had enough of our president's many strawman arguments.And, of a front-running candidate who blames a vast right wing conspiracy instead of taking personal responsibility, and who declares roughly half the country is her enemy.If Secretary Clinton has her way, the next four years will be like the last eight: gridlock, grievance, division, demonization.This is the only way they know how to win.On the issue of immigration, they have written a script for Republicans, filled with grievance and resentment.Frankly, the last thing they want is a Republican challenger who takes them out of their comfort zone of forced indignation and PC platitudes.But let me be clear: I'm not stepping into the role of ""angry agitator"" that they have created for us, because it's not what's in my heart.It is not true to the conservative cause. And, in the end, that role is just a bit part in the story of another conservative loss and another liberal victory.That's their plan, and I'm not going to play along.But I fear the President has already succeeded in setting the trap for our party, bringing a new pessimism on the right.Some people on the debate stage talked of a country that was once great, but now is in dramatic decline.They say our best days are behind us.I acknowledge the difficulties and challenges we face.But I reject this kind of thinking.Not because I don't understand it, but because I know it is not true.There is an important place in our politics for righteous indignation.But anger that leads to resentment without delivering results will take us down a path to perdition.I believe America's best days are not behind us, but squarely in front of us. If we elect the right leadership.And as your President, I will fight every day with a reformer's heart.I will lead.And I will tear down the barriers that keep Americans from rising up and realizing their God-given potential.I will do so keenly aware of the problems that give rise to the deep frustration all of us share ...frustration over a porous border... workers' wages remaining stagnant ...and an ever-shrinking pie for families living paycheck to paycheck.This won't be solved with more talk.The answer isn't sending someone from one side of the capital city to the other.The solution won't be found in someone who has never demonstrated the capacity to implement conservative ideas.And you can't just tell Congress... ""You're Fired""... and go to a commercial break.You have to bring people together to solve problems.The challenges we face as a nation are too great to roll the dice on another presidential experiment.To trust the rhetoric of reform over a record of reform.After seven years of incompetence, corruption and gridlock in Washington, we need a president who can fix it.I can fix it.After seven years of historic cuts to our military...a foreign policy based on leading from behind...the emboldening of our enemies and the isolation of our allies...we need a president who fixes America's standing abroad.I can fix it.After seven years of massive deficits, historic debt, and a president who vetoes defense spending because he wants more reckless spending, we need a president who fixes our budgetary mess.I can fix it.I know I can fix it...because I've done it.In Florida, we showed how strong, hands-on leadership could make a difference in the lives of people.I gave out my e-mail address because I wanted Floridians to know that their governor cared about them and wanted to help solve their problems.I remember emailing with an honor student named Kirsty Edwards who couldn't pass the FCAT to graduate because of her disability.We listened and changed the law so Kirsty could get her high school diploma and go onto graduate from college.I remember emailing with single moms like Tina Calloway who needed help collecting child support from absent fathers.Their calls for assistance motivated us to increase child support collection by 90 percent.And I remember emailing with teachers like Alleen Miller who joined our cause of improving schools, even though their union pressured them to fight us every step of the way.I went to Tallahassee as an agent of change.I turned the political culture of Tallahassee upside down.I'm putting The Beltway on notice. I'll turn Washington upside down too.We took on the teachers union to make Florida a national leader in parental choice and school accountability.We took on the public employee union to shrink the size of the state bureaucracy by 11 percent.We took on trial lawyers to rein in frivolous lawsuits and make our business climate more conducive to small business growth.And we took on big spending politicians from both parties to balance eight budgets and cut taxes eight years in a row by a total of $19 billion dollars.By the way, I vetoed 2,500 line items, eliminating more than $2 billion dollars of pork-barrel spending.My good friend and the Speaker of the House, John Thrasher, reacted by calling me Veto Corleone.That was not meant as a term of endearment at the time, but I wear it as a badge of honor today.The story of my governorship was one of using conservative principles to provide people with opportunity to improve their lives.I governed on the premise that there are no second class citizens. No second rate dreams. In America, every citizen is an asset. Every life matters.And every American has a right to rise to their God-given potential.If you want a president who maintains the status quo, I am not your candidate.But if you want fundamental conservative reform...reform that can be found in the record, not just the rhetoric...then I ask for your support.Our times are difficult, but not nearly as difficult as what Lincoln faced when he took office ... what FDR faced on December 8th of 1941.We have long been blessed with a benevolent presidency. Leaders who turned both our highest hopes and our worst fears into dramatic, lasting change that left the world a better place.Leaders who held the nation's highest office with humility. Who went on bended knee before God, asking His help in carrying out orders that would determine the fate of millions.It was Lincoln who spoke at his second Inauguration ... a few weeks before the end of the war ... soothing words of healing and hope, ""With malice toward none, with charity for all. With firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in...""If Lincoln were alive today, imagine the foolishness he would have to suffer.Advisers telling him to shave his beard.Cable pundits telling him to lose the top hat.Opposition researchers calling him a five-time loser before the age of 50.I have gotten a lot of advice lately myself...more than enough.Some is stylistic. Take off the suit coat. Ditch the glasses. Get rid of the purple striped tie.Man, I like that tie.Some advice is more strategic. Nail that zinger. Be angrier. Hide your inner wonk.But I have learned two important things from my time serving the people of Florida:One, I can't be someone I'm not.And, two, getting things done isn't about yelling into a camera, or regurgitating sound bites free of substance.The campaign trail is littered with candidates disguised as television critics. Politicians echoing poll-tested pabulum.But leadership is something far different.It's not about telling people what they want to hear, but what they must hear.It's not about saying the right thing, but doing the right thing.And it's not about tearing people down, but about bringing people together.I will do everything in my power to win this race, but there are some things I am not willing to do:I will not compromise my principles,I will not trade in a joyful outlook to put on the cloak of the angry agitator.And I will not make anyone feel small so I can feel big.Americans are looking for a president, not a pundit...a leader and not an agitator.For seven years we have been led by a cynic-in-chief.It is time we elected a Commander-in-chief.A president who knows leadership involves summoning the will and creativity to solve tomorrow's challenges and seize tomorrow's opportunities.I am running this campaign on my own terms. And let me tell you something: when the dust clears, and the delegates are counted, we will win this campaign.I will be true to myself, optimistic and inclusive.I will win appealing to our better angels, and not our greatest fears.And I will win with a message that welcomes all and includes all, because I will be a president who fights for all.Join me in this journey. Fight with me as we work to fundamentally change the culture of Washington.Let us seek to redeem the promise of a fledgling Republic formed well over 200 years ago.A land full of endless promise and limitless possibility for all so blessed to be called Americans.The future is in our hands.Let us seize it together with faith, hope and trust. In ourselves. In one another. In the God who made us and guides us.Thank you. God bless America."
Jeb Bush,R,c,"November 18, 2015","Remarks at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina","Thank you very much.I appreciate the hospitality of the Citadel and the privilege of addressing members of the Corps of Cadets.It's great to be here, and I'm proud to report that in the Citadel spirit, I got to the Parade Deck early this morning and went for a run with the Summerall Guards.So next time a Presidential candidate comes by here, tell them Jeb set a new precedent. From now on, you can't give a speech to cadets without first doing some P.T.And for all of us, what a privilege this morning to be in the presence of war heroes throughout this room.And for me, to be introduced by Major General James Livingston, is a special honor.When you are in the presence of General Livingston, you don't need any reminders from me about military virtues.His character, and the character of our military is summed up in that one word on the medal he earned: ""Valor.""This Marine did more than could ever be asked, gave more than could ever be repaid, and I am honored to have his support.Thank you all for being here.As we gather today, we do so with memories fresh from the atrocities in Paris.The indiscriminate murder of people sitting outside a cafe...the slaughter of innocents outside the national soccer stadium, and at a concert hall...The merciless killing of women, children, and unarmed citizens whose only crime was living in freedom.Our hearts are broken for the people of France.They are our oldest and first ally and we are joined together by shared values.Like France, we know the deep sorrow of innocent lives lost, due to terrorist brutality.What happened on the streets of Paris on Friday should not come as a surprise.After all, we have seen ISIS expand its deadly reach in recent weeks to Lebanon, to Egypt, and to Turkey  to say nothing of the daily horrors faced by those who live under their control in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan.This brutal savagery is a reminder of what is at stake in this election.We are choosing the leader of the free world.And if these attacks remind us of anything, it is that we are living in serious times that require serious leadership And that the free world needs to act. The last seven years under President Obama have taught us that problems do not take care of themselves in the absence of American leadership.During the State of the Union address, he declared we were stopping the advance of ISIS, and soon after they took Ramadi.Last Friday, he repeated the delusion that ISIS is contained, just hours before they murdered 129 innocent people in Paris, and hours after they killed dozens in Beirut.America has had enough of empty words, of declarations detached from reality of an administration with no strategy or no intention of victory.Here is the truth you will not hear from our president: We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.It is the war of our time, and a struggle that will determine the fate of the free world.Three months ago at the Reagan Library, I warned thatwe need to defeat ISIS and I outlined a clear and serious strategy to eradicate it.The actions I called for then remain critical:We must unleashthe power of our Air Force by removing self-imposed restraints;Enforce a no fly zone;Create safe zones in Syria;Allowour special operations forces to target terrorist networks; andArm the Kurdish forces.Since the attacks in Paris, the demand for action to stamp out ISIS has rightly grown.The United States should not delay in leading a global coalition to take out ISIS with overwhelming force.As the words of French President Hollande have made clear, the United States will not be alone in galvanizing this global effort.Militarily, we need to intensify our efforts in the air  and on the ground.While air power is essential, it alone cannot bring the results we seek. The United States  in conjunction with our NATO allies and more Arab partners  will need to increase our presence on the ground.The scope of which should be in line with what our military generals recommend will be necessary to achieve our objective.But the bulk of these ground troops will need to come from local forces that we have built workable relationships with.Finally, to take out ISIS, we must end Assad's brutal war against his own people and create a political solution that allows for a stable Syria.Let there be no doubt, this will not be easy.Some of you in this room will serve on the front lines of that fight against ISIS and against radical Islamic terrorism.You will sign up for an uncertain fate, on foreign fields of battle,because your country, and the cause of freedom, are calling you.For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, American military power, and American credibility defended the peace and deterred the violent.This is the way forward in our time as well.But for the United States, who's going to help our friends and allies in the Middle East gain the upper hand against radical Islamic terrorists like ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hizballah?But for the United States, who will lead the effort to once and for all stop Iran's bid for nuclear weapons capability, its support for terrorism, and its ballistic missile proliferation?But for the United States, who will defend Christians, Iranian dissidents, religious minorities, and other persecuted peoples in the Middle East and across the world?Due to President Obama's defense cuts, for the first time in 7 years, there is no U.S. aircraft carrier in the Arabian Gulf to counter Iran."
