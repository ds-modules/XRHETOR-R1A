Bernie Sanders this morning will declare his candidacy for president of the United States. The senator will send an email to hundreds of thousands of supporters declaring his intention to run in the Democratic Party and laying out themes of his campaign:Here are key excerpts:""I am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of the United States. I ask for your support.""For many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across our country, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good, hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeply concerned about the future of our country.""They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity and security.""The challenges facing our country are enormous.""It's not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been disappearing. It's that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at any time since the late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being squeezed and left behind.""The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case and in other related cases are undermining the very foundations of American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super PACS to buy politicians and elections.""And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is the central challenge of our time and our planet.""The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last another generation if we don't boldly change course now.""After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. But let's be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on Sunday that if elected he would nominate Supreme Court justices committed to overturning the Citizens United decision which Sanders said is ""undermining American democracy.""The court's 2010 decision voided campaign funding laws and has opened the floodgates for political spending by corporations and wealthy individuals.""If elected president, I will have a litmus test in terms of my nominee to be a Supreme Court justice. That nominee will say that we are going to overturn this disastrous decision in Citizens United because that decision is undermining American democracy,"" Sanders said during an interview on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" Added Sanders, ""I do not believe that billionaires should be able to buy politicians.""Sanders (I-Vt.), who favors public funding of elections, is the sponsor of a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.In the five years since the court struck down limits on campaign spending, billionaires like the industrialists Charles and David Koch and the Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson have spent heavily on political campaigns. The Koch brothers and their network of other wealthy donors have signaled their intention to invest nearly $1 billion in the next elections. The Brennan Center for Justice recently reported that so-called super PACs spawned by the Citizens United ruling have spent more than $1 billion to influence elections.Sixteen states, including Vermont, and voters and city councils in more than 600 cities and towns have passed measures supporting a constitutional amendment."

As an elected official in Vermont I have held hundreds of town meetings and have knocked on thousands of doors.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 26, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Launches Presidential Campaign in Vermont,"U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday launched his campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In a speech at Waterfront Park before a crowd police estimated at more than 5,000 strong, Sanders laid out the serious challenges facing the country and detailed an ""Agenda for America"" calling for specific proposals to provide bold solutions.""Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally,"" Sanders said. ""Today, we stand here and say loudly and clearly that; 'Enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their Super PACs and their lobbyists.'""Let me be very clear,"" he added. ""There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. There is something profoundly wrong when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about. This has got to change and, as your president, together we will change it.""In his remarks, Sanders discussed serious issues confronting the country including the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that struck down campaign finance laws. ""As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, the American political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do.""Sanders also addressed the planetary crisis of climate change. ""When we talk about our responsibilities as human beings and as parents, there is nothing more important than leaving this country and the entire planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and grandchildren. The debate is over. The scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in the United States and around the world.""Sanders said his campaign will focus on those and other substantive issues, not personal attacks or negative ads.In the few weeks since he officially formed a presidential campaign committee on April 30, Sanders has lined up more than 100,000 supporters and volunteers through BernieSanders.com. (An expanded webpage was launched on Tuesday to coincide with the campaign kickoff.) Sanders also has raised millions of dollars, mostly in small contributions of about $40 per person.After Tuesday's rally in Burlington, where Sanders served as mayor in the 1980s, he was headed on Wednesday to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. On Thursday, he travels to Davenport, Iowa, for the first of several stops in the Hawkeye State, which holds the first presidential caucuses. He has begun building staffs in both states to help organize what will become a nationwide grassroots campaign."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 28, 2015",Press Release - New Hampshire Campaign Kicks into Gear,"What a day! We left Burlington on Wednesday morning after an extraordinary kickoff on Tuesday evening, which was attended by more than 5,500 Vermonters. Our first day on the trail in New Hampshire was beyond belief. There were overflow crowds at each of three stops, and the enthusiasm among supporters was palpable.Bernie spoke at a town meeting at New England College in Concord, the state capital, which was attended by over 200 people. So many showed up that Bernie later spoke to an overflow crowd of about 100 at a nearby park. At the college, three students spoke about the impact of student debt. They thanked Bernie for his work on legislation to provide free tuition to public colleges and universities and to substantially lower interest rates for student loans.We then drove to Epping, New Hampshire, for what was to be a small house party. It turned out that there was an overflow crowd of about 150 people in a tent in the backyard of the home of Katy Williams and Brant Hardy. The discussion was centered on campaign finance reform and the need to get big money out of politics.Also during the afternoon Bernie met with the Concord Monitor editorial board and was interviewed by radio host Chris Ryan.We finished the day in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The energy was unbelievable. As hundreds streamed in, more than 700 people filled every seat in the pews and more than 100 stood in the doors along the side. It was an incredible turnout by an enthusiastic audience. All in all, this was an evening we will not soon forget. ""We are on the road to victory in New Hampshire,"" Bernie told the crowd at South Church.Now on to Iowa.ConcordEnthusiastic supporters packed out a small New England College meeting room in Concord.

He also said students and their parents ought to be able to negotiate better rates on student loans. He would boost in minimum wage eventually to $15 an hour. He also pledged to put 13 million Americans to work by investing $1 trillion in rebuilding roads and bridges and other infrastructure projects.""What we have got to do is to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent,"" Bernie said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 31, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Calls for Early Presidential Debates,"U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called for a series of debates beginning this summer involving Democratic presidential candidates to flesh out their positions on key issues like trade policy and global warming.He also proposed debates with Republican White House hopefuls to highlight policy differences between the major parties on core issues like how to create jobs, address income inequality, provide health care and expand Social Security.In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" with moderator Chuck Todd, Sanders said early debates would help voters understand candidates' positions on important issues. ""When we talk about the important issues, Chuck, we need a lot more debates in this campaign. I hope very much that we can begin with the Democratic candidate debates as early as July and have some Republicans in those debates as well,"" he said.Debates could help voters understand, for example, how candidates may differ on a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal now before Congress. Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership because he believes it would cause more U.S. manufacturing plants to close and result in the transfer of millions of jobs to low-wage nations like Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 58-cents an hour.Debates also could clarify where candidates stand on whether to promote the use of the dirtiest oil on the planet from Canada's tar sands region by constructing a pipeline to ship the crude oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. Sanders opposes the pipeline.Early debates involving both Democrats and Republicans also could revive interest among ordinary voters in the democratic process. One way to get disillusioned voters to participate in elections would be to make it clear that there are major differences between a progressive agenda and the reactionary platform of the Republican Party. That is why Sanders suggested debates including Republican candidates as well as his Democratic rivals for the nomination."

""We are going to go directly to the people in meetings like this and we're going to be knocking on doors all over Minnesota and all across America,"" Sanders told the big and boisterous audience here in that state that holds caucuses early next year when the presidential nominating process gets underway.He laid out detailed policy prescriptions including a $1 trillion push to rebuild America's crumbling roads and bridges and create 13 million good-paying jobs. He said he will lead the effort in Congress to block a new 12-nation trade deal that would ship more American jobs to low-wage nations overseas. He called for raising the minimum wage eventually to $15 an hour from today's starvation wage of $7.25 an hour. He said the wealthy and profitable corporations should not be allowed to continue evading taxes by sheltering profits in offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands. He said 4-year public colleges and universities should be tuition free. He advocated a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system.""Think big,"" Sanders exhorted the crowd.""Bernie Sanders can't do it alone. We have got to do it together through a strong grassroots movement,"" he said. ""We have got to think big. Imagine a nation and a government that works for all of us, not a government dominated by billionaires and their lobbyists. We have got to stand together because when we do there are a heck of a lot more of us than them."""

Bernie Sanders on Sunday urged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to take a stand against a proposed 12-nation trade agreement which backers are expected to try to resurrect this week.""Corporate America and Wall Street are going to bring that bill back to the House. I would hope very much that Secretary Clinton will side with every union in the country, virtually every environmental group and many religious groups and say that this TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] policy is a disaster, that it must be defeated and that we need to regroup and come up with a trade policy which demands that corporate America starts investing in this country rather than in countries all over the world,"" Sanders said on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" ""I look forward to working with Secretary Clinton on this issue,"" he added.""There is no question that what our trade policy has been for many years is to allow corporate America to shut down plants in this country, move abroad, hire people at pennies an hour and then bring their products back to the United States. It is a failed trade policy and I would hope that the secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and the vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, 'No. We've got to defeat this piece of legislation,'"" Sanders told John Dickerson.Clinton's support could be decisive, the senator added in a statement after the interview. ""If she joins us, we could stop this disastrous deal once and for all,"" he said.Some 60,000 factories and millions of good-paying jobs have been lost in the United States since 2001. ""I'm not saying trade is the only reason but it is a significant reason why Americans are working longer hours for lower wages and why we have seen our jobs go to China and other low-wage countries,"" Sanders said.The House of Representatives on Friday derailed the deal in a vote which may be only a temporary victory for American workers. Supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership  multi-national corporations, Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies  are sure to try again this week to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate an agreement that could be passed by an up-or-down vote in Congress."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 19, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Addresses National Latino Conference,"An Immigrant's Son Addresses Latino ConferenceLAS VEGAS  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders told Latino officials at a conference here on Friday that his family shares their immigrant experience and that he supports reforms that would put millions of people living in the United States on a path to citizenship.""I myself am the son of an immigrant,"" the senator told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. He recounted his father's journey to the United States from Poland and how his parents met and married, worked hard, raised a family and sent two sons to college. ""Their story, my story, our story is a story of America. Hard-working families coming to the United States to create a brighter future for their children. It is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope. It is a story that continues to this day in families all across the United States.Sanders said he knows from first-hand experience that not everyone who comes to the United States is treated fairly. He saw America's broken immigration system up close in 2008 when, as a new senator, he traveled to the tomato fields of southern Florida and met with migrant workers paid paltry wages for back-breaking work. Sanders invited leaders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers to come to Washington and testify at a Senate committee hearing where they confronted growers on abusive labor practices. The result in Immokolee was better working conditions and pay.""But how many more Immokalees are out there?"" Sanders asked. ""How many fields or factories are there where people  often without legal status  are used up and thrown away? We cannot continue to run an economy where millions are made so vulnerable because of their undocumented status.""Sanders said he voted in 2013 for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but has languished in the House. ""It is time to bring our neighbors out of the shadows. It is time to give them legal status. It is time to create a reasonable path to citizenship.""Sanders also supported the DREAM Act, which would offer the opportunity of permanent residency and eventual citizenship to young people who were brought to the United States as children. ""It is my belief that we should recognize the young men and women who comprise the Dreamers for what they are  American kids who deserve the right to legally be in the country they know as home.Immigration reform alone is not enough, Sanders added. ""We must also pursue policies that empower minority communities. This must start with energizing Latinos all across the country to engage in the democratic process,"" Sanders said. And he called for new economic policies that empower communities to address the crippling poverty that affects tens of millions of Americans, including more than 12 million Hispanics.He laid out an agenda for all Americans to live in a country where health care is a right, not a privilege; where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college; where every senior can live in dignity and security and not be forced to choose between their medicine or their food; and where every person  no matter their race, their country of origin, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation  realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans.To read the senator's prepared remarks, click here."

In 2010, he voted in the Senate to repeal the discriminatory policy known as ""Don't Ask Don't Tell.""Sanders also supported Vermont's civil unions law in 2000, and he was an outspoken proponent of gay marriage before the Legislature in his home state in 2009 passed one of the nation's first same-sex marriage laws.On CNN, Sanders replied to a question about the Supreme Court ruling after Tapper noted, ""You've been way out in front when it comes to the rights of same-sex couples.""Said Sanders: ""My view is that people have a right to love each other, regardless of one's sexual orientation. I voted against the DOMA Act, the so-called Defense of Marriage Act way back in 1996 that was signed by President Clinton, because I think if people are in love they should be able to get married in this country in 50 states in America. And I strongly support what the Supreme Court recently said,"" Sanders told CNN.Tapper asked the senator whether tax exemptions should be taken away from any organizations, including religious organizations, which do not recognize same-sex marriage. ""I don't know that I would go there. You know, we have religious freedom and I respect people who have different points of view.""Sanders' outspoken support for gay rights dates back to at least as long ago as 1983 when, as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he supported a then-controversial resolution designating that June 25 as Lesbian and Gay Pride Day. According to a recent report in the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, opposition to the proposal ""was strong  and, in some instances, vitriolic,"" but Sanders indicated at the City Council meeting that he would sign the proclamation. ""In the city of Burlington and in the state of Vermont, people have the right to exercise their lifestyles,"" Sanders said. ""It's an American right, anyone's right to have a march This is a civil liberties question."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"July 6, 2015",Press Release - Mainers Back Bernie at Big Rally,"PORTLAND, Maine  More than 7,500 people packed an arena here Monday night in another big show of grassroots support for Bernie Sanders.""In case you didn't notice, this is a big turnout,"" Sanders told the placard-waving crowd as they cheered his call to take on the billionaire class and rebuild the American middle class.""From Maine to California, the American people understand that establishment politics and establishment economics are not working for America,"" Sanders said. ""They understand that the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the great middle class of this country and people from coast to coast are saying, 'You can't keep getting away with it.'""In his fiery speech, Sanders pledged to address gaps in wealth and income inequality that are greater than at any time since the Great Depression. The big turnouts, he said, are sending a powerful message that Americans are tired of a system rigged to help the rich and powerful instead of working families.""It is not acceptable that a handful of billionaires is now controlling our political process and the time is long overdue for the corporate media to start talking about the real issues,"" Sanders said. ""People are becoming involved in this campaign because they want change  real change  and that is what this campaign is about.""Sanders was introduced by Troy Jackson, a logger from Allagash, Maine, who praised the senator's willingness to take on ""the big corporate structure."" Sanders' proposals for improving health care, raising the minimum wage and making higher education tuition-free also were cited by the Democratic National Committee member and former Maine Senate majority leader. ""What a lot of people are feeling is that there is somebody speaking to their issues,"" Jackson told the Portland Press-Herald. ""That's why you're seeing so many people come out.""He also called for closing tax loopholes that let profitable corporations stash income in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. He said he would break up the largest financial institutions in the country that are bigger today than before they were bailed out by taxpayers after the 2008 Wall Street crash.The Portland turnout was another in a string of big crowds coming out for Sanders. A 10,000-seat arena in Madison, Wisconsin, was filled to capacity last Wednesday when more people turned out than for any presidential candidate anywhere so far this campaign. On the Friday night before the Fourth of July, more than 2,500 showed up at a convention center in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the biggest Iowa audience for any candidate to date."

""This is not democracy. This is called oligarchy.""As examples of policies Bush would champion, Sanders cited Bush's assertion this week that Americans, who already work harder and longer than workers in other major countries, should work even longer hours. He also said Bush would cut Social Security and opposes a long overdue updating of overtime rules to raise the pay for some 5 million workers.Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic Party nomination, called for undoing the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United. That's the case which opened the floodgates to unlimited campaign contributions by corporations and billionaire benefactors like Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson and the industrialists Charles and David Koch.""The fact is that Bush's donors  are undermining the foundation of American democracy,"" Sanders said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"July 12, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Economic Agenda Puts Spotlight on Poor and Collapsing Middle Class,"EDGARTOWN, Mass.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that he would take his presidential campaign to all corners of the country to highlight poverty in the United States and unite the nation behind ways to help working families and the collapsing middle class.""The American people understand that establishment politics and establishment economics are not working for the middle class and working families of this country and they want real change. They want to end the absurdity of seeing the middle class in this country continue its 40-year decline,"" Sanders said in an interview on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation.""He also detailed policy differences with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, another Democratic presidential candidate. ""There are differences of opinion we have that should be the basis of reasonable discussion,"" he said, mentioning climate change, the need to break up big banks and their different votes on authorizing the war in Iraq.Sanders also discussed many of the wide-ranging economic policies he already has detailed in legislation or in policy proposals.He will soon introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour so no one who works 40 hours a week will live in poverty.He has proposed a $1 trillion investment in rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges to create or support 13 million jobs.To address youth unemployment, he recently filed legislation with Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to provide $5.5 billion for states and local governments to employ 1 million youth from ages 16 to 24 years old. According to Economic Policy Institute research conducted for Sanders, youth unemployment for high school graduates and dropouts is 33 percent for white youth, 36 percent for Hispanic youth and 51 percent for African-American young people.As part of a ""family values"" legislative agenda, Sanders would provide affordable child care, paid family leave for parents to care for newborns and guaranteed vacation for workers.To better care for seniors, Sanders has led the fight against efforts to cut Social Security benefits and raise the retirement age. Instead, Sanders has proposed expanding the program that has lifted millions of seniors out of poverty. He would strengthen Social Security finances for decades to come by applying the payroll tax to workers who earn $250,000 or more a year.He wants equal pay for women workers who now make 78 percent of what male counterparts make.To help students and our overall economy, he has introduced legislation to make four-year public colleges and universities tuition free so all qualified students, regardless of their income, may get a higher education.To reverse the decline of American manufacturing and the flow of good-paying jobs to low-wage nations overseas, Sanders would reform trade policies that have shuttered more than 60,000 factories and cost more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs.To provide better health care for more people at less cost, he would provide a Medicare-for-all, single payer health care system.To better care for the sick and hungry, he would expand Medicare, Medicaid and nutrition programs that were first approved in landmark legislation signed by President Lyndon Johnson 50 years ago this month.To address income and wealth inequality and pay for the proposals, Sanders would close tax loopholes, end the abuse of tax shelters in the Cayman islands and other tax havens, raise taxes on Wall Street speculators and raise tax rates for the wealthiest people in America."

Bernie Sanders appeared here on Monday at the annual convention of the National Council of La Raza.The son of an immigrant from Poland, Sanders called for comprehensive immigration reform and denounced those who would divide Americans over race and national origin.He referred specifically to recent remarks by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.While ""racism has plagued the United States since its inception,"" Sanders said the nation has advanced. ""We should be proud that in recent decades we have made real progress,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, another 8,000 Texans packed a Dallas hotel.At both appearances, Sanders discussed wealth and income inequality, the ""national tragedy"" of youth unemployment, making college tuition-free, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and the need for a massive federal highway construction program to create millions of decent-paying jobs.He also questioned why the United States puts more people behind bars than any other nation. ""When we have so many of our young people in jail, to me it makes sense that we invest more in jobs and education rather than jails and incarceration,"" Sanders said.And here in Houston, Sanders brought up the death last Monday of Sandra Bland, a young African-American woman found dead in her Waller County jail cell 60 miles northwest of Houston. The 28-year-old from suburban Chicago had been arrested July 10 after a routine traffic stop. The medical examiner said her death was a suicide. Bland's family disputes the finding.""I wish that in the year 2015, I could tell you that we have eliminated racism in our country but you all know that is not true,"" Sanders said.In citing the death of Bland, Sanders also mentioned other recent deaths of African-Americans in police custody.

Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who died last April while being transported in a Baltimore Police van. Tamir Rice was 12 years old when he was shot and killed in 2014 by two police officers in Cleveland, Ohio.""These are the cases that you have heard about recently but anyone who thinks this has not been going on decade after decade would be very wrong,"" Sanders said. ""It is unacceptable that police officers beat up people or kill people. If they do that, they have got to be held accountable.""As a former mayor, Sanders said he worked with police.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"July 25, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Addresses Southern Christian Leadership Conference on Struggle for Racial Justice,"BATON ROUGE, La.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Saturday that the ""continuing struggle for racial justice in America"" must confront the ""horrible facts"" of how African-Americans are treated by the criminal justice system in the United States.In remarks prepared for a Southern Christian Leadership Conference meeting here tonight, Sanders said one in four African-American males born today is likely to spend time behind bars. He called it an ""unspeakable tragedy"" that blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites.He cited a Department of Justice study which found that blacks are three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop than white motorists. He said African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and nearly four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with police.African-Americans make up two-fifths of all young people in prisons, he added. African-American women are three times more likely than white women to be incarcerated. Upon conviction for a crime, black offenders receive 10 percent longer sentences than whites for the same crimes. Minorities, moreover, are sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than whites, added Sanders, a capital punishment opponent.""Of course the majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children,"" Sanders added. ""But there are neighborhoods where mothers are afraid to let their children outside for fear of gang violence and drugs. And they are also afraid of their children being targeted by the police because of the color of their skin. No person should have to worry that a routine interaction with law enforcement will end in violence or death.""The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice, Sanders recalled. But today, the senator said, ""too many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. A growing number of communities do not trust the police and police have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect.""He cited the deaths in police custody of Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice. ""We know their names. Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody. The chants are growing louder. People are angry; I am angry; and people have a right to be angry. Violence and brutality of any kind  particularly at the hands of law enforcement sworn to protect and serve our communities  is unacceptable and must not be tolerated,"" he said.""Black lives do matter,"" Sanders said in detailing a series of reforms. He called for shifting from militarized local police forces to more community policing like he put in place as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. The federal government should help local law enforcement agencies reform how police officers are trained, he said, and body cameras should be provided for law enforcement agencies to create a record of police encounters with citizens. States and local governments should get more U.S. Justice Department grant support to encourage those initiatives, he said, but police departments which don't reform should have federal funding slashed.He said police and prosecutors should not be judged by how many people are locked away. For people whose crimes landed them in jail, there must be a path back from prison. There should be education and skills-training for those who are incarcerated. And prisons should not be packed with non-violent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society. ""It is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth  more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China. That has got to end,"" Sanders said.Linking racial justice with economic justice, Sanders said minorities would benefit from programs to reduce poverty and lift up the middle class. He proposed, for example, raising the minimum hourly wage to $15, which he called for in a Senate bill introduced on Wednesday. He cited the need to pass a youth jobs bill, which he introduced with Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), and argued that putting millions of Americans back to work rebuilding roads and bridges would create millions of decent-paying jobs.King, the great civil rights leader, drew a connection between racial discrimination and economic issues. He cited King's view that the problem in the United States was structural. ""This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor,"" King once declared.To read the complete text of the prepared remarks, click here."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"July 28, 2015","Press Release - Sanders Opposes Tar Sands Pipeline, Calls Clinton's Lack of Stand 'Hard to Understand'","WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday reasserted his strong opposition to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would bring oil from Canada's tar sands region to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico in Texas.Sanders made clear his opposition to the controversial pipeline on the same day former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked during a New Hampshire town meeting for a ""yes or no"" answer on whether she supports the project. She declined to answer.Said Sanders, ""We have to address the planetary crisis of climate change and there is no question that we must move aggressively toward energy efficiency and the development of sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. That is why I have introduced legislation that would create 10 million solar rooftops on homes and businesses in the United States. So I agree with Secretary Clinton about the need for substantial investment in sustainable energy.""But that is not enough,"" Sanders added. ""We must make significant reductions in carbon emissions and break our dependency on fossil fuels. That is why I have helped lead the fight in the Senate against the Keystone pipeline which would transport some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world.""It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose the Keystone pipeline.""Sanders was asked by reporters to comment on the pipeline after Mrs. Clinton was questioned at the town-hall meeting in Nashua, New Hampshire. ""This is President Obama's decision and I'm not going to second-guess him,"" she reportedly said. ""If it's undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.""Sanders has a strong Senate record on environmental legislation.A member of both the environment and energy committees, he was the lead sponsor of a bill to tax carbon and methane emissions that cause climate change. The idea has drawn increased support from environmentalists and economists. The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the former chairman of the environment committee. She called Sanders' proposal the ""gold standard"" on climate change legislation.Sanders also wrote legislation that created an energy efficiency block grant program. His measure was folded into a broader energy bill that Congress passed in 2007. He later secured $3.2 billion for the initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.Sanders' 10 Million Solar Roofs Act would make solar power more affordable and make it simpler for homeowners and businesses to get local permits."

Bernie Sanders on Saturday welcomed reports that a push for a new 12-nation trade deal had stalled amid differences over maneuvers by drug makers who want to jack up prescription medicine prices around the world.""Some of the countries understand what the pharmaceutical companies want and they're not going to give it to them,"" Sanders told a town meeting here at Southern New Hampshire University. ""They want to have not only Americans but people around the world pay sky-high prices for prescription drugs.""Meetings in Hawaii reportedly deadlocked on Friday over protections for drug companies. The talks ended as negotiators reportedly neared agreement on a major Pacific Rim trade agreement known at the Trans-Pacific Partnership.New Zealand negotiators reportedly foiled U.S. efforts to extend patent protections and raise prices for medications. Australia and Chile also were said to be resisting the U.S. push to shield pharmaceutical companies for up to 12 years from competition by lower-priced generic drugs.""Let's defeat TPP,"" Sanders said to cheers from the more than 500 people who came out to hear him discuss the trade deal and other issues in his campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.Sanders has strongly opposed the job-killing agreement."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 1, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Endorsed by Friends of the Earth,"CONCORD, N.H.  Winning the first major endorsement for any presidential candidate by a national environmental group, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday welcomed Friends of the Earth's backing for his White House campaign.""I am very honored to receive the endorsement of one of the great environmental organizations not only in America but in the world,"" Sanders said at the news conference at a park here along the banks of the Merrimack River.The endorsement was announced by Michael Herz, a former chairman and current Friends of the Earth board member. Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth Action, said in a statement that the endorsement means his group's 2 million activists will promote Sanders' bid to become the Democratic Party nominee for president.""He has proven himself a bold and fearless voice for the planet,"" Pica said of Sanders in a prepared statement. ""Sen. Sanders' bold ideas and real solutions to addressing climate change, inequality and promoting a transformative economy that prioritizes public health and the environment over corporate profits, have earned him an enthusiastic endorsement from Friends of the Earth Action.""In the audience at the news conference was Jerry Curran, the chairman of the New Hampshire chapter of the Sierra Club. Another leading environmentalist and best-selling author, Bill McKibben, took part in the May 26 kickoff of Sanders' presidential campaign at a Lake Champlain shoreline park in Burlington, Vermont.In accepting the Friends of the Earth endorsement, Sanders focused on the most serious environmental issue confronting the planet: global warming. ""We need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into sustainable energy,"" Sanders said.The endorsement capped a week during which Sanders welcomed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support for solar power and energy efficiency, but questioned her refusal to take a stand on construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean.""If you're concerned about climate change, say no to the Keystone XL pipeline,"" Sanders said at the news conference. He said the pipeline would ship some of the dirtiest oil on the planet from Canada's tar sands region across the United States to refineries in Texas.Sanders' clear stand on the pipeline was among the factors Friends of the Earth cited in its endorsement.Sanders said he would tax emissions from burning oil and coal to discourage the use of fossil fuels responsible for climate change. He has proposed eliminating $135 billion in tax breaks for fossil fuel companies which turn enormous profits. He introduced legislation Congress passed to create an energy efficiency block grant program. His measure was folded into a broader energy bill that Congress passed in 2007. He later secured $3.2 billion for the initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. And his 10 Million Solar Roofs Act would make solar power more affordable and make it simpler for homeowners and businesses to get local permits.  "

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 2, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Proposes Public Funding of Campaigns,"ROLLINSFORD, N.H.  Decrying the influence of big money in American politics, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said he will introduce legislation to provide public funding of elections. ""We're going to introduce legislation which will allow people to run for office without having to beg money from the wealthy and the powerful,"" Sanders said.He called the current campaign finance system a ""sad state of affairs."" Public funding, he added, would level the political playing field and make elections more competitive. It also would let candidates spend more time meeting voters and discussing issues and less time raising campaign funds. ""That's called democracy and I am going to do everything I can to bring that about,"" Sanders said.Sanders spoke about campaign finances during an hour-long speech to about 300 people at a town meeting. It was his first stop on Sunday as part of a two-day swing through New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary election next February.Public funding of campaigns would counteract the disastrous Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Citizens United. That 2010 case and others which followed in its wake have gutted decades-old limits on campaign funding and paved the way for millionaires and billionaires to spend unlimited sums to influence election outcomes. ""We must overturn that decision before it's too late,"" Sanders told the crowd here. ""We are increasingly living in an oligarchy where big money is buying politicians,"" Sanders added.He cited former President Jimmy Carter's concerns about how the Citizens United ruling resulting in ""unlimited political bribery.""The senator compared politicians to NASCAR drivers with their sponsor's logos emblazoned on their uniforms. He imagined a politician with a sign saying, ""I'm sponsored by the Koch brothers"" or ""I'm sponsored by Big Oil."" Said Sanders, ""It's a really sad state of affairs.""In his own presidential campaign, Sanders has said he does not want help from super PACs, which the Citizens United ruling spawned. Instead, during the first two months after he declared his candidacy, Sanders has relied on contributors who gave him small donations.Altogether, more than 76.5 percent of all contributions  totaling more than $10.5 million  came from individuals who donated less than $200."

""We've got 12,000 people here,"" he said to roar of the crowd inside the pavilion. ""And a few minutes ago, I just talked to 3,000 people outside,"" he added, citing a Seattle police estimate.The big turnouts are sending a powerful message, Sanders said, in arenas and convention centers here and in other cities from Phoenix to Houston to New Orleans to Madison, Wisconsin. (The 11,300 turnout in Phoenix on July 18 was the biggest crowd for any presidential candidate before the rally here in Seattle.)""All across this country people are sick and tired of establishment politics, establishment economics and they want real change,"" he said. ""The people of America understand that corporate greed is destroying our country,"" he added, ""and that much of the mainstream media is prepared to talk about everything except for what is the most important.""The record crowd for any presidential candidate so far this campaign heard Sanders speak about wealth and income inequality, the need for a massive federal jobs program, tuition-free public college, the need to strengthen and expand Social Security, reform the criminal justice system and confront racism.""As somebody who has one of the strongest lifetime civil rights record in Congress, no president will fight harder to end the stain of racism in this country and reform the criminal justice system,"" he said.He also has proposed making public higher education tuition free.

This is an unbelievable turnout,"" Sanders said after he walked onto the stage. Consistently drawing bigger turnouts than any other presidential contender, Sanders told the packed Portland arena, ""You've done it better than anyone else."" The arena seats were filled and thousands more listened to the speech on loudspeakers outside, according to Michael Lewellen, a Rose Quarter vice president. The total turnout far surpassed the 15,000 in Seattle just 24 hours earlier.The big and boisterous crowds, Sanders said, are sending a message that it's time to reverse the four-decade decline of the American middle class and launch a grassroots ""political revolution"" to take on the billionaire class. ""Bringing people together,"" Sanders added, is at the core of his campaign.Sanders also called for criminal justice reform. ""There is no candidate who will fight harder to end institutional racism in this country and to reform our broken criminal justice system,"" he said.In the nearly hour-long speech, Sanders touched on economic and jobs proposals, criminal justice reform and civil rights issues.On domestic issues, the U.S. senator from Vermont advocated raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy and profitable corporations, undertaking a massive $1 trillion program to fix roads and bridges and create or sustain 13 million jobs, a Medicare-for-all health care system to provide better care for more people at less cost, an expansion of Social Security and tuition-free college.In an interview broadcast earlier Sunday on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Sanders had made the case for the agreement with Iran reached by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.

""We are proud to stand with him in his candidacy for president,"" she added in remarks before delivering Sanders his first national labor union endorsement.Flanked by nurses in red scrubs at the union's Bay Area headquarters, Sanders thanked the 185,000-strong labor organization for providing high-quality health care to Americans. ""I am humbled and enormously appreciative of you support,"" Sanders said.He called nurses ""the backbone of our health care system"" and added, ""I want to thank each of you for the work that you do.""Sanders has worked for years with the California-based national nurses' group to strengthen Medicare, address the nation's nursing shortage and ensure collective-bargaining rights and decent wages and benefits. He praised the critical role National Nurses United has played in improving the health care system, working to prevent medical errors and reducing costs.He also welcomed the nurses' backing for Medicare-for-all legislation that he will soon introduce to provide better care for more people at less cost. ""The time has come for us to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right.""A leading champion for health care reform, the union also stresses social and economic justice issues as a key part of its mission.The nurses' union leader praised Sanders' proposals to address income and wealth inequality. He has called, for example, for an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour and for pay equity for women.Sanders also stands out, added DeMoro, for his outspoken opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The proposed trade deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations, she noted, includes a handout to pharmaceutical giants that would further drive up prescription drug prices.And she cited the union's push for a Wall Street transactions tax, legislation he introduced to put a small fee on speculators and hedge funds to finance Sanders' proposal for tuition-free public colleges and universities.National Nurses United represents nurses from coast-to-coast and in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, three states that play a critical early role in the nominating process.To read Sanders' full prepared statement, click here."

""I give you, if we're all very smart and a little bit lucky, the next president of the United States,"" she said. The crowd roared its approval.And there were more thunderous cheers and applause when Sanders walked up a catwalk onto the stage and proclaimed, in a hoarse shout, that ""this country belongs to all of us and not a handful of billionaires. We need a grassroots political revolution.""Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena officials said there were 27,500 people inside the arena and watching on giant TV screens in an overflow area outside.

""This is a campaign that is on the move,"" Sanders said, ""and, together, this is a campaign that will end in victory.""He spoke for about an hour about domestic and foreign policy issues.On foreign policy, Sanders reminded the audience that he voted against the war in Iraq. They cheered. Then he said he spoke with President Barack Obama last week and assured him that he will support an agreement with Iran to stop it from developing a nuclear weapon. There was more applause. But the audience really erupted when he added, ""War has got to be the last recourse, not the first.""He was cheered when he called for public funding of campaigns. ""This campaign is not a billionaire-funded campaign. It is a people campaign,"" he said. ""We don't take money from billionaires. We don't take money from corporations. Yet we have received more individual contributions than any other campaign. We don't have the money but when people stand together there is nothing we can't accomplish.""Angelenos approved when Sanders congratulated the city for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He has a Senate bill to put the federal hourly minimum wage at $15 by 2020. They applauded his call for a massive road and bridge project to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure and create 13 million good-paying jobs.Perhaps the biggest crowd reaction of the night came when he called for tuition-free public colleges and universities, something the University of California system once offered to qualified students.""The reason why we are doing well in this campaign is because we are telling the truth. We are talking to the reality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which almost all of the wealth and income in this country is going to the top 1 percent. We are talking about the United States having more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on earth and we are going to change that.""  "

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 15, 2015","Press Release - Sanders Calls for Strengthening Social Security, Slams Republican Plans to Dismantle Retirement Program","BOONE, Iowa  Eighty years after Social Security was signed into law, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called for strengthening and expanding the retirement and disability program and slammed Republican White House hopefuls who would dismantle Social Security.Sanders outlined his legislation during a town hall meeting here at the Boone County Fairgrounds. He also planned to talk about Republican attacks on the program at The Des Moines Register's State Fair Soapbox.""Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history. Through good times and bad, Social Security has paid out every benefit owed to every eligible American,"" Sanders said. ""The most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share as everyone else.""Republican presidential candidates have floated proposals to cut Social Security. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham all have suggested raising the retirement age. Proposals to privatize the system have been advanced by many of those candidates and by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.""It is unacceptable to ask construction workers, truck drivers, nurses and other working-class Americans to work until they are 68 to 70 years old before qualifying for full Social Security benefits,"" Sanders said.In Iowa, more than 616,000 people (19.8 percent of the population) received $9 billion in Social Security benefits last year. This includes more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children.Social Security lifted 228,000 Iowans out of poverty in 2013. The average Social Security benefit was just $14,556 in 2014. Without Social Security, 47 percent of the elderly, including more than half of senior women in Iowa, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate for Iowa is just 4.7 percent. For Iowa women it is 8.2 percent.In Washington, D.C., Sanders introduced legislation on March 12 to expand benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. Under current law, the amount of income subject to the payroll tax is capped at $118,500. That means someone making millions of dollars a year pays the same amount in payroll taxes as someone making $118,500 a year. Sanders would levy the payroll tax on all income over $250,000. That change would impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, according to the Center for Economic Policy Research.Having the wealthiest Americans contribute their fair share would extend the solvency of Social Security through 2065 and allow benefits to be expanded for millions of Americans. ""At a time when over half of the American people have less than $10,000 in savings and senior poverty is increasing, we should not be talking about cutting Social Security benefits. We should be talking about expanding benefits to make sure that every American can retire with dignity,"" the senator said.Under the legislation, Social Security benefits would go up by about $65 a month for most recipients. Annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients would increase and set a new minimum benefit to significantly reduce the senior poverty rate.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935.Social Security today has a $2.8 trillion surplus and will be able to pay all promised benefits until 2033, after which it will be able to pay around 75 percent of all promised benefits. Sanders' Social Security Expansion Act would increase revenue and extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 50 years.To read what Republican candidates say about Social Security, click here."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 17, 2015","Press Release - Chicago Feels the Bern, Sanders Meets with Rev. Jackson","CHICAGO  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Monday brought his call for a ""political revolution"" to a crowd of more than 820 people packed inside a historic theater here on the Windy City's North Side.Earlier Monday, the U.S. senator from Vermont visited the South Side headquarters of Operation PUSH for a meeting with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. Long-time friends, the senator and the civil rights leader held a very productive, hour-long meeting on important issues confronting the country and the African-American community.Civil rights and criminal justice reform were among the key topics Sanders addressed in remarks at the Park West theater. ""As somebody who has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress, no one will fight harder to end institutional racism in this country and, equally important, reform the criminal justice system,"" Sanders said.He said he will soon propose legislation to stop private corporations from making money on the incarceration of prisoners. He also called for reforming sentencing laws and providing better ways for those in prison to return to society.""We are going to end this horrendous distinction of having more people in jail than any other country on earth and instead work to create the best-educated population on earth,"" Sanders added. ""In my view, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to be investing in jobs and education instead of jails and incarceration.""A spotlight beamed on Sanders at center stage as he thanked the standing-room-only crowd for joining him in ""fighting for a country that belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires.""The event was a small-dollar fundraiser with tickets starting at $50. It was only the fifth formal fundraiser in the nearly four months since Sanders launched his campaign last spring. Since then, more than 350,000 supporters have donated to his campaign. Unlike other candidates who have relied on Super PACs and the unlimited donations they can take from wealthy donors, Sanders said the average donation to his campaign so far is $31.20.""We are seeing in America today a campaign finance system which is corrupt,"" he said of the campaign funding mechanism created by a disastrous 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which opened the floodgates to unlimited spending by corporations and wealthy individuals.""I don't believe in the agenda of corporate America. I don't believe in the agenda of the billionaire class. And I don't want their money,"" Sanders said. ""But at the end of the day money doesn't always win. What we are showing is that millions of people agree with us.""Sanders was introduced by Cook County Commissioner Jess G. ""Chuy"" Garca, 10th Ward Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza, 35th Ward Ald. Carlos Rosa and Robert Peters of the National People's Alliance.The first Chicago Teachers Union member on the Chicago City Council said her successful campaign and its ""people-powered politics"" was a model for the grassroots movement Sanders is building."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 18, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Lays out Agenda for Working Families at AFL-CIO in Nevada,"LAS VEGAS  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tuesday spoke here at the Nevada State AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.He called for a $1 trillion, five-year investment in rebuilding roads and bridges and other infrastructure projects to support 13 million decent-paying jobs. He advocated raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, more than double the $7.25 an hour under current law. He urged men to stand with women for pay equity.Shedding his suit coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, Sanders also made the case against a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal. A leading opponent in Congress of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, Sanders said the corporate-backed agreement which is uniformly opposed by labor would continue a string of disastrous trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and others which have destroyed millions of decent-paying jobs in the United States.""During my 24 years in Congress, I have been proud to stand side by side with the AFL-CIO fighting to increase the minimum wage; fighting to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right of citizenship; fighting to make it easier for workers to join unions; fighting to create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; fighting for pay equity for women workers; fighting for paid family and medical leave; fighting to expand, not cut, Social Security,"" Sanders said in prepared remarks.At a news conference afterward, Sanders told reporters he agrees with the AFL-CIO effort to eliminate the excise tax on health benefits union workers earned in collective bargaining agreements.He also spoke about the gains labor unions have helped achieve for working families.""When only the wealthy were allowed to vote, the trade union movement was successful in demanding universal suffrage and a more democratic society. When tiny children were forced to work in the factories and fields, it was the trade union movement who put an end to abusive child labor and who fought for quality public education. When bosses refused to negotiate with their workers and fired them for standing up for their rights, the trade union movement pushed Congress into passing legislation which guaranteed all people the right to organize unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits.""The list goes on. Social Security, the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, affordable housing  are just a few of the benefits that workers have won over the years thanks in large part to the trade union movement,"" Sanders said.After speaking at the labor convention, Sanders headed to Reno for a rally at the University of Nevada expected to draw a crowd of several thousand supporters. ""How come people are coming out?"" he asked before answering his own question. ""Because they've had it up to here.""This is the third time this year that Sanders has visited Nevada, one of the first states to hold caucuses to begin the process of selecting the Democratic Party nominee for president.To read the senator's prepared remarks at the AFL-CIO, click here."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"August 21, 2015",Press Release - Big Crowds Turn Out for Sanders in South Carolina,"COLUMBIA, S.C.  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Friday addressed more than 5,500 supporters who packed convention halls here in the state capital and in Greenville, South Carolina, on the first day of a weekend swing through the key early primary state.In Greenville, a big Bernie banner featuring the distinctive palmetto tree symbol hung high overhead as Sanders addressed the crowd of 2,800. Another 2,700 packed a low-ceilinged hall and an overflow area here at the Medallion Center. In his speeches and in private meetings with African-American ministers and community leaders, Sanders spoke about ""institutional racism"" that persists in America and in this state where last June 17 nine people were killed at a prayer service at Charleston's historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.""There is no one who will fight harder not only to end institutional racism, but to make fundamental changes in our broken criminal justice system,"" Sanders said.He also pledged to fight the ""political cowards"" who exploited a Supreme Court ruling that gutted the Voting Rights Act by passing laws designed to suppress turnout on Election Day.In Sanders' wide-ranging speeches, he also talked about high unemployment and the need to create jobs. He proposed a $1 trillion roads and bridges rebuilding program. He said the Trans Pacific Partnership, the latest corporate-backed, job-killing trade deal, must be defeated. He called for bold solutions to address the looming planetary crisis of climate change. And one of the biggest applause lines in both speeches was when he talked about his legislation to make public colleges and universities tuition free.Sanders speech at the Medallion Center was broadcast live on C-SPAN. Afterward the senator answered questions from the public service network's Steve Scully.Sanders has assembled a talented and experienced campaign staff in South Carolina led by Chris Covert, the state director, and Lawrence Moore, the political director. Covert, who lives with his family in James Island, is veteran of campaigns in the Palmetto State. Moore, who is from Columbia, played key roles in campaigns for the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. and the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).To watch Sanders on C-SPAN, click here.To read more about Sanders' team in South Carolina, click here."

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday capped a two-day swing through South Carolina with a rally here that drew 3,150 supporters to the North Charleston Convention Center.In this city where a white gunman in June killed nine people inside a historically black church, Sanders discussed the need for racial justice reforms. ""Racism still remains a much too real part of American society. No one can deny it,"" Sanders said. He spoke of ""the sickness of a man who can walk into a Bible study class in Charleston and then take out a gun and kill nine people.""""As president of the United States,"" Sanders told the North Charleston audience, ""nobody will fight harder to end institutional racism and to reform our broken criminal justice system.""He also cited the case of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man killed last spring after a traffic stop by a North Charleston police officer later charged with murder. Scott is among too many African-Americans, Sanders said, who ""died unnecessarily at the hands of police officers or in police custody. That must change,"" he added.On another critical issue in South Carolina, Sanders said 27 percent of the state's children live in poverty and of those 300,000 children, 138,000 are black, 95,000 are white and 34,000 are Hispanic. ""This issue of childhood poverty impacts every race and we've got to stand together to change it,"" Sanders said.On health care, he said it was ""tragically wrong"" for Gov. Nikki Haley and the state Legislature to refuse to expand Medicaid coverage for 200,000 poor and working families under the Affordable Care Act. ""Don't punish the people of your own state,"" Sanders said, because of ""your dislike of President Obama.""Addressing the centerpiece of his campaign, Sanders said that ""our country today has more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on earth."" He called the gap between the rich and the rest of America ""the great moral, economic and political issue of our time.""  The U.S. senator from Vermont also touched on other proposals to rebuild the American middle class and take on the billionaire class.He spoke out about the need to create jobs (he has proposed a $1 trillion road and bridge rebuilding project); the necessity to raise wages (he would raise the federal hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $15); the importance of providing health care for all Americans (he will soon introduce legislation to extend Medicare for seniors to cover all Americans); and the need to strengthen and expand Social Security (he proposed a bill to increase benefits and pay for it by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as other wage earners).The speech here drew the biggest turnout this weekend but there also were big crowds in Greenville (2,800), Columbia (2,700) and Sumter, South Carolina (600).Watch the South Carolina recap video here:"

He said he was not faulting how reporters cover him but how news organizations too often ignore critical issues for working families.""I want you to talk about and force discussion about climate change. Do you think you do that enough? I would like you to force discussion of poverty in America. I have talked over and over and over again that 51 percent of African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed. You think that's an important issue? I do. Are you going to discuss it?""""The American people want a discussion of the real issues,"" he added. ""They don't really care that Marco Rubio threw a football and hit some kid in the head. Not one of the great issues facing our society.""At the last town meeting of the two-day New Hampshire swing, 750 people filled the Littleton Opera House. Hundreds more watched on television monitors outside. On Monday morning, Conway Fire Chief Stephen Solomon said 750 filled the Kennett Middle School Cafeteria.

With $15.2 million raised altogether during the quarter covered by the most recent Federal Election Commission reports, Sanders has more contributions of $200 or less than any candidate in either major party, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports for The New York Times.Sanders raised the same issue on Friday during a speech to the Democratic National Committee summer meeting in Minneapolis.""We need a grassroots movement which tells the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they will not be able to continue to buy candidates and elections,"" he said in the DNC speech."" In that speech to the DNC, Sanders also pledged not to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court ""unless that candidate is loud and clear saying one of the first orders of business will be to rehear and overturn Citizens United.""Super PACs were created after the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. The 5-4 ruling in that 2010 case opened the floodgates to unlimited spending on campaigns by corporations and billionaires, like Charles and David Koch.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 1, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Plan Would Stop Runaway Prescription Drug Prices,"BURLINGTON, Vt.  Letting Medicare negotiate with drug companies for lower price prescription medications and cracking down on pharmaceutical industry fraud are among proposals that Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders outlined Tuesday as part of a package to rein in runaway prices for prescription medicine.Prescription prices jumped 12.6 percent last year in the United States, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That increase was more than double the rise in overall medical costs.""Americans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren't willing to challenge the drug and health care industry lobby,"" Sanders said. The pharmaceutical industry last year doled out almost $230 million to lobby Congress.Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said he will introduce legislation to let the Department of Health and Human Services negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Using the buying power of the federal government to get better deals on drug prices for taxpayers and seniors on Medicare would dramatically lower the costs.Sanders also proposed tough new penalties for drug companies that commit fraud. ""We should pass legislation which says that drug companies lose their government-backed monopoly on a drug if they are found guilty of fraud in the manufacture or sale of that drug,"" Sanders said.To encourage wider availability of more affordable generic drugs, Sanders said Congress should ban the practice of brand-name drugmakers paying potential competitors to keep lower-priced generic substitutes off the market. Brand-name drugs cost, on average, 10 times as much as generics.Sanders also would lower barriers to the importation of lower-cost drugs from other countries like Canada, where he once took a busload of Vermonters to purchase a prescription breast cancer drug at a fraction of the cost charged in the United States for the same medicine.In separate legislation, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) last May introduced legislation that would make companies pay rebates to the Medicaid program if generic prices grew faster than inflation.""Between our government's unwillingness to negotiate prices and its failure to effectively fight fraud, it's no wonder drug prices are out of control. We have got to make sure that everyone in this country can afford the prescription drugs that they need to live healthy lives,"" Sanders said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 4, 2015","Press Release - Sanders Calls for Immigration Reform, Rips Trump Attacks on Immigrants","MUSCATINE, Iowa  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told a Latino roundtable meeting here on Friday that ""mean and degrading"" remarks about immigrants by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump are ""unacceptable.""Sanders also faulted the Republican-controlled House of Representatives for refusing to consider a Senate-passed immigration reform bill passed by a bipartisan majority of 68-32 in 2013. ""It is incomprehensible that the U.S. House has not yet taken up the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the Senate with my support,"" Sanders said. ""We need legislation which takes 11 million undocumented people living in the United States out of the shadows and puts them on a path to citizenship.""Turning to Trump's attacks on immigrants, Sanders said that ""honest people can disagree on immigration reform but candidates running for president should not stoop to racism and demagoguery to win votes.""In a statement, Sanders said: ""This country has experienced racism for hundreds of years. I would have hoped that by the year 2015 leading candidates for president like Mr. Trump would campaign on their ideas as to how they can address our serious problems, and not by trying to divide the country with racist and demagogic appeals. Clearly Trump is scapegoating the Hispanic community. Immigrants are not responsible,"" Sanders stressed, ""for the disappearing American middle class, the Wall Street collapse brought on by huge financial institutions' greed and illegal behavior, the war in Iraq, income inequality or climate change."" At the roundtable discussion, Sanders called Trump's comments ""mean"" and ""denigrating"" to an entire group of people and accused him of using Latinos as ""whipping boys"" to distract attention from real problems confronting the country. He called it ""absurd, racist and wrong"" to blame immigrants for the nation's problems.""That is absolutely unacceptable,"" the senator added during the roundtable discussion at the Muscatine County Boxing Club. ""That kind of discourse should be removed from our politics.""In recent weeks, Trump has proposed the mass deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. as well as their American-born children. He called for amending the Constitution to end automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants living illegally in the U.S. He has denounced immigrants from Mexico and other Central American nations as ""really bad."" He also has vilified immigrants from Latin America in general as responsible for ""bringing drugs, bringing crime"" into the U.S. He also has branded them as ""rapists.""Watch the video: "

Bernie Sanders on Monday said organized labor fought overwhelming odds and ""changed society"" by securing a 40-hour work week, workplace safety standards and the minimum wage. During a keynote speech to the New Hampshire AFL-CIO, Sanders laid out a bold agenda to help working families today.""Working people and their unions fought for a more responsive democracy and built the middle class,"" Sanders said in prepared remarks. ""Today we can and we must follow their example. It's time to rebuild the crumbling middle class of our country and make certain that every working person in the United States of America has a chance at a decent life.""""At a time when almost all new income and wealth is going to the people on top while millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages,"" he said, ""the time is long overdue for us to create an economy which works for the middle class and working families of this country, and not just the 1 percent.""Today, the Democratic candidate for president said, workers in the United States must be guaranteed paid medical and family leave and paid sick time and vacation time. With real unemployment at more than 10 percent, Sanders proposed a $1 trillion program to rebuild America's crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects and create 13 million decent-paying jobs.With too many workers making ""starvation wages,"" Sanders said the $7.25 hourly federal minimum wage should be more than doubled to $15 an hour by 2020.When many businesses are making it harder for workers to form a union, Sanders said Congress should enact the Employee Free Choice Act to let workers who want to organize join a union. When millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost to low-wage countries overseas because of job-killing trade policies, Sanders said Congress must defeat a corporate-backed proposal for a new Pacific Rim trade deal.He also called for pay equity for women workers, tuition-free public colleges and universities funded with a tax on Wall Street speculators, a Medicare-for-all health care system and an expansion of Social Security.At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, Sanders also said our tax system must demand that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share.""The economic reality is that while our economy today is much stronger than when President George W. Bush left office seven years ago, the middle class is continuing its 40-year decline,"" Sanders said. Wages fell for 90 percent of Americans between 2009 and 2012 but rose for the top 10 percent.""In the wealthiest country in the history of the world we can accomplish all these goals, but we can't do it without a political revolution. We can't do it unless millions of Americans stand up and fight back to reclaim our country from the hands of a billionaire class whose greed is destroying our nation,"" Sanders said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 14, 2015",Press Release - Excerpts from Sen. Sanders' Remarks at Liberty University Convocation,"LYNCHBURG, Va.  Here are excerpts from prepared remarks by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders for an address on Monday at Liberty University:""I came here today because I believe that it is important for those with different views in our country to engage in civil discourse  not just to shout at each other or make fun of each other. It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us. I do that every day. It is harder, but not less important, to try to communicate with those who do not agree with us and see where, if possible, we can find common ground and, in other words, to reach out of our zone of comfort.""Liberty University is a religious school. It is a school which tries to understand the meaning of morality and the words of the Bible within the context of a very complicated modern world. It is a school which tries to teach its students how to behave with decency and honesty and how to best relate to their fellow human beings. I applaud those goals.""So let me take a few moments to tell you what motivates me in the work that I do as a public servant and as an elected official. I am far, far from a perfect human being but I am motivated by a vision which exists in all of the great religions  Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and others  and which is so beautifully and clearly stated in Matthew 7:12. 'So in everything, do to others what you would have them to do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets.' The Golden Rule. Do to others what you would have them do to you. Not very complicated.""Let me be very frank. I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to you and that we disagree on those issues. I get that. But let me respectfully suggest that there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and the world and that maybe, just maybe, we don't disagree on them. And maybe, just maybe, we can work together in trying to resolve them.""It would, I think, be hard for anyone in this room to make the case that the United States today is a just society or anything close to a just society. In America today, there is massive injustice in terms of income and wealth inequality. Injustice is rampant.""There is no justice when the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. There is no justice when all over this country people are working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.""There is no justice when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while, at the same time, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. Twenty percent of all children  and 40 percent of African-American children  now live in poverty.""There is no justice when, in a rigged economy, the 15 wealthiest people in this country in the last two years saw their wealth increase by $170 billion. That is more wealth, acquired in a two-year period, than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans.""There is no justice when low-income and working-class mothers are forced to be separated from their new babies one or two weeks after giving birth because they must go back to work to sustain their family and because the United States is the only major country on earth that does not provide paid family and medical leave.""There is no justice when thousands of people in this country die each year because they don't have health insurance and don't get to a doctor when they should."""

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 16, 2015","Press Release - 'Waiting, Waiting, Waiting,' Sanders Says as Republicans Don't Debate Real Issues","WASHINGTON  As Republican presidential candidates debated on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders took to Twitter at #DebateWithBernie to take on the White House hopefuls for ignoring critical issues.""Rich get richer. Median family income $5k less than in 1999. One of the highest rates of childhood poverty. Any discussion?"" he asked as the debate droned on. ""Have you heard anyone use the word poverty yet? 47.7 million Americans living in poverty. No discussion."" Still later he tweeted: ""Waiting, waiting, waiting. Will we hear anything about racial justice, income inequality or making college affordable?""Nearly two hours into the debate, the conversation briefly turned to an important issue: raising the $7.25 hourly minimum wage. ""The American people overwhelmingly want to raise the minimum wage. Too bad the Republicans don't,"" Sanders tweeted. He has introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.During a back-and-forth on foreign policy, Sanders asked, ""Gee. How come these guys are not talking about the great 'success' of Bush's foreign policy and the war in Iraq?"" A few minutes later he wondered, ""Can these guys talk about anything other than their desire to go to war?"" During a discussion about a proposed deal to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, Sanders wrote, ""War, war, war. When do we get to their other major priority: tax breaks for billionaires?""Missing from the exchanges was perhaps the greatest international crisis facing the planet. ""Will they talk about climate change as a foreign policy issue? Or talk about it at all?"" They finally did. It turned out that not one of them believes that the United States government should lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels.On domestic issues, Republicans wanted to take away health care for women and marriage rights from gays.The candidates were asked about a Kentucky county clerk defying a court order and refusing to issue marriage licenses to gays. ""Does anybody on the stage believe that our gay brothers and sisters have the same rights as the rest of us?"" Sanders wondered. ""Anybody?""The Republicans also called for defunding Planned Parenthood. ""Does anyone on that stage believe the women of this country have the right to control their own bodies? Anyone?"" Sanders asked.Some of Sanders' most popular tweets were about Republican front-runner Donald Trump. ""Trump: 'I will take care of women.' Really? What about respecting the right of women to control their own bodies?"" Sanders said. As the front-runner smirked and ridiculed his challengers, Sanders said of Trump: ""What a pleasant and humble person. Can't stop saying kind and generous things about his fellow Republicans.""Sanders gave up after more than two and a half hours. ""Thank you all. I've had it. I'm going home. Talk to you soon."" He ended the night with a Facebook post: ""The evening was really pretty sad. This country and our planet face enormous problems. And the Republican candidates barely touched upon them tonight. And when they did, they were dead wrong on virtually every position they took. The Republican Party cannot be allowed to lead this country. That's why we need a political revolution."""

The average donation was $23.""I hope that sends a very clear message that the American people are sick and tired of politics as usual and negative campaigning,"" Sanders said in the email thanking his supporters.""We've never seen an immediate donor response like what the Sanders campaign received on Tuesday.

""Over its 11-year history ActBlue has sent money to over eleven-thousand campaigns and committees  and the Bernie Sanders campaign holds the record for the two biggest donor days ever for a campaign on our platform.""The reaction was to the attempt by David Brock of the Clinton super PAC to link Sanders and Chavez. The ""connection"" was that Sanders and former Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) worked together to help provide Vermonters and other low-income New England residents with affordable home heating oil supplied by the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, CITGO.""Frankly what the Clinton Super PAC is doing is nothing new. It's the same-old, same-old negative politics that has gone on for years: throw mud and hope some of it sticks,"" Sanders wrote. ""We are fighting for a different kind of politics. Instead of hurling dishonest or out-of-context charges, we are trying to run an issue-oriented campaign  focusing on the most important concerns of the American people.""Sanders said he looks forward to debating the regulation of Wall Street, trade policies, health care, college costs, climate change, Social Security and other important issues.

Bernie Sanders cast his campaign as the one with the momentum and excitement to help Democrats retain the White House and regain seats in Congress and Statehouses.""We will not retain the White House ... unless we are the party which generates excitement and momentum and enthusiasm,"" he said in remarks to the delegates signed up to attend the state convention.Sanders is the front-runner in a string of recent polls in New Hampshire, where he consistently has drawn larger crowds to rallies and town-hall meetings than other candidates. The momentum behind his candidacy, Sanders said, could help Democrats reverse setbacks in the last election when ""Republicans didn't win. Democrats lost"" because ""we had a voter turnout that was worse than abysmal.""Barely more than four months into his White House campaign, Sanders has attracted a grassroots movement drawn to his call for a political revolution to stand up for the American middle class and take on the billionaire class.In his address, Sanders laid out a detailed agenda that has been the cornerstone of his campaign.He called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.He proposed a $1 trillion jobs bill to put 13 million Americans to work rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges.He made the case for a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system that would provide better care at less cost for more Americans.He said the United States must act boldly to lead the world in addressing climate change and to wean us off the fossil fuels that cause global warming.He advocated comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States.There were cheers when he talked about his plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free and to pay for it with a tax on Wall Street speculators.He also blasted the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that opened the floodgates to corporate and billionaire campaign cash that has corrupted American politics and led to the formation of super PACs. (Sanders has said he does not want billionaires' money and won't work with a super PAC.)""I am a proud progressive,"" Sanders said. ""I am proud to stand with the working families of our country prepared to take on the powerful special interests,"" he said.""We need a movement that takes on the political establishment, not one that is part of it.""Watch the full speech:"

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 20, 2015","Press Release - At N.H. Retirement Community, Sanders Takes on Rising Drug Prices","EXETER, N.H.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday visited the Riverwoods Retirement Community and highlighted rising prices for prescription drugs and increased poverty among seniors.""I can tell you that many seniors are struggling,"" Sanders told a meeting room filled with about 250 seniors. He cited a Census Bureau report which said 10 percent of seniors in the United States are living in poverty. That's up from 8.7 percent in 2011.Rapidly-rising prescription drug prices are among the factors driving up poverty among seniors, Sanders said.""Today, Americans pay, by far, the highest prices for prescription drugs anywhere in the world,"" he said.Spending on medicine in the United States has gone up by more than 90 percent since 2002. Last year alone, nearly 1 in 5 Americans could not afford to fill a prescription their doctor prescribed.The senator has introduced legislation to rein in skyrocketing prices.Sanders recently introduced legislation which would bring down drug costs by authorizing Medicare to use its purchasing power to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies to lower the prices of prescription drugs. Not only would this substantially reduce the prices seniors pay for drugs, it could save Medicare more than $500 billion over the next decade.Sanders' bill also would allow individuals, pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in Canada, where drug prices are 40 percent lower per person than in the U.S."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"September 25, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Spotlights Seniors in New Hampshire,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H.  Focusing on critical issues for seniors, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday blasted outrageous price spikes by drugmakers and pressed for Congress to pass his plan to strengthen and expand Social Security.In remarks prepared for a keynote speech at a Democratic Party dinner here, Sanders said Medicare must be allowed to negotiate with drug companies to bring down costs to consumers and taxpayers. He also said Americans who pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs should be allowed to purchase medicine from Canada and other countries.Sanders also called for strengthening and expanding Social Security and slammed Republican White House hopefuls who would dismantle the successful retirement and disability program.On prescription drugs, Sanders has introduced legislation to rein in prices that jumped more than 12 percent last year, the highest in a decade. ""Americans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren't willing to challenge the drug and health care lobby,"" Sanders said. He noted that the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $230 million on lobbying last year, $65 million more than any other industry, and employed more than 1,400 registered lobbyists.Legislation filed in the Senate by Sanders and by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) in the House would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The bills also would stiffen penalties for drug companies that commit fraud and lower barriers to the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.Sanders and Cummings also have questioned spiraling prices for generic drugs, including a 62-year-old drug Daraprim that recently shot up in price from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet before public outcry forced the drugmaker to back down.On Social Security, Sanders said the successful program has a $2.8 trillion surplus and will be able to pay all benefits promised to every eligible recipient until 2033.In New Hampshire, Social Security lifted 90,000 people out of poverty in 2013. The average Social Security benefit was $14,987 in 2014. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire, including more than 45 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is just 5.1 percent.Sanders said the most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share of their income as everyone else. Instead of capping income subject to the payroll tax at $118,500, as current law does, Sanders would make those earning $250,000 and up, the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, pay the same share into Social Security.Republican presidential candidates have their own plans for Social Security. They would cut benefits. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham all have suggested raising the retirement age and cut benefits. Proposals to privatize the system have been advanced by many of those candidates and by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.To read what Republican candidates say about Social Security, click here.To read more about Sen.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"October 6, 2015",Press Release - Wall Street CEOs Not 'Too Big to Jail',"WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday agreed with Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that corporate executives should have gone to jail for the illegal behavior which caused the financial crisis in 2008.""Everything that went wrong or was illegal was done by some individual, not by an abstract firm,"" the former Fed chief told USA Today. ""[T]here should have been more accountability at the individual level.""Sanders agreed.""It is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy. The failure to prosecute the crooks on Wall Street for their illegal and reckless behavior is a clear indictment of our broken criminal justice system,"" Sanders said.""It is an obscenity that people in this country are getting arrested at near record rates for smoking marijuana, but not one Wall Street CEO has been prosecuted for triggering the Great Recession in 2008.""Millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, life savings and ability to send their kids to college because of the greed on Wall Street. We can no longer tolerate a criminal justice system that treats Wall Street executives as too big to jail when their actions have ruined the lives of so many Americans.""I wish Ben Bernanke would have understood that when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve.""To read about Bernanke's comments, click here and here."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"October 8, 2015","Press Release - Sanders: Breaking Up Big Banks, Restoring Glass-Steagall are Key Wall Street Reforms","WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has a long history of standing up to Wall Street, on Thursday pressed for critical reforms that he said must include breaking up of too-big-to-fail banks and restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law which separated commercial and investment banking.""Given the image of big banks today, it is easy now to take on Wall Street. I was there when it was not so popular,"" Sanders said. Sanders this year introduced legislation to break up too-big-to-fail financial institutions. He also is a co-sponsor of legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to reinstate Glass-Steagall. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Sanders fought the push to deregulate Wall Street by then-Treasury Secretaries Lawrence Summers and Robert Rubin and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. In 1999, Sanders was one of only 57 Members of the House of Representatives who voted against the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed Glass-Steagall.""I was proud to lead the fight in the House against repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. I predicted then that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would seriously harm the economy. I would give anything to have been proven wrong about this, but unfortunately what happened to the economy during the financial collapse of 2008 was even worse than I predicted,"" Sanders said.During the House floor debate, Sanders warned that the measure ""will lead to fewer banks and financial service providers; increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses; diminished credit for rural America; and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. It will lead to more mega-mergers; a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry; and further concentration of economic power in our country.""In the Senate, Sanders in 2009 voted against the bailout of the biggest Wall Street financial institutions whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior had plunged the nation's economy into a terrible recession. The nation's largest financial institutions put taxpayers on the hook for a $700 billion bailout and more than $16 trillion in virtually zero interest loans from the Federal Reserve. Today, three of the four largest financial institutions are bigger today than before they were bailed out.The six largest financial institutions in this country today (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) have assets of nearly $10 trillion, a figure equal to about 60 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Those six financial institutions issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards, over 35 percent of all mortgages, control 95 percent of all derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits in the United States."

He called for strengthening instant background checks and closing a legal loophole that allows unchecked weapons sales at gun shows.Earlier Friday, Sanders said he is ""willing to see change"" in a law limiting liability for firearms manufacturers. ""Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes,"" Sanders said in a taped interview with Chuck Todd, host of the NBC News program ""Meet the Press.""Before the senator and congressman addressed the rally, the crowd grew quiet as 10-year-old Bob de la Rosa told a heart-wrenching story about his separation from his mother in Mexico.

Twitter agreed. Both said online interest peaked when Sanders said relentless news media focus on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails were a distraction from more important issues. ""What the Secretary said is right. And that is the American people are tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" Sanders said. Instead, he added, this campaign should be about the grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality in our country, the unprecedented planetary emergency of our changing climate, and our need to invest in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration.Online, BernieSanders.com broke our own record for the website's biggest day ever.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"October 18, 2015",Press Release - Sanders: Boost Social Security Benefits,"IOWA CITY, Iowa  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said it is unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of Iowa retirees, orphans and people with disabilities won't get a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year.Unless Congress acts, he added, last Thursday's announcement by the Social Security Administration that it would freeze retirement benefits also means no increase during 2016 for disabled veterans.""That is unacceptable,"" Sanders said. The way cost-of-living adjustments are calculated ""is clearly broken and must be fixed,"" he added.Sanders' Social Security Expansion Act would make sure annual inflation adjustments are based on a formula that accurately measures the spending patterns of seniors. Sanders' legislation would also increase Social Security benefits and scrap a cap on income subject to the payroll tax. Now, someone making millions of dollars a year pays no more than someone making $118,500 a year. Levying the same tax rate on annual income greater than $250,000 would only impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners while boosting benefits for millions of retirees.Sanders highlighted how Social Security helps Iowans.""While Social Security is taken for granted today, let us remember that before it was signed into law nearly half of senior citizens in Iowa were living in poverty. Today, while much too high, the senior poverty rate in Iowa is 6.4 percent,"" Sanders said.More than 616,000 people in Iowa  nearly 20 percent of the population  received $9 billion in Social Security benefits last year. The benefits went to more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children. Social Security last year lifted more than 228,000 Iowans out of poverty.""At a time when the average Social Security benefit is just $1,328 a month and more than two-thirds of the elderly population rely on Social Security for more than half of their income, our job must be to expand, not cut, Social Security,"" Sanders said.He said Republican White House hopefuls like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have proposed raising the retirement age to 69 or 70 and slashing Social Security benefits.""I have a hard time understanding what world these Republicans and their billionaire campaign contributors live in,"" Sanders said. He cited reports that more than half of workers between the ages of 55 and 64 have no retirement savings at all. And only 1 in 5 Americans has a traditional pension."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"October 19, 2015",Press Release - Sanders in Iowa Focuses on College Affordability,"OSKALOOSA, Iowa  Meeting with students at William Penn University, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday laid out his plan to address college costs and bring down student loan interest rates.Sanders discussed his college affordability plan after fielding a question from a student who said she had to take out a $20,000 loan at an 8 percent interest rate.The senator from Vermont and candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination has proposed legislation to cover tuition costs for qualified students at public colleges and universities. He also wants to substantially lower interest rates on student loans.Iowa was a national leader in providing a universal high school education for all students in the first half of the 20th century when public secondary schools saw a rapid increase in enrollment. That movement made a high school diploma the ticket to a solid, middle-class job.""In the year 2015, now is the time to extend that idea to colleges and universities,"" Sanders said. ""That is why I am fighting for free tuition at public colleges and universities. The world has changed. We are living in a highly competitive global economy and for us to succeed we need the best educated workforce in the world.""Sanders' legislation would also overhaul student loan programs so students and their parents could reduce crushing debt loads. Federal profits on loans would be eliminated, work-study programs expanded and incentives offered for colleges and universities to keep costs down.The federal portion of Sanders' proposal would be offset by imposing a tax on Wall Street transactions by investment houses, hedge funds and other speculators.More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on Wall Street speculation and today some 40 countries throughout the world  including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and China  have imposed a similar tax.To read more about Sanders college affordability plan, click here."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"October 28, 2015",Press Release - Sanders: Let States Make Marijuana Legal,"FAIRFAX, Va.,  Citing a recent FBI report that someone in the United States is arrested every minute on marijuana charges, Sen. Bernie Sanders told a nationwide meeting of college students on Wednesday that he would take marijuana off the federal government's list of outlawed drugs.Speaking from George Mason University to 250 online student meetings in all 50 states, Sanders said he favors removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances regulated by federal law.""In the United States we have 2.2 million people in jail today, more than any other country. And we're spending about $80 billion a year to lock people up. We need major changes in our criminal justice system  including changes in drug laws,"" Sanders said.""Too many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That's wrong. That has got to change,"" he added. Under the senator's proposal, people in states which legalize marijuana no longer would be subject to federal prosecution for using pot. Owners of stores that sell marijuana could fully participate in the banking system, like any other business.States which want to regulate marijuana would remain free to do so the same way local laws now govern sales of alcohol and tobacco. Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, would continue to allow federal law enforcement officials to arrest and prosecute drug dealers for trafficking in marijuana sales.Highlighting the proposal as part of a criminal justice reform agenda, Sanders noted that there were 620,000 marijuana possession arrests in 2014. That's one a minute, according to The Washington Post.Sanders pointed to marijuana arrests as another example of the disparate treatment of African-Americans by the criminal justice system. Although about the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, the American Civil Liberties Union found. According to the ACLU report, there were more than 8 million marijuana arrests in the United States from 2001 to 2010, and almost 9 in 10 were for possession. State governments spent $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws in 2010, the most recent year in the study.Arrests for marijuana possession rose nationwide last year even as Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the use of marijuana, followed by Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia. The legalization movement may spread next year when marijuana decriminalization advocates plan to put the question to voters on ballots in Nevada, Arizona and California.A 2012 estimate calculated that about 20,000-30,000 people are in prison on marijuana possession alone."

Bernie Sanders called for strengthening Social Security, raising retirement benefits and bringing down skyrocketing prescription drug prices.Sanders told the gathering at the William B. Cashin Senior Activity Center that the most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share of their income as everyone else. Instead of capping income subject to the payroll tax at $118,500, as current law does, Sanders would make those earning $250,000 and up, the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, pay the same share into Social Security.In New Hampshire, more than 42,000 seniors, orphans and disabled people rely on Social Security benefits, which last year averaged $14,987. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire, including more than 45 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is 5.7 percent.Sanders has proposed legislation which would increase benefits by an average of $65 a month and lift low-income seniors out of poverty by expanding the minimum benefit. It also would base annual inflation adjustments on a formula that accurately measures the real-life spending patterns of seniors who pay a disproportionate amount of their income on health care and prescription drugs. To pay for the increased benefits, he would gradually scrap the cap on income subject to the payroll tax.While he would strengthen the retirement program for future generations, Sanders stressed that Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus, enough to pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 19 years.Sanders visited the senior center two days after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks at St. Anselm's College, reportedly declined to back an across-the-board benefit boost, left open the possibility of raising the retirement age and stopped short of saying the wealthiest wage earners should pay the same percent of their income as everyone else."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"November 6, 2015","Press Release - Sanders: We Must Increase Voter Turnout, Not Suppress It","ROCK HILL, S.C.  Calling Republicans political cowards for passing laws to drive down voter turnout, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday said that he would back measures to guarantee the right to vote for every eligible American.In a country where Election Day turnout has shrunk to record lows, Sanders said that he would look at every option, including a constitutional amendment, which would guarantee the right to vote to all Americans over the age of 18.""We have got to end this outrageous voter suppression which is taking place in dozens of states  efforts that are intentionally denying low-income people, people of color and seniors the ability to participate in the political process,"" he added. ""As president, my job will be to increase voter turnout, not decrease it. My job will be to see that the United States has one of the highest voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest.""Sanders' push for greater voter participation comes at a time when Republican-controlled state legislatures in many states have passed laws making it harder to vote by erecting roadblocks to registration like requiring a photo ID or making it harder for students to vote.""Anybody who is suppressing the vote, who is intentionally trying to keep people from voting is a political coward,"" Sanders said.In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley signed legislation in 2011 that requires voters to show a photo ID in order to vote.When the governor signed the law, some 178,000 South Carolina voters lacked driver's licenses or other photo identification issued by the state Department of Motor Vehicles. An Associated Press analysis found the law especially impacted African-American voters. Former NAACP President Ben Jealous called the law ""little more than a 21st Century poll tax.""The U.S. Justice Department tried to block the law that South Carolina nevertheless was allowed to enforce after a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court gutted the federal Voting Rights Act.Sanders, who has drawn large and enthusiastic crowds at rallies across the country, said increasing turnout is the key to Democratic chances of success. ""In my view, Democrats will not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate, will not gain the House and will not be successful in dozens of governor's races unless we run a campaign which generates excitement and momentum and which produces a large voter turnout. Democrats win when the turnout is high. Republicans win when the turnout is low.""Watch Sanders speak about voter suppression at the 2015 Southern Regional Meeting of the National Federation of Democratic Women at Winthrop University:"

Bernie Sanders on Saturday renewed a call to let states decide whether to legalize marijuana possession, a proposal detailed in a bill introduced Wednesday in the Senate. Sanders commented after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at a separate appearance in South Carolina on Saturday, offered her own proposal to loosen restrictions on marijuana.""I am glad to see Secretary Clinton is beginning to address an issue that my legislation addressed,"" he said, ""but her approach ignored the major issue. Secretary Clinton would classify marijuana in the same category as cocaine and continue to make marijuana a federally regulated substance.""If we are serious about criminal justice reform and preventing many thousands of lives from being impacted because of criminal convictions for marijuana possession, we must remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act and allow states the right to go forward, if they choose, to legalize marijuana without federal legal impediments,"" Sanders added.Sanders was here at the University of South Carolina at Aiken for a rally to cap a two-day swing through South Carolina.

He has proposed the boldest legislation to combat climate change. Sen. Barbara Boxer, the former environment committee chairman, called their bill on climate change 'the gold standard.' He was a leader in the fight to block the Keystone pipeline. He has passed legislation to promote energy efficiency and he has championed proposals to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable and renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels,"" said Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman.""That's why he was endorsed by Friends of the Earth. That's why Bill McKibben called him 'the most aggressive voice in the Senate' on climate issues. That's why he has a 95 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters. The league agreed with former Sen. Clinton only 82 percent of the time, so its endorsement is based on something other than the merits,"" Briggs added."

His plan essentially would put in place provisions that were approved in 2013 by a 68-32 bipartisan majority in the Senate but were blocked by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives""As president, passing a legislative solution to our broken immigration system will be a top priority,"" Sanders said. ""But, let me be clear: I will not wait around for Congress to act. Instead, beginning in the first 100 days of my administration, I will work to take extensive executive action to accomplish what Congress has failed to do and to build upon President Obama's executive orders.""Important components of his broader plan include:Going beyond President Barack Obama's executive actions and provide broad administrative relief to the parents of DREAMers, the parents of citizens, the parents of legal permanent residents, other family members and other immigrants who would have been given legal protections by the Senate-passed bill.Dismantling inhumane deportation programs and private detention centers.Offering humane treatment and asylum to victims of domestic violence and minors fleeing from dangerous circumstances in Latin America.Ending policies that discriminate against women and ensure that mothers and wives who come into the United States with their families have the same right to work as their husbands.Those key elements are part of a broader set of immigration policies that Sanders plans to spell out in greater detail in the coming days. Altogether, Sanders' plan would provide legal protections to more than 7 million undocumented individuals living in the United States.Sanders' speech to the immigration activists at a downtown hotel came the morning after he drew 3,400 supporters to a nighttime rally at a soccer field in North Las Vegas.

They also represent fish cannery workers in Alaska, warehouse workers in Portland, and U.S. Navy maritime support specialists in Hawaii.Sanders spoke to the IBU during its national convention of delegates on Nov. 6th in Seattle. ""Senator Sanders hit all our questions out of the park, resulting in a unanimous endorsement,"" President Alan Cote said. ""In particular, we appreciate his very supportive stance on the Jones Act and his strong opposition to 'right to work' legislation.""When President Cote asked if there was a motion for nomination on deck, the entire delegation jumped to their feet and screamed ""so moved!"" The motion was followed by a thunderous second and an even louder shout of approval for the motion to endorse Sanders for president. ""We have no doubt about 'which side he's on' to paraphrase the late great Florence Reece,"" Secetary-Treasurer Terri Mast said. ""Our members trust him and believe in his candidacy."""

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"November 18, 2015",Press Release - 'Very Encouraging' News for Sanders in Polls,"WASHINGTON  Recent polls for major news organizations contained ""very encouraging news"" for Sen. Bernie Sanders and warning signs on Hillary Clinton's general election prospects should she win the nomination, according to a memorandum by polling and strategic consulting expert Ben Tulchin. Significantly, Sanders fares better than Clinton in many head-to-head matchups with leading Republicans.The independent surveys show the senator from Vermont continues to close the gap with the former secretary of state while voters' familiarity with Sanders and his favorability ratings are steadily rising, Sanders' pollster said. Moreover, Sanders' agenda has dominated the debate. His message about a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system ""is driving the issue agenda within the Democratic primary,"" Tulchin wrote.Looking ahead to next year's general election, Sanders is much more popular than Clinton with independents and he is much better positioned with Republicans, factors Tulchin said raise ""real questions as to which of these leading Democratic candidates is in fact the best positioned for the general election.""In several recent surveys Sanders outperformed Clinton in matchups with Republicans. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Nov. 3, Sanders outpolled Donald Trump by nine points, 50 percent to 41 percent, and the Vermont senator beat Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida by five points, 46 percent to 41 percent. In a McClatchy/Marist poll released Nov. 13, Sanders outpolled Donald Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina. Sanders outperformed Clinton against Cruz and Bush. In a new poll in Colorado, Sanders fared better than Clinton when pitted against four leading Republican White House hopefuls. Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll, said Clinton ""would get bruised and beaten by all the top GOP opponents, and absolutely crushed"" by Rubio or Carson.With the first primaries and caucuses less than three months away, the survey findings warn that Clinton ""has real vulnerabilities within the Democratic primary electorate,"" particularly for ""being too close to special interests and Wall Street.""The analysis of recent polls for CBS News, NBC News, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal underscored the fact that Sanders has closed the gap with Clinton since he declared his candidacy on April 30. Half a year ago, Sanders barely registered in polls and pundits dismissed his chances. Today, Sanders ""has made tremendous progress and is now the leading Democratic challenger to Hillary Clinton and within striking distance of her,"" according to the memo.Nationally, Sanders trailed by 30 points in a New York Times/CBS News poll in September (58 percent to 28 percent) but trailed by only 19 points (52 percent to 33 percent) in the latest survey. In fact, Sanders gained a net 5 points on Hillary over the past month, a period one published report declared ""the best month ever"" for Clinton.In Iowa and New Hampshire, the states with the first caucuses and primary elections next February, the survey show that the more people know about Sanders the better they like him. ""The bottom line is that as Democratic primary voters in key early voting states become more familiar with Sanders, they very much like what they hear and are much more likely to vote for him, thereby putting Sanders on a trajectory to make the Democratic primary horserace even more competitive as he campaigns aggressively and begins to advertise to get his message out more broadly.,"" the pollster wrote.To put the numbers in historical context, then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2007 trailed Clinton by 27 points at the same stage of that campaign. A Gallup Poll released on Nov. 16, 2007, put her ahead with 48 percent of the vote to Obama's 21 percent."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"November 20, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Lays out Agenda for Working Families,"CHARLESTON, S.C.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday night outlined a bold plan to create millions of jobs, raise wages, provide health care for all Americans, lower skyrocketing prescription drug prices, make college affordable, guarantee paid family leave, ensure pay equity for women and strengthen Social Security.""We have an economy that is rigged. You have people working two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income to raise their families. While our people work longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of new income goes to the top 1 percent,"" Sanders said at a town meeting here tonight at Burke High School.""What we are looking at is a rigged economy,"" he added.""Wages in America are just too low. Our job is to create an economy that works for working families, not just a handful of billionaires. My plan would make Wall Street banks, profitable corporations, millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. My plan would provide living wages for working people and ensure equal pay for women,"" he said.Under Sanders' plan:At least thirteen million decent-paying jobs would be created or sustained by investing in a $1 trillion, five-year program to rebuild roads, bridges, railways, water systems and other infrastructure projects. This program would be paid for by closing loopholes allowing corporations to stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens to avoid paying taxes.Public colleges and universities would be tuition free. That would save middle-class families an average of $9,400 a year. The program would be funded with a tax on Wall Street speculation.A Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care plan would save the typical family more than $5,000 a year by eliminating profit-making private insurance companies that charge steep premiums for policies with big deductibles and co-payments.The minimum wage would be raised from $7.25 an hour today to a living wage of $15 an hour by 2020. That would directly increase the wages of more than 42 percent of American workers, including about half of African Americans and nearly 60 percent of Hispanics.Provide pay equity for women workers who now make 79-cents for every dollar male workers are paid.Allow mothers and fathers to receive paid family leave to care of a baby. Sanders has called for three months of paid leave if an employee has a child. He would also allow workers to take the same amount of paid time off if they are diagnosed with cancer or have other serious medical conditions or to take care of family members who are seriously ill. He's one of 19 Senate cosponsors of the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.Social Security would be strengthened and benefits boosted for millions of retirees, widows, widowers, orphans and the disabled. This would be paid for by applying the Social Security payroll tax on all income above $250,000.Prescription drug prices, now the highest in the world, would be lowered by allowing Americans to import brand-name medicines from Canada and other countries and letting Medicare negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for better prices.Too-big-to-fail banks would be broken up and Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law, would be restored.Sanders spoke to some 670 people in the high school auditorium on the first day of a three-day weekend swing through South Carolina, home to the first-in-the-South presidential primary next Feb. 27."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"November 21, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Calls Criminal Justice Reform the 'Civil Rights Issue of the Century',"COLUMBIA, S.C.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called criminal justice reform the ""civil rights issue of the 21st century"" and detailed a series of reforms needed in a nation where more inmates are behind bars than any other country and a disproportionate number of prisoners are minorities.""For too long in this country politicians have used getting tough on crime as a wedge issue to win elections. It is clearly about time to start talking  as we have in this election  about the really disastrous effects of too many politicians trying to win too many elections by locking too many people up,"" Sanders told a forum on criminal justice reform at Allen University.""And we should lay it all right out on the table."" Sanders added. ""People in American jails are disproportionately people of color. That's the reality in America today. That's a reality that has to change.""Among what he called ""shocking statistics,"" Sanders said one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime; that blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and that minorities are sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than whites. He also noted that the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop, compared to white motorists.Sanders also spoke about what he called an ""endless stream of tragedies"" that he said ""screams out for justice"" involving blacks killed by police during arrests or while in custody.""The Black Lives Matter movement which has arisen in response to these deaths has done a needed and commendable job in raising public awareness of this issue. The proliferation of cell phone video has brought the reality of these deaths into the living room and onto the computer screens of people across this country. I know you have heard these names before but they bear repeating so we do not lose sight of the real human price being paid: Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Samuel Dubose, Rekia Boyd and too many more. But people must do more than just echo the phrase Black Lives Matter. We must put actions behind those words. Actions that will bring about the fundamental reform that is needed in the face of this crisis,"" Sanders said.Declaring that ""the killings of African-Americans has got to stop,"" Sanders put police reform at the top of a list of proposals to remake the criminal justice system in the United States. ""Too many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals,"" Sanders said.Sanders' proposals include:Eliminating for-profit prisons within two years.Ending mandatory minimum sentencing and giving judges the discretion to better tailor sentences to the specific facts of a given case.Removing marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and letting states decide whether possession should be a crime.Establishing a new federal police training program that trains police to de-escalate confrontations and to humanely interact with people with mental illnesses.Making police forces reflect the diversity of our communities.Requiring greater civilian oversight of police departments and ongoing and meaningful community engagement.Making law enforcement officers wear body cameras to help hold them accountable while protecting the privacy of innocent people.Providing federal funding to help state and local governments adopt new policing standards. State and local governments who participate in police reform should be rewarded by the federal government. Those who do not should have federal justice funding withheld.To read more details of Sanders' criminal justice reform proposals, click here."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"November 22, 2015","Press Release - In South Carolina, Sanders Makes Case for Family Leave, Social Security","ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C.  Speaking to 600 people packed inside the Penn Center's Darrah Hall, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called for paid family leave for new parents and expanded benefits for seniors who rely on Social Security.Sanders is one of 19 Senate co-sponsors of the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Rep. Rosa DeLauro is the chief sponsor of a companion bill with 112 co-sponsors in the House.Under both measures, workers would be entitled to three months of paid leave to care for a newborn child. The legislation also calls for a small payroll tax totaling $1.38 a week for a typical worker.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton does not support Gillibrand's bill, aides have said. Sanders urged all presidential candidates to join him in supporting the legislation.The senator from Vermont also called on other White House hopefuls to join him in supporting a boost in benefits for retirees and the disabled.With Social Security recipients facing a coming year with no cost-of-living adjustment for inflation, Sanders' Social Security Expansion Act would make sure annual inflation adjustments are based on a formula thatbetter measures seniors' spending. Increasing medical costs and rising prices prescription drugs disproportionately impact seniors, Sanders told the audience here in South Carolina.Legislation he introduced in the Senate also would increase Social Security benefits and scrap a cap on income subject to the payroll tax. Now, someone making millions of dollars a year pays no more than someone making $118,500 a year. Levying the same tax rate on annual income greater than $250,000 would only impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners while boosting benefits for millions of retirees.""I would hope that every Democratic candidate for president of the United States is prepared to lift the cap and expand benefits for millions of seniors in this country who desperately need to see those benefits expanded,"" Sanders said.According to published reports, Clinton has not categorically ruled out benefit cuts including an increase in the retirement age.Sen. Sanders' plan to expand and extend Social Security would boost the income of a typical senior making less than $16,000 a year by about $1,300 a year. It would also make sure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 50 years."

The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and boost benefits for low-income beneficiaries.""Senior citizens with an income of less than $16,000 would see their benefits go up by more than $1,300 a year. Very low-income seniors who put in a lifetime of work would see their benefits go up even more,"" Sanders said.On prescription drugs, Sanders has introduced legislation to rein in prices that jumped more than 12 percent last year, the highest in a decade. ""Americans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren't willing to challenge the drug and health care lobby,"" Sanders said.He noted that the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $230 million on lobbying last year and employed more than 1,400 registered lobbyists.Legislation by Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Their bills also would stiffen penalties for drug companies that commit fraud and lower barriers to the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.Sanders has fought Republican efforts to end Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher program. ""Instead of cutting Medicare, instead of privatizing Medicare, instead of limiting the number of Americans who qualify for Medicare, we must join every other major nation on earth in recognizing that health care is a right, not a privilege and that right should be guaranteed to all, regardless of gender, income, age, or race,"" said Sanders, the Democrats' leader on the Senate Budget Committee."

""DFA's tireless focus on bringing people together through grassroots organizing is the best way we can fight back against the billionaires and oligarchs who have rigged our economy. I also want to congratulate DFA for its principled support for grassroots democracy and for its internal democratic process. It is no secret that the founder of DFA my friend and fellow Vermonter former Gov. Howard Dean has chosen not to support my candidacy. Yet the leadership of DFA allowed a fair and free vote to take place which we won.

Bernie Sanders' supporters have made presidential campaign history by donating more than 2 million times to his campaign for the Democratic Party nomination.""Over 2 million contributions have been made to the only campaign that rejects a corrupt campaign finance system,"" Sanders says in a television and Internet advertisement entitled People Power. ""You can't level the playing field with Wall Street banks and billionaires by taking their money,"" Sanders adds in the new message.In a statement, Sanders thanked his supporters. ""What our vision of a political revolution has already accomplished is to show that we can run a strong and we believe winning campaign without a super PAC, without contributions from millionaires and billionaires,"" Sanders said. ""We are enormously proud that we have received more individual contributions at this point in the campaign than any candidate who is not an incumbent president. As the campaign continues to succeed, we expect those numbers to grow exponentially.""More than $3 million was raised since an online push was launched on Monday to top 2 million donations. Of that total, about $1.6 million has been raised since Wednesday alone.The average donation to Sanders this week has been about $20 as many of the more than 800,000 donors were showing their financial support for a second or third time. Just 261 Sanders backers have given the maximum allowable contribution of $2,700, accounting for a mere 1.7 percent of his campaign's total reported money raised. That's a sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton's 17,575 maxed-out donors, whose donations accounted for almost 62 percent of her money raised, according to Federal Election Commission records for the first three quarters of this year.No other candidate who is not a sitting president ever received 2 million donations by this point in a White House campaign. Then Sen. Barack Obama had surpassed 1 million donations to his first campaign for president by the time of the 2008 Iowa caucuses. In his run for a second term, reports indicated Obama receiving around 2.2 million contributions by the end of 2011, a figure Sanders still could surpass.Watch the new ad below."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"December 18, 2015","Press Release - Statement by Jeff Weaver, Bernie Sanders 2016 Campaign Manager","Two months ago, shortly after our digital vendor who conducts modeling for our campaign told us that there was failure in the firewall that prevents campaigns from seeing one another's data, we contacted the DNC and told them about the failure. We were concerned that our data could be compromised and we were assured at the time the firewall would be restored.Instead, we found out two days ago that once again, this sensitive and important data was compromised because the DNC and its vendor failed to protect it.We have invested enormous campaign resources in acquiring the rights to use this proprietary information. But the DNC, in an inappropriate overreaction, has denied us access to our own data.Let me briefly discuss the three issues involved here.First, this is not the first time that the vendor hired by the DNC to run the voter file program, NGP VAN, has allowed serious failures to occur. On more than one occasion, they have dropped the firewall between the data of competing Democratic campaigns. That is dangerous incompetence. It was our campaign months ago that alerted the DNC to the fact that campaign data was being made available to other campaigns. At that time our campaign did not run to the media, relying instead on assurances from the vendor that the problem would be resolved. Unfortunately, the other day, the vendor once again dropped the firewall between the campaigns for some data.Secondly, after discussion with the DNC it became clear that some of our staffers irresponsibly accessed some of the data from another campaign. That behavior is unacceptable to the Sanders campaign and we fired the staffer immediately and made certain that any information obtained was not utilized. We are now speaking to other staffers who might have been involved and further disciplinary action may be taken. Clearly, while that information was made available to our campaign because of the incompetence of the vendor, it should not have been looked at. Period.Thirdly, rather incredibly, the leadership of the DNC has used this incident to shut down our ability to access our own information, information which is the lifeblood of any campaign. This is the information about our supporters, our volunteers, the lists of people we intend to contact in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere. This is information that we have worked hard to obtain. It is our information, not the DNCs.In other words, by their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign. This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign  one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.We are announcing today that if the DNC continues to hold our data hostage, and continues to try to attack the heart and soul of our campaign, we will be in federal court this afternoon seeking an immediate injunction.What is required here is a full and independent audit of the DNC's handling of this data and its security from the beginning of this campaign to the present, including the incident in October that we alerted them to."

It argued that without the database, the campaign would lose some $600,000 a day in donations.The campaign's access to the database should be restored by Saturday morning in time for the campaign staff and volunteers to contact voters over the weekend.""We are extremely pleased that the DNC has reversed its outrageous decision to take Sen. Sanders' data. The information we provided tonight is essentially the same information we already sent them by email on Thursday,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.""Clearly, they were very concerned about their prospects in court. Now what we need to restore confidence in the DNC's ability to secure data is an independent audit that encompasses the DNC's record this entire campaign. Transparency at the DNC is essential. We trust they have nothing to hide,"" Weaver added.The DNC decision to let Sanders use his own database came after the national party was barraged with outraged messages from grassroots supporters of Sanders. There were more than 214,800 people who signed an online petition to the DNC circulated by Sanders' campaign. MoveOn.org collected another 250,000 petition signatures and Democracy for America collected 100,000.Earlier on Friday, Democracy for America issued a statement from Executive Director Charles Chamberlain saying, ""The Democratic National Committee's decision to attack the campaign that figured out the problem, rather than go after the vendor that made the mistake, is profoundly damaging to the party's Democratic process.

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday called for an independent investigation of the Democratic National Committee and challenged Hillary Clinton to join him in seeking a probe of DNC data security failures.Speaking at the Democratic Party's third presidential debate this year, Sanders also apologized to Clinton for the improper actions of his campaign aides who took advantage of the flaw in the DNC vendor's computer database.""Not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton and I hope that we can work together on an independent investigation from Day One. I want to apologize to my supporters, this is not the type of campaign that we run and if I find anybody else involved in this they will also be fired,"" Sanders said.He addressed questions about the DNC voter database at the outset of the debate one day after the party reinstated his campaign's access to the critically-important voter database. The DNC backed down after Sanders' campaign sued in U.S. District Court in Washington.On at least two occasions, Sanders said, sensitive data was exposed because of flaws in DNC vendors' software programs.In one instance, about two months ago, Sanders campaign staffers discovered a vulnerability in the DNC software program and quietly reported the problem to the DNC. On that occasion, Sanders said, ""our staff at that point did exactly the right thing"" and reported the flaw to the party. The DNC once again ""screwed up"" in a second instance last Wednesday. On that occasion, however, Sanders' campaign aides ""did the wrong thing"" and looked at Clinton campaign records. The data director for the campaign was fired and the campaign is investigating whether others acted improperly.In the second instance, the data breach was leaked to the press and the DNC arbitrarily decided to shut off the Sanders campaign's access to its own information, ""crippling our campaign,"" Sanders said.Because of the pattern of serious mistakes by the DNC, Sanders called for ""an independent investigation of all of the breaches that have occurred from Day One in our campaign.""Sanders said he hopes the investigation will determine whether his campaign data has been breached by Clinton campaign aides. ""I am not convinced that our information may not have ended up in her campaign, don't know that, but we need an independent investigation and I hope that Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that last point."""

""Probably not,"" a Sanders' spokesman said, ""but what is certain is that they will have more total money because they have established super PACs.""Sanders has rejected super PACs, which may accept unlimited sums and are the key part of a corrupt political system that props up a rigged economy.

All told, more than 31,000 people have filled school gyms, convention centers, churches and other venues for rallies and town meetings. ""So keep it a secret. Don't tell anyone, but I think we're going to win here and make history,"" Sanders said.Earlier Tuesday at a town meeting in Storm Lake, Iowa, Sanders brought up an exchange during last weekend's Democratic debate when David Muir of ABC News asked the former secretary of state, ""Should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?"" Quipped Clinton, ""Everybody should."" In Iowa on Monday, Sanders was blunt. ""I do not want to be liked by everybody.

He was 14 points ahead in New Hampshire.This Iowa swing came in the wake of major developments in the Sanders campaign. Last Thursday he won the endorsement of the 700,000-member-strong Communications Workers of America. The same day he won the backing of the progressive grassroots group Democracy for America.

""My father came to this country at the age of 17 with no money and he could speak no English,"" he added.The U.S. Senate two years ago passed immigration reform legislation with Sanders support but the House refused to take it up. As president, Sanders said he would work with lawmakers on Capitol Hill but added, ""If Congress does not act, we will use the executive authority of the president to stop the dividing up of families.""In November, Sanders introduced his bold ""Families First"" immigration plan. Through legislation and executive action, Sanders would implement an immigration policy that provides a pathway to citizenship and is grounded in civil, humane and economic rights.Sanders also alluded to remarks by Donald Trump. ""In this country, people can disagree but what we will not accept in 2015 is appeals to racism. We will not accept candidates like Donald Trump referring to the Mexican people as criminals and rapists. We're going to shut that door on racism. We are not going to let Trump or anyone else open that door."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"December 23, 2015",Press Release - Sanders Discusses Criminal Justice Reform in Chicago,"CHICAGO  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders discussed criminal justice reform during a round-table meeting Monday at the Village Leadership Academy on the city's near West Side. Illinois State Rep. La Shawn K. Ford of Chicago led the discussion. At a news conference afterward, Sanders recalled his participation in civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s when he was a student at the University of Chicago. ""Institutional racism existed then. Institutional racism exists today. The criminal justice system was broken then. The criminal justice system is broken today,"" he said. ""I consider reforming our criminal justice system one of the most important things that a president of the United States can do.""Sanders called it an international embarrassment that the United States has more prisoners than any other country and a disproportionate number of those behind bars are minorities. And reciting shocking statistics, Sanders said one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. He said blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and that minorities are sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than whites, which is one reason why he would end capital punishment. He also noted that the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop compared to white motorists. ""That is unacceptable,"" Sanders said.Sanders also mentioned the prison death of Sandra Bland who died last July in a Texas jail cell after her arrest and jailing for a routine traffic violation. Bland, 28, had lived in Naperville, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. A grand jury on Monday declined to press charges against personnel in the sheriff's office jail where she was found dead.Sanders' criminal justice reform proposals include eliminating for-profit prisons; ending mandatory minimum sentencing and giving judges the discretion to better tailor sentences to the specific facts of a given case. He also would remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and let states decide whether possession should be a crime.He also called for ensuring that police forces reflect the diversity of our communities. The senator would require greater civilian oversight of police departments. He would make law enforcement officers wear body cameras to help hold them accountable while protecting the privacy of innocent people. And he would provide federal funding to help state and local governments adopt new policing standards."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"December 24, 2015","Press Release - Sanders Gains in New Poll, Clinton Support Shrinks","BURLINGTON, VT.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has significantly narrowed Hillary Clinton's margin in a new national poll that showed him making dramatic gains with African-Americans and Latinos.Overall, Sanders cut Clinton's lead almost in half, reducing it by 12 points in the new CNN/ORC poll.Support for Sanders has grown to 34 percent among registered voters who are Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. That's a four-point pickup for Sanders since November.Clinton has fallen to 50 percent, a significant eight-point drop in her standing since the same survey was conducted last month. The reversal for Clinton was remarkable because it came after support for her increased in three previous CNN polls.In an interview broadcast Thursday morning on CNN's ""New Day,"" anchor Chris Cuomo told Sanders ""the Santa Claus of political polls has brought you a gift, the highest number you've reached so far in the new CNN poll""Sanders noted the progress his campaign has made from polls earlier this year that showed his support in single digits.""All of the pundits considered us a fringe candidacy. Today, we're perhaps in the lead in New Hampshire, where I think we're closing in here in Iowa, and your poll seems to indicate we have national momentum,"" Sanders said in the interview taped in Council Bluffs, Iowa.""We have come a really long way in 7 1/2 months,"" Sanders added. ""We have a tremendous volunteer network all over this country. We are raising significant sums of money from small individual contributions. So at this point, I have to tell you, we're feeling good.""Non-white voters4/16-4/191%5/29-5/315%6/26-6/289%7/22-7/2512%9/17-9/1917%12/17-12/2132%Looking closer at the CNN survey, Sanders has demonstrated growing support among what the pollster refers to as non-white voters. In a survey last April, he had only 1 percent of voters in that category. As he made a concerted effort to reach out to African-Americans and Latinos, Sanders support has grown to an impressive 32 percent in the most recent poll.Turning to the general election, several recent polls show Sanders holding a big advantage over Republican front-runner Donald Trump and faring better than Clinton against potential Republican nominees.A Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday found Sanders leading Trump by 13 percentage points, 51 percent to 38 percent. ""If this margin held in a general election, Democrats would almost certainly regain control of the United States Senate and very possibly the House of Representatives,"" according to Bent Budowsky, a columnist for the The Hill newspaper.The CNN poll did not ask voters about a Sanders-Trump contest. The survey did show Clinton with a statistically-insignificant two-point edge over Trump, 49 percent to 47 percent. She has slipped from a five-point lead over Trump two months ago. As in earlier CNN matchups, Clinton trailed Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"December 27, 2015","Press Release - 2,000 Turn Out at Big Reno Rally for Bernie","RENO, Nev.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday brought his campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination to the Reno Ballroom here and told more than 2,000 supporters that ""with your support we're going to win here in Nevada."" ""We have a path toward victory not only to win this election but most importantly to transform our country,"" Sanders told Nevadans. Sanders leads Hillary Clinton in recent polls in New Hampshire and is within striking distance of the lead in Iowa. After Iowa's Feb. 1 precinct caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary election, Nevada is the next state to play a critical role in the nomination process with caucuses on Feb. 20. In reality, Sanders said, the presidential nomination process kicked off long ago for Republican White House hopefuls last April at a Las Vegas casino. What was dubbed the ""Adelson Primary"" was staged by billionaire gambling tycoon Sheldon Adelson who welcomed a parade of Republican hopefuls to his posh Las Vegas casino to vie for his financial support. Adelson and other billionaires have exploited the corrupt campaign finance system ushered in by a Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. That disastrous 5-4 decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for corporations and billionaires like Adelson to spend unlimited sums to bankroll candidates.  Earlier Sunday, Sanders spoke to about 140 supporters at a union hall here with members of the three major national labor organizations which have the endorsed him: the Communications Workers of America, National Nurses United and the American Postal Workers Union. At another meeting with some 160 seniors and others, Sanders said protecting Social Security is a top priority at a time when more than half of workers nearing retirement have no savings. He also called for reining in runaway prescription drug prices and stopping cuts to Medicare. The Reno stops were on the first day of a two-day trip to Nevada. Later this week, Sanders returns to Iowa before heading back to New Hampshire next weekend."

Bernie Sanders on Monday welcomed a major endorsement from Erin Bilbray, Democratic National Committee superdelegate and a leading advocate for women in public service. ""I have spent my entire career working to engage women in the political process,"" Bilbray said. ""But at this point the biggest threat to American democracy is the dark money from super PACs that are controlling our elections. Government cannot focus on all of the important issues that affect America's working families when a handful of super wealthy donors, in both parties, have the ability to predetermine who will win the election. Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced all super PACs and will continue to fight for the future of the middle class.

""Erin Bilbray is a leader in Nevada. She has been an advocate of middle-class working families her whole life, and believes Senator Sanders is the only candidate that can bring the real change necessary to take back our country from the billionaire class and fight for true campaign finance reform,"" said Sanders' Nevada state director, Joan Kato. ""We are excited to have her support."" Bilbray is a Nevada native and her father, James Bilbray, is a former congressman from southern Nevada. She founded Emerge Nevada, a nonprofit organization that trains and recruits women to become politically active. On Monday, Bilbray will welcome Sen.

""The goal of U.S. foreign and military policy must be to destroy ISIS, but to do it in a way that does not get American troops involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.

The night before, another 800 people packed into a meeting place decorated with holiday ornaments in snow-covered Ottumwa, Iowa.The big turnouts during a three-day campaign swing across Iowa pushed to more than 34,000 the total number of supporters and others who came to Sanders' campaign events since his bid for the White House officially began last April 30. Another 1,000 campaign volunteers and others are expected at a New Year's Eve party that Sanders is throwing Thursday night here in the state capital.With the Feb. 1 precinct caucuses only one month away, Sanders thanked Iowans for taking seriously their unique role in the American presidential nomination process.""We are running a simple, straightforward grassroots campaign.

As the senator was speaking about the collapse of the middle class in the United States and growing income and wealth inequality, he was interrupted by a man wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt. ""Here's a Trump supporter, worried about Mr. Trump's money,"" Sanders said as the man was ushered away. ""I say to Mr. Trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation,"" Sanders added as the crowd cheered.  As he arrived in Worcester, his car was caught in traffic outside the high school. Sanders jumped out and shook hands with supporters waiting in the long line that snaked for blocks to get inside the gymnasium. Not all of them made it. As dusk fell, the senator spoke at an impromptu gathering of 300 people in overcoats and Patriots stocking hats. Inside the school, another 2,700 people packed the gym and two overflow rooms to listen to Sanders' hour-long stump speech.The two campaign stops in Massachusetts came on the same day when Sanders disclosed that his campaign raised $33 million in the final three months of 2015. That brought his fundraising tally for the year to $73 million, almost all of it from small donors. Altogether, Sanders received more than 2.5 million donations in 2015 from 1 million different individuals.""We will not accept a political system which is increasingly corrupt, which allows billionaires to buy elections.

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign raised more than $33 million in the final three months of last year in a way that rewrote the record books for White House campaigns. The tally for the year-end quarter pushed his total raised last year to $73 million from more than 1 million individuals who made a record 2.5 million donations.""This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it.""The 2,513,665 donations to Sanders' campaign broke the record set four years ago by President Barack Obama's re-election committee. Through Dec. 31, 2011, Obama had chalked up 2,209,636 donations.The more than 1 million donors to Sanders also is a milestone unmatched by any first-time White House candidate. Obama's millionth donor in his 2008 campaign came on Feb. 27 of that election year. (In the next election cycle, the incumbent president's re-election campaign hit the 1-million- donors mark on Oct. 17, 2011.)Unlike other campaigns, small contributions made up the vast majority of all the money Sanders' campaign raised. The average donation to Sanders during the past three months was $27.16.Unlike other presidential campaigns, 99.9 percent of Sanders' supporters may give again because they have not reached the legal limit on donations to traditional campaign committees. Only a few hundred of the more than 1 million Sanders donors have given the maximum $2,700.Unlike candidates who have coordinated with so-called super PACs, Sanders has refused to work with the fund-raising behemoths that have corrupted American politics.All told, Sanders supporters gave $33,281,952 during the Federal Election Commission reporting period that ended at midnight on New Year's Eve. Secretary Clinton's campaign announced on Friday that she raised $37 million in the last quarter for use in the Democratic primary. The total for Sanders far surpassed donations in either of the previous two quarters of his eight-month long campaign and brought the fundraising total for 2015 to $72.8 million. Sanders ended the year with $28.4 million cash on hand.The record number of donations to Sanders is one way to measure the grassroots enthusiasm for his campaign. Another sign of his success has been big turnouts at rallies and town meetings in Iowa and New Hampshire and other states. In Iowa alone, more than 35,000 have come to Sanders-sponsored campaign events.""Bernie is the only candidate generating the kind of broad-based enthusiasm and excitement that Democrats must have in order to raise funds for a general election campaign and keep the White House and make gains in Congress,"" Weaver said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 3, 2016","Press Release - Stop Drug Company Greed, Strengthen Social Security, Sanders Tells New Hampshire Seniors","LONDONDERRY, N.H.  Speaking at a seniors' center here on Sunday, Bernie Sanders detailed plans to lower prescription drug prices, expand Social Security, boost Meals on Wheels and improve other programs for seniors.  ""We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces, but by how it treats the most vulnerable people,"" Sanders told the crowd of 280.""We've got too many seniors who are struggling to provide for their basic needs. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, we should pay attention to the needs of senior citizens trying to survive on as little as $12,000 a year,"" he added.Sanders has introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to bring down prescription drug prices, which soared more than 12 percent in 2014, the biggest jump in a decade. The legislation by Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Their bills also would make it legal to import less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.""If I am elected president of the United States, the pharmaceutical industry will know who the president is and their greed is going to end,"" Sanders said.On Social Security, he told seniors that there will be no cost-of-living increase this year. It is only the third time in 40 years that payments will stay flat. Sanders said the consumer price index, which is used to calculate annual COLAs, does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors. Sanders has proposed legislation to increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors.Also under Sanders' Social Security plan, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year would pay the same share of their income into Social Security as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500. Sanders' proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and lift seniors out of poverty by boosting benefits for low-income beneficiaries.Social Security is a key source of income for 42,000 people in New Hampshire whose benefits in 2014 averaged about $15,000. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is just 5.7 percent."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 5, 2016",Press Release - Sanders: Wall Street Will Play by the Rules if I'm President," NEW YORK  Speaking a few subway stops away from the epicenter of the global financial crisis, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders promised to remake the financial system to serve America's working families.""We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else,"" Sanders said. ""I'll rein in Wall Street behavior, so they can't crash our economy again. Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.""Sanders presented a sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation's biggest financial institutions, drawing sharp contrasts with Sec. Clinton's approach. ""My opponent says that as a senator she told bankers to 'cut it out' and end their destructive behavior,"" Sanders said. ""But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to 'cut it out.' The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street and their lobbyists regulate Congress. We must change that reality and as president I will.""Sanders' administration will create a list of ""too big to fail"" institutions by the end of his first 100 days in the White House. ""Within one-year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy,"" he said. Sanders will accomplish this goal by appointing strong regulators who will utilize Section 121 of Dodd-Frank to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system by breaking up large banks and shadow banks that pose a grave threat to the economy.Sanders promised to fight to establish a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap ATM fees, allow post offices to offer banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its full employment mandate. ""Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits. On this issue, Secretary Clinton is wrong. Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally insured bank deposits of big commercial banks  something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act,"" Sanders said.Sanders also said he will fight to cap ATM fees at $2, cap interest rates on credit cards and loans at 15 percent, establish modest banking services at post offices, and turn credit rating agencies into non-profits that are committed to accurately rating financial products, and are not beholden to Wall Street.""Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy,"" Sanders said before describing some of the biggest crimes committed by financial institutions in recent years. ""That will change under my administration. 'Equal justice under law' will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.""Click here to read Sanders' prepared remarks."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 7, 2016",Press Release - Sanders' Campaign Questions Clinton Opposition to Paid Family and Medical Leave Legislation,"DAVENPORT, Iowa  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday plans to make the case for three months of paid family and medical leave if employees have a child or they or their family members become ill. He plans to tell a news conference in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that it's unconscionable that millions of new parents in this country are forced back to work because they don't have the income to stay home with their newborn babies.Sen. Sanders is disappointed that Hillary Clinton refuses to support the FAMILY Act sponsored by leading Democratic women in the Senate and House.Bernie is one of 19 cosponsors of the bill by Sen. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to provide three months of paid family leave for new parents and people with serious illnesses. Rep. Rosa DeLauro's House bill has 112 cosponsors.The legislation would be paid for by a small payroll tax totaling $1.61 a week for a typical worker.""Bernie thinks that's a good investment,"" said Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs. Secretary Clinton has refused to support the paid family and medical leave legislation because of the way it would be funded.""What Secretary Clinton might not appreciate is that we're talking about the same kind of modest investment our country has made before in two critically important programs for working families: Social Security and Medicare,"" Briggs added.""Would Secretary Clinton have opposed Social Security when President Roosevelt signed it into law? Would she have fought President Johnson when Medicare was passed? What FDR understood in terms of Social Security and what LBJ understood in terms of Medicare is the importance of all workers having a stake in important programs for working families, "" Briggs said.""If she was the president, would she now veto the paid family and medical leave legislation that Democrats have introduced in Congress? How exactly would Sec. Clinton pay for her plan?""Sanders support for the FAMILY Act was criticized on Friday by Clinton's top domestic policy adviser, Ann O'Leary. Curiously, O'Leary previously supported a payroll tax to provide family and medical leave insurance in an article she co-authored for the Center for American Progress. "
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 8, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Supports President Obama on Gun Safety,"TOLEDO, Iowa  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday reiterated his support for President Barack Obama's executive actions on gun safety.""Senator Sanders strongly supports the president's executive actions on gun safety,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. Throughout his career in Congress, Sanders has voted for strong gun safety measures, including a ban on assault weapons, improved background checks and eliminating the gun-show loophole. As the senator has said before, he thinks Congress should re-examine a law on manufacturers' liability, Weaver added.""Bernie has been a consistent supporter of gun safety legislation since he lost his first bid for Congress in a campaign in which he supported an assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association has given him grades of D- and F.""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has a record of flip flops on  among other issues  gun safety,"" Weaver added. ""Today she's attacking Bernie on guns. Eight years ago she attacked Barack Obama on guns.""When she was a candidate for the Senate in 2000, she said she favored licensing everyone who buys a gun and establishing a registry of all handgun sales. But by the time she was running president in 2008, she said that federal ""blanket rules"" on guns no longer made sense to her.At one point in that 2008 campaign, she even attacked then-Sen. Barack Obama as ""elitist and out of touch"" over what she called his ""demeaning remarks"" about gun owners. In fact, she even sent out a pamphlet attacking Obama for being too strong on gun control. He reacted to her over-the-top rhetoric by accusing her of acting like ""Annie Oakley  packin' a six-shooter.""""Maybe Secretary Clinton should apologize for attacking the president in 2008 because he was too strong on gun control,"" Weaver said.

Bernie Sanders on Friday made the case for three months of paid leave for workers who have a child or if they or someone in their family becomes ill.Sanders said he was disappointed that Hillary Clinton has only ""talked in vague and general terms"" about family leave but won't support bills in Congress to implement it.Sanders is one of 20 cosponsors of a bill by Sen. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to provide three months of paid family and medical leave for new parents and people with serious illnesses. Rep. Rosa DeLauro's companion bill in the House has 115 cosponsors. The legislation would be paid for by a small payroll tax of about $1.61 a week for a typical worker. It's the same broad-based tax that funds Social Security and Medicare.""Apparently Secretary Clinton believes that a $1.61 payroll tax for the average worker is too high a price for three months of paid family and medical leave. I strongly disagree with that,"" Sanders said.""It is an insurance program, like Social Security and like Medicare,"" he added. ""If President Franklin Roosevelt had taken the same position that a small payroll tax is unacceptable we would not have Social Security. If President Johnson had taken the same position as Secretary Clinton that a small payroll tax was unacceptable then we would not have Medicare.""Almost one-quarter of employed mothers in the United States return to work within two weeks of giving birth, according to an In These Times analysis of U.S. Department of Labor data. Only 13 percent of U.S. workers have access to any paid leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 40 percent of U.S. households with children under 18 rely heavily on a mother's income, Pew research data shows.Sanders said the current law provides only 12 weeks of unpaid leave and only covers employees in companies with more than 50 workers.The legislation to provide paid leave has strong backing in Congress. ""Twenty-one members of the Senate, including virtually every progressive Democrat, and 116 members of the House, including virtually every progressive Democrat, believe this is the approach we should take as we move forward toward paid family and medical leave,"" Sanders said.Watch the press conference:"
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 8, 2016",Press Release - Sanders is Most Electable Democratic Candidate for President,"TOLEDO, Iowa  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Tuesday that Democratic Party caucus goers should consider ""electability."" She's right. Now there is more evidence that Bernie Sanders is the most electable Democrat running for the White House.Sanders outpolled Clinton in head-to-head matchups against the leading Republican candidates in a new poll release on Friday of voters in the battleground general election state of New Hampshire.""Sanders does an average of nine points better than Clinton in the general election match ups,"" according to the North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling.Sanders does best against the candidates who are most popular among Republicans. He is favored by 20 points over both Donald Trump (54 percent to 34 percent) and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz by 20 points (55 percent to 35 percent.)Sanders leads the entire Republican Party field by double digits. He holds a 12-point edge over former Gov. Jeb Bush; leads U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio by 14 points and he has a 19-point advantage over Dr. Ben Carson.Sanders is the only candidate with a positive favorability rating among the overall electorate in New Hampshire ""and it's a very positive rating,"" according to a news release from Dean Debnam, the polling firm president. Fifty-five percent of New Hampshire voters see Sanders positively while only 35 percent have a negative opinion of the senator.The results fit a pattern in other recent polls. Sanders outperformed Trump 51 percent to 38 percent in a recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University.""Sanders is the candidate best positioned to lead the party to victory in November,"" said Sanders' pollster Ben Tulchin. ""A series of polls conducted in mid-December  notably the Quinnipiac University poll, the CNN/ORC International poll, and The Economist/YouGov poll  find Sanders has the most positive reputation of any presidential candidate from either party and is significantly better positioned with independent voters than is Hillary Clinton."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 9, 2016","Press Release - Strengthen Social Security, Rein in Drug Prices, Sanders Tells Iowa Seniors","NEWTON, Iowa  Meeting on Saturday with Iowa seniors, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton to support his proposal to boost Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for decades to come.Under Sanders' plan, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year would pay the same share of their income into Social Security as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.""I hope that Hillary Clinton joins me because I believe that we've got to stand with seniors,"" Sanders told the crowd of 160 at the Jasper County Community Center. Clinton has said raising the cap is ""something we should look at"" but she has stopped short of endorsing the proposal. She also has left open the possibility that she would support raising the retirement age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security. ""I would consider it,"" she told a town meeting in New Hampshire last Oct. 28.Sanders' proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and lift seniors out of poverty by boosting benefits for low-income beneficiaries.For only the third time in 40 years, seniors on Social Security this year are not receiving a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.More than 616,000 people in Iowa  nearly 20 percent of the population  receive about $9 billion annually through Social Security. The benefits go to more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children.Sanders also detailed plans to lower prescription drug prices, which soared more than 12 percent in 2014, the biggest jump in a decade. He has introduced a bill in the Senate authorizing the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland introduced a companion bill in the House. The measures also would make it legal to import less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries."

Ted Cruz of Texas, the leaders in their party's field of candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a memo by Sanders' pollster Ben Tulchin.The analysis of public polling on the White House race also yielded these key points:Sanders is viewed more favorably by Americans than any other candidate for president from either party.He is regarded as the most honest and trustworthy candidate of either party.Sanders is popular with independents while Clinton fares poorly with that bloc of critical swing voters in general elections.He is very popular with younger voters and can galvanize them to turn out, helping Democrats up and down the ticket.Republicans favor Sanders far more than Clinton.Sanders popularity is largely due to his positive reputation. ""Sanders enjoys the most positive profile of any 2016 contender and would begin a fall campaign with room to grow,"" according to Tulchin. His memo cites a new Field Poll in California which found Sanders' favorability was greater than Clinton's by a margin of 15 points.While most voters view Sanders as honest and trustworthy, two recent polls found that Clinton is distrusted slightly more than Trump. A December Quinnipiac University poll found Trump was distrusted by 58 percent of voters. Fifty-nine percent distrusted Clinton. The Economist/YouGov poll from the same time found Trump distrusted by 50 percent of voters and 52 percent distrusted Clinton.Sanders also is the strongest Democrat against the leading Republican candidates. ""The main factor responsible for Sanders' superior performance against Trump is that the senator from Vermont performs much better with independents,"" according to Tulchin. The Quinnipiac University poll found Sanders beating Trump by 14 points with independents, while Clinton beat Trump by only 2 points with independents, a critical bloc in general elections.Young voters remain a key to Sanders' strength. Notably, Tulchin wrote, Quinnipiac found that voters under age 35 view Sanders favorably by a 44-point margin (58 percent favorable to 14 percent unfavorable) while CNN found he was viewed favorably by voters in that age group by a 32-point margin (55 percent favorable to 23 percent unfavorable).In a new Fox News poll released on Friday, Sanders is ahead of Hillary Clinton 50 percent to 37 percent among New Hampshire Democratic primary voters. Sanders lengthened his lead since November, when he was up by just one point (45 percent to 44 percent). Sanders outpolled Clinton in head-to-head matchups against the leading Republican candidates in another new poll in New Hampshire released on Friday by Public Policy Polling. Sanders averaged nine points better than Clinton in the general election match ups. He defeated Trump by 20 points.To read the memo, click here."

Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.Sanders' plan is patterned after a proposal to scrap the cap first brought forward by President Barack Obama in 2008. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada in the last session of Congress was a cosponsor of Sanders' legislation to scrap the cap on the payroll tax.""I hope Hillary Clinton joins us because I believe that we've got to stand with seniors,"" Sanders said.

""One says it's okay to take millions from big banks and then tell them what to do. My plan: break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes, and make them pay their fair share. Then we can expand health care to all and provide universal college education.""Sanders presented a sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation's biggest financial institutions a week ago during a major speech in New York. He pledged to break up the biggest banks and fight to establish a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act which would restore a Depression-era law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap credit card interest rates and ATM fees, allow post offices to offer basic banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its mandate to promote full employment.Hillary Clinton, another candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, recently claimed that her proposals were backed by ""everybody."" In a Jan. 5 speech in Sioux City, Iowa, she asserted that ""everybody who's looked at my proposals says my proposals are tougher, more effective, more comprehensive."" It wasn't true then, as The Washington Post reported, and it's not true now.In reality, 170 economists and other experts have laid out the reasons why Sanders' plan is superior.

Galbraith, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC., Brad Miller, former U.S. Congressman from North Carolina, and William K. Black, University of Missouri-Kansas City.""Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another 'too-big-to-fail' financial crisis,"" the letter said.

""They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking.

""For his outspoken and courageous leadership, his candid and consistent pledge of allegiance to that All-American ideal, I am proud to be here to join this 'untiring effort'; and, as a former Chairman of the National Democratic Party, to endorse Bernie Sanders for our Party's nomination for President of the United States of America.""

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 15, 2016",Press Release - Sanders: Stop the Wall Street to Washington Revolving Door,"BURLINGTON, Vt.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday said he would stop the revolving door between Wall Street and the federal government.He cited Goldman Sachs' deal this week to pay a $5 billion fine for bogus marketing schemes on home mortgages during the financial crisis seven years ago as the latest example of the need for independent regulators and prosecutors.""The $5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs should make it clear to everyone that the business model on Wall Street is fraud. In my view, the time has come to shut the revolving door between Wall Street and the federal government. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration,"" Sanders said.""Instead, we need federal prosecutors and regulators with a clear track record of standing up to the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street,"" added Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic Party nomination for president.Wall Street's undue influence in both Republican and Democratic administrations is exemplified by two recent Treasury secretaries who have held posts in and out of Washington and Wall Street. In 1995, Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, became the Treasury secretary. In 1999, Rubin left to become a director and senior counsel of Citigroup. In 2006, Henry Paulson left his job as chairman of Goldman Sachs to become Treasury secretary. In 2008, Paulson asked Congress to pass legislation giving him a blank check of $700 billion to bailout Wall Street.""Under my administration, top executives of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street CEOs will no longer go through the revolving door from Wall Street to government,"" Sanders said.Sanders pledge to fill financial posts with regulators who are not beholden to Wall Street came as he made the case for his sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation's biggest financial institutions. In laying out the proposal during a major speech last week in New York, Sanders pledged to break up the biggest banks. He also advocated restoring the post-Depression Glass-Steagall Act to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap credit card interest rates and ATM fees, allow post offices to offer basic banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its mandate to promote full employment.Sanders plan is backed by some 170 economists and other experts, including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, University of Texas Professor James K. Galbraith and Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC."

Bernie Sanders on Saturday made good on his promise to support legislation to amend a 2005 law on firearms manufacturers' liability.""I'm pleased that this legislation is being introduced,"" Sanders said of proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam Schiff to rescind portions of a law granting broad immunity from lawsuits to gun manufacturers and dealers. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders added.Sanders called it ""good news"" that the Senate and House bills proposed by Blumenthal and Schiff would leave in place provisions in the 2005 law that require child safety locks on guns and ban armor-piercing ammunition. ""Those were important provisions that I did support,"" he said.Sanders also renewed his concern that the law should not subject the owners of small gun stores, which have not acted negligently, to lawsuits. ""As I have said, I do want to make sure that this legislation does not negatively impact small gun stores in rural America that serve the hunting community. So I'm pleased to support the legislation and should it come up for consideration I would work to make sure it includes a provision that allows us to monitor its impact so that we may determine if it is having any unintended consequences.""Sanders proposed amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills would require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law's impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. Sanders amendment would add this section to the proposed legislation:Sec. 3. Protection of non-negligent rural mom and pop hunting stores. The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the impact of this statute, if any, on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, in rural communities from non-negligent local sellers.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 16, 2016",Press Release - Sanders: Michigan Governor Must Resign over Flint Lead-Poisoning Crisis,"BURLINGTON, Vt.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to resign for his administration's failure to deal with a lead-poisoning crisis that has sickened thousands of children in Flint, Michigan.""There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint's water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign,"" Sanders said.Problems with Flint's public water system date to a decision nearly two years ago by a receiver, appointed by the governor, who decided to cut costs by drawing the city's drinking water from the polluted Flint River instead of from Lake Huron.The governor and other state officials knew  but did not acknowledge until last fall  that the river water was corroding pipes and causing lead to leach into the drinking water. The decision not to add chemicals to prevent corrosion of the pipes was made at the direction of the governor's Department of Environmental Quality. The state health department in Michigan apparently knew about elevated lead levels in the blood of children but did not warn the public.""Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder's administration and his refusal to take responsibility, families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems. The people of Flint deserve more than an apology,"" Sanders said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 17, 2016","Press Release - Medicare-for-All Plan Detailed by Sanders: Improves Health Care, Cuts Costs","CHARLESTON, S.C.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday detailed a Medicare-for-all plan to provide better health care for all Americans at less cost.""Universal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,"" Sanders said. ""It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege.""The proposal would expand Medicare, the popular and successful health care program for seniors, and build on the success of the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders helped craft. Patients would be able to choose their own doctors and receive comprehensive care for everything from hospital stays to emergency room visits to primary and specialty care.Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan would save $6 trillion over the next 10 years compared to the current system, according to a detailed analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at University of Massachusetts at Amherst who is a leading expert on health care costs.In a nation that now spends $3 trillion a year on health care  nearly $10,000 per person  Sanders' plan would save consumers money by eliminating expensive and wasteful private health insurance. The plan would save taxpayers money by dramatically reducing overall health care costs and bringing down skyrocketing prescription drug prices which are far greater in the United States than in any other country.The typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs, Friedman calculated. The average working family now pays $4,955 in premiums for private insurance and spends another $1,318 on deductibles for care that isn't covered. Under Sanders' plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the Medicare-for-all program.Businesses would save more than $9,400 a year in health care costs under Sanders' plan. The average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 a year would go from $12,591 to just $3,100.The shift to universal health care would be paid for with a 2.2 percent health care premium (calculated under the rules for federal income taxes); a 6.2 percent health care payroll tax paid by employers; an estate tax on the wealthiest Americans and changes in the tax code to make federal income tax rates more progressive.Under the plan, individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 a year would be taxed at a rate of 37 percent. The top rate, 52 percent, would apply to those earning $10 million or more a year, a category that in 2013 included only the 13,000 wealthiest households in the United States.Additional savings would be achieved from reducing outlays for taxpayer-supported health care expenditures.Sanders laid out his health care plan and progressive tax reform proposals here in South Carolina where he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were to take part on Sunday night in a nationally televised debate in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.To read more about Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan and his progressive tax proposals, click here.To read Professor Gerald Friedman's analysis of Sanders' plan, click here."

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by marching to the South Carolina Statehouse and touring a Baptist church that was bombed here in Birmingham.Speaking on the Capitol steps in Columbia, South Carolina, Sanders' call for racial and economic justice echoed King's twin missions to end discrimination and poverty.Later Monday, Sanders traveled to Alabama and visited the landmark 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. The senator stopped beside a plain marker along the side of the church commemorating four girls who were killed in a 1963 bomb blast at the church where King often preached.""The vision he had for the future in many ways remains unfulfilled,"" Sanders said.

We certainly concede that former Secretary of State Clinton has more experience than Sen. Sanders, but his judgement on major foreign policy issues is far superior.""In 2002, then Sen. Clinton and then-Rep. Sanders both listened to the Bush administration's arguments for getting us into a war in Iraq. Secretary Clinton voted for that war  one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of our country and a war which resulted in the kind of chaos and instability which allowed for the rise of ISIS. Sen. Sanders not only voted against the war but helped lead the opposition to the war. Many of the concerns he raised in 2002 turned out, unfortunately, to be true.""As president, Sen. Sanders would do all that he could to destroy the barbaric Islamic State terrorist group, but he will do it by maintaining a strong coalition of major powers and our Muslim allies. He agrees with King Abdullah of Jordan that it must be Muslim troops on the ground that destroy ISIS with the support of the United States and other major powers providing air support, training and military equipment. He will do everything he can to prevent U.S. troops from getting involved in perpetual war in the quagmire of the Middle East.""Sen. Sanders also agrees with President Obama that Secretary Clinton's proposal for a no-fly zone in Syria could have dangerous implications.""As president, Sanders also will work to prioritize military spending to make sure we are no longer fighting the Cold War but focus our resources and priorities in fighting today's challenges, including international terrorism."""

Bernie Sanders' stand against the proposed Bakken oil pipeline in Iowa is the focus of a new television ad set to begin airing on Wednesday in Iowa. Sanders is the only candidate to oppose the pipeline, which would pump dirty crude oil across Iowa.In the 30-second ad, two Iowa farmers explain that they support Sanders because ""he stands up against the pipeline.""""Bernie Sanders didn't hesitate to say no to the big oil companies,"" George Naylor of Churdan, Iowa, says. ""Bernie knows that if we don't act we threaten the climate and the health of our children,"" Patti Edwardson adds. ""Bernie Sanders has the guts to just stand up for what he believes in,"" Edwardson concludes.Sanders first voiced his opposition to the pipeline, which would transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily through 18 Iowa counties, in November. Sanders noted at the time that he was ""opposed to the construction of the Bakken crude oil pipeline because as a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, and not increase our dependence on oil, coal and other carbon pollution sources.""Sanders was also the first candidate to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline and the Northeast Energy Direct pipeline in New Hampshire.

Sanders believes stopping the worst effects of climate change is a critical challenge for the next president. That's why he's proposed a bold and comprehensive proposal that lays out what he would do once he's in the White House to put people before polluters. His plan cuts U.S. carbon pollution 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. He does it by putting a tax on carbon pollution, repealing fossil fuel subsidies and making massive investments in energy efficiency and clean, sustainable energy such as wind and solar power.""With only 12 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, however, it remains unclear whether Hillary Clinton will tell voters what she would do to address climate change. In July, a post on her campaign website promised a 'comprehensive energy and climate' plan 'in the coming months.' It's now six months later. What's taking so long? Is there a pattern here? It took the former secretary of state four years to take a stand on the Keystone pipeline, which would carry some of the dirtiest oil on the planet across the United States.""These are among the important questions for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Does Secretary Clinton oppose the Bakken crude oil pipeline that cuts through Iowa and three other states? What's her position on the Northeast Direct pipeline in New Hampshire?""Will she support a carbon tax? Will she continue President Obama's moratorium on all new coal leases on public land? Will she commit to banning fossil fuels extraction on public lands? Does she oppose offshore drilling? Fracking? We just don't know.""Where is Secretary Clinton's climate plan?"""

Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas and Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio.Sanders polled nearly three times better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head contests with Trump. The former secretary of state also languished behind Sanders in general election matchups against the other Republican White House hopefuls, according to the poll for WMUR-TV and CNN.Results released on Tuesday from the same University of New Hampshire Research Center survey found that 60 percent of likely Democratic Party primary voters say they would vote for Sanders compared to 33 percent for Clinton.""There is excitement and energy for Bernie that no other candidate can match,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""His message that it is time to do something about the rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system is resonating with voters in New Hampshire and other states.Sanders ""currently has double digit leads over five potential Republican challengers in New Hampshire"" while Clinton leads Trump ""but is deadlocked with four other potential challengers,"" according to the University of New Hampshire Research Center.""Hillary Clinton says Democrats should look at which candidate is the most electable and we couldn't agree more,"" Weaver added. ""These new poll numbers in New Hampshire are the most recent evidence that Bernie would be the best Democratic nominee to retain the White House and help regain the Senate and elect Democrats all across the country.""In a hypothetical contest with Trump, Sanders led by 23 points in New Hampshire, outpolling the Republican real estate developer by 57 percent to 34 percent. Clinton, by contrast, has only a single-digit margin over Trump, 48 percent to 39 percent.Driving this divide is Sanders' strength with independent voters, in contrast to Clinton who struggles with this key bloc of voters. Notably, Sanders leads Trump with independents by a 22-point margin while Clinton actually trails the real estate mogul by 9 points, a net 31-point difference.""This same pattern emerges in all of the head-to-head match-ups with Republicans between Sanders and Clinton,"" said Sanders' pollster Ben Tulchin. ""This real strength with independents  both overall and especially compared to Clinton  positions Sanders very well for the general election and gives him a real edge over Clinton as the more electable candidate, especially recalling that New Hampshire is a swing state that Al Gore lost in the 2000 general election.""Sanders led Christie and Cruz by 23 points, was 21 points up on Kasich and 18 points over Rubio. Clinton lost to Rubio, tied Kasich and led Christie by less than the survey's margin of error."

It's not Secretary Clinton.""How exactly would Secretary Clinton, as she vaguely put it, 'get us the rest of the way?' She hasn't told us. Her website promises she'll 'expand affordable coverage, slow the growth of overall health care costs and make it possible for providers to deliver the very best care to patients.' How exactly? Does she have a plan to improve Medicare or Medicaid? Does she have a plan to provide insurance for 29 million Americans who still lack coverage and more who are underinsured?""If she does have a plan to achieve universal health care, voters deserve to see it. If she does not have one, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire deserve to know that too."""

But slick television ads can't hide her hawkish record.""As a senator, she voted in 2002 for the war in Iraq, one of the worst foreign policy blunders in modern American history. As a House member, Sanders voted against the war and led opposition to the Bush-Cheney military fiasco.""In 2008, then-Sen. Clinton scolded Barack Obama and called him 'naive' for his willingness to talk to the leaders of Iran.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 23, 2016","Press Release - Clintons, Wall Street Getting Nervous as Sanders Gains in Iowa"," CLINTON, Iowa  Bernie Sanders told 700 supporters packed inside a community center here that Wall Street and Hillary Clinton's campaign are getting nervous about his growing momentum in Iowa and New Hampshire.Speaking in the same city where Clinton addressed a smaller crowd earlier in the day, Sanders rebuffed attacks which he said were recycled from her failed 2008 Iowa caucus contest with then Sen. Barack Obama. ""It reminds me of what happened here in Iowa eight years ago,"" Sanders said of the doubts she tried to plant about Obama's and now his experience and electability. ""But you know what, people in Iowa saw through those attacks then and they're going to see though those attacks again.""In fact, polls show Sanders is far more electable. In general election matchups with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Sanders substantially outpolls Clinton. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in mid-January, for example, found that in Iowa, a battleground state, Sanders was 13 points over Trump, 51 percent to 38 percent. Clinton's margin over Trump was only eight points. Sanders also spoke here and earlier Saturday in Davenport, Iowa, about Wall Street jitters about his growing success.""It appears that we have Wall Street a little bit nervous and that is a good thing,"" Sanders told volunteers at a field office in Davenport, Iowa, as they prepared for a day of door-knocking to bring people out to the Feb. 1 precinct caucuses.He was referring to a Wall Street Journal interview, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group, a global private equity firm. Schwarzman blamed Sanders for rattling stock markets because of his growing support coupled with a sense that ""we have Republicans on the other hand who don't inspire enormous confidence in terms of their ability perhaps to handle that job.""Sanders has made Wall Street reform a major issue in the contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In a speech in New York City earlier this month, Sanders said Wall Street's business model is ""fraud"" and questioned whether Clinton's plan to regulate the financial industry would work. He also spoke about ""very generous speaking fees"" Clinton accepted from financial institutions, a reference to more than $3 million she took in 2013 alone from Goldman Sachs and other big banks."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 23, 2016",Press Release - The American People are Angry,"MAQUOKETA, Iowa  ""I am angry and millions of Americans are angry,"" Bernie Sanders told a town meeting that brought out nearly 400 people to an inn here in eastern Iowa on cold Saturday night nine days before Iowa's first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses.Sanders was responding to former President Bill Clinton, who a few days before had tried to shrug off Sanders' campaign and the massive grassroots movement it has attracted by asserting that ""what they need now is not anger but answers."" Sanders recited a litany of reasons for Americans to be angry from childhood poverty to high unemployment to college students confronted by massive debt to a corrupt campaign system that props up a rigged economy.He also has detailed a series of answers to those and other problems confronting the country.Sanders has introduced a $1 trillion, five-year plan to rebuild America's crumbling roads and bridges to put 13 million Americans to work in good-paying jobs.He has a plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020 from the current starvation wage of $7.25 an hour.He will fight to sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law and favors pay equity for women workers.He has introduced a plan for a constitutional amendment to undo the 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which created the corrupt campaign finance system that props up our country's rigged economy.Sanders has a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free and pay for it with a tax on Wall Street speculators.He has a plan to expand and extend Social Security by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same share of their income into the system as everyone else."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 24, 2016","Press Release - Locked in Close Contest in Iowa, Sanders Details Differences with Clinton"," DECORAH, Iowa  With little more than a week to go before Iowa's precinct caucuses, Bernie Sanders on Sunday detailed sharp policy differences with Hillary Clinton on a host of issues from Wall Street reform to family leave to climate change.""Today we are locked in a very close race here in Iowa,"" Sanders said in a speech at Luther College to an audience of 2,272 people crowded into a gymnasium. A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released earlier Sunday showed Sanders holding a one-point edge over Clinton. The same survey had Sanders 19 points ahead in New Hampshire and gaining ground in South Carolina.""On Feb. 1 you have the opportunity to say that it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics and together we are going to take this country in a very different direction and that in fact we are going to make a political revolution,"" Sanders said.On foreign policy, Sanders contrasted his vote against the war in Iraq with Clinton's support for the 2002 invasion. ""That is a difference in judgement in what turns out to be the most important foreign policy moment in the modern history of the United States,"" Sanders said. On Wall Street reform, Sanders has introduced legislation to break up the biggest banks to protect consumers and spare taxpayers from future bailouts like the 2008 taxpayer rescue of Wall Street. ""In my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud,"" he said. ""Today three out of the four largest banks in this country are larger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. The time is now to break them up. That is not the position of Secretary Clinton,"" Sanders added.On paid family leave, Sanders laid out his support for bills in Congress to provide three months of paid leave. The legislation, introduced by leading Democratic women in the Senate and House, would pay for the program with a $1.61 payroll tax. ""I think it's a good investment,"" Sanders said. ""Secretary Clinton does not support that legislation.""On Social Security, Sanders detailed his plan to expand and extend the retirement and disability program by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same share of their income into the system as everyone else. He agrees with President Barack Obama's proposal to lift the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax. His legislation would make those earning more than $250,000 pay the same tax rate as those who earn $118,500 or less. ""On that issue, I support lifting the cap. Secretary Clinton does not,"" Sanders said.On the planetary crisis of climate change, Sanders was a leader opposing a pipeline to ship some of the dirtiest oil on the planet from the tar sands region of Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Texas. ""If we are going to transform our energy system and move away from fossil fuel we cannot support the Keystone pipeline,"" he said. ""I was out front on that issue, Hillary Clinton did come out late in opposition to the Keystone pipeline. I would have appreciated it if she had come out earlier."" Sanders also has opposed the proposed Bakken Pipeline that cuts through Iowa and three other states. Clinton has not taken a position. Clinton also refused to release a comprehensive plan to stop the worst effects of climate change, despite saying she would in July 2015. Overarching all other issues, Sanders said, is the corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires and corporations to try to buy elections so they can control Congress and protect their special interests.""We are living with a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system,"" Sanders said. ""The people of Iowa will have to determine  which candidate is willing to stand up to Wall Street and the billionaire class and represent working families.""The CBS poll released today showed that 91 percent of Iowa Democratic voters believe Sanders would pick regular people over big donors."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 25, 2016",Press Release - A Future to Believe In,"DES MOINES, Iowa  Making a closing case before Iowa's caucuses, Bernie Sanders presents his vision of an economy and political system that works for all Americans, not just the 1 percent. ""There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy,"" Sanders says in the spot set to begin airing in the Hawkeye State on Tuesday.""But I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place  and look to the American horizon,"" he continues. ""To a nation where every child can not only dream of going to college  but attend one. Where quality health care will be a birthright of every citizen. Where a good job is not a wish but a reality. Where women receive equal pay and a living wage is paid to all. An America where after a lifetime of labor there is time for rest and grandchildren. A nation that defends our people and our values but no longer carries so much of that burden alone.""Sanders has released comprehensive policy proposals to confront the problems facing the nation. He has detailed plans to make public colleges and universities tuition free, expand health care to all Americans, put 13 million Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding the country's crumbling roads and bridges, pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, expand social security and defeat the Islamic State while avoiding perpetual warfare in the Middle East.""I know we can create that America if we listen to our hearts. And that journey begins here in Iowa,"" Sanders concludes."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 25, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Blasts Corporate Deserters," AMES, Iowa  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday denounced ""corporate deserters"" after Johnson Controls and Tyco International announced a plan to merge the manufacturing giants in the latest example of a U.S.-based company acquiring a foreign firm to avoid paying U.S. taxes.""The potential Johnson-Tyco merger would be a disaster for American taxpayers,"" Sanders said. ""Profitable companies that have received corporate welfare from American taxpayers should not be allowed to renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying U.S. taxes. These corporate inversions must stop.""My message to these corporate deserters is simple: You can't be an American company only when you want corporate welfare from American taxpayers or you want lucrative contracts from the federal government,"" Sanders continued. ""If you want the advantages of being an American company then you can't run away from America to avoid paying taxes.""Sanders last year introduced the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act. It would end the inversion tax scam by treating corporations as American corporations for tax purposes when it is still majority owned by U.S. interests. In November, Sanders called on the Obama administration and Congress to stop a similar deal involving Pfizer and Allergan that would lead to higher prescription drug prices. ""The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,"" Sanders said at the time. ""It also would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas.""Sanders' Senate bill also would also stop corporations from avoiding $100 billion in taxes a year by stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 25, 2016","Press Release - Clinton Campaign Playing Politics with Guns, Just Like in 2008","GRINNELL, Iowa  Hillary Clinton's campaign is hiding her latest position on guns from voters in Iowa, an Associated Press analysis revealed.The Clinton campaign has painted their candidate as a fearless advocate for gun safety legislation but, according to the AP analysis, the campaign is downplaying a television ad on gun control in Iowa and in some rural parts of the state the ad hasn't been shown at all.This latest revelation re-focuses attention on Secretary Clinton's often changing views on gun safety legislation over the years.In 2000, Secretary Clinton supported registering all handgun purchases or transfers and licensing every gun owner who purchases a weapon.In 2008, she reversed that position and criticized gun safety legislation at the federal level. She also attacked then-Sen. Obama as being too tough on gun safety. Her posturing in that campaign prompted Obama's famous statement that she sounded like ""Annie Oakley."" The 2008 Clinton campaign sent out a mailer attacking then-Senator Obama, a mailer that was subsequently used by the NRA to echo those attacks in October 2008.In the 2016 campaign, she has now moved back to calling for more gun control but apparently is downplaying her views in Iowa for tactical advantage.Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager said, ""When you really believe an issue is important you don't hide it from voters in one state to gain political advantage. This is exactly what is wrong with the political process. It's no secret that Secretary Clinton has repeatedly changed her views on gun safety from one election to another. Now we see the Clinton campaign is gaming its message from one state to the other within the 2016 election.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"January 26, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Contrasts Record with Clinton on 'Disastrous' Trade Deals," DES MOINES, Iowa  Bernie Sanders told steelworkers at a boisterous meeting in a union hall here on Tuesday that a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal would continue ""disastrous"" policies that have shuttered factories and cost millions of good-paying jobs in the United States.""Everyone in this room understands what these disastrous trade agreements are all about. They were written by corporate America to benefit corporate America, people who could care less about working families,"" Sanders said at the United Steelworkers of America Local 310L union hall. ""The simple truth is, and it's indisputable, these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country and they have benefited the CEOs of major corporations.""Sanders is leading the opposition in Congress against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be the biggest trade pact in history. He also was at the forefront in earlier battles against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China  trade agreements that Secretary Clinton supported which have led to the loss of more than 30,000 good-paying jobs in Iowa. ""Can you be a great country when everything we buy is made in China?"" he asked the union workers. In the closing days before Iowans go to precinct caucuses to begin the process of picking a Democratic nominee for president, Sanders is in a neck-and-neck contest in Iowa with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Clinton has praised past trade agreements and once called the Pacific trade deal ""the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field."" Last Oct. 8, however, she said that ""as of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it. I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""At a news conference outside the union hall, Sanders was asked about trade. ""You are looking at a senator and former congressman who has led the effort since his first day in Congress back in the early 1990s against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China and today against the TPP. My record on trade is very, very different than Secretary Clinton's. I am glad that after talking about how good the TPP would be, finally, under great pressure, she decided to oppose it. But I think it is a real area of disagreement.""I have opposed all of these trade agreements. We have lost millions of jobs as corporations have shut down in America, gone to China and other low-wage countries. If elected president, we will make fundamental changes to our trade policies. Our demand is that we create good-paying jobs in the United States of America, not China, not Mexico, not other low wage countries.""So those are areas where I think there are real differences of opinion: our views on trade, our views on Social Security and ultimately our view as to which candidate is prepared to stand up to the greed and the irresponsibility of Wall Street and corporate America, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires,"" Sanders told reporters."

Another 4,539 spilled into an overflow amphitheater to hear him declare that corporate America's greed is destroying our economy and that the Koch brothers and other billionaires are using their fortunes to rig the economy by exploiting a corrupt campaign finance system.""These people have so much power that the only way we beat them is when we come together and demand that the United States government represent all of us and not just a handful of billionaires,"" Sanders said.The charged-up supporters waved blue and white placards  some saying ""Bernie"" and others ""A Future to Believe In""  as Sanders called for a plan to create millions of good-paying jobs, raise the minimum wage, provide pay equity for women and paid family and medical leave. They cheered his proposal to offer free tuition for qualified students at public colleges and universities. They applauded when he called for breaking up the big banks and taking on Wall Street and when he called for comprehensive immigration reform to put 11 million undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship.""People are sick and tired of working longer hours for lower wages and they're tired of having to work two or three jobs to have enough income and they are very tired of seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent,"" Sanders said. ""The American people are saying loudly and clearly that we have got to create an economy that works for all of us and not just the top 1 percent.""Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, introduced Sanders at the rally in the Twin Cities and earlier at a mid-day rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where a crowd of 6,000 filled a hockey rink.In Duluth, Sanders said the success of Democratic candidates at the ballot box will depend on their ability to turn enthusiasm at rallies into turnout at the polls. ""When our people vote, we win and we win big.""  Minnesota is one of 11 states that will hold caucuses or primary elections on March 1, Super Tuesday.

In fact, Sanders helped write the Affordable Care Act but says more remains to be done to provide better health care at less cost for all Americans, including the 29 million Americans still without health insurance and millions more who are underinsured. Sanders' proposal would save the typical family more than $5,000 a year.Her ad claims she would ""break through the gridlock, not add to it."" In fact, Sanders has worked with Republicans in Congress to pass major legislation. He worked with Sen. John McCain, for example, to pass a $15 billion bill to improve health care for veterans. McCain praised Sanders' ""record of advocacy for veterans,"" but added, ""I don't see how any veteran  could possibly have any good things, nor could support, her quest for being commander in chief.""Clinton insinuated that Sanders attacked Planned Parenthood. In fact, Sanders has a 100 percent lifetime voting record for Planned Parenthood and defended the group against Republican attempts to cut its budget.Clinton's ad says she would ""stand up to the gun lobby, not protect it."" Sanders has a D- lifetime rating by the National Rifle Association, supports President Barack Obama's gun safety initiatives. Sanders' advocacy for gun safety dates back to his 1988 congressional campaign, which he lost by 3 points after calling for a ban on assault weapons. Clinton has flip-flopped on gun issues throughout her career. Once an advocate for registering handguns, she became a gun-friendly candidate in 2008 when she tried to portray Obama as too hard on gun owners.In another dig at Sanders, her ad suggests that she would ""lead on foreign policy, not ignore it."" On the major foreign policy issue of the era, however, she voted for the war in Iraq. Sanders opposed it. He supported President Obama's overture to Iran which resulted in an agreement with world powers to stop Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal. She called President Barack Obama ""nave"" for even talking to Tehran. She wants a no-fly zone in Syria. He disagrees and instead wants Middle East nations to take the lead in fighting the Islamic State to prevent U.S. forces from being drawn into a perpetual conflict.Clinton's new ad does not offer any proposals for the future. She doesn't say how she would strengthen Social Security. She doesn't detail a way to combat climate change. She doesn't say why she won't support the leading bills by Democrats in Congress to provide paid family and medical leave. She doesn't detail her own plan to expand health care for Americans.""Secretary Clinton is spending a lot of time saying what she's not going to do. Bernie is spending his time telling Iowa voters and people across the country where he intends to lead the nation as president,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Bernie Sanders will build on the achievements President Obama has made and build for the future."""

The answer is obvious. The dynamics of the race have changed and Sen. Sanders has significant momentum. Sen. Sanders is happy to have more debates but we are not going to schedule them on an ad hoc basis at the whim of the Clinton campaign. If Secretary Clinton wants more debates that's great. We propose three additional debates. One in March, April and May and none on a Friday, Saturday or holiday weekend. And all of the three Democratic candidates must be invited.

I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set."" She hasn't talked about it since then.""What's her position on this bad trade deal today?"" Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs asked. ""It's hard to keep track of Secretary Clinton's shifting stands on the trade agreement that would help multi-national corporations ship more decent-paying jobs from the United States to low-wage nations overseas.""Questions about where Clinton stands were prompted by the article in Inside Trade in which the chamber president said that ""he expected Hillary Clinton would ultimately support the TPP if she becomes the Democratic nominee for president and is elected."" Donohue reasoned that Clinton switched her position on trade because Sanders led the opposition to the agreement in Congress. ""If she were to get nominated, if she were to be elected, I have a hunch that what runs in the family is you get a little practical if you ever get the job,"" Donohue told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Sanders is leading the opposition in Congress to the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be the biggest trade pact in history. He also was at the forefront in earlier battles against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China  trade agreements that Secretary Clinton supported which have led to the loss of more than 30,000 good-paying jobs in Iowa. ""Can you be a great country when everything we buy is made in China?"" he asked the union workers.He discussed the issue in Iowa last Tuesday at a United Steelworkers of America union hall. ""You are looking at a senator and former congressman who has led the effort since his first day in Congress back in the early 1990s against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China and today against the TPP,"" he told reporters afterward. ""My record on trade is very, very different than Secretary Clinton's."""

That's a record at this point in the campaign for any White House candidate.Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders' donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that more than 3 in 5 dollars given to Hillary Clinton come from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law.""The numbers we've seen since Jan. 1 put our campaign on pace to beat Secretary Clinton's goal of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled.""While the Sanders campaign is supported by millions of small-dollar contributions, Clinton left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. It's not yet known how much she added at that event to her reported $17 million in campaign contributions over the years from Wall Street and financial services interests.Sanders also has refused to coordinate with a super PAC which Clinton and other candidates have used to take unlimited contributions from millionaires and billionaires. For example, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Clinton, claimed on Friday to have nearly $45 million cash on hand. Donors have pledged at least $42 million in additional contributions that would give her a bigger super PAC war chest than any Democratic fund ever before.""As Secretary Clinton holds high-dollar fundraisers with the nation's financial elite, our supporters have stepped up in a way that allows Bernie to spend the critical days before the caucuses talking to Iowans about his plans to fix a rigged economy and end a corrupt system of campaign finance,"" Weaver said.

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign is funded by small donors who gave an average of about $29 each in the past year while Hillary Clinton has relied on the wealthy to bankroll her presidential bid, new financial disclosure reports reveal.The latest round of campaign finance reports filed over the weekend with the Federal Election Commission show the stark differences between the two campaigns.In perhaps the major contrast, the disclosure forms show that only 649 of Sanders' more than 1.3 million backers have donated the $2,700 maximum that an individual may give to a candidate to help fund campaigns in primary elections and caucus states. Only 2.3 percent of Sanders' total money raised comes from maxed-out donors. With far fewer total donors, Clinton has tapped out more than 23,000 of her donors who have given to her campaign committee all that the law allows for the primary election and may donate no more. Her maxed-out donors provided nearly 60 percent of the primary money raised for her campaign committee.Another way to gauge support is to examine donations of $200 or more, the legal threshold for which donations must be itemized in FEC reports. In Clinton's case, 83 percent of her money came from donors who gave more than $200. In contrast, only 26 percent of the money raised for Sanders came from donors above the $200 threshold.Tallying contributions from small donors is another yardstick that campaign finance analysts examine. Sanders reported more than $23.4 million in fourth quarter donations of less than $200. That's out of a total $33.6 million raised in the last quarter of the year. Despite an aggressive online campaign designed to jack up the number of her small donors, Clinton's total take for her campaign committee in the last three months of 2015 in un-itemized donations totaled only $5.7 million of her more than $38 million total haul for the quarter.Sanders' small-dollar donors continue to be the financial backbone of his campaign. Last month alone, nearly $21 million was donated to him. The money came in the form of 812,012 separate contributions averaging only $26 apiece. That brought the total number of donations since Sanders launched his campaign last April 30 to more than 3.3 million, a record for any presidential candidate at that point in a campaign.Clinton has been criticized for her heavy reliance on donations from Wall Street and other special interests. For example, she left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm.

Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.Under Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.The measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments. This year, for only the third time in four decades, seniors on Social Security did not receive a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.The proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans.

He called for pay equity for women, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, moving to a Medicare-for-all health care system and strengthening Social Security. He outlined bold steps to combat climate change. He advocated reforms in the criminal justice system and spoke out for immigration reform.On foreign policy, Sanders said he had been ""lectured"" by critics in recent days about his relative experience compared to the former secretary of state. He drew perhaps the loudest applause of the day when he cited his vote against invading Iraq. ""I was right and Hillary Clinton was wrong,"" he said to cheers.In the final days on the campaign trail before Tuesday's first-in-the-nation presidential primary, Sanders noted that he had climbed from far behind in New Hampshire polls last spring and is now ahead of Clinton in the state where she defeated then Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.He had stressed in an interview earlier Sunday on WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, that he believes the results on Election Day will be tight. ""We think it's going to be a close election, we're working really hard,"" Sanders told Jake Tapper in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 8, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Campaign Statement on Clinton Falsehoods,"MANCHESTER, N.H.  Bernie Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, issued the following statement in response to false claims by the Clinton campaign:""It is very disturbing that, as the Clinton campaign struggles through Iowa and New Hampshire, they have become increasingly negative and dishonest. No, Bernie Sanders will not dismantle health care programs in America. He believes in health care for all. No, Bernie Sanders is not 'attacking' Planned Parenthood. He believes Planned Parenthood is an outstanding organization and wants to increase its funding. No, Bernie Sanders is not 'protecting' the gun lobby. He has a D- record from the NRA.""Today's attack from Secretary Clinton, whose super PAC received $15 million from Wall Street, is even more absurd. Bernie Sanders, who has never accepted corporate PAC money in his life, is now accused by Secretary Clinton of taking 'about $200,000 from Wall Street firms.' How do they reach that false and absurd conclusion? They assume that every nickel Bernie Sanders received from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for his Senate campaign came from Wall Street. That is obviously preposterous.""Bernie appreciates the help he has gotten from the DSCC, whose funds come from millions of Americans' individual contributions, labor organizations, environmental groups, women's organizations and others. To say that every nickel that Bernie received came from Wall Street is beyond preposterous. It is laughable and suggests the kind of disarray that the Clinton campaign finds itself in today."""

""There would be nothing that would give me greater pleasure than in fact beating Donald Trump.""American voters back Sanders over Republican White House hopefuls by as much as 10 percentage points, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released last Thursday. Sanders led Trump by six points. Hillary Clinton, in sharp contrast, trails or ties leading Republicans. The Quinnipiac poll found Clinton edged Trump by only 1 percent.  ""It's certainly Sen. Bernie Sanders' moment. The Vermont firebrand leads all potential GOP rivals in raw numbers and raw emotion with the best scores for favorability and several key character traits,"" Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a news release. The independent pollster said Sanders has the highest favorability rating of any candidate and the highest scores for honesty and integrity, for caring about voters' needs and problems and for sharing voters' values.At the biggest South Carolina rally ever for Sanders, he also talked about how he overcame long odds to tie Clinton in Iowa on Feb. 1, defeat her by 22 points in New Hampshire on Feb. 9 and finish much closer than expected in Saturday's Nevada caucuses. ""A lot has changed in the last nine months,"" Sanders said.The growing momentum for his campaign also has been reflected in growing financial support. ""One of the most amazing things that has happened in a very long time in American politics is that over the past nine months what we have seen is that our campaign has received 4 million individual campaign contributions.

""We have in America today a broken criminal justice system. We should not be having more people in jail, largely African-American and Latino, than any other country on earth.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 22, 2016",Press Release - Sanders' Record vs. Clinton's Rhetoric,"SOUTH BOSTON, Mass.  Contrasting his record and her rhetoric, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday laid out key differences with Hillary Clinton in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.""People need to know the difference between hastily-adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and long-held ideas of the candidates,"" Sanders said during a news conference at a labor union hall. He spelled out differences with Clinton on trade policy and talked about the difference between his people-powered campaign and her Wall Street-bankrolled Super PAC.  He called for overturning the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United. The disastrous 2010 decision led to creation of super PACs, like Clinton's Priorities USA, which take unlimited sums from millionaires and billionaires. There is what Sanders called ""a very profound difference"" between his campaign  funded by more than 4 million individual donations averaging $27 apiece  and Clinton's super PAC, which in the last half of 2015 raised $25 million from powerful special interests including $15 million from Wall Street.""Now I know that every candidate who has ever received special-interest money always says that the millions of dollars they receive will never influence them. Never, never, never. Well, Americans need to ask a simple question. If these contributions from powerful special interests have no influence over the candidates, why are they making huge campaign contributions?"" Sanders asked.  On trade, Sanders welcomed Clinton's new-found resistance to a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal but noted that she was sympathetic to it in the past and favored other bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade pacts promoted by multi-national corporations have contributed to the shutdown of 60,000 U.S. factories and resulted in the loss of good-paying jobs in the United States. While Clinton may have shifted stands recently, Sanders noted that Thomas Donahue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted she would do another about-face and support the business-backed deal if she wins the White House.  At the same news conference, Sanders was endorsed by People's Politics, a grassroots group that fights for racial and economic justice.""I hold many identities within me,"" Maria Elena Letona, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, said. ""I am an Afro-Latina, immigrant, woman. Like me, no one in our country is simply one thing. The crisis we face today is complex. We need a leader who won't separate economic inequality from the fight to end racism. We need a leader who represents us as a whole people. The promise of Bernie Sanders' campaign is that the political revolution is big enough for all of us.""Organizations with leaders participating in People's Politics include Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, Maine People's Alliance, Vocal-N.Y. Action Fund, Community Voices Heard Power of New York and SouthWest Organizing Project Action of New Mexico. Organizations with leaders in People's Politics who have already endorsed Sanders include The Reclaim Campaign/The People's Lobby of Illinois, Rights and Democracy of Vermont and New Hampshire and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, have already endorsed Sanders bid for the White House.Sanders flew to Massachusetts for the news conference here and a rally in Amherst after campaigning in South Carolina, where Democrats vote on Saturday.

Velasquez Institute.The institute's detailed analysis was conducted after Hillary Clinton's campaign disputed entrance poll numbers by discounting the impact of high turnout by younger Latino voters in Saturday's Nevada precinct caucuses.""We note that some analysts have said that Secretary Clinton's victories in heavily Latino precincts proved that she won the Latino vote. However the methodology of using heavily Latino or 'barrio' precincts to represent Latino voting behavior has been considered ineffective and discarded for more than 30 years due to non-barrio residential patterns common among Latino voters since the 1980's,"" said Antonio Gonzlez, the president of the non-partisan organization whose purpose is to conduct research aimed at improving the level of political and economic participation in Latino and other communities.""Simply put there is no relevant statistical inconsistency between Edison's Entry Poll results for Latinos, Whites, and Blacks and the overall election results. Based on this fact WCVI concludes that there is no statistical basis to question the Latino vote breakdown between Secretary Clinton and Sen. Sanders.""""It is not surprising that we received the support of the Latino community in Nevada, especially since the majority of those that turned out were young Latinos,"" said Erika Andiola, a Sanders spokeswoman. ""We have consistently seen that the under-35 age group overwhelmingly supports Sen. Sanders, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. It's also important to remember that young Latinos live all across Nevada and not just in Clark County.""According to the Census Bureau, the Latino population in Nevada is 10 years younger than the national average.""For months, as Sen. Sanders has traveled across the country, we have seen that the more people get to know him and learn about his consistency and what he stands for, the more people support him. This was certainly the case in Nevada as well where we saw a huge shift in support after he started spending time in the state and staff and volunteers mobilized to amplify his message,"" Andiola said."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 24, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Addresses Poverty in South Carolina,"COLUMBIA, S.C.  Bernie Sanders on Wednesday detailed proposals to reduce poverty in the United States and he attributed the increase in part to a 1996 welfare reform bill which he opposed at the time as ""an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities and immigrants.""""The United States today has the highest poverty rate of nearly any major country on earth because almost all of the new wealth and income is going to the people on top,"" Sanders said at the news conference. ""The poor remain invisible, powerless, not heard from. Most don't even vote,"" he added.Sanders said 21 percent of children in the United States and 37 percent of African-American children live in poverty. In South Carolina, the childhood poverty rate overall is greater than the national figure. The 27 percent overall rate in South Carolina includes 138,000 black children and 34,000 Hispanic children.  Sanders said one reason for the increasing numbers of poor Americans is the 1996 bill he opposed and Hillary Clinton supported. ""What welfare reform did in my view was to go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,"" Sanders said. ""During that period, I spoke out against so-called 'welfare reform' because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable. Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on 'welfare reform.' She strongly supported it and worked hard to round up votes for its passage.""To address poverty in the United States today, Sanders called for the federal minimum wage to be lifted from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour. He proposed a youth jobs program to create 1 million jobs for young Americans, and urged support for a $1 trillion, five-year push to put 13 million Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding roads, bridges and railways. He said a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system also would help reduce poverty in the United States.  Sanders was flanked at the news conference by South Carolina State Reps. Justin Bamberg and Joe Neal.According to the latest statistics, 57 percent of children in South Carolina who are of preschool age are not attending preschool. More than 280,000 children are poor. In the state, 168,000 African American children, 159,000 white children and 39,000 Hispanic children are in families where no parent has a full time job."

""But when it really mattered Bernie Sanders was on picket lines opposing NAFTA; Secretary Clinton supported it. Bernie helped lead the effort against permanent normal trade relations with China; Secretary Clinton supported it. Bernie helped lead the opposition against fast-tracking the Trans Pacific Partnership; Secretary Clinton initially brushed it aside as a technical and procedural vote. Bernie has always understood that fast-tracking these disastrous trade deals would pave the way for more lost jobs, more lost factories, and more pain for the middle class.""According to the Economic Policy Institute, Ohio has lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs  31 percent of factory jobs  between 1994 and 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2010, 34,900 jobs had been lost or displaced in Ohio  and about 700,000 in the United States  due to the rise in the trade deficit with Mexico alone since NAFTA was enacted in 1994. The Economic Policy Institute also found that by 2013, 106,400 jobs had been lost or displaced in Ohio  and more than 3.2 million in the United States  due to the rise in the trade deficit with China since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.As president, Sanders will:Not send any trade deal to Congress that will make it easier for corporations to outsource American jobs overseas.Not send any trade deal for approval in Congress that forces American workers to compete with desperate workers in Vietnam who make less than 65 cents an hour.Not send any trade deal to Congress that forces American workers to compete against migrant workers in Malaysia who are treated like modern-day slaves.Not approve any trade agreement that gives foreign corporations the right to undermine American democracy through the disastrous Investor State Dispute Settlement system.Not send any trade deal to Congress that would increase the price of prescription drugs or deregulate the financial services industry.Not approve any trade agreement that includes major human rights violators like Brunei  a country that has announced intentions to stone people to death for the ""crime"" of being gay.Ensure that countries like China and Japan are not able to manipulate their currency.""We challenge Secretary Clinton to make those same commitments,"" Gunnels said. ""Our goal must be to make sure that American-made products, not American jobs, are our number one export."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 25, 2016",Press Release - Poison Water,"FLINT, Mich.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday told a forum here that the city's ""poison water"" is a ""canary in the coal mine"" which demands an emergency response by the federal government coupled with a long-term commitment to rebuild the country's crumbling water systems.""The federal government has to acknowledge that this is an emergency,"" Sanders said. ""We are looking at people being poisoned and perhaps suffering irreversible brain damage. If that's not an emergency I don't know what is,"" Sanders added during the meeting at the Woodside Church.Sanders also cited the need for a massive investment in rebuilding water systems. ""The situation in Flint may be extreme but all over this country our infrastructure is collapsing,"" Sanders said. He has proposed $70 billion over the next five years to rebuild and repair our clean drinking water infrastructure in America, as part of a $1 trillion, initiative to create or support 13-million jobs. He would pay for it by closing tax loopholes that let profitable corporations avoid paying federal income taxes by stashing profits in offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands.Sanders was invited to Flint after a private meeting last Feb. 15 with several Flint residents during a visit to Eastern Michigan University.  Problems with Flint's public water system date to a decision nearly two years ago by a receiver appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. The governor's appointee decided to cut costs by drawing the city's drinking water from the polluted Flint River instead of from Lake Huron.The governor and other state officials knew  but did not acknowledge until last fall  that the river water was corroding pipes and causing lead to leach into the drinking water. The decision not to add chemicals to prevent corrosion of the pipes was made at the direction of the governor's Department of Environmental Quality. The state health department in Michigan apparently knew about elevated lead levels in the blood of children but did not warn the public.Sanders has called for Snyder's resignation over his administration's failure to deal with the lead-poisoning crisis."

Bernie Sanders' campaign manager on Thursday reiterated the senator's reasoning for voting in favor of the Clinton administration's 1994 Crime Bill despite serious reservations. The House version of the bill included a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. Sanders had supported the ban since 1988. The conference committee version included not only the assault weapons ban but also the Violence Against Women Act provisions. Sanders supported these efforts to protect women.In Sanders' statement at the time, he criticized the mass incarceration and death penalty provisions in the bill, saying:""it is also my view that through the neglect of our Government and through a grossly irrational set of priorities, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence.And Mr. Speaker, all the jails in the world, and we already imprison more people per capita than any other country, and all of the executions in the world, will not make that situation right. We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.Mr. Speaker, let us create a society of hope and compassion, not one of hate and vengeance.""During consideration of the bill, Sanders voted six times to weaken or eliminate the death penalty provisions and voted separately against creating new mandatory minimums. Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke strongly in favor of increased incarceration, labeling at risk youth as ""super-predators"" who had to be ""brought to heel.""""When this so-called crime bill was being considered, Bernie Sanders criticized its harsh incarceration and death penalty provisions,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, resorted to dog whistle politics and dehumanizing language. Bernie was right then and he's right now. We need to invest in those communities that have been neglected in this country. Poor communities  more often than not, communities of color  deserve the same opportunities and education that other communities have. Bernie Sanders has always known jails and incarceration are not the answer. Nor is heated rhetoric against young people of any race. You can't throw vulnerable people under the bus just because it's politically expedient."""

To watch the ad, click here.Clinton recently released a plan to double down on natural gas production, which would promote continued fracking and slow the nation's transition to renewable sources of energy.In recent debates, Clinton has denied the influence of money in politics. She has claimed, for example, that it is possible to take on Wall Street while still taking their money. Sanders disagreed and pointed to her detour from the campaign trail in Iowa for a high-dollar fundraiser at a hedge fund, Franklin Square Capital. Franklin Square is a major investor in fracking, the destructive practice of extracting natural gas by pumping secret chemicals into the ground. Wall Street donors pumped $15 million in the last half of last year into her super PAC, Priorities USA.Two weeks after the Clinton fundraiser, her campaign announced that she supports continued natural gas production, which is a product of fracking.""I do not support fracking,"" Sanders said. ""I don't need money from hedge fund managers and I don't want money from those who profit off of the destruction of our planet.""Clinton's support for fracking dates back to her tenure as secretary of state. She set up a wing at the State Department to promote fracking overseas. ""Under her leadership, the State Department worked closely with energy companies to spread fracking around the globe  part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel,"" Mother Jones reported. Sanders supports fracking bans like a law in his home state of Vermont. He also has introduced the most comprehensive climate plan of anyone running for president, including a moratorium on fossil fuels extraction on public lands. He's also proposed a plan to transition all fossil fuels workers into new clean energy jobs through a $41 billion investment to provide benefits, training and support for workers and communities. The plan is paid for by closing loopholes that allow corporations to hide money overseas and by ending subsidies to fossil fuel companies."

""We will win because love trumps hatred,"" Sanders added to cheers from the crowd of some 6,000 supporters.Sanders would give Democrats the best chance at victory in November because he leads by far greater margins than Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups with the real estate tycoon.""The American people do not want a president who insults Mexican, Muslims, women, African-Americans, veterans and basically anybody who does not look like him,"" Sanders said. ""Some of his supporters say they like Mr. Trump because he tells it like it is. Bigotry is not telling it like it is.""Earlier Sunday, Sanders criticized Trump for refusing to disavow David Duke, the ex-Ku Klux Klan leader who has called Trump ""by far the best candidate."" Sanders reacted in a tweet that said, ""America's first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the KKK.""At the Oklahoma City rally, Sanders also highlighted differences with Clinton, his primary rally in the state where a close Super Tuesday contest is shaping up for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.He once again asked the former secretary of state to release transcripts of nearly 100 speeches to Goldman Sachs and other special interests for which she pocketed $21.7 million in fees. ""I think if you're going to get paid $200,000 of a speech it must be a pretty damned good speech and if it's such a good speech you ought to release the transcripts,"" Sanders said.With Oklahoma and 10 other states holding primaries or caucuses in two days, Sanders said his campaign was just beginning and that he intends to be in the race through the California primary in June and on to the Democratic Party national convention in Philadelphia in July.A recent Public Policy Polling survey had Sanders and Hillary Clinton separated by only 2 percentage points in the state where Sanders has been airing TV ads and has opened three campaign offices.The Sunday stop was Sanders' second in Oklahoma in a week. Last Wednesday, nearly 6,900 supporters squeezed into a Tulsa arena while 2,000 more listened on loudspeakers outside.Earlier Sunday, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that she was resigning from her post as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and endorsing Sanders for the Democratic nomination.Watch the video of Senator Sanders asking Secretary Clinton to release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches:"

Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who resigned her Democratic National Committee leadership post in order to back Sanders for president.""There is a clear contrast between our two candidates with regard to my strong belief that we must end the interventionist, regime change policies that have cost us so much. This is not just another 'issue.' This is the issue, and it's deeply personal to me,"" Gabbard said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""Congresswoman Gabbard is one of the important voices of a new generation of leaders,"" Sanders said. ""As a veteran of the Iraq War she understands the cost of war and is fighting to create a foreign policy that not only protects America but keeps us out of perpetual wars that we should not be in.""Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran and member of the Hawaii Army National Guard, also released a video on Sunday explaining her decision to back Sanders.""We need a commander in chief who has foresight and good judgment, who understands the need for a foreign policy which is robust in defending the safety and security of the American people. Who will not waste precious lives and money on interventionist wars of regime change,"" she said. ""Such counterproductive wars undermine our national security and economic prosperity,"" added the veteran of two deployments to the Middle East.""That's why today I'm endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders to be the next president and commander-in-chief of the United States,"" Gabbard said.Like Sanders, Gabbard has been outspoken on the danger that a no-fly zone in Syria, proposed by Hillary Clinton, could drag the United States into another quagmire in the Middle East. She introduced legislation calling for an end to the war to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad and to focus on defeating the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.To endorse Sanders, Gabbard resigned as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee so that she could focus on electing ""a president who will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.""Sanders was in Minnesota on Sunday as part of a campaign swing to some of the 11 states holding primary elections or caucuses this week on Super Tuesday.Watch the video of Gabbard endorsing Sanders:"

Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. ""Our whole state is on fire for Bernie Sanders,"" U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison told the crowd while introducing the U.S. senator from Vermont.In remarks at the Minneapolis Convention Center, Sanders focused on the environment and the need to address the planetary crisis of climate change.He announced his opposition to two proposed oil pipeline projects. Enbridge, Inc.'s Sandpiper and Alberta Clipper pipelines would bring a combined 1.4 million more barrels of oil per day into Midwestern refineries. Sanders compared the projects to the Keystone pipeline which would have shipped crude oil from Canada's tar sands region to refiners along the Gulf of Mexico.""President Obama said when his administration was reviewing Keystone XL that he wouldn't grant approval if the project made climate change significantly worse,"" Sanders said. ""A Sanders administration would direct the State Department to apply that same test to the Alberta Clipper and the Sandpiper, because we need to ensure corporations don't keep wrecking our climate and environment for their own profit.""Sanders' campaign recently released a new television ad on his consistent leadership on climate change issues ranging from Keystone XL to offshore drilling.In recent weeks, Sanders also has drawn a sharp contrast between his proposal to ban fracking and Hillary Clinton's plan to double down on domestic gas production.Sanders has also faulted Clinton for taking campaign contributions ""from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet,"" and argued those contributions undermine her ability to effectively address climate change.""Just as I believe you can't take on Wall Street while taking their money, I don't believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet,"" Sanders said."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - More Dishonest Attacks from the Clinton Campaign,"BOSTON  Hillary Clinton's campaign is once again attacking Bernie Sanders' record, purposefully leaving out the facts and misleading the American people. The latest misinformation campaign implies that Sen. Sanders only opposed the 2007 immigration reform bill because of his concerns about U.S. workers, even though he was fighting that same year to stop corporations from ruthlessly exploiting guest workers.""It is shameful to see the fabrication of facts and reinventing of history,"" Rep. Ral Grijalva said. ""Sen. Sanders is the only candidate in the Democratic presidential race with a detailed immigration plan and a strong, consistent record on immigration policy. This election will be defined by who has the best policy alternatives for the country, not cheap political attacks.""Here is what Sanders said on the floor of the Senate on July 26, 2007:""In addition, according to a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center entitled 'Close to Slavery,' H-2B workers are routinely cheated out of wages; forced to mortgage their futures to obtain low wage, temporary jobs; held virtually captive by employers or labor brokers who seize their documents; forced to live in squalid conditions; and denied medical benefits for on-the-job injuries. Let us not make it worse. Simply put, we must make sure that labor protections for American workers and for foreign workers who are temporarily working in our country  we must make sure these regulations are strengthened, not weakened. Over the long term, I will be introducing legislation to accomplish that goal. But in the interim, we must not take a major step backwards in terms of protecting both U.S. workers and guest workers from unscrupulous employers.""The League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States, criticized the Clinton campaign for its unfair attacks on Sanders' vote on the 2007 immigration reform bill.""I really think it's unfair for Hillary to make an issue of that vote,"" LULAC executive director Brent Wilkes told BuzzFeed News.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, ""The H-2 guest worker program is inherently abusive and should not be expanded in the name of immigration reform.""For a list of some of the groups opposed to the 2007 immigration reform bill see below.The League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States: ""LULAC cannot support a bill that will separate families and lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers,"" said the then-executive director Brent Wilkes in a May 2007 statement.The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement: ""Once Latinos learn of the many onerous provisions included in [this bill] as well as the phony 'legalization' program, support turns into opposition,"" said Gabriela D. Lemus, the then-executive director in a June 20, 2007 statement.The Hispanic Federation: ""Congress has a legislative responsibility to produce immigration reform that is both humane and pragmatic. Unfortunately, as it stands, this bill falls short of what our immigrant community and nation needs and expects,"" said Lillian Rodriguez Lpez, the then-president of this organization in a June 20, 2007 statement.The National Day Laborers Organizing Network: ""The Senate should not accept a bill that will worsen the status quo. We need a bill that will benefit this and future generations,"" said Pablo Alvarado, the then-president of the organization said in a June 20, 2007 statement.The American Immigration Lawyers Association said it ""cannot support enactment of the Senate bill in its current form,"" in a June 2007 statement.The AFL-CIO, Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers, and other unions also opposed the 2007 immigration bill: ""This bill is far from the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that would improve the status quo for either U.S.-born or immigrant workers or their families and, in fact, it is likely to make matters much worse,"" said AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Shooting for $40 Million Month,"FORT COLLINS, Colo.  Bernie Sanders' backers were racing the clock on Monday to raise more than $40 million by tonight's end-of-the-month midnight deadline.To keep up the momentum propelling Sanders' grassroots White House bid, the campaign set the ambitious goal of topping the $40 million mark for February.With one day to go in the month, Sanders' campaign has raised more than $36 million from 1.2 million individual contributions. That sum already makes the shortest month of the year the best yet in the 10-month-old campaign.A $40 million month would be nearly half as much as the $94.8 million Sanders raised since the campaign began last April 30 through Jan. 31, according to the most recent report on file with the Federal Election Commission.The average donation to Sanders recently is about $27, Sanders told a rally on Sunday here in the college town nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. ""That in itself is revolutionary because we can show billionaires we can run a campaign without their money,"" Sanders said.His grassroots fundraising success is a dramatic contrast to other candidates bankrolled by super PACs which may raise unlimited sums from wealthy donors. A super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton, for example, raised $25 million from special interests, $15 million of that sum from Wall Street, in the last half of last year. Sanders has refused to coordinate with a super PAC and he told the rally at Colorado State University's Moby arena that the country's ""corrupt campaign finance system is undermining American democracy.""In TV ads airing for the first time on national television, Sanders connects the dots between campaign cash and how the economic system is tilted to help powerful special interests. ""It's called a rigged economy and this is how it works: most new wealth flows to the top 1 percent,"" Sanders says in one of his first ads running nationwide. ""It's a system held in place by corrupt politics where Wall Street banks and billionaires buy elections. The truth is you can't change a corrupt system by taking its money.""To track progress on the $40 million goal, click here.To watch the TV ad, click here"

Hillary Clinton's Campaign Manager Robby Mook on Tuesday confirmed that Bernie Sanders ""substantially outraised"" the former secretary of state in February. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign announced an impressive $42.7 million raised in the month as the fundraising deadline closed at midnight last night.""Donald Trump is going to have plenty of money to compete in November,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager said. ""It's important that our nominee be able to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to defeat the Republicans in November. Secretary Clinton's reliance on maxed-out mega-donors isn't sustainable and should scare Democrats who want to keep the White House in November.""February marks the second month that Sanders' grassroots donors have outperformed a fundraising machine that was once widely regarded as unstoppable. In January, Clinton's backers donated just $15 million to her campaign, while Sanders' small-dollar donors gave more than $21 million.Clinton's committee has taken the majority of its reported money from maxed-out donors who cannot give again. In fact, about 55 percent of her money comes from donors who cannot give again. More than 99.9 percent of Sanders' donors can give again.In February, Secretary Clinton spent significant time attending an average of more than one high-dollar fundraising event every other day, often leaving the trail to raise money from financial interests in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. But Clinton can't keep up with Sanders' small-dollar fundraising operation, forcing her allied super PAC, which has raised millions from Wall Street, to spend on advertising. Sanders attended zero fundraisers in February, as his campaign brought in 98 percent of its money online, allowing him to spend more time talking to voters about fixing a rigged economy held in place by a broken campaign finance system.The Sanders campaign in total has tallied more than 4.7 million contributions, compared to Clinton's 1.5 million. February's fundraising brings the campaign's total raised this cycle to more than $137 million."

Altogether, 11 states were holding primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday.Sanders and his wife, Jane, cast their ballots at a Ward 7 polling place in Burlington, Vermont, the city where he first won elected office as mayor. ""This is a campaign that is going to the Philadelphia convention in July,"" he told reporters as he left the polling place in a community center.Earlier, a new poll conducted for CNN found Sanders has far better odds than Hillary Clinton of defeating Republican front-runner Donald Trump in this fall's general election. In a head-to-head matchup, Sanders beat Trump by 12 points. Clinton's advantage was only eight points. Sanders also beat U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio by 8 percentage points and U.S Sen. Ted Cruz by 17 points. Clinton loses to Rubio and Cruz in head-to-head matchups in the CNN/ORC poll.""This latest poll confirms what other recent polls show. Bernie Sanders is the strongest general election candidate against the Republicans. Secretary Clinton does worse against Trump and actually loses to two of the top three Republican contenders,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.In another development showing Sanders broad grassroots support, his campaign announced after a midnight filing-period deadline that supporters had donated a record $42.7 million in February. Clinton's campaign manager conceded the senator from Vermont ""substantially outraised"" the former secretary of state during the month. He did not disclose, however, how much was raked in by her super PACs from millionaires and billionaires, Wall Street, Big Oil, the pharmaceutical industry and other powerful special interests."

""Not only are we going to smash Secretary Clinton's personal goal of raising $50 million in the first quarter of 2016, our supporters are putting Bernie on the path to win the nomination.""  Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders' donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that a majority of the money given to Hillary Clinton came from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law.Clinton finished the month on a fundraising tear, holding high-dollar events in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.""Our supporters are a firewall protecting Bernie from the Clinton campaign's wealthiest donors and super PACs,"" Weaver said.

""Well guess what? It doesn't look like she's so inevitable now,"" he said as he was drowned out by cheers in Portland's historic State Theater.Sanders defeated Clinton by large numbers in New England, the Midwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest, parts of the country where Democrats must prevail in November if the party is to retain the White House and make gains in Congress and statehouses.  In New England, Sanders won his home state of Vermont with 86 percent of the vote, a margin so big he locked up the support of all 16 pledged delegates. That put New England solidly in the Sanders' column when the result there is combined with the outcome in neighboring Massachusetts, where a virtual tie on Tuesday left him with 43 pledged delegates to her 45, on top of his 22-point Feb. 9 victory in New Hampshire.Sanders also scored double-digit victories on Tuesday in the Midwest, where he took on Clinton and the Minnesota political establishment and won by 24 points, and in Colorado, where he won by 19 points, and in Oklahoma, where he defeated Clinton by 10 points.The same political pundits who had counted Sanders out since his campaign began 10 months ago interpreted Tuesday's turnout as another signal that Clinton would prevail. So Sanders said he ""was very excited"" when he read in The Washington Post on Wednesday that ""all of the pundits"" once again called the race for Clinton. ""That means we're probably going to win in a landslide,"" he told the 1,784 supporters inside the theater and 650 others who the fire marshal said watched from an overflow area.Maine Democrats will go to caucuses this coming Sunday afternoon. ""If we win Maine, we move another step forward toward a political revolution in this country, a process that not only elects a president but transforms America. That's what this campaign is about,"" Sanders saidSanders also planned a big rally later on Tuesday in Lansing, Michigan. Voters go to the polls next Tuesday in the state, where job-killing trade policies which Sanders opposed and Clinton backed have cost manufacturing jobs and shuttered factories.Sanders began the day in Burlington, Vermont, where he woke up to a ""Hometown Hero"" headline in the Burlington Free Press.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"March 3, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Takes on Climate Change in Nebraska,"LINCOLN, Neb.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders stressed the need for bold action to combat climate change on Thursday at the University of Nebraska where supporters cheered his early and consistent opposition to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project which would have crossed the state.A member of the Senate energy and environment committees, Sanders led opposition to construction of the pipeline to ship crude oil from Canada's tar sands region in Alberta to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico in Texas.""The reality is that if we do not get our act together the problems we have today will become much worse in the future if we do not boldly go forward and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy,"" Sanders said.  Hillary Clinton, Sanders' rival for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, for years avoided taking a stand on the pipeline project, which was under study by the State Department when she was secretary of state.Sanders told the university audience that he opposed the pipeline from the beginning because building it would have encouraged drilling for ""some of the dirtiest oil on the planet"" and promoted the use of the dirty fuel. Too often, massive corporations like TransCanada march into heartland communities and try to seize people's property, just so their CEO's can take home bigger bonus checks. That's wrong and it needs to stop. The government should not allow big companies to take people's land.He cited warnings by scientists that average temperatures on Earth could rise up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century without action to curb climate change.  ""Here is a radical idea. Let's listen to the scientists, not the politicians,"" Sanders told 2,200 supporters who filled the Lied Center for Performing Arts.

Bernie Sanders on Thursday said U.S. trade policies, supported by Hillary Clinton, have devastated Michigan's economy and led to the disappearance of automobile and other manufacturing jobs.""A campaign is not about what you said yesterday. It is about what you have stood for your entire career. On one of the most important issues facing working people, Secretary Hillary Clinton and I have very different points of view,"" Sanders said. ""She was very, very wrong and millions of families across the country have been suffering.""Sanders opposed and Clinton backed trade deals which contributed to the loss of nearly 60,000 factories in the United States and almost 5 million manufacturing jobs over the last 15 years. She supported and Sanders opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement. She supported and Sanders opposed permanent normal trade relations with China. She also recently boasted about her role as secretary of state in brokering a trade agreement with South Korea, which increased the U.S. trade deficit and hurt Michigan auto exports.Today, Sanders is leading the opposition in Congress to a proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership which Clinton once called ""the gold standard in trade agreements."" While she has shifted stands recently, Sanders noted that Thomas Donahue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted she would do another about-face and support the business-backed deal if she wins the White House.Michigan has been hit especially hard by a failed trade policy, which led to the state losing 33 percent of its manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years. Detroit, once the richest city in the United States in the 1960s per capita, today is the poorest. The North American Free Trade Agreement alone led to the loss of 43,000 jobs in Michigan. Permanent normal trade relations with China put another 80,000 Michigan workers out of jobs.No city in the United States has been more devastated by unfettered free trade than Flint, Michigan. Since 1978, General Motors has eliminated more than 72,000 jobs in Flint and moved several factories to Mexico. ""Unfettered free trade turned a prosperous middle-class city, where residents could own a home, raise a family and retire with security, into a place where good jobs are scarce and extreme poverty is high,"" Sanders said. Today, one quarter of Flint residents have an annual income of less than $15,000 and 65 percent of the children live in poverty.""Everyone understands what these disastrous trade agreements are all about. The results are clear. You look at Detroit. Look at Flint. Our trade policies have failed,"" Sanders said. ""The truth is that these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country and they have benefited the CEOs of major corporations.""Joining Sanders at the news conference were Larry Cohen, a former Communications Workers of America president and senior adviser on labor issues; Kevin Mack, an executive board member in Detroit's an IBEW Local 58; and Kim Ward, former American Axel worker and UAW member. ""I loved my job. I was able to provide for my family and put a roof over their heads,"" Ward said. ""We had a good thing going. We raised our family together."" Then the company wanted to slash pay in half and cut benefits. The workers went on strike but eventually made concessions. Still, the company moved the plant to Mexico.

In a video from the Indian TV state NDTV from May 7, 2012, then-Secretary Hillary Clinton told an Indian audience that outsourcing benefited many parts of the United States: ""Well, you know, it's been going on for many years now and it's part of our economic relationship with India, and I think that there are advantages with it that have certainly benefited many parts of our country and there are disadvantages that go to the need to, you know, improve the job skills of our own people and create a better economic environment, so it's, like anything it's, you know, got pluses and minuses.""Following a question from the host about a political ad by President Obama about outsourcing, Secretary Clinton laughingly responds, ""Well, you know, it's an election year . . . .""Her remarks to the Indian audience stand in stark contrast to her comments here in the United States denouncing outsourcing.For instance, in February 2004, Secretary Clinton said, ""I do not think outsourcing American jobs is a new kind of trade . . . and I certainly do not believe it is a good thing.""Congressional Record 2/10/04 Page S769""This new video shows Secretary Clinton says different things to different audiences about outsourcing,"" Jeff Weaver, Bernie 2016 campaign manager, said. ""In the United States she condemns it but when she's in India she says it has benefitted many parts of our country. Secretary Clinton should explain to the people of Michigan how they have benefited from the outsourcing of their manufacturing jobs.""Given the Secretary's long history of supporting job-crushing trade deals it's not a surprise she thinks there are 'pluses' to outsourcing. But to go abroad and just describe it 'as part of our economic relationship with India' is disturbing when so many communities like Detroit and Flint that have been hurt so badly by outsourcing. America workers need a president they can trust to protect their jobs.""Weaver also said the video shows why voters should be allowed to see the transcripts of Secretary Clinton secret paid speeches. ""If she's willing to say positive things about outsourcing when she knows she's on film in India, we can only imagine what she told Goldman Sachs, foreign banking interests, drug companies and other corporate interests in those closed-door speeches she was paid millions to give. Voters deserve to see them.""Full Text of Clinton's remarks on outsourcing is below:The entire video can be found here.The relevant section begins at approximately 51:30.A clip of the relevant section can be found here.Transcript below:Audience: good morning ma'am, I'm also a part of the youth advisory council of the US government. so I have [inaudible] questions the first one is: with the possible cut down on outsourcing, [inaudible] protectionism, and [inaudible, will you do anything] about the jobs? And uhhHost: okay let's take one question at a time so we can get other people to respond.Clinton: So you're talking about outsourcing from the United States to India? Outsourcing from the United States to India? Well you know it's been going on for many years now, and it's part of our economic relationship with India, and I think that there are advantages with it that have certainly benefited many parts of our country and there are disadvantages that go to the need to, you know improve the job skills of our own people and create a better economic environment, so it's, like anything it's, you know, got pluses and minuses.Host: There's a new advertisement in the election campaign of President Obama, that causing a lot of [inaudible hot word?] about outsourcing.Clinton: Well, you know it's an election campaign, and there is an obligation in any election campaignHost: to overstate a little bit?Clinton: Well I'm not overstating I wouldn't go that far, but to talk about what's on people's minds, and you know it's more directed toward the fear that a lot of Americans who were in manufacturing, who don't feel like they have any other job possibilities because they weren't trained for any other job possibilities, so it's a legitimate issue, it needs to be aired, but i think the President has been very clear that he wants to improve our own exports. You know when we're on our way to doubling our exports, he wants to improve education, skills training so that people can have the jobs of the 21st century. So it's fair to talk about but you also have to have a solution that looks at what's really going to work."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"March 4, 2016",Press Release - Sanders at Southern Illinois University Calls for Tuition-Free Public Colleges and Universities,"EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday focused on college affordability as he appealed to St. Louis-area voters on both sides of the Mississippi River in Illinois and Missouri.Both states will hold primary elections on March 15 to vote on their choice for the Democratic Party presidential nominee.Nearly 5,200 people surrounded Sanders in the jam-packed Sam M. Vadalabene Center at Southern Illinois University. Before the rally, the senator went outdoors to address another 2,000 supporters who were still waiting in a mile-long line when the doors were closed.Sanders' stop at the public university in downstate Illinois came as state lawmakers remained gridlocked with the Republican governor over a higher education budget crisis. In his remarks to the mostly-student audience at SIU, Sanders focused on his proposal for tuition-free public colleges and universities.  In the U.S. Senate, Sanders is the chief sponsor of legislation to make 4-year public colleges and universities tuition-free. Under his bill, $70 billion a year in assistance  two-thirds from the federal government and one-third from states  would replace what public colleges and universities now charge in tuition and fees.The federal share of the cost would be offset by imposing a tax on Wall Street transactions by investment houses, hedge funds and other speculators. Read more here. Sanders said the tax on speculation also would help reverse a decades-long trend in the United States where the middle class has shrunk and the wealth and income gap has grown.""In the past 30 years in this country there has been a massive redistribution of wealth,"" Sanders told the university audience. ""The middle class has shrunk. Trillions of dollars have left the middle class and gone to the top one-tenth of 1 percent."""

Bernie Sanders' Policy Director Warren Gunnels on Friday issued the following statement after the Tax Policy Center released an analysis of the senator's tax plan:""U.S.Sen. Bernie Sandersintroduced a bold plan to rebuild the middle class, raise wages and reduce the poverty rate during his presidential campaign. At a time when income and wealth inequality are skyrocketing, Sanders pays for his economic agenda by making Wall Street, large corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes.""Unlike Citizens for Tax Justice, the Tax Policy Center chose to analyze Sanders' tax plan in a vacuum without taking into account the savings the American people would gain under his Medicare-for-all plan. That is misleading.""The analysis from Citizens for Tax Justice found that 95 percent of American households will see their take-home pay go up, not down, under Sanders' Medicare- for-all plan which is paid for by his progressive tax plan.""Citizens for Tax Justice also found that middle class families would see their take-home pay go up by more than $3,200 a year under Sanders' plan.""Not only did the Tax Policy Center fail to estimate the savings the American people will gain under Medicare-for-all, they also fail to count the economic gains that would be achieved by Sanders' plan to rebuild the middle class.""Sanders has a plan to create and maintain at least 13 million jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. It is widely accepted among many economists that rebuilding roads, bridges, drinking water facilities, airports and other infrastructure needs creates jobs for Americans in the short-term while allowing commerce to flow more smoothly in the long-term, a win-win for prosperity in the U.S. The Tax Policy Center did not look at that.""Sanders has a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free that would save the typical middle class family $9,400 a year. Creating a workforce that is more educated and less bogged down in student debt would benefit the economy immensely. The Tax Policy Center did not look at that.""Sanders' has a plan to extend and expand Social Security boosting the income of senior citizens by an average of about $1,600 a year. The Tax Policy Center did not look at Bernie's plan to expand Social Security.""Sanders has a plan to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and to protect the pensions of more than 1.5 million workers. The Tax Policy Center did not look at that.""Sanders' tax plan is the mechanism for achieving universal health care and education, creating jobs, and a secure retirement. Without estimating the benefits the American people would gain under these initiatives, the Tax Policy Center's report is inaccurate and one-sided.""The American middle class has been disappearing for 40-years. This is a big problem that demands big solutions.""The reality is that Sanders' plans will make our tax system more progressive and will make the investments that are key to our future prosperity."""

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Saturday released a powerful new ad featuring the working families of Immokalee, Florida, where workers have been fighting exploitation by the agricultural industry. A five-minute version of the spot will run Thursday nationwide at 8:48 p.m. EST on Univision. It is unprecedented for the Spanish-language network to run an ad this long and it will alter its primetime schedule to accommodate the spot.""I will always fight,"" Udelia Chautla says in Spanish as the ad opens. ""As long as I can see my children happy and well, I will continue fighting to provide them with the best. My children are the motor that drives my life.""Udelia started protesting with the Fair Food campaign in 2010. The campaign asks corporations to pay one cent per pound of tomatoes to provide workers with better pay and benefits.""There were cases of bosses abusing workers,"" Chautla says about working in the fields of southern Florida. ""They would not provide workers with water or restrooms. The bosses would get angry because some of the men wouldn't want to keep working and start hitting them. At night, I would cry sometimes because what you earn isn't enough. It affected my children because I didn't have enough to buy food.""""They don't understand what we have to live through,"" she says of the bosses. ""We have families.""In 2008, Sanders traveled to Immokalee and met with migrant workers who were being ruthlessly exploited. They were being paid starvation wages for backbreaking work and denied basic rights. After the visit, Sanders invited leaders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers to Washington to testify during a Senate committee hearing regarding abusive labor practices. As a result of the tremendous grassroots effort of this coalition, working conditions in Immokalee improved and workers received a wage increase.""Bernie Sanders took interest in the lives of the workers and wanted to hear their struggles,"" Udelia says. ""Politicians never came to Immokalee. He didn't keep silent about what he witnessed here in Immokalee.""""There are now more rights and worker support,"" Udelia says of life in Immokalee after the committee hearings. ""We started to see changes in our wages. It really improved our lives. I could buy small things for my children. This changes a person.""""But how many more Immokalees are there?"" Sanders says as the video closes. ""How many fields or factories are there? We have to ask ourselves 'who benefits from this exploitation?' And to understand that it is not only the Immokalee workers who suffer but every worker in America because that pushes us in a race to the bottom.""As president, Sanders would fight to end exploitation of migrant workers and work to enact immigration policy that stops the criminalization of communities of color and keeps families together.

Bernie Sanders on Saturday blasted ""crazy"" Republican proposals to cut or privatize Social Security and said Hillary Clinton was ""vague"" about how she would strengthen the retirement program.Sanders' comments came during a news conference to announce a major endorsement for his White House bid by the National Union for Social Security Workers, an affiliate of the American Federation of Government Employees.""Republicans think we should either privatize Social Security or make massive cuts. Can you imagine somebody talking about cutting Social Security?"" he asked during the news conference. He branded Republican proposals to cut benefits ""crazy,"" ""unconscionable"" and ""wrong"" and concluded, ""We will not let that happen.""Asked about Clinton's stand on Social Security, Sanders contrasted her ""vague"" comments to his specific legislation to increase benefits and lift the cap on income subject to the payroll tax. ""That is not Secretary Clinton's position. Frankly, I have no idea what her position is. She talks in vague terms,"" Sanders said.Sanders has challenged Clinton to support his legislation, which is patterned after a proposal advanced in 2008 by then U.S. Sen. Barack Obama when Clinton challenged him for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.Sanders' bill would ensure that Social Security would be able to pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 58 years. His plan would increase benefits by more than $1,300 a year for seniors with less than $16,000 in annual income. He also would boost yearly cost-of-living adjustments by making the consumer price index better reflect seniors' rising costs for health care and prescription medicine.To shore up the retirement program's trust fund, he would lift the cap on taxable income so everyone who makes more than $250,000 a year would pay the same percentage of their income into Social Security as middle-class working families.""We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world,"" he told reporters and workers watching the news conference. ""At the same time, millions of seniors, disabled veterans and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. You know what? You cannot survive on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.""We are not going to cut Social Security. We are going to expand Social Security,"" Sanders stressed.Sanders was introduced at the news conference by Dana Duggins, executive vice president of the National Union for Social Security Workers. She praised him as ""a champion for Social Security"" who fought to preserve the program throughout his career in Congress. Sanders, she added, ""will be the best champion of Social Security as president of the United States.""

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"March 10, 2016",Press Release - Sanders in Florida Puts Focus on Climate Change and Offshore Oil Drilling,"TAMPA, Fla.  Bernie Sanders' campaign on Thursday contrasted his consistent record opposing offshore oil drilling with Hillary Clinton's support for a bill that allowed more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.With Sanders scheduled to address a rally here tonight in this Gulf of Mexico coastal community, his campaign cited the 2006 vote on the gulf drilling bill. Sanders, then a member of the House, voted against the legislation. Clinton, then a senator, voted for the bill. After the bill passed, the oil giant BP obtained a permit to drill in the area where one of its rigs exploded in 2010, killing 11 workers and causing a catastrophic spill of of 130 million gallons of oil into the gulf.Like her shifting stands on other issues, Clinton more recently has signaled opposition to offshore drilling.Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, said the senator opposed the Gulf of Mexico offshore drilling bill because of the risk of environmental contamination to coastal communities. In addition, Briggs said, Sanders also strongly believes the United States must lead the world in taking bold measures to combat climate change.Sanders touched on climate change during speeches at rallies in Kissimmee, Florida, where more than 5,200 supporters showed up at the outdoors Osceola Heritage Park, and at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where the crowd count topped 5,800.Saying climate change already is ""doing devastating harm in this country and around the world,"" Sanders said the future widespread devastation would occur ""if we don't have the guts to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and tell them their short-term profits are not more important than the planet we intend to leave to our children and grandchildren.""He also called at the Kissimmee rally for an end to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Clinton recently released a plan to encourage natural gas production using the controversial technique of injecting water and chemicals into the ground.The Florida peninsula is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because of rising sea levels that scientists say threaten nearly one-third of the state's Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico coastal areas.As part of Sanders' bold agenda on climate change, he has co-sponsored a Senate bill to end fossil fuel extraction from public lands, including along the Atlantic continental shelf. He supports a carbon tax on oil, gas and coal to discourage burning the fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gas emissions which scientists say could cause the planet to warm by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century."

Meanwhile, the city has continued to pay bankers who lured the school system into a risky investment in an exotic debt-financing scheme.""The city of Chicago should sue these banks for fraud and put public pressure on these wealthy bankers to protect Chicago's most precious asset  its children,"" Sanders said at a news conference three days before Illinois voters go to the polls in a primary election.""The reality is that there wouldn't be a budget shortfall if the city of Chicago had refused to pay Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America over $500 million for risky financial schemes that were marketed as a way to finance the public school system,"" Sanders added.The budget crisis was caused by switching from traditional fixed-rate bonds to the high-risk securities, according to a Chicago Tribune investigation. ""This is a disaster for communities in Chicago, for communities of color and for the children of this city,"" Sanders said.Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has put the state in a similar bind.

Altogether, the committee reported raising $25 million from wealthy special interests in the last half of last year. He's raised funds instead mostly online from more than 5 million donations averaging less than $30 apiece.Sanders also touched on foreign policy. He called the 2003 vote to go to war in Iraq ""one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the history of our country."" He voted against the resolution authorizing the invasion.

""You don't go around saying that it's ok to beat somebody up and I'll pay the legal fees,"" Sanders told a boisterous but peaceful rally of 7,500 at Ohio State University.Trump claims he doesn't condone violence but on Sunday said he may cover legal costs for a man charged last week with assault and battery for sucker-punching a protester at a Trump rally.

""I'm sorry to have to tell you that Secretary Clinton has had a very different position on trade,"" Sanders said. ""She supported trade agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs while corporate America has made huge profits.""When Clinton was secretary of state she praised the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership as the ""gold standard"" for such pacts, but on Saturday she called for vague revisions in the deal with 12 Pacific Rim nations. ""That's fine,"" Sanders said, ""but it doesn't go anywhere far enough. Our job is to kill this disastrous trade agreement and start all over creating trade agreements that work for workers in this country and poor people abroad, not just the CEOs of multi-national corporations.""Meanwhile, Sanders reached out to young voters here and elsewhere after an Ohio judge ruled last Friday that 17-year-olds could cast ballots in the presidential race.

Assessing the Democratic Party nomination contest, pollster J. Ann Selzer said Sanders ""is the one Democrats see as looking out for them  meaning he will build a stronger middle class at the expense of Wall Street. They trust him to do it. In the end, Hillary Clinton has a trust problem."" The poll, for example, found Democratic primary voters by a better than 2-to-1 ratio said Sanders would fight harder than Clinton for the middle class and do the most to rein in the power of Wall Street. More than 60 percent said Sanders cares most about people like them and regard him as the most honest and trustworthy candidate. Only a quarter said that of Clinton.The new poll came two days after Sanders won 21 more delegates than Clinton in three Western states on Tuesday.In Idaho on Thursday, Sanders picked up endorsements from Democratic Party Chairman Bert Marley and Pete Gertonson, a national DNC committeeman.

It's very clear from research done by Greenpeace that she's not just receiving money from 'individuals' who happen to work in the oil, coal and gas industry. Fifty-seven lobbyists from the industry have personally given to her campaign and 11 of those lobbyists have bundled more than $1 million to help put her in the White House.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 1, 2016","Press Release - Clinton's Close Ties to the Oil, Coal and Gas Industry","NEW YORK  The Clinton campaign on Friday held a conference call with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to discuss Secretary Hillary Clinton's record on clean energy and climate change.Unfortunately, the Clinton campaign left out some important facts.In 2001, Clinton voted to kill a measure backed by most Democrats and spearheaded by Sen. Bill Nelson that would have restricted drilling off the coast of Florida. Sanders voted for the restrictions.During the 2006 election, Clinton accepted $74,000 from oil and gas interests while running for re-election that year. According to a scorecard of Senate votes compiled by the League of Conservation Voters, Clinton cast two votes in support of 2006 legislation to vastly expand drilling in the Gulf. Those votes put her on the opposite side of then-Sen. Barack Obama. That same year, Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against a measure in the House of Representatives to expand offshore drilling.During the 2008 election cycle, she was the 6th largest recipient of oil and gas money in the Senate.A year later, as secretary of state, she approved the Alberta Clipper, a tar sands pipeline that Sen. Sanders opposes.The Clinton-led department said the pipeline would ""advance a number of strategic interests."" Environmental groups such as Earthjustice told Reuters: ""It means large amounts of more air pollution, large amounts of water pollution and extra [greenhouse gases] because more energy is required to convert this [heavy oil] into a refined, usable petroleum product.""In 2010, SecretaryClinton remarked that she was ultimately ""inclined to approve"" Keystone XL, a pipeline that would transport tarsands oil from Canada. During the campaign, after strong opposition from environmental organizations, Secretary Clinton eventually came out in opposition to the Keystone Pipeline, not because of her concerns about climate change, but because she viewed it as a ""distraction.""During her time leading the State Department, the agency also signed the ""U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement,"" a deal it said would help energy companies expand offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The State Department said the pact would help energy corporations expand offshore drilling and ""unlock areas for exploration and exploitation"" in locations between the two countries. The agency said the deal will make ""nearly 1.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf more attractive"" to energy companies.In her 2016 bid, Clinton has relied on a slew of current and former advocates for the oil and gas industry for fundraising support, including Tony Podesta, the brother of Clinton's campaign chairJohn Podesta. As recently as this year, Tony Podesta has lobbied for BP, the company responsible for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. He has also lobbied for a company partly-owned by ExxonMobil. Podesta has raised over $130,000 for Clinton's campaign, according to federal election records. According to public filings, approximately one in 15 dollars given to Priorities USA Action, a Super PAC coordinating directly with SecretaryClinton's campaign, came from oil, gas and coal interests.Oil and gas companies have contributed more than $700,000 to Clinton's campaigns throughout her political career, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.""Bernie believes it is critical that the next president acts to curb the worst effects of climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""He also believes you cannot take on an industry if you take their money. If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine.

""Let us have the largest voter turnout in Wisconsin primary history,"" he added to roaring cheers from the record-breaking capacity crowd.The stop here was part of a five-day campaign march across Wisconsin before Tuesday's Democratic Party primary contest with Hillary Clinton. ""Let the world know that Wisconsin is prepared to go forward with a political revolution,"" Sanders said.During the hour-long speech, Sanders contrasted his and Clinton's stands on fracking, campaign finance reform, trade agreements and health care. Sanders is the candidate with the most consistent track record of taking on special interests and fighting for the middle class and working families. ""Together we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent,"" he said at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire's Zorn Arena.Sanders also is the candidate with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump and other Republican White House hopefuls. Polls in Wisconsin and nationwide consistently have shown Sanders defeating Trump by margins much greater than Clinton. ""Not only will we defeat Donald Trump, we will defeat him by a large margin,"" Sanders said. ""The American people will not elect a president of the United States who insults Mexicans and Latinos, who insults Muslims, who insults women and veterans, who insults the African-American community.""Wisconsin historically has been a watershed event in the Democratic Party's primary schedule. Since 1960, with only one exception, the winner here has become the party's standard bearer.Some pundits have pointed to the state's progressive tradition to explain why Clinton has slipped behind Sanders in recent polls. In fact, however, Wisconsin Democrats frequently have favored establishment candidates. Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Jimmy Carter, for example, all won Wisconsin primaries in contests with more progressive rivals."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 4, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Wows Wisconsin,"MILWAUKEE  Drawing bigger Badger State crowds than any other presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders spoke to supporters at a rally here on Monday that pushed the total turnout at Wisconsin campaign appearances this week to more than 38,000 supporters.For more than a week Sanders crisscrossed the state making stops in Eau Claire, Onalaska, Wausau and other cities. His push to win Tuesday's Democratic Party presidential primary began a week ago Saturday in Madison, the state capital, where a big and boisterous University of Wisconsin crowd welcomed him to the state fresh off landslide victories in Washington, Alaska and Hawaii.In Monday night's speech at the Wisconsin Convention Center, Sanders spoke about the momentum behind his grassroots campaign which won six of the last seven contests. ""Not only have we won them, we've won every one by landslide victories and tomorrow if there is a good turnout in Wisconsin, if there is a record-breaking turnout in Wisconsin, we are going to win here as well.""Sanders said he would have the best chance to keep the White House for Democrats this fall. ""We beat Donald Trump by huge margins,"" he said citing national polls and a survey last week in Wisconsin. He held a 20-point edge over Trump in a recent CNN poll and was up on the Republican front-runner by 19 points in a Wisconsin survey. ""And our margin against him is greater than Hillary Clinton's,"" Sanders said.Two major milestones were marked during the week.The campaign announced on Friday that supporters contributed a record $44 million in March and that since the campaign began 11 months ago more than 6.5 million contributions had been made from 2 million donors.And then on Sunday, Sanders crossed the 1 million mark in total attendance at his rallies, town meetings, house parties and other campaign events since he launched his White House bid last May 26 at an outdoor rally on the banks of Lake Champlain in the city where his career of public service began in 1981 when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. On Monday alone in Wisconsin the U.S. senator from Vermont spoke in trade-battered Janesville, headlined a mid-afternoon rally in Green Bay and ended the day on the campaign trail with the speech to 2,400 in the state's biggest city on the shore of Lake Michigan.Wisconsin plays a major role in presidential politics. The winner of Wisconsin's primary has gone on to secure the Democratic Party presidential nomination in every presidential election year but one since 1960. ""Wisconsin has played an enormously important role in determining who the president of the United States will be,"" Sanders said."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 4, 2016","Press Release - Clinton Support for Corporate Trade Deals Hurt Wisconsin Workers, Sanders Says","JANESVILLE, Wis.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday came to this trade-battered city to talk about how job-killing international trade deals backed by Hillary Clinton have hurt Wisconsin workers and put profits over people.General Motors in 2008 idled its manufacturing plant here and moved the factory to Mexico. That threw 2,800 Wisconsin workers out of decent-paying jobs at the plant which opened in 1919. The factory was the oldest GM plant in the United States when it was shuttered.As a member of Congress, Sanders was a leader in the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hillary Clinton supported the bad trade deal that was enacted in 1994. He fought and she backed normalized trade with China and other international trade pacts.""I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,"" Sanders told the crowd at a United Automobile Workers union hall named for the mid-century labor leader Walter Reuther. ""Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one,"" Sanders added.On the campaign trail, Clinton recently has spoken in broad generalities about a recovery of manufacturing in the United States. ""Maybe she should have been there 20 years ago when we started hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs in this country, largely because of disastrous trade deals,"" Sanders said.The North American Free Trade Agreement cost the U.S. 850,000 jobs, including more than 14,000 in Wisconsin. Normalized trade with China cost the U.S. 3.2 million U.S. jobs, including some 68,000 in Wisconsin. Sanders opposed both deals. Clinton supported them.I'm not a candidate who goes to the unions, goes to workers and then leaves and goes to a fundraiser with Wall Street. You are my family. I have worked with unions for my entire life. That is what this campaign is about. That is what I've been about my whole life. --Sen. Bernie SandersSanders cited other recent examples of companies shipping jobs and moving factories overseas, costing thousands of good-paying Wisconsin jobs.Just last January, Strattec Security in Milwaukee announced that it would build a manufacturing plant to make car door handles in Leon, Mexico.After Chrysler received an $8 billion bailout from the working people of this country, it shut down the Kenosha Engine Plant in 2009. The company moved the plant to Saltillo, Mexico, where workers are paid a fraction of what they make in Kenosha. Eight hundred decent-paying jobs were lost. Fifteen years ago, Briggs & Stratton was Wisconsin's largest private employer with 11,000 manufacturing workers. Today, it only has 2,500 workers in Wisconsin after it moved plants to Mexico and China.Master Lock and Tower Automotive now employ more workers in Mexico than Wisconsin. And Rockwell Automation has slashed its union workforce in Milwaukee from 6,000 down to just 300 as it moved plants to Mexico, China, and the Dominican Republic.Sanders consistently has fought job-killing trade deals. In Congress today, he is leading opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal that Clinton, as secretary of state, called the ""gold standard"" for trade agreements."

Sanders has accepted another invitation to debate Hillary Clinton in New York. We are glad that she finally has agreed,"" said Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman. ""Sanders all along has pressed for a debate on television in prime time so the greatest number of New Yorkers and Americans may listen to the candidates and decide for themselves who has the best ideas about how to reform our rigged economy and the corrupt campaign finance system. It's great for the people of New York that there will be a debate in Brooklyn, something that the Clinton campaign has long opposed.""Fortunately, we were able to move a major New York City rally scheduled for April 14 to the night before. We hope the debate will be worth the inconvenience for thousands of New Yorkers who were planning to attend our rally on Thursday.""CNN invited Sanders and Clinton to the debate ahead of New York's April 19 Democratic Party primary election. Sanders previously accepted NBC's invitation to a prime-time debate next Sunday.

""Momentum is starting a campaign 60 to 70 points behind Secretary Clinton"" and ""momentum is national polls in the last weeks that had us 1 point up or 1 point down,"" he told the rally at a University of Wyoming auditorium.""Momentum is we are defeating Donald Trump by very significant numbers,"" Sanders added, ""and in almost every instance our margin over Trump is wider than Secretary Clinton's."" After Saturday's Wyoming caucuses the next stop in the race for the White House is New York's April 19 primary in the state where the Vermont U.S. senator and Brooklyn native was born and raised.Sanders' grassroots campaign has been fueled by phenomenal support from more than 2 million donors who continue to set campaign finance records. In March alone, donors contributed $44 million, almost all of it in small amounts averaging less than $30. The total for March was more than any month since the campaign began last April 30 and $15 million more than Clinton raised last month.Clinton hasn't disclosed the fundraising haul by the super PACs backing her bid with unlimited sums from wealthy donors and corporations. Saying super PACs are part of a corrupt campaign finance system, Sanders has refused to coordinate with the fundraising committees invented after a disastrous decision by the Supreme Court opened the floodgates to unlimited campaign cash coming from billionaires and corporations."

Bernie Sanders' spokesman issued the following statement on Tuesday on how the nation's biggest banks would be broken up under a Sanders administration:""Sen. Bernie Sanders and Secretary Clinton have very different points of view on how to reform Wall Street and the largest financial institutions in this country.""Sen. Sanders believes that it is necessary to break up large financial institutions not only because we need to prevent another Wall Street bailout, but because of the incredible concentration of ownership and power that now rest with a handful of these huge institutions. In fact, the six largest financial institutions in this country now have assets equivalent to more than 56 percent of our nation's GDP, issue two thirds of the credit cards, and one third of the mortgages. ""Electing Sen. Sanders as president would send a clear message to financial regulators that they need to do everything within their power to break up financial institutions so that they can no longer threaten the financial well-being of the American people.""Here's how he will accomplish that.""Within the first 100 days of his administration, Sen. Sanders will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a ""Too-Big-to Fail"" list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.""Within a year, the Sanders administration will work with the Federal Reserve and financial regulators to break these institutions up using the authority of Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.""Sen. Sanders will also fight to enact a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Secretary Clinton opposes this extremely important measure.""President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Glass-Steagall Act into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton. That is unacceptable and that is why Sen. Sanders will fight to sign the Warren-McCain bill into law."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 7, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Links Clinton to Panama Papers Scandal,"PHILADELPHIA  Responding to Hillary Clinton's attempt to portray him as unqualified for the White House, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders linked her to a trade pact exploited by wealthy individuals and profitable corporations to avoid paying taxes.An investigation by a team of journalists revealed that 214,000 entities throughout the world have used a law firm in Panama to shelter their incomes and profits to avoid paying taxes. The release this week of the documents on offshore financial dealings raised questions over the widespread use of tactics to avoid taxes.Sanders cited the former secretary of state's support of the trade deal as one reason she should not be the party's nominee for president. ""I don't think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has made it easier for wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries,"" Sanders told a rally at Temple University in an auditorium packed with nearly 13,000 supporters.Sanders five years ago led opposition to the Panama trade deal in a Senate floor speech. He predicted that the pact would make it easier for the wealthy and the powerful to stash their cash in Panama to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.Clinton had opposed the deal in 2008 when she was running against then Sen. Barack Obama. But in an about face, she helped push the agreement through Congress when she was secretary of state.""The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election,"" Sanders said on Tuesday in a prepared statement. As president, Sanders said he would terminate the trade deal and investigate U.S. banks, corporations and wealthy individuals who have been stashing their cash in Panama to avoid taxes.Sanders came to Pennsylvania fresh off a win Tuesday in Wisconsin, his seventh victory in the past eight caucuses and primaries. A new national poll release Wednesday put him ahead of Clinton by two points and also showed him ahead of Republican front-runner Donald Trump.Clinton earlier on Wednesday questioned Sanders' qualifications to be president. ""Secretary Clinton appears to be getting a little nervous,"" he shot back. ""She has been saying lately that I am not qualified to be president.""Sanders then ticked off his own list of reasons why Clinton isn't qualified to be in the White House.""I don't believe that she is qualified if she is through her super PAC taking tens of millions of dollars in special-interest funds.""I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC.""I don't think you are qualified if you voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.""I don't think you're qualified if you supported almost every disastrous trade agreement.""I don't think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has gave the green light to wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 7, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Stands with Verizon Workers,"PHILADELPHIA  Ahead of a major address to the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO's annual convention, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday called on Verizon to negotiate a fair contract with workers in the region and addressed the devastation unfettered free trade has brought to the state.""Verizon wants to take American jobs  call center jobs  out of this country and bring them abroad where people will be paid pennies an hour. That is unacceptable,"" said Sanders, who was flanked by members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. ""We are going to have to deal with this corporate greed, which is more concerned with compensation packages for CEOs than about the needs of hard working people who want nothing more than to be able to live in dignity and security and bring their kids up in a decent way.""Both CWA and the IBEW are locked in contract negotiations with Verizon. The company, which books profits of over $1 billion a month, is demanding that workers take pay cuts and reduce health benefits or see their jobs shipped overseas.Unfortunately, that choice is familiar for too many workers in Pennsylvania.The North American Free Trade Agreement cost 850,000 good-paying jobs in the United States, including 26,300 in Pennsylvania. Normalized trade relations with China led to the loss of 3.2 million jobs including 122,600 in Pennsylvania. Sanders opposed both agreements while Secretary Clinton supported them.During the news conference, Sanders cited examples of how bad trade deals have hurt Pennsylvania. In 2013, General Electric announced that it would eliminate 950 jobs at its Pennsylvania locomotive plant in Erie moving many of these jobs to Mexico.Allegheny Technologies shut down two steel plants in western Pennsylvania last year, laying off 600 workers due to a surge in cheap imports from China.Hershey in 2009 shut down its York Peppermint Patties plant in Reading. Three-hundred jobs were lost when the plant was moved to Monterrey, Mexico, where workers are paid a fraction of what they were paid in Pennsylvania.Sony closed the last television manufacturing plant in the United States in 2008 when it closed a Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, plant that employed 560 workers and moved the plant to Baja, Mexico. Sanders has a consistent record in Congress fighting job-killing trade deals.In Congress, he has led opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal that Clinton, as secretary of state, called the ""gold standard"" for trade agreements.Clinton recently signaled that she might seek modifications in the pact, but Sanders has said that's not enough. He's pledged to rewrite the worst trade deals of the last 30 years, including NAFTA. Sanders will also impose countervailing tariffs on imports from China and Japan until they stop dumping steel into the United States and stop manipulating their currencies.Pennsylvania voters go to the polls on April 26 to decide how the state will allocate its 189 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer in Philadelphia."

Sanders, as a young man, spent months in Israel and, in fact, has family living there now. There is no candidate for president who will be a stronger supporter of Israel's right to exist in freedom, peace and security,"" said Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs. ""The path to peace in the Middle East is not an easy one,"" Briggs added. ""As we go forward in this campaign, distorting the truth is not useful. We hope there can be an honest discussion of this important issue.""During a recent New York Daily News editorial board interview, Sanders was asked about the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict. ""Help me out here because I don't remember the figures,"" he said before saying his recollection was that 10,000 Palestinians were killed. He then immediately added, ""Does that sound right?"" The interviewer did a quick search and found that, in fact, more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed and 10,000 were wounded. The United Nations has estimated that 2,104 were killed, including 1,462 civilians. Understanding that his recollection was about the total number of casualties, not the death toll, the senator immediately accepted that correction and the discussion moved on to other topics.""The idea that Sen. Sanders stated definitely that 10,000 Palestinians were killed is just not accurate and a distortion of that discussion,"" Briggs said. ""Bringing peace between Israel and the Palestinians will not be easy. It would help if candidates' positions on this issue are not distorted."""

The senator from Vermont has now won seven out of eight primaries and caucuses.""Sen. Sanders won these recent contests by large and impressive margins,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""As a result, we have cut Secretary Clinton's delegate lead by 101 since March 15, which amounts to one-third of her then-total margin.

In fact, in Nevada Sanders now has a three delegate lead on Clinton.""As we have pointed out since Iowa, the enthusiasm and commitment of Sen. Sanders' supporters will enable us to add delegates to our total in many caucus states as the process moves from precinct to county and then to the final state and congressional district level,"" Weaver said.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 9, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Challenges Clinton on Social Security,"NEW YORK  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called for raising Social Security benefits to help seniors make ends meet. He also urged Hillary Clinton to back a plan endorsed by leading Democrats and seniors' advocates to strengthen the retirement program.Sanders' stops at Bronx Community College and at the United Palace in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood were part of a presidential campaign tour of New York City boroughs.More than 1,000 backers turned out to hear Sanders in Washington Heights and more than 800 supporters in the Bronx packed an auditorium in the Gould Memorial Library and an overflow room at the college.Sanders said seniors in New York and across the United States don't have enough income to heat their homes or feed themselves and many are forced to cut their pills in half to save money on prescription drugs. ""These are the people who built this country  our parents, our grandparents. We should not be treating them that way.""Clinton, Sanders' rival for the Democratic Party nomination, has refused to back Sanders' plan to strengthen Social Security. In fact, Clinton has left open the possibility that she would support raising the retirement age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security. ""I would consider it,"" she told a town meeting in New Hampshire last Oct. 28.In New York, more than 3.5 million seniors, orphans, widows, widowers and disabled people received Social Security benefits last year. The average annual benefit totaled only $15,000.Without Social Security, more than 43 percent of the elderly in New York, including more than 48 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New York is 11.6 percent.Sanders has introduced legislation to make the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.Under Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.The measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments. This year, for only the third time in four decades, seniors on Social Security did not receive a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.The proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. Sanders' plan is patterned after a proposal to scrap the cap first brought forward by President Barack Obama in 2008.According to new estimates from the Social Security Administration, Sanders' plan would extend the solvency of Social Security until the year 2074.The senator from Vermont who was born and raised in Brooklyn was headed later Saturday to a third rally in Queens before capping the day with a nighttime event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem."

Bernie Sanders on Monday contrasted his call for a nationwide ban on fracking to Hillary Clinton's shifting stand on the extreme and risky method of drilling for oil and gas. Sanders also began airing a new television ad on fracking calling him the only candidate for president who would ban fracking everywhere. ""The growing body of evidence tells us that fracking is a danger to our water supply, our most precious resource. It is a danger to the air we breathe. It has resulted in more earthquakes. It is highly explosive. And it is contributing to climate change,"" Sanders told 5,000 supporters inside Veterans Memorial Arena here in the Southern Tier region of New York known as the ""fracking belt."" New York and Sanders' home state of Vermont have banned fracking. There's a moratorium on the drilling technique in Maryland. ""I want to applaud you for standing up to Gov. Cuomo and demanding that New York state ban fracking,"" Sanders told the audience. But he added: ""If we are serious, we need to put an end to fracking not only in New York and Vermont but all over this country.""          The toxic chemicals used in fracking are known to cause cancer and birth defects, he said. ""We cannot, we must not allow our children to be poisoned by toxic drinking water just so a handful of fossil fuel companies can make even more profits,"" Sanders added. Sanders also noted that Clinton promoted fracking overseas when she was secretary of state. He called their records on fracking and other environmental issues one of the ""very important differences"" between the candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. He also noted other differences with Clinton on climate change and the environment. Sanders led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline to transport ""some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet"" from Canada's tar sands region to Gulf Coast refineries. She was a latecomer to opposing the controversial pipeline's construction. He has introduced legislation calling for a carbon tax to discourage use of greenhouse-gas emitting fossil fuels that cause climate change. She doesn't support a carbon tax. He consistently opposed offshore drilling. Clinton has not. He would end leases for the extraction of fossil fuel on public lands. Clinton would not. ""If we are going to leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for future generations we need bold action now,"" Sanders said. Meanwhile, the new TV ad released Monday was called ""No Fracking Anywhere.""  ""Do Washington politicians side with polluters over families?"" asks Susan Sarandon in the 30-second spot. ""They sure do, because Big Oil pumps millions into their campaigns. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere."" According to public records and disclosures, $1 of every $15 contributed to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action came from fossil fuel interests. Lobbyists with deep ties to Exxon, BP and TransCanada have also bundled thousands of dollars for Clinton's campaign directly. ""Bernie,"" the ad concludes. ""He can't be bought by them, because he's funded by you."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 11, 2016",Press Release - Clinton Misfires,"BUFFALO, N.Y.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs issued the following statement after Hillary Clinton blamed Vermont for guns in New York: ""I don't know why Secretary Clinton would be so critical of the governor of Vermont who strongly supports her candidacy. What Gov. Shumlin recently said is true: 'It is campaign season, therefore, things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes aren't entirely accurate. I would just say this, I think you'd have a hard time convincing Vermonters that New York's crime problems are coming from Vermont.'"""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 11, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Draws Big Crowd in Trade-Battered Buffalo,"BUFFALO, N.Y.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders railed against ""corporate greed"" in a speech to almost 11,400 supporters in this city where a once vibrant manufacturing base has been hollowed out. Sanders said job-killing international trade deals backed by Hillary Clinton have shut down manufacturing plants in Buffalo and thrown workers out of jobs that were shifted to Mexico, China and other low-wage countries. Sanders was a leader in the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Hillary Clinton supported it. He later opposed normalized trade with China and other international trade pacts that she supported. ""I voted against every one of these disastrous agreements,"" Sanders said. ""Secretary Clinton supported virtually every trade policy."" It was Sanders' third rally of the day and he drew 8,323 inside an arena at the University of Buffalo. Another 3,060 watched on a jumbo TV screen outside. He stopped earlier in Binghamton and Albany as he campaigns in New York for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Touted as a job creator, NAFTA cost 850,000 jobs in the United States. In Buffalo alone, 31,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 1994, more than one-third of all the factory jobs that once provided decent livings in the metropolitan area. Giving China trade status cost 3.2 million U.S. jobs, including more than 179,000 in New York. Here in this city on the shore of Lake Erie, American Axle shut its Buffalo plant in 2008 and shipped work on the Chevy Camaro to Mexico. Some 740 jobs were eliminated. Motorola in 2003 moved its circuit board plant from Buffalo to Mexico. General Motors Powertrains in 2008 moved another 778 jobs from Buffalo to Mexico where they could pay workers about $3.25 an hour. Buffalo Color was forced to shut its plant in 2003 shortly after Chinese manufacturers began exporting indigo dye into this country at less than half its price. At its height, this company employed 3,000 workers. Niagara Ceramics, the dinnerware manufacturer, in 2013 shut down its plant, throwing 110 workers out on the street because of unfair competition with China. Just last year Chemours, one of the world's biggest producers of titanium dioxide, announced that it would close its plant in Niagara Falls because it could not compete with cheap imports from China. Another 200 jobs were destroyed."

Bernie Sanders said a $5 billion legal settlement with Goldman Sachs over the sale of junk securities before the 2008 financial crisis is the latest evidence that the business model on Wall Street is fraud. ""Goldman Sachs is one of the major financial institutions in our country. What they have just acknowledged to the whole world is that their systemis based on fraud,"" Sanders told an armory packed with supports at one of three rallies as he crisscrossed New York. The deal announced by the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., spared individuals from prosecution. Sanders called that an example of ""the corruption of our criminal justice system."" The settlement involved the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the housing bubble burst and led to the Great Recession.  It is the subject of a TV ad Sanders will begin airing in New York. Goldman ""just settled with authorities for their part in the crisis that put seven million out of work and millions out of their homes,"" the narrator explains. ""Our economy works for Wall Street because it's rigged by Wall Street and that's the problem,"" the ad says. ""As long as Washington is bought and paid for we can't build an economy that works for people."" Sanders has proposed a plan, backed by 170 economists and financial experts, to remake the financial system to serve America's working families.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 12, 2016",Press Release - Clinton's Ties to Wall Street,"SYRACUSE, N.Y.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday questioned Hillary Clinton's financial ties to Wall Street, including $15 million in donations to a super PAC and millions more in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and other firms after she left the State Department. In a campaign for the White House in which Sanders has stressed the urgent need to address rising wealth and income inequality, Sanders has called on Clinton to release the transcripts of the speeches for which she was paid more than $2 million in 2014. ""You can't stand and fight for working families and the middle class if you are dependent upon big-money interests,"" Sanders told 5,045 supporters at Syracuse University. Goldman Sachs is the Wall Street investment banking firm that agreed on Monday to pay up to a $5 billion fine for marketing fraudulent mortgage-backed securities before the housing bubble burst and plunged the nation into the worst recession since the 1930s. Clinton gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs executives in 2013 before she launched her latest bid for the White House. She was paid a total of $675,000. In a new development on the lucrative speaking fees, Yahoo News on Tuesday reported that Clinton ""is plowing an increasingly large amount of her funds"" into her presidential campaign. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that state and federal officials said provisions in the Goldman deal will let it pare as much as $1 billion off the fine through a combination of tax credits and incentives."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 12, 2016",Press Release - Clinton's Credibility Gap,"ROCHESTER, N.Y.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday contrasted his record to Hillary Clinton's stands on Wall Street reform, fracking, a corrupt campaign funding system and job-killing trade deals. Meanwhile, Clinton's credibility was questioned after she blamed Vermont for gun violence in New York. The charge backfired when The Washington Post called her assertion ""significantly misleading."" Even Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Clinton backer, said she was wrong. ""It is campaign season, therefore, things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes aren't entirely accurate,"" Shumlin told Vermont reporters. On a host of other issues, Sanders detailed differences with Clinton during a rally here at Monroe Community College. Sanders faulted Clinton's reliance on Priorities USA, one of her super PACs, which took $15 million in the last half of last year from Wall Street sources. That haul was part of $25 million showered on her by special interests. ""Our job is to stand up to these powerful special interests, not to take their money,"" Sanders said. He doubled down on his call for Clinton to make public the transcripts of closed-door speeches on Wall Street that netted her millions of dollars in speakers' fees after she stepped down as secretary of state. The payments include $675,000 for three paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, which on Monday agreed to pay a $5 billion fine for marketing shady mortgage-backed securities before the housing bubble collapsed. Renewing his call for a nationwide ban on fracking, Sanders said Clinton has tried to masquerade her shifting stand on the extreme and risky method of drilling for oil and gas. ""When she was secretary of state she pushed fracking in countries all over the world,"" Sanders said. ""And she still has refused to come out firmly for a national ban on fracking."" Sanders has launched a new television advertising campaign on fracking calling him the only candidate for president who would ban fracking everywhere. On trade policy, Sanders said job-killing international trade deals backed by Clinton have shut down manufacturing plants across New York and thrown workers out of jobs that were shifted to Mexico, China and other low-wage countries. Sanders was a leader in the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Hillary Clinton supported it. He later opposed normalized trade with China and other international trade pacts that she supported. ""I opposed every one of these disastrous trade agreements. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one. If corporate America wants us to buy their products they damn well better start investing in America,"" Sanders told more than 6,400 supporters at the community college."

Sanders called Roosevelt ""one of the greatest presidents in the history of our country"" and said ""there is a lot we can learn from Roosevelt's life."" The 32nd president ""created a government that stands up for working people, the poor and the sick,"" Sanders added as he toured the grounds of the Springwood estate and paid his respects at the gravesite of the longest-serving president in American history. Roosevelt battled his era's elite. He called them ""economic royalists."" Sanders today calls them the ""billionaire class."" Like Roosevelt in the last century, Sanders has made taking on Wall Street and big banks a centerpiece of his campaign for the White House.  Sanders pays his respects at the gravesite of the longest-serving president in American history. In a 1936 address announcing his second New Deal, Roosevelt spoke about how reckless bankers, Wall Street speculators and business monopolies ""had begun to consider the government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs."" In this year's presidential campaign, Sanders has railed against the recklessness, fraud and illegal behavior of Wall Street bankers who plunged the economy into the most severe economic downturn since Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933.       Sanders' stop at the Roosevelt homestead was a break from the campaign trail ahead of next Tuesday's New York primary. Earlier Tuesday at stops in Rochester and Syracuse, Sanders had criticized Democratic Party rival Hillary Clinton for taking $15 million in campaign donations and millions in lucrative speaking fees from Wall Street bankers and other special interests after she resigned as secretary of state."

""I value a living wage for all Americans. I value a justice system that treats everyone fairly. I value a government which works for all,"" Sanders said.

Bernie Sanders, who rode the subways growing up in New York City, was endorsed on Wednesday by the Transport Workers Union Local 100. The local labor union represents 38,000 workers across New York, including those who operate and maintain the New York City subway system. ""Brothers and sisters, there is no doubt that America needs a jolt, New York needs a jolt, working families need a jolt and business as usual politics are not going to give us the jolt that we need,"" said TWU Local 100 President John Samuelson. ""TWU has been fighting for transport workers for decades. In Bernie Sanders, we see a kindred spirit because Bernie Sanders has been fighting for American workers his entire life."" ""At a time when our middle class is disappearing, when we are seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top one percent, when we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of almost any major country on earth, John is right: it is too late for the same old, same old establishment politics,"" said Sanders. Sanders highlighted his Rebuild America Plan to invest $1 trillion rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and public transit systems over the next five years. The Democratic Party presidential candidate also promised to make sure that public transit systems would be given the flexibility they need to use this federal funding to cover the cost of operating. Sanders also said that he would fight to enact the Workplace Democracy Act and expand collective bargaining rights. This bill, which Sanders introduced last year, will make it easier for workers to join a union by allowing the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards. Sanders' plan also requires companies to begin negotiating within 10 days after certification. If no first contract is reached after 90 days, either party can request compulsory mediation. After 30 days of mediation, the parties will submit the remaining issues to binding arbitration. ""Millions of Americans who want to join unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers,"" Sanders said. ""The benefits of joining a union are clear: higher wages, better benefits and a more secure retirement. If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country."""

Sanders has introduced legislation to break up the nation's biggest banks and restore Wall Street regulations that were dismantled before the financial collapse.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 17, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Details Affordable Housing Plan,"NEW YORK - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders addressed the affordable housing crisis in New York and across the nation Sunday after he toured the New York City Housing Authority's Howard Houses in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and New York City Council Members Jumaane Williams of Brooklyn and Ritchie Torres of the Bronx accompanied Sanders on a walking tour of the low-income public housing buildings. ""This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. People should not be forced to live in dilapidated housing,"" Sanders said afterward. Public housing residents in New York are forced to live with leaky roofs, mold, unreliable heating systems, broken elevators and vermin. The authority provides housing for some 400,000 New Yorkers, but there is a $17 billion backlog in unmet capital needs. Sanders released a plan to address the crisis of affordable housing in America and create millions of good-paying jobs. As president, Sanders would expand the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund  which was created by legislation he authored in 2001  to repair public housing, increase funding for housing vouchers and make it easier to refinance mortgages.                   From the time Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1981, he has made affordable housing a top priority. Then-Mayor Sanders created the first municipally-funded housing trust in the nation, which continues to create home ownership opportunities for families who had been shut out of the market. Sanders stopped in Brownsville after he attended a church service at the First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem and before a Sunday afternoon rally at Prospect Park in Brooklyn in advance of Tuesday's Democratic Party presidential primary.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 18, 2016",Press Release - Clinton-DNC Joint Fundraising Raises Serious Campaign Finance Concerns,"NEW YORK  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Monday questioned ""serious apparent violations"" of campaign finance laws under a joint fundraising deal between Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The questionable dealings were detailed in a letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders' campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. The letter questioned whether the Clinton presidential campaign violated legal limits on donations by improperly subsidizing Clinton's campaign bid by paying Clinton staffers with funds from the joint DNC-Clinton committee. Unlike Clinton's presidential campaign committee, Hillary for America, the joint committee may accept large donations of up to $356,100. The first $2,700 of this amount is eligible for transfer to the Clinton campaign, $33,400 can be transferred to the DNC, with any remaining amount, up to $10,000, to each participating state party. According to public disclosure reports, however, the joint Clinton-DNC fund, Hillary Victory Fund (HVF), appears to operate in a way that skirts legal limits on federal campaign donations and primarily benefits the Clinton presidential campaign. The financial disclosure reports on file with the Federal Election Commission indicate that the joint committee invested millions in low-dollar, online fundraising and advertising that solely benefits the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign ""is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising"" according to the letter to the DNC. Both outlays benefit the Clinton presidential campaign ""by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA [Hillary for America] rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees."" The questionable outlays ""have grown to staggering magnitudes"" and ""can no longer be ignored,"" Deutsch added. The expenditures on advertising and fundraising are at best ""an impermissible in-kind contribution from the DNC and the participating state party committees"" to Clinton's presidential campaign, the letter said. ""At worst, using funds received from large-dollar donors who have already contributed the $2,700 maximum to HFA [Hillary for America] may represent an excessive contribution to HFA from these individuals."" In addition, the joint committee has paid the Clinton campaign committee $2.6 million ostensibly to ""reimburse"" the Clinton presidential campaign staff for time spent running the joint committee. The unusual arrangement, Deutsch said, ""raises equally serious concerns that joint committee funds, which are meant to be allocated proportionally among the participating committees, are being used to impermissibly subsidize HFA through an over-reimbursement for campaign staffers and resources."" ""While the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time  it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 18, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Meets with Puerto Rican Community Leaders,"NEW YORK  At a meeting with leaders in New York's Puerto Rican community, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Congress to prioritize the needs of the people of Puerto Rico over the greed of Wall Street investors when addressing the island's financial crisis. ""We have a major economic and humanitarian crisis"" in Puerto Rico today, Sanders explained. ""Fifty-eight percent of children in Puerto Rico are living in poverty. Today, Puerto Rico has a debt of $73 billion and the solution to this crisis is not more austerity. Congress must act immediately to restructure the debt."" Republicans in Congress have proposed creating an unelected oversight board that would be given the power to make even more cuts to Puerto Rico's budget and raise taxes without the approval of the government. Sanders has rejected the Republicans' proposal, arguing, ""We can not give in to the demands of vulture funds on the backs of those children"" who are living in poverty. Instead, Sanders' plan would grant Puerto Rico the same authority given to every municipality in the United States to restructure its debt under the supervision of a bankruptcy court. Importantly, if any of this debt was issued in violation of Puerto Rico's Constitution, it must be immediately set aside. In addition to addressing the fiscal crisis, as president Sanders said he would create more than 150,000 good-paying jobs in Puerto Rico by enacting a national jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. He would also invest in clean energy on the island to lower fuel costs, create jobs and transition away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The political future of island ""is a decision for the people of Puerto Rico. There should be a referendum to let the people of Puerto Rico decide,"" Sanders said. ""We need to create a government that works for all of us, not the 1 percent."" Sanders roundtable discussion with leaders in New York's Puerto Rican community comes just hours before New Yorkers head to the polls. In just two weeks Sanders has cut Hillary Clinton's lead in half in the state. According to a recent poll conducted by NY1, Latino and Latina voters prefer Sanders over Clinton 55 to 38 percent."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 18, 2016",Press Release - New Video Featuring Mark Ruffalo Highlights Sanders' Brooklyn Roots," NEW YORK  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign on Monday released a new online video highlighting the Democratic candidate's roots and upbringing in Brooklyn. The video features Sanders walking through the Brooklyn College campus where he spent his freshman year, talking with actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo. Over images of Brooklyn from decades ago, Sanders discusses values and experiences gained from growing up in an immigrant community. ""Many of us were the sons or grandchildren of immigrants. And the main shopping area was Kings Highway. And if you went shopping there, you saw would see people who had serial numbers on their arms, which was from Hitler's concentration camps,"" Sanders says. The densely populated and diverse community Sanders grew up in had a large impact on the way he sees the world today. He explains, ""The strength of this country is the fact that we have so much diversity. And I think that we do better when we are a people who appreciate, who love, respect people from all over the world who bring their own values and traditions and become part of the American experience."" Sanders goes on to discuss the lessons he learned from his parents  his father's experience as an immigrant and his mother's desire to provide a better life for her children. Asked about his role in anti-segregation efforts in Chicago, Sanders tells Ruffalo tells that he became involved out of ""a sense of justice."" The video ends with a discussion of Sanders' accomplishments as mayor of Burlington, where he put the city on the path to becoming one of the most progressive cities in America, and his time in Congress where he was dubbed the ""Amendment King"" for his unparalleled record of passing roll call amendments in the House. ""One of the beautiful parts of this campaign,"" Sanders concludes, ""is your dreams and my dreams, you may have thought there were very few of us. Turns out we are the majority of the people in this country. And people now through this campaign, I think, are sensing that they are not alone. And that's a big deal."""

Bernie Sanders' campaign today announced that he has earned the endorsement of United Steelworkers Local 1999, whose members stand to lose 1,400 jobs with Carrier Corporation's decision to ship jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico. ""Bernie Sanders for decades has fought against the kinds of disastrous trade deals that are now allowing Carrier to ship over a thousand good-paying Indiana jobs to Mexico,"" said Local 1999 president Chuck Jones. ""Bernie Sanders is the only candidate running for president who will do something to stop this kind of corporate greed if he is elected  because he's been fighting against it for years. We will be doing everything we can to help him win the primary here in Indiana on May 3."" Sanders previously denounced the decision by Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, to move operations to Mexico. ""The decision by United Technologies to ship 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Mexico is the latest example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers,"" said Sanders. ""In my view, we have got to fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies so that American jobs are no longer our number one export. I was proud to help lead the effort against NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. Unfortunately, Secretary Clinton supported these trade policies which have led to the loss of millions of jobs and thousands of factories."" In the last week, Sanders has also earned the endorsement of Indianapolis City-County Councillors Zach Adamson and Jared Evans. Both cited Sanders' opposition to free trade agreements and Carrier Corp's decision as one of the major reasons for their support.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 19, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Focuses on Jobs and Trade in Pennsylvania,"ERIE, Pa.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday brought his White House campaign and the fight for working families to this city hard hit by the loss of decent-paying manufacturing jobs. This year alone, General Electric has laid off almost 1,400 workers at a plant here. The jobs were shifted to Texas where anti-worker labor laws let the company slash wages in half. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor says the ripple effect of the GE layoffs will affect as many as 18,000 jobs in the region. Before speaking to 2,197 supporters at the Bayfront Convention Center, Sanders met with members of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Local 506, which represents workers at the GE plant. Sanders has singled out GE as an example of ""corporate greed"" for taking advantage of job-killing trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Over the last decade, GE has shut down 10 plants in the U.S., while it opened 58 factories in low-wage countries overseas. Sanders has led the fight in Congress against NAFTA and other trade deals which Hillary Clinton supported. Sanders also has exposed GE as one of the major multi-national corporations which have exploited legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. income taxes. He has introduced legislation that would repeal tax laws that cost the U.S. treasury $100 billion a year in lost revenue. From 2008 through 2013. GE, Verizon and Boeing posted profits totaling more than $102 billion but received income tax rebates from the Internal Revenue Service totaling more than $4.1 billion, according to a report from Citizens for Tax Justice. Sanders traveled to Pennsylvania from New York, where 247 pledged delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention were at stake in a primary election underway on Tuesday. The Brooklyn-born Vermont senator and Clinton were competing in the state that twice elected her to the U.S. Senate and gave her a 17-point victory margin over then Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Monday showed Sanders trailing Clinton nationally by only two points  a virtual tie. When the same poll was conducted in June of last year, the Vermont senator was behind by 60 points. Sanders was headed later Tuesday to State College Pennsylvania for a nighttime rally at Penn State. Pennsylvania Democrats hold their presidential primary in one week along with Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut and Rhode Island."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 20, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Raises Nearly $46 Million in March,"BURLINGTON, Vt.  Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Wednesday filed a report with the Federal Election Commission showing it raised nearly $46 million in March. ""Bernie's grassroots campaign has now out-raised Secretary Hillary Clinton for three months straight,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""We're honored to have the strong support of 2.2 million passionate donors who have given more than 7 million times. It's because of them that our campaign can take on the establishment and win eight of the last ten primaries and caucuses."" In March, Sanders' grassroots campaign received 1.7 million contributions from more than 900,000 individual donors. Sanders' campaign has now raised more than $200 million since he launched his campaign in April 2015, including more than $110 million in the first quarter of 2016. The average contribution for the month was $26.20, just under the long-term average Sanders cites in his stump speech. Unlike other candidates, Sanders' small-dollar donations allow him to run his primary campaign without the help of a Wall Street-funded super PAC. More than 96 percent of Sanders' money comes from donors who have not maxed-out to his primary campaign and can give again. In fact, only 127 donors maxed-out to the campaign in March. Sanders' campaign reported more than $17 million cash on hand."

Bernie Sanders on Thursday welcomed the vice president's support for what The New York Times called Sanders' ""aspirational approach"" over Hillary Clinton's ""caution."" ""I like the idea of saying, 'We can do much more,' because we can,"" Biden told John Harwood during an interview last Friday. ""I don't think any Democrat's ever won saying, 'We can't think that big  we ought to really downsize here because it's not realistic,'"" Biden added. ""C'mon man, this is the Democratic Party! I'm not part of the party that says, 'Well, we can't do it.'""  Biden's comments drew loud cheers from more than 1,400 supporters when Sanders read from the interview at the outset of a rally in suburban Philadelphia. Biden's comments drew loud cheers from more than 1,400 supporters when Sanders read from the interview at the outset of a rally in suburban Philadelphia. It was Sanders' third rally of the day in the state where voters on Tuesday will choose between him and Clinton for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. The Times interviewed the vice president as they rode from Washington, D.C. to Wilmington, Delaware, aboard an Amtrak passenger train. Harwood wrote that Biden likes the idea that Sanders ""is aiming high, regardless of whether the large steps he envisions to narrow income inequality and broaden economic opportunity become realized in the next presidential term."" ""The vice president is exactly right. This is what this campaign is about. It is about having the courage to face the reality of American life today, understanding that it is not always a pleasant, but having the courage to take on the special interests."" Sanders, Greater Philadelphia Expo Center.  ""What it means is having the courage to envision a nation in which we fulfill the potential we know we have. It means we end a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires to buy elections.          ""When we talk about having the courage to address the real issues facing our people, it is about understanding that today we have a rigged economy. ""Thinking big is not really that radical. What it says is we're going to have an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent."" "
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 21, 2016","Press Release - Sanders Contrasts with Clinton on Jobs, Trade","READING, Pa.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday talked about jobs and unfair trade deals as he returned to the campaign trail in Pennsylvania ahead of next Tuesday's primaries here and in four other Atlantic coast states. He also split with Clinton over her support on Wednesday for a regressive tax on soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks and teas. During his speech to more than 2,600 supporters at the Santander Performing Arts Center, Sanders detailed differences with Clinton on issues ranging from health care to the environment and from the minimum wage to college affordability. One key difference he detailed was on trade policies that have destroyed decent-paying jobs in the United States. ""We have seen the middle class of this country decline,"" Sanders told more than 2,600 supporters at the Santander Performing Arts Center. Sanders led the fight in Congress against the North American Free Trade Agreement and other job-killing trade pacts that Clinton supported. Pennsylvania was especially hard hit by a manufacturing decline in the past 15 years that saw 60,000 factories and almost 5 million jobs disappear as companies moved operations to low-wage countries overseas. Hershey in 2009 shut its York Peppermint Patties plant here and 300 jobs were shifted to Monterey, Mexico where workers are paid a fraction of what they were paid in Pennsylvania. Sony in 2008 closed the last TV manufacturing plant in the U.S. in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, destroying 560 Pennsylvania jobs when the plant was moved to Baja, Mexico. Campaign funding was another major difference with Clinton. Sanders on Wednesday reported raising a record $46 million last month, mostly in donations averaging about $27 apiece. Clinton raised $19 million in her traditional campaign fund last month and another $11.8 million for a super PAC, Priorities USA Action, which is funded by wealthy donors and special interests. Turning to immigration policy, Sanders spoke out on a local issue. ""It is time to shut down the Berks Family Detention Center,"" he said. ""The government should not be in the painful and inhumane business of locking up families who have fled unspeakable violence in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries throughout the world. Instead, we should treat these families with the compassion, the dignity and the respect they deserve.""  The rally here followed a stop earlier Thursday in Scranton. The Vermont senator was headed later for an event in the Philadelphia suburbs. Meanwhile, Sanders spoke out on a proposal by Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney to provide universal pre-school for all 4-year olds in Philadelphia. ""Making sure that every family has high quality, affordable pre-school and childcare is a vision that I strongly share. On the other hand, I do not support paying for this proposal through a regressive tax on soda and juice drinks that will significantly increase taxes on low-income and middle class Americans,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it should be the people on top who see an increase in their taxes, not low-income and working people."" Sanders also chided Clinton for supporting the soda tax. ""Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge. A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 22, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Focuses on Veterans at Gettysburg,"GETTYSBURG, Pa.  Speaking near this famous Civil War battleground, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday invoked the memory of Abraham Lincoln and echoed the 16th president's call for of a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people."" Sanders also paid tribute to the men and women who serve in the military today and generations of veterans who ""fought and died to preserve our way of life."" ""There are times when you have to respond militarily, when our freedom is in danger,"" Sanders told more than 2400 people at Gettysburg College. ""But in my view the use of military force should be the last response, not the first response. Diplomacy and doing everything we can to avoid a war is not weakness. It is intelligence. It is strength."" As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Sanders worked with veterans and veterans' organizations to develop and pass comprehensive veterans' health care legislation in 2014. Sanders worked with Sen. John McCain on the legislation that allowed the VA to hire more than 14,000 doctors, nurses and other medical staff. It reduced the time it takes for a veteran to see a doctor and expanded access to care by creating 27 new VA clinics in 18 states. Sanders told the crowd here that he remains committed to helping the men and women who fight to protect us. Sanders has pledged to improve the processing of veterans' claims for compensation and appeals. He also will expand the Department of Veterans Affairs' Caregivers Program, improve mental health programs and services for veterans and make certain that dental care is considered part of health care. Sanders' stop at Gettysburg was part of a swing through the Keystone state ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary election. Five states vote on Tuesday with 384 pledged delegates at stake."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 22, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Addresses Philadelphia Panel on a Moral Economy,"PHILADELPHIA  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday told an interfaith panel discussion that the richest country in the world must do more to reduce childhood poverty, create decent-paying jobs and provide affordable housing. In a disagreement with rival Hillary Clinton, Sanders also spoke out against a proposal by Philadelphia's mayor to slap a regressive tax onto soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks and teas. Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in America. There is a 30 percent poverty rate in the city where 40 percent of children rely on food stamps for their nutrition. ""That is shocking to hear these statistics,"" Sanders told the breakfast gathering at the Sharon Baptist Community Center. ""The reality that Philadelphia is experiencing today is unacceptable."" As president, Sanders added ""We are going to invest in those communities hit the hardest. Sadly and tragically Philadelphia is one of those cities."" Sanders called for closing tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes. He said he would put 13 million people to work with a $1 trillion, five-year investment in rebuilding crumbling schools, building affordable housing, fixing the nation's crumbling roads and bridges. He called for raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour and providing pay equity for women workers. He also said the nation must undertake a crash program to build affordable housing by fully funding the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund which Sanders first authored in 2001. ""What our economic agenda is about is telling the wealthiest people in this country that they cannot have it all,"" Sanders said. ""Yes, the people on top will start paying their fair share of taxes."" He also touted his plan for tuition-free public colleges and universities. ""I want every child in this city and this country, regardless of his or her income, to know that they will be able to get a college degree."" Speaking of Mayor Jim Kenney's proposal to tax soda and juice drinks to pay for universal pre-school, Sanders said he shares the mayor's goal of providing child care. The senator differed with the mayor and Clinton over how to pay for the proposal. ""I do have a serious disagreement with how you fund this. You don't have to fund child care on the backs of the poorest people in this city. That is a regressive way to raise funds."" Breaking her own pledge to oppose any new taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year, Clinton earlier this week supported the tax that would hurt the poorest people in Philadelphia."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 23, 2016",Press Release - On the Road: Poverty is a Death Sentence,"Speaking at a forum at a church in Baltimore, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said the life expectancy for someone born in Baltimore's poorest neighborhood is almost 20 years shorter than for someone born in the richest neighborhood.  Children in Baltimore have the least chance of escaping poverty of any big city in America. He said 15 Baltimore neighborhoods have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than Palestine's West Bank. He said Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in economically distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China, and South Africa. ""Children in Baltimore have the least chance of escaping poverty of any big city in America,"" Sanders said at the forum at the Carter Memorial Church of god in Christ. Sanders prescriptions for addressing the problem include:  Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Putting 13 million people to work rebuilding America's aging infrastructure. Embarking on a crash program to provide affordable housing by constructing, rehabilitating and preserving at least 3.5 million affordable homes and apartments over the next decade. ""We should not have buildings that I just walked past that are all boarded up when we desperately need affordable housing."" Creating 1 million jobs for disadvantaged young Americans and job opportunities for young adults through the $5.5 billion Employ Young Americans Now Act. Rewriting job-killing trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalized trade with China which have cost Maryland 72,000 factory jobs, more than 41 percent of its manufacturing workforce.

Sanders contrasted his grassroots campaign, which is supported by more than 7 million donations averaging about $27 apiece, to Hillary Clinton's campaign bankrolled by high-dollar donors to her White House campaign and to her super PACs, which have taken more than $25 million from Wall Street and other special interests. Sanders was introduced by the civil rights activist and actor Danny Glover and by Benjamin Jealous, the former head of the NAACP. In an interview taped earlier Saturday for the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders was asked about his differences and similarities with Clinton. ""I think there is a lot that unites us. I think there is a lot that divides us. I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us. The fact that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while our Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us,"" Sanders told Chuck Todd. ""On the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the part of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. We have to deal in very substantive way with income and wealth inequality. We need to understand that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people, not to provide paid family and medical leave. We have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system which allows big- money interests to buy elections. Those are areas I think of difference,"" Sanders said. The full interview airs Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""          "

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 27, 2016",Press Release - Sanders: I'm In It to Win It,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Declaring that he is ""in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee,"" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday told a rally at Purdue University that he is the Democrats' best hope to defeat Donald Trump in November.""If you want the candidate who will be the strongest nominee, you're looking at that candidate right now,"" Sanders told 2,267 cheering supporters at the rally in a student center. ""The reason I am the strongest candidate is that our campaign is appealing not just to Democrats but to independents all over this country and even some Republicans."" In poll after poll, Sanders fares much better than Hillary Clinton in matchups with Trump and other Republican White House hopefuls.Sanders' appeal to independents was evident on Tuesday when he won by 12-points in Rhode Island, a state with an open primary where independents could vote. That outcome should send a message to delegates going to the Democratic National Convention this summer, he said. What I hope delegates understand is that the national election is an open process. Guess what? Independents vote in that process. And it turns out that we are overwhelmingly winning the independent vote.Sen. Bernie SandersSanders acknowledged that Clinton currently leads in the number of delegates headed to Philadelphia, but he sees a narrow path to victory as voters in Indiana go to the polls next Tuesday and nine more states have elections on the calendar before the primary process comes to a close in June.""We are behind today. But you know what? Unusual things happen in politics,"" he said. ""With your help, superdelegates may reach the conclusion that Bernie Sanders will be the strongest candidate against Donald Trump or any other candidate.""Sanders was headed later Wednesday to another rally in Bloomington, Indiana, before flying to Oregon, another state where voters have yet to weigh in on who should be the Democratic Party nominee for president."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 28, 2016",Press Release - Sanders to Democratic Party: Whose Side are We On?,"SPRINGFIELD, Ore. - Saying that ""our job is to revitalize American democracy,"" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday challenged the Democratic Party establishment to decide if it will fight for working families or do the bidding of Wall Street, big oil, the pharmaceutical industry and other special interests.""Are we on the side of working people or big-money interests? Do we stand with the elderly, the sick and the poor or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the insurance companies?"" the Democratic Party presidential candidate asked 8,300 supporters at an outdoor rally at Island Park.He said a key reason why 63 percent of voters did not go to the polls in the last election and nearly 80 percent of young and low-income people stayed home is that ""the Democratic Party, up until now, has not been clear on which side they are on on the major issues facing this country.""Do we stand with the elderly, the sick and the poor or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the insurance companies?Sen. Sanders, Springfield, Ore.On issue after issue, Sanders challenged the Democratic Party to pick sides. ""You can't be for Wall Street and the working people of this country. You cannot be for the drug companies and senior citizens and veterans,"" he said. ""You cannot be on the side of workers and support those corporations that have thrown millions on the street.""The failure of Democratic leadership to send a clear message on where the party stands is why Republicans have grabbed control Congress and Statehouses. ""The problem in my view is not that the Republicans are winning elections. It's that Democrats are losing elections,"" he said.Sanders also faulted Democrats for not pushing election reforms that would increase voter turnout and help Democrats win elections. For example, he said, Democrats should get behind legislation he introduced in the Senate to register everyone to vote when they turn 18 years old. ""The Democratic Party has got to be very clear. We need automatic voter registration."" In 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to require state agencies to automatically register voters when they get a new driver's license or identification card.He also called on Democrats in states where access to the voting booth is restricted in primary contests to open the process and let millions of independents participate, ""Republican governors want to make it harder to vote. Our job is to bring more people into the system. We need open primaries.""Sanders also spelled out differences with Hillary Clinton. On trade policy, he opposed and she backed most of the job-killing trade deals. On climate change, he challenged Clinton to support a carbon tax to discourage burning the fossil fuels that are warming the planet. He pressed her to support a nationwide ban on fracking that imperils safety of drinking water and encourages fossil fuel. He asked Clinton to join him in supporting a Medicare-for-all health care system and to crack down on pharmaceutical companies that charge Americans the highest prices for prescription medicine anywhere in the world.""Secretary Clinton may not believe the American people have the ability to take on the insurance companies and take on the drug companies. I disagree.""Sanders also cited his big leads over Republican White House hopefuls Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Sanders beats Trump by twice as big a margin as Clinton. He also holds leads over Cruz and Kasich. She holds a narrow edge over the Texas senator and loses in many polls to the Ohio governor.""I hope delegates to the Democratic National Convention take heed of this,"" Sanders said at the rally.Sanders, who launched his campaign one year ago as an underdog, has so far won 17 primaries and caucuses and amassed 1,350 delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention. He has set fundraising records with 7.3 million donations. And he is drawing the biggest crowds for any presidential candidate.""I think Secretary Clinton and I agree that we must not have a Republican in the White House but I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate,"" Sanders said. ""And the reason for that is that our campaign is able to reach beyond the Democratic base and win the support of millions of independents.""This is the campaign that is generating excitement and enthusiasm and a large voter turnout.""Oregon is among 14 states, territories and the District of Columbia which have yet to vote in the contest between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. He thanked U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon for being the only member of the United States Senate ""to have the guts"" to back Sanders."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"April 29, 2016",Press Release - Independent Investigation Confirms Sanders Campaign Told the Truth,"BURLINGTON, Vt. - Four months ago, in an impulsive overreaction and at a critical point in the campaign just weeks before the closest Iowa caucus results in history, the DNC shut down the Sanders campaign's access to its own voter file data, only restoring access after the campaign filed a lawsuit in Federal court.Now, four months later, an independent investigation of the firewall failures in the DNC's shared voter file database has definitively confirmed that the original claims by the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inaccurate - the Sanders campaign never ""stole"" any voter file data; the Sanders campaign never ""exported"" any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign's ""strategic road map.""In fact, the independent investigation has confirmed what the Sanders campaign said from the start:The DNC's security failures allowed four Sanders campaign staffers - three junior-level staffers led by a manager who had been hired at the recommendation of the DNC and who was immediately terminated after the incident - to have extremely short-lived access for one hour to Hillary for America's scoring models, but not to any of Hillary for America's proprietary voter data.No one else in the Sanders campaign, outside these four staffers, accessed the Hillary for America's scoring models or had knowledge that the activity was taking place until well after the incident was over.With one exception, all unauthorized access took place within the DNC's own system. While there is evidence that the terminated staffer may have exported a summary data table, the independent investigation of Sanders campaign computers could not locate that file and no one in the Sanders campaign has ever seen that file.With the investigation behind us, the campaign has withdrawn its lawsuit against the DNC today but continues to implore the DNC to address the systemic instability that remains in its voter file system. It is imperative that the DNC make it a top priority to prevent future data security failures in the voter file system, failures that only serve as unnecessary distractions to the democratic process.Bernie Sanders Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver said ""We are gratified by the results of this independent investigation."""

Bernie Sanders blamed trade policies which he fought and Hillary Clinton supported for the loss of manufacturing jobs in Indiana.He spoke Friday at a United Steelworkers rally outside the Indiana Statehouse where workers were protesting United Technologies' plans to move two of its Indiana plants to Mexico.""We must rewrite our disastrous trade policies that enable corporate America to shut down plants in this country and move to Mexico and other low-wage countries,"" Sanders said. ""We need to end the race to the bottom and enact trade policies that demand that American corporations create jobs here and not abroad.""United Technologies announced in February that it would shutter a Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis and move 1,400 jobs next year to Monterey, Mexico, where workers will be paid only $3 an hour. Another 700 jobs will be lost in Huntington, Indiana, where the same parent company is closing a facility.Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed by Congress in 1994, Indiana has lost 113,000 manufacturing jobs.""Look around Indiana and you will find once vibrant and strong manufacturing towns like Gary, South Bend, Muncie, Bloomington, Indianapolis and Evansville shattered by abandoned factories, shut down steel mills, sky-high poverty rates and foreclosed homes,"" Sanders said.The United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at the Indianapolis plant, has endorsed Sanders for president.To read the senator's prepared remarks, click here."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 1, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Raises $26M in April and Breaks $200M Raised for Campaign,"WASHINGTON - Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Sunday announced that supporters made almost 1 million donations in April totaling $25.8 million, far surpassing the campaign's average monthly total of $17 million.Since the Sanders campaign was launched one year ago, his supporters have revolutionized campaign fundraising and demonstrated that he can wage a competitive campaign for president without relying on Wall Street and other special interests. More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million.A key to Sanders' fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinton's big-dollar donors. Sanders' April donations far exceeded Hillary for America's $21 million in March.""What our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""Sanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.""In April, the average contribution was slightly less than $26. Only 3 percent of the total came from donors who have given the maximum $2,700 an individual may donate to a candidate. About 48 percent Hillary Clinton's primary campaign committee money comes from maxed-out donors.A typical Sanders donor is 27 years old. Forty-one percent of people giving to his campaign are between the ages of 18 and 39, an unprecedented level of support from younger Americans. 'Teacher' is the most common profession followed by 'student' and 'engineer.'Sanders continued fundraising success comes as the presidential nomination contest with Clinton enters the final phase with 14 states, territories and the District of Columbia still to hold primaries or a caucuses. Sanders and Clinton are neck and neck in national polls with Sanders edging ahead in some surveys. He consistently is a much stronger general election candidate polling much better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Donald Trump or other Republican White House hopefuls."

""We think the Clinton campaign should let the state parties keep their fair share of the cash.""Sanders' and Clinton's primary campaigns both raised about $26 million in April, but Politico documented how the Hillary Victory Fund, a supposedly joint fundraising committee, has been exploited to inflate her presidential primary campaign.""Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions,"" Weaver added. ""If Secretary Clinton can't raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?""The Sanders campaign first raised questions about the arrangement in an April 18 letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders' campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC.""Hillary Clinton says that campaign finance reform is one of the most important issues facing our country but her campaign's use of the Victory Fund to essentially launder money proves otherwise,"" Weaver said. ""You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.""Sanders last month raised money for three progressive Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives.

It was the third big rally of the day for Sanders. He spoke earlier Monday to more than 3,000 people each in Evansville and Fort Wayne as he crisscrossed the state in an election eve campaign blitz.Here in Indianapolis, Sanders contrasted his record to Hillary Clinton's on how they finance their campaigns. He has relied on more than 7.4 million donations while she is bankrolled by big-dollar donors. He supports a tax on carbon and a nationwide ban on fracking to combat climate change. She doesn't. He called for a tax on Wall Street speculation to pay for his proposal to provide tuition-free public colleges and universities and to help those struggling with heavy student debt loads refinance their loans. She doesn't.  He also focused on the core economic issues and proposals to end a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system. ""We are going to create an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent,"" he said.He called for more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 an hour. ""In the United States of America if you work 40 hours a week you should not live in poverty. He said there should be pay equity for women workers who are paid just 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. He promised to rewrite trade policies that have encouraged corporations to send jobs to low-wage nations overseas. The most recent example of how trade policies have failed American workers is the decision of United Technologies the owner of Carrier to ship 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Monterey, Mexico, He denounced the greed of the Connecticut-based United Technologies for its plan to ship Indiana jobs to Mexico and throw Indiana workers out of their jobs.In Evansville earlier in the day, Sanders spoke about the $25 million Clinton took in donations from Wall Street and other special interests.

Bernie Sanders on Thursday came to McDowell County, West Virginia, for a meeting with people from nearby towns and hollows who gathered at a food bank in one of the worst pockets of poverty in the United States.""What is strange about what goes on in America is that we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world,"" Sanders told more than 250 people at the Five Loaves & Two Fishes Food Bank.He pointed to mounting wealth and income inequality nationwide. In West Virginia, while the top 1 percent saw incomes rise more than 60 percent from 1979 to 2012, incomes for everyone else fell by 0.4 percent. He also said 22 percent of American children live in poverty, including about 100,000 in West Virginia.""What poverty is about is dealing with the stress of whether or not your family is going to make it every single week,"" Sanders said. ""When you don't have any money you're fighting for your survival every single day.""The senator also cited studies showing how poverty cuts lives short. Here in McDowell County, where suicides and drug overdoses are leading causes of death, men live to be only 64 on average. Women typically live to be 73. That's a sharp contrast to Fairfax County, Virginia, only a six-hour car ride away, where the average lifespan for a man is 82 and a woman is 85.  Sanders has outlined an agenda to address poverty in America. He would expand Medicare to cover all Americans, raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, ensure pay equity for women and make public colleges and universities tuition free.He also called for a major investment in rebuilding roads and bridges to create jobs. More than 1,500 bridges in West Virginia, 22 percent, are functionally obsolete. Sanders would invest $1 trillion in rebuilding roads and bridges. Paid for by closing tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes, Sanders' legislation would create at least 13 million jobs.He also said job-killing trade policies have thrown West Virginia workers out of their jobs. Since passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, West Virginia has lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs. Sanders has also introduced a $41 billion plan to transition coal workers into new industries that pay a living wage and to rebuild communities that have been dependent on the fossil fuel industry."

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 6, 2016",Press Release - Sanders to DNC: Don't Stack the Deck at Philly Convention,"BURLINGTON, Vt. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday urged Democratic Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz not to stack the committees that will draft the rules and lay out the party platform at this summer's Democratic National Convention.In a letter to the party chairwoman, Sanders said the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the relative level of support that he and Hillary Clinton received in primaries and caucuses. So far, Sanders has won about 45 percent of the pledged delegates. Both campaigns deserve a say at the convention this July in Philadelphia, the senator said.Under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommends 25 at-large appointments to the party's executive committee for each of the three standing committees; rules, platform and credentials. Wasserman Schultz has forwarded only three of 40 names the Sanders campaign recommended for the key committees while installing Clinton loyalists in leading roles. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was put in charge of the Platform Committee, for example, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts was tapped to head the Rules Committee.Sanders called Malloy and Frank ""aggressive attack surrogates"" for Clinton. He doubted that either would ""conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner"" and said the appointments of the two Clinton loyalists ""suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy.""How the party leadership comports itself at the convention will affect Democrats' chances of winning the general election this November, the Vermont senator said.""If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond,"" Sanders wrote to Wasserman Schultz.The letter warned that if committee assignments aren't fairly allotted one result could be floor fights. Under party rules, minority reports may be brought before the full convention at the request of 25 percent of the platform, credentials and rules committees.""If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention,"" Sanders wrote.Read Sanders' letter to Wasserman Schultz here."

""I hope other states follow Maine's example. This is the kind of grassroots democracy that will help the Democratic Party grow and win elections.""Maine is one of several states where Sanders scored landslide victories but where most of the so-called superdelegates - elected officials and party insiders - have lined up behind Hillary Clinton.Sanders won Maine's March 6 caucuses with 64 percent of the vote to Clinton's 36 percent. As a result, Maine's delegation will include 17 elected delegates pledged to Sanders and eight for Clinton. Despite the lopsided outcome in Sanders' favor, three of Maine's five superdelegates still back Clinton. One supports Sanders and one remains uncommitted. Under Maine's new rules, Sanders would have three superdelegates to Clinton's two.Superdelegates have ignored rank-and-file Democrats in other states too.In the state of Washington, 73 percent of the caucus-goers backed Sanders last March 26. Clinton has 10 super delegates. He has zero.In Minnesota, Clinton has 11 superdelegates to Sanders' three despite his 61 percent support in the March 1 caucuses.In Colorado, Sanders won with 59 percent on March 1 but Clinton has 10 superdelegates and he has none.In New Hampshire, Sanders on Feb. 9 won more than 60 percent of the popular vote with more votes than any candidate in the 100-year history of the primary. Still, all six superdelegates remain committed to Clinton.""Superdelegates in states where either candidate has won landslide victories ought to reflect the decision of the people in their states,"" Sanders said.The Maine rule change won't affect this year's contest between Sanders and Clinton. For fear of being penalized at this summer's national convention in Philadelphia, the new Maine plan won't take effect until 2020.

Clinton has looked to big-dollar donors to fund her presidential campaign and to super PACs that take unlimited sums from special interests.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Clinton is relying more and more on Wall Street donors and financial-services executives. During the last reporting period, according to the analysis of records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, she raised another $4.2 million from Wall Street - more than any other candidate running for president combined. Clinton's super PAC has now received almost $19 million from Wall Street, more than any other industry.Saying that ""our current campaign finance system is corrupt and it is undermining American democracy,"" Sanders called for public funding of elections."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 9, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Campaign Statement on Tax Policy Center's Analysis,"BURLINGTON, Vt. - Bernie Sanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, released the following statement after the Tax Policy Center released an analysis of the senator's proposals. We are pleased the Tax Policy Center recognizes that a major part of Senator Sanders' economic agenda - making public colleges and universities tuition free, substantially reducing student debt, expanding Social Security, and providing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave - would help rebuild the middle class without increasing the deficit.In terms of our health care plan, the good news is that the Tax Policy Center recognizes that Senator Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan will provide health care as a right, not a privilege, to everyone in America - immediately covering more than 28 million uninsured Americans.Even better, this report estimates that low-and-middle-income households would experience a much bigger increase in their income than our own projections. According to the Tax Policy Center, middle-income households would receive an average gain of more than $8,500 a year and low-income households would gain an average of $10,000 a year under Bernie's Medicare-for-all plan.By eliminating private health insurance premiums, deductibles, and co-payments, 95 percent of the American people will see their incomes go up through Bernie's universal health care plan - which is what we have been saying throughout this campaign.The bad news is that the Tax Policy Center wildly overestimates the cost of Senator Sanders' health care plan.The fact of the matter is that the U.S. spends far more per capita on health care with worse health outcomes than any major country on earth. And, unlike every major country on earth, over 28 million of our people are still uninsured.In 2013, the U.S. spent about three times as much per capita on health care than Britain and about twice as much as Canada and France. If every other major country can spend less on health care and insure all of their people, so can the U.S.Here is where the Tax Policy Center is wrong:First, it assumes that state and local governments will dump all of their health care obligations onto the federal government at a cost of $4.1 trillion over the next decade. That is categorically false. Bernie's plan requires state and local governments to maintain their current levels of health care spending - a maintenance of effort that has been upheld by the courts.Secondly, this study significantly underestimates the savings in administration, paperwork, and prescription drug prices that every major country on earth has successfully achieved by adopting a universal health care program.The Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) has estimated that we could save nearly $500 billion annually on paperwork and administration alone - enough savings not only to provide universal coverage to the uninsured, but also to eliminate deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance for everyone in America. Hospitals currently spend over 25 percent on administrative costs in this country, but just 12.4 percent in Canada.Third, the authors of this report estimate that the cost of our plan would be about $8 trillion more than even the highest cost estimates to date  estimates that have already been debunked by the experts at Physicians for a National Health Program.At a time when 50 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured we must guarantee health care as a right so that no American is one bad illness or accident away from financial catastrophe. Doing so will make the U.S. a healthier and more productive country."

Bernie Sanders on Monday said he is fighting for workers who have seen greedy Wall Street hedge fund managers and corporate raiders cut their pay and destroy their pensions and health care.""That greed is not acceptable,"" Sanders told a crowd of more than 2400 at Boardwalk Hall located across town from the Taj Mahal, a casino once owned by Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential candidate. ""That greed is destroying America and you are looking at somebody who if elected president will take these people on,"" Sanders said.After Trump's casino went bankrupt, another billionaire, Carl Icahn, last February added the property to his collection of two other Atlantic City casinos.  Workers at the Taj Mahal have seen their paychecks cut by more than one-third, their pensions eliminated and their high-quality health insurance plan eliminated.Icahn has endorsed Trump, who in turn put the billionaire on his list of potential treasury secretaries.Before the rally, Sanders met with rank-and-file members of UNITE HERE!

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday backed a California ballot initiative to save state taxpayers from being ripped off by pharmaceutical companies which charge Americans the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.""While Congress has failed to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, the people of California can by supporting this ballot initiative,"" the Vermont senator said.The California Drug Price Relief Act is supported by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and National Nurses United, both headquartered in Oakland, California. ""Americans living with HIV/AIDS and cancer should not live in fear that they will go bankrupt because of the outrageously high cost of their prescription drugs,"" Sanders said.The proposition would prohibit the state from paying more for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The nationwide VA health care system negotiates lower prices for pharmaceuticals.As a former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Sanders authored landmark legislation reforming the health care system for veterans. ""We know that the VA pays considerably less than retail prices for prescription drugs. The people of California and all Americans should get the same price,"" Sanders said.Prices for prescription medicine in the United States soared last year more than 10 percent - the third consecutive year of double digit price increases. One out of five adults between the ages of 18 and 64 - more than 35 million Americans - cannot afford the medications that their doctors prescribe. ""In the richest country in the history of the world,"" Sanders said, ""that is unacceptable.""The pharmaceutical industry is bankrolling a campaign to defeat the California initiative. ""It is no surprise that the pharmaceutical industry already has dedicated $50 million to defeat this ballot initiative,"" Sanders said. ""Their greed has no end.""In Congress, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland have introduced comprehensive legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Their bills would authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and reduce barriers to the importation of lower-cost drugs from Canada and other countries.Sanders and Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, also have spotlighted steep price increases for generic drugs. The increases cost taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion over the last decade, according to a study Sanders and Cummings requested from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. Prices of top-selling generic drugs rose faster than inflation 22 percent of the time over the 10-year period examined by the study.Sanders was in California this week ahead of the state's June 7 presidential primary election.To read the senator's statement, click here.To read the senator's plan to lower prescription drug prices, click here."

In battleground states across the country, Sanders added, he also polls much stronger than Hillary Clinton.""There is no question about which campaign is energizing the American people,"" Sanders said. ""If you want the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump that's us.""Sanders was on a two-day campaign swing through northern California and the San Francisco Bay area ahead of the Golden State's June 7 primary election. California, the largest state, will elect 475 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.The rally in Stockton was the second big turnout in two days. On Monday night, the U.S. senator from Vermont spoke to more than 16,000 at a soccer field in Sacramento.In Stockton, he referred to a Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll released on Tuesday whichexamined how Sanders and Hillary Clinton fared against Trump in three general election battleground states:Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania.  In two of those states Sanders led Trump by significantly greater margins than Clinton.In Ohio, Clinton actually trailed Trump by four points. Sanders prevailed with 43 percent to Trump's 41 percent.In Pennsylvania, Sanders had a six-point lead over Trump. She was up only by 1 percent.In Florida, he had a two-point edge compared to her one-point advantage.In each state, more voters have unfavorable opinions of both Clinton and Trump.In yet another state poll, this one in New Hampshire, Sanders trounced Trump 49 percent to 28 percent, a 21-point spread.

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday spoke to a pair of big rallies here in Big Sky Country ahead of Montana's presidential primary election. He was greeted with cheers when he said he is the most electable candidate for president.Some 9,100 Sanders supporters came out on a sunny spring day to Caras Park in Missoula for a rally on the banks of the Clark Fork River. Hours later, another 3,000 packed the Montana Pavilion in Billings.Twenty-seven delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention are at stake in the June 7 primary. With eight states still set to hold primaries or a caucus in the closing weeks of the nominating process, Sanders renewed his pledge to stay in the race with Hillary Clinton until the convention in Philadelphia in July.""If we can do really well - it is a steep climb and I admit it - but we can end up with more pledged delegates, real delegates, delegates elected by the people than Secretary Clinton,"" Sanders told the Billings rally.The senator from Vermont so far has won victories in 19 states and amassed 46 percent of the pledged delegates. He picked up more with back-to-back wins the past two Tuesdays. He carried every county in West Virginia on Election Day this week. He scored another upset win over Clinton one week ago in Indiana.  Sanders called it ""strange and undemocratic"" that 450 superdelegates - elected officials and party officials - backed Clinton even before Sanders entered the presidential campaign last April 30. ""That's not democracy. That's the establishment defending its own interests,"" Sanders said.In West Virginia, for example, Sanders soundly defeated Clinton 51 percent to 36 percent in Tuesday's primary election. As a result of the popular vote, he won 18 elected pledged delegates to her 11. But six of the state's seven superdelegates back Clinton. In other states - including Minnesota, Washington and Colorado - Sanders won by double-digit margins but the party establishment figures are clinging to Clinton.Sanders also made the case for why he would be the Democrats' best choice to win in November. In yet another new poll published on Wednesday, Sanders trounced Trump 48 percent to 39 percent in a general election matchup. That 11-point lead contrasts with Clinton's 2-point margin over Trump in the same Economist/YouGov Poll. She was supported by 42 percent to his 40 percent.""You are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate,"" Sanders said.  "

The high school dropout rate is 70 percent and the teacher turnover rate is eight times the national average.  ""In America today, we have a massive level of income and wealth inequality. We are living in a country where some people have unbelievable wealth but a lot of other people are living in dire poverty,"" Sanders said.He called for a federal jobs program to put millions of people back to work. He has introduced legislation to create 13 million good-paying jobs by investing $1 trillion in repairing the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, water systems, schools and other infrastructure projects.Sanders also said the federal minimum wage should go up. ""In America today, many people are working for wages that are much too low. That is why we have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,"" he said.Told that the Indian Health Service is a ""failure,"" Sanders called for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care as a right for all Americans.

In fact, Sanders voted for a $14 billion aid package which passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 10, 2008. When that bill ran into a Senate Republican roadblock, the White House turned to a separate Wall Street bailout fund for loans to the auto industry.""It is absolutely untrue to say that Sen.

There is a humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico that Congress and the Administration must address as soon as possible.

About 60 percent of all adults are either unemployed or have stopped looking for work. The childhood poverty rate has shot up to 56 percent.Wall Street investors - who bought bonds at a deep discount which yield steep interest rates of up to 34 percent - have pressured Puerto Rico's government to adopt stern austerity measures. Over the last five years, for example, more than 150 public schools have been closed. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, UBS and other financial firms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage Puerto Rico's bond sales.""We have got to make it clear to these Wall Street vulture funds that they cannot have it all,"" Sanders said.Children in Puerto Rico will not go hungry, will not lose health care to make billionaires even wealthier. It is time for the Federal Reserve to act.Bernie SandersSanders said creditors must work with Puerto Rico to develop a fair debt repayment plan to help the island's economy recover and give the territory time to expand its tax base, create jobs and reduce the poverty rate.He also said the Federal Reserve should provide emergency loans to Puerto Rico to facilitate an orderly restructuring of its debt.The senator renewed his opposition to a proposal by U.S. House Republicans to create an undemocratic control board in Washington to oversee the territory's budget and spending.In order to create jobs, Sanders has introduced legislation to invest $1 trillion over five years to rebuild the nation's crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that would support 13 million good-paying jobs in the United States and put 150,000 people to work in Puerto Rico.He also proposed an aggressive push to replace an energy system almost entirely reliant on fossil fuels and turn instead to clean energy sources like wind and solar power would help the economy and the environment.Sanders also called on President Obama to release Oscar Lopez Rivera, a political prisoner that has already served 34 years in prison for his commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico. ""I say to President Obama: let him out,"" Sanders said. ""Free Oscar Lopez Rivera. He has done his time. And if you do not do this, I will.

She said the land trust was modeled on an affordable housing initiative which Sanders pioneered in the 1980s when he was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont.The Martn Pea land trust gave residents a legal, long-term claim to land where their families have lived for generations.

Sanders applauded the example of grassroots democracy.""You should be proud of what you accomplished under very difficult circumstances,"" Sanders said during an impromptu news conference with Rodriquez a few steps away from the channel.Rodriquez also has been instrumental in the effort to dredge and clean up the fetid channel.

Bernie Sanders on Friday told a community college rally that he is much more likely than Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump.""Hillary Clinton is not the Democratic candidate most likely to defeat Donald Trump. Our campaign is the campaign ...,"" Sanders said as cheers drowned him out.Clinton has slipped behind Trump in two recent national polls and her edge over Trump narrowed significantly in a New York Times/CBS News survey published Sunday. Sanders 13-point advantage over Trump was more than twice as great as Clinton's shrinking six-point edge. Sanders also cited a recent Fox News poll in which he said Trump ""rather frighteningly"" is ahead of Clinton by three points. In that same poll, Sanders held a 46-42 percent advantage over Trump.""The reason we are the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump has everything to do with you.

The energy, the excitement is in our campaign, not Secretary Clinton's campaign,"" he added.Sanders has notched wins in 20 states including three in the last three weeks in a row. With nine contests still to come, including delegate-rich California, the Vermont senator is now backed by almost 46 percent of the pledged delegates.Clinton, by contrast, has commitments from 93 percent of the so-called superdelegates, top elected Democrats and party officials. ""These are the people who received no popular votes at all. I know many of these people. I like many of them. This is not an attack on them or their character."" But Sanders called it ""a very bad idea"" that more than 400 superdelegates had lined up behind Clinton before any other candidate was in the race.""In other words, the establishment determined who the anointed candidate would be before the voters got in the process. That is a very bad idea and an idea we intend to change at the convention,"" Sanders said.Sanders was headed later Friday to Albuquerque for another rally in the state where 34 pledged delegates are at stake in the June 7 primary.

""We need to guarantee health care for all people as a right.""Sanders said the United States spends far more per capita on health care than any other nation; twice as much as in Great Britain and half again as much as in France. In the United States, meanwhile nearly 60 million Americans either do not have health insurance or are underinsured and cannot afford high deductibles, premiums and co-payments charged by private health insurance companies.According to a 2009 Harvard Medical School study, 45,000 people die unnecessarily each year because they go to a doctor or hospital too late or don't have health insurance at all.Sanders has proposed expanding the successful health care program for seniors and to build on the advances made under the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders helped craft. Patients would be able to choose their own doctors and receive comprehensive care for everything from hospital stays to emergency room visits to primary and specialty care.Under Sanders' plan, millions of people in the richest nation in the history of the world no longer would have to choose between health care and other necessities like food, heat and shelter.Sanders also backed a California ballot initiative that could save the state an estimated $4 billion over the next 10 years on prescription drugs.Today in the United States, Sanders said, 1 in 5 Americans is unable to afford to fill prescriptions while the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profits by charging Americans the highest prices anywhere for prescription medicine. ""That's crazy,"" Sanders saidThe California ballot initiative faces stiff opposition from pharmaceutical which are bankrolling an effort to block the proposition. They have already raised $68 million and may spend $100 million to defeat the proposal.To read Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan, click here.To read Sanders' statement in support of California's prescription drug ballot initiative, click here."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"May 31, 2016","Press Release - Clinton Cannot Clinch Nomination before Convention, Sanders Says","MONTEREY, Calif. - Campaigning Tuesday along California's Pacific Coast, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said neither he nor Hillary Clinton will win enough pledged delegates on June 7 to secure the Democratic Party presidential nomination.A total of 694 delegates are at stake in six states with contests next Tuesday. ""No candidate will end up with the number of pledged delegates needed to win the nomination,"" Sanders told 7,800 supporters at an outdoor rally here.The close contest will mean that the selection of a nominee will fall to superdelegates. Those elected officials and other party power brokers won't cast their votes until July at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.He aims to persuade superdelegates that it is in their own self-interest and the best interests of their party that Democrats nominate the candidate best able to defeat Donald Trump.One reason Sanders is much more likely than Clinton to win the general election in November is that he leads Donald Trump by margins that often are much greater than Clinton's narrow edge over the likely Republican presidential nominee. In one recent poll in California, for example, he led Trump by 17 points. Her advantage was 10 points.For another reason, the Sanders campaign is the one generating the most excitement. ""Our campaign has the energy and enthusiasm that Clinton does not,"" Sanders said. ""I believe we can leave that convention with the Democratic nomination."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 1, 2016","Press Release - Offshore Fracking in California 'Disastrous,' Sanders Says'","SPRECKELS, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders told a news conference on Wednesday he favors a nationwide ban on fracking and warned that it would be ""disastrous"" to let oil and gas companies use fracking to exploit oil and gas reserves along California's continental shelf.The U.S. Department of the Interior on Friday released two reports that could clear the way for underwater ocean fracking. ""Make no mistake: this was a very bad decision by the federal government that will not be allowed to stand if I have anything to say about it,"" Sanders told a news conference here near Monterey Bay. ""Offshore fracking has the potential to pollute the ocean with toxic fluid, hurt the environment and harm our beautiful beaches. That risk to me is unacceptable.""Sanders is a co-sponsor of legislation in the U.S. Senate with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and California's Sen. Barbara Boxer to end the extraction of all fossil fuels on public lands, including in federal waters. If passed, the bill would stop the fracking approved by the administration last week.Sanders favors a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing because it endangers water supplies and because burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, does not support a nationwide ban.""Secretary Clinton in one way or another wants to quote unquote 'regulate' fracking. I think it is too late for regulating. I think fracking has got to be banned in America,"" Sanders said. He also noted that Clinton promoted the dangerous technology around the world when she was secretary of state.The toxic chemicals used in fracking can cause cancer and birth defects. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Academy of Sciences have shown clear evidence that fracking can lead to a contaminated water supply. The pollution from fracking causes nausea, nosebleeds, headaches and high rates of asthma and other respiratory illness.The threat of Methane emissions from fracking also presents a profound danger to our climate. Methane traps more than 86times the heat of carbon dioxide in the short term. A report published last week by Environment America found that ""newly fracked wells released 2.4 million metric tons of methane in 2014  equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 22 coal-fired power plants.""The growing body of evidence finds that fracking is a huge danger to the water supply - a precious resource in the Golden State. It takes 160,000 gallons of clean water to frack just one well. With California in the midst of a five-year drought, it makes no sense to allow fracking in California.Monterey County voters will consider a local ballot initiative in November to ban fracking and all new oil drilling. Santa Cruz, San Benito and Mendocino counties already have banned fracking. Sanders' home state of Vermont was the first state in the nation to ban fracking in 2012.""In my view, if we are serious about safe and clean drinking water; if we are serious about clean air; if we are serious about protecting the health of our children and families; and if we are serious about combatting climate change, we need to put an end to fracking all over this country,"" Sanders said.To read Sanders' plan to stop the worst effects of climate change, click here."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 1, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Applauds Obama Support for Expanding Social Security,"PALO ALTO, Calif. - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday applauded President Barack Obama's support for expanding Social Security by asking the ""wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.""Sanders urged Hillary Clinton to back legislation endorsed by leading Democrats and seniors' advocates to strengthen the retirement program.""I applaud President Obama for making it clear that it is time to expand Social Security benefits,"" Sanders said. ""Millions of seniors, disabled veterans and people with disabilities are falling further and further behind on $10,000 or $11,000 a year Social Security,"" he added.Legislation Sanders introduced in the U.S. Senate would expand Social Security benefits and extend the life of the program for 58 years. In a speech in Indiana, Obama suggested that the retirement system should be strengthened by making the wealthy pay more, a position the president first advocated during his 2008 White House campaign. Sanders' bill would lift the cap on taxable Social Security income and asking the very wealthy to pay more.""Our legislation is supported by millions of senior citizens organizations,"" Sanders said, ""and I hope Secretary Clinton will come on board.""Sanders' proposal calls for making the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.Under Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.The measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments. This year, for only the third time in four decades, seniors on Social Security did not receive a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.The proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans.According to the most recent estimates from the Social Security Administration, Sanders' plan would extend the solvency of Social Security until the year 2074.In California, where Sanders was campaigning ahead of next Tuesday's presidential primary, more than 5.5 million seniors and disabled people receive Social Security benefits. The average benefit is less than $14,500 a year. Social Security lifted nearly 2 million Californians out of poverty in 2013. Without Social Security, more than 37 percent of California's seniors would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the senior poverty rate in California is less than 10 percent."
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 2, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Schools Trump on Climate Change in California,"MODESTO, Calif. - Calling Donald Trump ""a climate change denier,"" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday said bold action is needed to combat the planetary crisis that the Republican White House hopeful dismisses as a ""hoax.""At a news conference, Sanders also challenged Hillary Clinton to join him in supporting a carbon tax to limit burning the fossil fuels that scientists blame for climate change.And Sanders urged his rival in Tuesday's California primary to support his call for a nationwide ban on fracking to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""This is a crisis of unbelievable magnitude,"" Sanders said of climate change. ""Burying our heads in the sand and taking contributions from the fossil fuel industry is not going to solve this problem,"" he said.""I urge Secretary Clinton to appreciate the severity of the crisis and join me in telling the fossil fuel industry that yes there will be a tax on carbon,"" the Vermont senator added.Sanders spoke at a news conference here in California, where a devastating five-year drought has resulted in severe water shortages, dangerous wildfires and massive heat waves.Trump, who is poised to become the Republican Party presidential nominee, has asserted that there is no drought in California. He also has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. ""This is so ludicrous that it really would be funny if the future of the planet were not at stake,"" Sanders said.  Sanders has proposed a comprehensive plan to tackle the worst effects of climate change. He has introduced legislation in the Senate to put a tax on carbon and cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050 from 1990 levels.Sanders news conference was held before he spoke to 2,500 supporters at a rally in the Modesto Centre Plaza. It was the 28th rally his campaign has staged in California since May 9 in Sacramento where he began a drive to speak directly to a quarter-million Californians in advance of Tuesday's primary.To read Sanders' climate change plan, click here."

So while the official unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, the reason for the decline raised red flags. Real unemployment in May remained at 9.7 percent. That figure counts those who gave up looking for work and those forced to settle for part-time jobs. ""It was a bad day for American workers,"" U.S. Sen.

Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 4, 2016",Press Release - A Future to Believe In,"Hillary Clinton and the news media are talking like the Democratic Party presidential nomination contest is over and done with. They're wrong. There are 931 pledged delegates still at stake in contests this weekend in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, next Tuesday in California and five other states and on June 14 in Washington, D.C. The truth is that at the end of a long and closely-fought contest, neither candidate is likely to have enough pledged delegates to cinch the nomination before the Democratic National Convention this summer. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain. Voters all across the United States deserve to have a say in who the party nominates and what the party stands for. And no candidate should be allowed to short-circuit the democratic process.Sanders, who has edged ahead of Clinton in the most recent Los Angeles Times poll of California voters, thinks voters in the Golden State and the other places still to hold contests are as important as the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.""I am running for president because I want to give people a real choice in this election,"" Sanders said at a Los Angeles news conference on Saturday. ""I want to give people a choice to vote for something, future that calls for a government that represents all of us, not the 1 percent."""
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 4, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Hosts Meeting on Immigration Reform,"LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday spoke at a town hall meeting on immigration reform, a key issue in California where Democratic Party voters go to the polls in Tuesday's hotly contested presidential primary contest.Meanwhile, in a prepared statement, Sanders contrasted his record in favor of comprehensive immigration reform to Clinton's support for a 2007 Senate bill. She supported and he opposed the measure which was criticized by one of the country's foremost Latino organizations, by organized labor and by a leading human rights organization.""I voted against this bill because the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States, said that it could not 'support a bill that will separate families and lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers,'"" Sanders said....akin to slavery allowing employers to exploit workers, cheat them out of wages, deny them medical treatment...""I voted against this bill because the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the massive expansion of guest worker programs included in the legislation were akin to slavery allowing employers to exploit workers, cheat them out of wages, deny them medical treatment for on-the-job injuries, force them to live in squalid conditions and compel them to mortgage their futures to obtain low wage, temporary jobs.""""I voted against this bill because the AFL-CIO, the largest trade union in America representing over 12 million workers, said that it was 'far from the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that would improve the status quo for either U.S.-born or immigrant workers or their families' and was 'likely to make matters much worse,'"" the Vermont senator said.  We must protect children fleeing to the U.S. from violence in Central America, not use them to ""send a message.""Sanders noted other areas of disagreement with Clinton on immigration issues.He opposes deportation of children who fled to the United States from violence in Central America. She thinks the deportations will ""send a message."" ""Instead, we need to welcome these children into our country and do everything we can to help them get their lives back together,"" Sanders said.He wants to shut down private prisons used to jail those awaiting deportation. She took campaign cash from private prison lobbyists.They also split on whether to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses. She fought and helped block passage of a proposal in New York. He supported a similar effort in Vermont which became law in 2013.""I am proud that I have the strongest immigration reform plan of any candidate running for president. I am proud that my plan was endorsed by The New York Times. If I am elected president, I will do everything I can to provide a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million aspiring Americans living in this country. And that includes taking executive action within the first 100 days I am in office.""Watch the meeting:"
Bernie Sanders,D,p,"June 5, 2016",Press Release - Sanders Tells LA Coliseum Rally He is Best Choice to Defeat Trump,"LOS ANGELES - From a stage framed by a burning torch atop Memorial Coliseum's giant arch, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders told a Saturday night rally that he is the Democrats' best choice to defeat Republican Donald Trump this November.Sanders addressed more than 13,500 cheering supporters sprawled on the coliseum's Olympic Plaza on the final weekend before California Democrats go to the polls to elect 475 pledged delegates. In a state that has experienced a record surge in voter registration, Sanders held a 44 percent to 43 percent lead over Clinton in a new USC/Los Angeles Times poll released on Friday. That was a nine-point swing in Sanders favor since the same survey was conducted in March.Like national and state polls across the United States, the California poll also showed Sanders with much greater support than Clinton in general election matchups with Trump.""I hope that the delegates going to the Democratic National Convention understand that in virtually every state poll we do much better against Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton,"" Sanders said. ""If the delegates at the Democratic National Convention want to make sure we defeat Trump and defeat him badly we are the candidate to do that.""It's not just the polls, Sanders added. Since mid-May, he has drawn more than 211,000 Californians to hear him at rallies that are far bigger and more boisterous than Clinton's. ""Our campaign has he energy, the grassroots activism to make certain that in November we have a large voter turnout. And when people have something to vote for rather than just against, progressives and Democrats win.""  When people have something to vote for rather than just against, progressives and Democrats win. - Sen. SandersEarlier Saturday, Sanders told a news conference that he will carry his campaign all the way to the Democratic convention at Philadelphia in July. He said neither he nor Clinton will have won enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination by the end of the primary and caucuses on June 14.""It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night,"" Sanders said. ""Now I have heard reports that Secretary Clinton has said it's all going to be over on Tuesday night. I have reports that the media, after the New Jersey results come in, are going to declare that it is all over. That simply is not accurate.""In other words,"" he added, ""the Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention."""

Bernie Sanders' campaign issued the following statement Sunday on long lines at polling places in Puerto Rico's Democratic Party presidential primary election:""Some Puerto Rico Democratic officials are claiming that the Sanders campaign requested fewer polling places in today's primary contest. That's completely false. The opposite is true. In emails with the party, Sanders' staff asked the party to maintain the 1,500 plus presidential primary locations promised by the Puerto Rico Democratic party in testimony before the DNC in April, when the party was asking to have its caucus changed to a primary. They cannot blame their shoddy running of the primary on our campaign. This is just one example of irregularities going on in Puerto Rico voting today.

She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then.
