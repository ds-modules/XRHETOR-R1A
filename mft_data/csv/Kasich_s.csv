John Kasich,R,s,"August 23, 2015",Statement by Ohio Governor John Kasich Congratulating Ukraine on 24 Years of Freedom and Independence,"OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH CONGRATULATES UKRAINE ON 24 YEARS OF FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCERepeats Call for U.S. to Provide Ukraine Defensive ArmsToday Ohio Gov. John R. Kasich congratulated the people of Ukraine as they celebrate their 24th Independence Day tomorrow, and pledged to work with them so they have many, many more to come.Kasich issued the following statement:""I congratulate the people of Ukraine, the one million Americans of Ukrainian heritage and your friends and supporters around the world on 24 years of independence for Ukraine. Ukraine has come so far in a short time and I share the pride I know you feel.""Strong U.S. support for Ukraine is critically important, especially as we see the country that feels 'threatened' by a strong, Western-looking Ukraine trying to undermine itby proxies and even direct intervention. That is unacceptable. The repeated violations of the Minsk ceasefire protocols must stop, efforts to erode the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine must stop and Crimea and Donbas must be returned to Ukraine.""In response to these challenges to Ukraine's independence, and the fact that Russia continues to arm forces hostile to Ukraine, the United States must do everything in its power to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself. Congress gave the President the authority help arm Ukraineby large bipartisan majorities but its requests to the U.S. for help have been denied. The Obama Administration has even gone a step further and prohibited the sale of the defensive weapons systems Ukraine urgently needs.""This must stop and we must help Ukraine protect its independence. That means providing the anti-tank, anti-aircraft and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems it needs.""The hostilities must end and all parties must do what they have promised. The restoration of Crimea and Donbas to their rightful places as part of Ukraine must be negotiated in a way that's acceptable to all parties. I reject any attempt to resolve the conflict bilaterally or multilaterally without the full participation of the Ukrainian government.""The Ukrainian independence we celebrate today is an important fact, and the United States has a moral obligation to help protect it. Congratulations on your freedom Ukrainemay there be a thousand more days just like this one. Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam Slava!"""
John Kasich,R,s,"November 14, 2015",Statement by Governor John Kasich Calling for the U.S. to Immediately Work with Allies to Destroy ISIS in the Wake of Paris Attacks,"John Kasich Calls for the U.S. to Immediately Work with Allies to Destroy ISIS in the Wake of Paris Attacks Today, in his second comments following the terrorist attacks in Paris yesterday, Ohio Governor John Kasich called on the United States to immediately work with our allies to destroy ISIS.Today, Kasich issued the following statement:""Yesterday evening's Islamic terrorist attack on Paris is an attack on us all.""The victims of this attack and their families are in our prayers and deserve our heart-felt sympathy.""America should offer our French ally every assistance in tracking down and eliminating the perpetrators of this abomination.""As French President Hollande said, this is an act of war.""Just as France did for us in aftermath of the infamous 9/11 attacks, we should invoke Article 5, the mutual defense clause, of the North Atlantic Treaty.""After the events of Fort Hood and Chattanooga, here in the U.S., it is very easy to imagine that the tragic events that occurred in Paris last night could occur here, on our own shores.""Last night I said these horrific events in Paris must serve as a wake-up call telling us that America and its friends and allies must become more aggressive in taking on ISIS, because our very way of life is under serious threat.""America must strengthen its intelligence efforts to prevent such attacks  especially by terrorists who might already be here in America.""We must immediately intensify intelligence collaboration with our allies in order to identify, track and apprehend all foreign ISIS fighters.""To stem the flow of refugees into Europe, together with our allies, we must create protected safe havens for civilian refugees on Syria's borders and enforce them with no fly zones.""As President, I would immediately summon an emergency meeting at the highest level to begin working with our European, Turkish, and Sunni Arab allies to contain and ultimately defeat ISIS in its homeland.'Time is of the essence. We cannot afford to await the outcome of the Presidential election in a year's time before being able to act.""I urge the President to get on this now  in a much more assertive and consequent manner than we have seen from his administration to date.""Kasich first addressed the terrorist attacks at a Town Hall in Laconia, New Hampshire last night. Video of those remarks can be found here.Kasich first called for a coalition to destroy ISIS in early February.In early October, he called for the creation of safe havens in Syria to protect civilians, enforced by no-fly zones."
John Kasich,R,s,"December 7, 2015",Statement by Governor John Kasich in Response to President Obama's National Remarks on Terrorism,"STATEMENT: Gov. John Kasich's Response to President Obama's National Remarks on TerrorismTonight, Ohio Governor John Kasich issued the following statement in response to President Obama's remarks on the recent terrorist attacks:""The President's strategy is not enough. Without taking the fight to ISIS on the ground, ISIS won't be defeated. Since February I've been calling for a coalition to do that. We must stop delaying and do it. We delayed in helping the Syrian rebels and look where it got us, and when we decided to act it was too little. Bolder action across the board is needed because our way of life is what's at stake. Also, when terrorists threaten us, our response can't be to target our own constitutional rights. Our rights aren't the problem, our unwillingness to act to defeat extremists is the problem. We need to decisively and aggressively protect our nation and our ideals. We can't delay."""

John Kasich released the following statement in response to the State of the Union address delivered by President Obama on January 12, 2016:""We're going to cut taxes, balance the budget and get government out of the way so every American can rise. We're also going to strengthen our military and renew our alliances to proclaim the values of the civilized world and stand up to extremists and bullies. On-the-job training in this presidency has marched us down a trail of failure and left America weaker, divided and adrift. That's going to end and by working together we're going to fight, win and succeed."""
John Kasich,R,s,"February 7, 2016",Statement by Governor John Kasich: North Korea's Missile Launch is Unacceptable,"Today John Kasich made the following statement in response to North Korea's reported missile launch:""North Korea's missile launch is completely unacceptable and not only violates Security Council resolutions but further signals that this rogue regime has no interest in constructive, normal international relations. The United States must act decisively to contain this threat by deploying anti-missile systems that protect our regional allies, and by banning North Korea from the world financial system so it can't profit from its missile sales. The Obama Administration's do-nothing policy toward North Korea is failing and must be reversed by standing up to the world's bullies to project American power, protect our way of life and promote stability in an increasingly chaotic world."""
John Kasich,R,s,"March 12, 2016",Statement by Governor John Kasich on Violence at Chicago Trump Rally,"Tonight the seeds of division that Donald Trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly. Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen. I urge people to resist that temptation and rise to a higher level. Now is the time for Americans to come together and stand firm for what we know is true: we are great because we are a peaceful people who live by the rule of law. We are stronger together, we will reject those who try to divide us for personal gain and we will do it the right wayat the ballot box."

John Kasich released the following statement in response to today's terrorist attacks in Brussels:I want to express my solidarity with the people of Belgium in the aftermath of the attacks that took place in Brussels. Along with every American, I am sickened by the pictures of the carnage, by the injuries and by the loss of life.The wave of terror that has been unleashed in Europe and elsewhere around the world are attacks against our very way of life and against the democratic values upon which our political systems have been built.We and our allies must rededicate ourselves to these values of freedom and human rights. We must utterly reject the use of deadly acts of terror.We must also redouble our efforts with our allies to identify, root out and destroy the perpetrators of such acts of evil. We must strengthen our alliances as our way of life and the international system that has been built on our common values since the end of the Second World War comes under challenge from these and other actors of evil. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the attacks and with the people of Belgium."
John Kasich,R,s,"March 27, 2016",Statement by Governor John Kasich on the Terrorist Attack in Pakistan,"Gov. John Kasich released the following statement in response to today's terrorist attack in Lahore, Pakistan:The cowardly mass execution of innocent women and children, reportedly including Christian families, on Easter Sunday in Lahore, Pakistan is an outrage. Coming on the heels of the terrorist attacks in Belgium, it is further confirmation that radical terrorists are at war with our culture, our values and our way of life.This type of terrorism is an existential threat to all who share our values. It must be defeated.The need for a strong America is greater than ever, and we must rise to the challenge. When America retreats or shows weakness, the entire world shudders.We must redouble our efforts with Pakistan to identify and eliminate terrorists groups, which Pakistan now recognizes pose a dire threat to its own national security as well.Let us remember the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers as we gather strength and resolve to defeat all who threaten our values."
John Kasich,R,s,"March 31, 2016",Statement by Governor John Kasich on Recent Comments by Donald Trump,"Today Gov. Kasich issued the following statement in response to recent comments made by Donald Trump:""The past 24 hours revealed in the clearest way yet that Donald Trump is not prepared to be President. On top of all his previous inflammatory statements, yesterday he proposed punishing women who receive abortions, attacked the Geneva Conventions and said he'd nominate Supreme Court justices based on who will look into Hillary Clinton's email scandal.Donald Trump is not ready to be Commander in Chief. He talks loosely about the use of nuclear weapons and of dismantling NATO. America is facing major challenges at home and abroad and cannot afford to elect a President who does not respect the seriousness of the office.Since the beginning of the campaign, I have focused on uniting our country and finding solutions to the threats we are facing. I believe you can be a defender of life while respecting women, you can defend our country without alienating our allies and basic human rights and you win against Hillary Clinton without using outlandish rhetoric. As President, I will approach every day with the seriousness of purpose our country deserves."""
