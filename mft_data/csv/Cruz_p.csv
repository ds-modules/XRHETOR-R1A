Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 23, 2015",Press Release - Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz Speaks at Liberty University,"Texas Senator Makes Liberty University First Stop After Announcing CandidacyLYNCHBURG, VA  Earlier today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke to more than ten thousand students who packed the Vines Center Arena at Liberty University. Cruz made Liberty, the world's largest Christian University, his first stop after announcing his candidacy by video sent out to supporters and the media.Transcript of remarks as delivered:Ted Cruz: It's Time to Reignite the Promise of AmericaCourageous conservatives will stand for libertyThank you so much, President Falwell.God bless Liberty University.I am thrilled to join you today at the largest Christian university in the world.Today I want to talk with you about the promise of America.Imagine your parents and their children, imagine a little girl, growing up in Wilmington, Delaware, during World War Two, the daughter of Irish and Italian Catholic family, working class, her uncle ran numbers in Wilmington, she grew up with dozen of cousins because her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids, she had a difficult father, a man who drank far too much, and frankly didn't think women should be educated, and yet this young girl, pretty and shy, was driven, was bright, was inquisitive, and she became the first person in her family to go to college.In 1956, my mom, elenor, graduated from Rice University with a degree in math, and became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s and 1960s.Imagine a teenage boy. Not much younger than many of you here today. Growing up in Cuba. Jet black hair, skinny as a rail.Involved in student council and yet Cuba was not at a peaceful time. The dictator, Batista, was corrupt. He was oppressive. And this teenage boy joins a revolution. He joins a revolution against Batista. He begins fighting, with other teenagers, to free Cuba from the dictator. This boy at age 17 finds himself thrown in prison, finds himself tortured, beaten, and then at age 18, he flees Cuba. He comes to America.Imagine for a second the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to key west and got on a greyhound bus to head to Austin, Texas to begin working washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour. Coming to the one land on earth that has welcomed so many millions.When my dad came to America, in 1957, he could not have imagined what lay in store for him.Imagine a young married couple, living together in the 1970s, neither one of them has a personal relationship with Jesus. They have a little boy, and they're both drinking far too much. They're living a fast life. When I was three my father decided to leave my mother and me. We were living in Calgary at the time he got on a plane and flew back to Texas. He decided he didn't want to be married anymore and he didn't want to be a father to his three-year-old son.And yet when he was in Houston, a friend a colleague, from the oil and gas business invited him to a Bible study. Invited him to Clay Road Baptist church. And there my father gave his life to Jesus Christ. And God transformed his heart, and he drove to the airport, he bought a plane ticket, and he flew back to be with my mother and me.There are people who wonder if faith is real. I can tell you, in my family there is not a second of doubt because were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ I would have been saved and I would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household.Imagine another little girl, living in Africa, in Kenya and Nigeria. Playing with kids. They spoke Swahili, they spoke English. Coming back to California, where her parents, who had been missionaries in Africa raised her on the central coast. She starts a small business when she is in grade school, baking bread. She calls it, Heidi's bakery. She and her brother compete baking bread. They bake thousands of loaves of bread and go to the local apple orchard where they sell the bread to people coming to pick apples. She goes on to a career in business, excelling and rising to the highest pinnacles.And then Heidi becomes my wife and my very best friend in the world. Heidi becomes an incredible mom to our two precious little girls, Caroline and Catherine, the joys and loves of our lives.Imagine another teenage boy, being raised in Houston, hearing stories from his dad about prison and torture in Cuba. Hearing stories about how fragile liberty is, beginning to study the United States Constitution, learning about the incredible protections we have in this country that protect the God-given liberty of every American.Experiencing challenges at home. The mid 1980s oil prices crater. And his parents business go bankrupt. Heading off to school over a thousand miles away from home at a place where he knew nobody. Where he was alone and scared. And his parents going through bankruptcy meant there was no financial support at home. So at the age of 17 he went to get two jobs to help pay his way through school. He took over $100,000 in school loans. Loans, I suspect a lot of y'all can relate to. Loans that I will point out I just paid off a few years ago.These are all of our stories. These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.What is the promise of America? The idea that the, revolutionary idea, that this country was founded upon, which is that our rights, they don't come from man. They come from God Almighty. And that the purpose of the Constitution as Thomas Jefferson put it, is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government.What has enabled millions of people from all over the world to come to America with nothing and to achieve anything. And then, the American exceptionalism that has made this nation a clarion voice for freedom in the world, a shining city on a hill. That's the promise of America. That is what makes this is nation an indispensable nation, a unique nation in the history of the world. And yet so many fear that, that promise is today unattainable. So many fear it is slipping away from our hands. I want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of America.240 years ago on this very day a 38-year-old lawyer named Patrick Henry stood up just 100 miles from here in Richmond, Virginia, and said, 'give me liberty or give me death.' I want to ask each of you to imagine, imagine millions of courageous conservatives all across America rising up together to say in unison, we demand our liberty. Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren't voting.They're staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values. Today, millions of young people are scared, worried about the future, worried what the future will hold. Imagine millions of young people coming together and standing together saying, 'we will stand for liberty.' Think just how different the world would be. Imagine, instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth.Instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers, imagine, small businesses growing and prospering. Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers. Imagine innovation thriving on the Internet as government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay and more and more opportunity is created. Imagine America finally becoming energy self-sufficient as millions and millions of high-paying jobs are created.Five years ago today the President signed Obamacare into law. Within hours Liberty University went to court filing a lawsuit to stop that failed law. Instead of the joblessness, instead of the millions forced into part-time work, instead of the millions who have lost their health insurance, lost their doctors, have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums, imagine in 2017 a new President, signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare.Imagine health care reform that keeps government out of the way between you and your doctor and that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation, that imposes burdens on families struggling to make ends meet, imagine a simple, flat tax. That lets every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard.Imagine abolishing the IRS. Instead of the lawlessness, and the President 's unconstitutional executive amnesty, imagine a President that finally, finally, finally, secures the borders. And imagine a legal immigration system that welcomes and celebrates those who come to achieve the American dream. Instead of a federal government that wages an assault on our religious liberty, that goes after Hobby Lobby, that goes after the Little Sisters of the Poor, that goes after Liberty University.Imagine a federal government that stands for the first amendment rights of every American. Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage. Instead of a government that works to undermine our second amendment right, that seeks to ban our ammunition, imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans.Instead of a government that seizes your emails and your cell phones, imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every American. Instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through common core. Imagine repealing every word of common core. Imagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation. That every single child, regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of wealth or zip code, every child in America has a right to a quality education. And that's true from all of the above, whether it is a public schools or charter schools or private schools or Christian schools, or parochial schools or homeschools, every child.Instead of a President who boycotts Prime Minister Netanyahu, imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel. Instead of a President who seeks to go to the United Nations to end-run congress and the American people. Imagine a President who says, I will honor the Constitution and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.Imagine a President who says, we will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. And we will call it by its name. We will defend the United States of America. Now all of these seem difficult. Indeed to some they may seem unimaginable. And yet if you look in the history of our country.Imagine it is 1775 and you and I were sitting there in Richmond listening to Patrick Henry say, 'give me liberty or give me death.'Imagine it is 1776, and we were watching the 54 signers of the Declaration of Independence, stand together and pledge their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to igniting the promise of America.Imagine it was 1777, and we were watching General Washington as he lost battle after battle after battle in the freezing cold as his soldiers with no shoes, were dying, fighting for freedom against the most powerful army in the world. That too seemed unimaginable.Imagine it is 1933 and we were listening to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tell America at a time of crushing depression, at a time of a gathering storm abroad, that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.Imagine it is 1979 and you and I were listening to Ronald Reagan and he was telling us, that we would cut the top marginal tax rate from 70% all the way down to 28%. That we would go from crushing stagnation to booming economic growth, to millions being lifted out of poverty and into prosperity and abundance. That the very day he was sworn in, our hostages who were languishing in Iran would be released. And that within a decade, we would win the cold war and tear the Berlin wall to the ground.That would have seemed unimaginable and yet with the grace of God that's exactly what happened. From the dawn of this country, at every stage America has enjoyed God's providential blessing over and over again when we faced impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge. Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS, ain't all that tough.The power of the American people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds.If you're ready, to join a grassroots army across this nation, coming together and standing for liberty, I'm going to ask you to break a rule here today and to take out your cell phones. And to text the word, 'constitution', to the number 33733. You can also text 'imagine.' We're versatile. Once again, text 'constitution', to 33733. God's blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation. And I believe God isn't done with America yet.I believe in you. I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America. And that is why today, I am announcing that I am running for President of the United States.It is a time for truth. It is a time for liberty.It is a time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States. I am honored to stand with each and every one of you. Courageous conservatives. As we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children, and our children's children we stand together for liberty.This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington it will come from only the men and women across this country from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution, it will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country.When the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill, that is the United States of America. Thank you and God Bless you!"

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 28, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI: Liberty University Student: ""Cruz Inspired Us""","Writes article for Townhall.com about Sen. Cruz's appeal to millennial generationHOUSTON, Texas  On Monday, March 23, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. Below is an article posted in Townhall.com featuring a student's perspective of his speech that day at Liberty University, notably:Cruz did an excellent job weaving a story. He told us a story of hope, the story of our liberty. He dared us to imagine America as the Founders intended, an America based on our Constitution with the freedom that comes from a limited government. He spoke of this date in history more than 200 years ago when Patrick Henry gave his famous, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" speech. The senator reminded us that we, too, must demand our liberty. He took the cause of liberty and made it tangible through telling the story of America.In addition, Cruz inspired us; millennials long for hope and a belief that we can still do great things. The senator inspired us by defining the promise of America as being able ""to come to America with nothing and achieve anything.""Below is partial text of the article, the entire version may be viewed here.The Next 'Greatest Generation': A Millennial's Perspective on Ted CruzTownhall.comAshley TraficantMar 27, 2015Monday morning I sat among 10,000 of my peers as Sen. Ted Cruz announced his bid for the Republican nomination for president at my school, Liberty University. As a senior in Liberty's Helms School of Government I was thrilled to witness a presidential hopeful announce his candidacy.I went into Cruz's speech with a basic understanding of who he is and what his political views are, but without much of an opinion as to whether or not he is someone I would vote for. As you can imagine, I was eager to hear his platform and see how he would frame his message for a college audience.There are 80 million of us ""millennials,"" a significant portion of the voting population. This is a fact I'm sure Cruz considered when he asked to make his announcement at Liberty.After his speech I managed to work my way through the crowd to ask Cruz how he plans to appeal to millennials. He told me that he wants to convey a message of hope, of getting back to the promise of America, and reigniting the promise of America.""What I'm trying to do right now, more than anything, is energize and mobilize an army of courageous conservatives to understand that 'We the People' is where the power lies,"" he told me.Out of the 80 million people in my demographic, 50 percent identify as Independents. As he tries to recruit his base, it is important for Cruz to understand how to best reach my generation. Here are some things he needs to consider as he pursues that goal:Millennials cling to stories. We are very relational. Most of my peers do not know a lot about policy, but they care deeply about people. Give us a narrative, tell us a story, and inspire us to take up your cause.Cruz did an excellent job weaving a story. He told us a story of hope, the story of our liberty. He dared us to imagine America as the Founders intended, an America based on our Constitution with the freedom that comes from a limited government. He spoke of this date in history more than 200 years ago when Patrick Henry gave his famous, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" speech. The senator reminded us that we, too, must demand our liberty. He took the cause of liberty and made it tangible through telling the story of America.In addition, Cruz inspired us; millennials long for hope and a belief that we can still do great things. The senator inspired us by defining the promise of America as being able ""to come to America with nothing and achieve anything.""He acknowledged that many of us feel the promise of America has faded, but he reminded us our war for independence, WWI and WWII, and the Cold War all taught us how we could rise time and again in the name of liberty.Cruz wants to reignite the promise of America. He listed several of the challenges our country faces, including the economy, Islamic terrorism, health care, and immigration. Instead of framing these issues as nebulous problems, he set them up as challenges we can overcome if we get back to our roots. Millennials respond to hope, we respond to a call to action. We are dreamers who want not only to believe in a better world but also help create it. Cruz painted a picture of liberty as intended by our forefathers and called on us to imagine reclaiming that heritage through a return to our founding principles.The full text of this article may be viewed here."

It will run at a time when Cruz is the only announced candidate for president for 2016 and several polls show him ""vault[ing] into the top tier of GOP contenders,"" as one news outlet put it. Cruz made his announcement on March 23 speaking at Liberty University, the world's largest Christian university.'Killing Jesus' first ran on the National Geographic cable channel with 3.7 million viewers tuning in. The Fox News airing of 'Killing Jesus' is expected to draw a similarly large Christian audience.The ad from Cruz for President pulls from several personal moments Cruz spoke about during the announcement speech at Liberty University and conveys the story of how the transformative love of Jesus Christ reunited a son with his father.TRANSCRIPT""Were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household.""""God's blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation.""""Over and over again, when we faced impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge.""""This is our fight, and that is why I'm running for President of the United States.""""I'm Ted Cruz, and I approve this message."""

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today addressed the John Locke Foundation Luncheon where he highlighted the disintegration of America's leadership on the world stage under the foreign policy of President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.""President Obama and Secretary Clinton have had their chance,"" Sen. Cruz said. ""Their policies do not work. Leading from behind is a dismal failure. We need a new track. We need to get back to the principles that made America strong. We need to restore America's leadership.""In his remarks, Cruz noted numerous instances of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policies and offered priorities that the United States must pursue in order to restore America's leadership in the world.""We need new leadership in Washington that doesn't just start with symbolic steps, but it starts by making clear that America will stand with our friends and stand up to our enemies. It starts by making clear that America will stand unshakably with the nation of Israel, and that we will use every lever at our disposal to prevent the United Nations from undermining the sovereignty of our nation. And it means standing up to bad guys, such as making clear to brutal dictators like the Castros in Cuba, that billions in economic relief will not flow until real reforms and freedom occur.""Cruz concluded his remarks with words of encouragement, ""We've seen great challenges before. And every time we've seen great challenges, with God's providential blessing, the American people have risen to the occasion.""Excerpts of Cruz's remarks highlighting the failures of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy are included below:We saw during the Green Revolution, as people poured to the streets against the radical mullahs, President Obama and Sec Clinton decided the best course was to do nothing, to ignore the Green Revolution and allow the Iranians to crush it under their boot.We saw Nov 5, 2009, a terrorist attack on our homeland as Nidal Hasan in Fort Hood murdered 14 innocent souls including an unborn child. And we saw the administration classify that attack as workplace violence... Mind you, Nidal Hasan was communicating with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical terrorist, expressly asking about the permissibility of waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The federal government knew this and did nothing to prevent the terrorist attack that followed from that communication... Yet, to this day, this administration refuses to acknowledge this is radical Islamic terrorism.We saw the consequences of leading from behind in Libya. We saw red lines drawn and then dissolve in Syria, which meant every bad actor on earth took note that when this president speaks he doesn't mean what he says.We saw the unpunished murder of four Americans, including our Ambassador Chris Stevens, in Benghazi. And we saw the president and Secretary Clinton both go to the American people and not admit it was radical Islamic terrorism, but instead try to blame it on some silly internet video when they knew full well it was terrorists who had murdered those four Americans in Benghazi.We've seen letters and phone calls to the Iranian mullahs while American citizens languish in Iranian prisons.We've seen ISIS dismissed as the Junior Varsity of radical Sunni terrorists.We've seen Yemen and Somalia hailed as models of successful counter-terrorism... if you were to pick out two countries that are in greater chaos from the disaster of [this administration's] counter-terrorism policy, it would be difficult to find.We've seen the president make nice with Raul Castro and with Maduro.We've seen an Egyptian president Al-Sisi having the courage to call out radical Islamic terrorism, and yet an administration not willing to stand up and speak with the same courage.We've seen the terrorist attack in Paris described by the president as a random act of violence. There is nothing random when Islamists come in with butcher knives to a kosher deli to murder Jews because of their faith  it is a naked act of anti Semitism.We've seen 21 Coptic Christians on their knees beheaded by ISIS, and White House statement saying they were killed because of their Egyptian citizenship.We saw just over a week ago 14 Christians in Kenya systematically slaughtered. Al-Shabab, the radical terrorists there inquired person by person what their faith was, if they were Muslims they were spared, if they were Christians, they were slaughtered.We cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a President who is unwilling to utter the words ""radical Islamic terrorism""We have seen President Obama, Secretary Clinton and Secretary Kerry systematically unravel, undermine and attack our friendship and alliance with the nation of Israel.President Obama recently had time to pal around with Raul Castro, but yet he could not be bothered to sit down and talk with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he came to America.These episodes aren't isolated events. They are part of a broader problem. Part of an inability or unwillingness to recognize the threats to this country (9:40)What are the fruits of the Obama-Clinton approach to the world? Well, today Iran has 19,000 active centrifuges up from 5,000. The best we've been able to do is negotiate a terrible deal that will pave the way to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons  the single greatest national security threat facing this country.ISIS today controls a territory the size of Great Britain and is savagely murdering Americans, Israelis, British citizens, Japanese, Jordanians, and Egyptian Coptic Christians.Putin has consolidated his gains in Georgia, has invaded our ally Ukraine while we stood by and did nothing, has annexed Crimea, and is eyeing further expansion in to NATO members such as the Baltics.Our staunchest Middle East ally Israel faces unprecedented isolation, and international institutions that can no longer rely onChina is on a campaign of territorial expansion, the intent of which is to kick America out of the Pacific.And the American military has been undermined by years of aggressive cuts while money has been poured into economic stimulus programs that didn't work, entitlement programs  like Obamacare  that have exploded the deficit and undermined our ability to protect this nation.President Obama and Secretary Clinton have had their chance. Their policies do not work. Leading from behind is a dismal failure. We need a new track. We need to get back to the principles that made America strong. We need to restore America's leadership."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 17, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Adam Carolla: I love me some Ted Cruz,"Sen. Ted Cruz joins the Adam Carolla ShowHOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined the Adam Carolla Show  the number one podcast in the world  to discuss tax reform, patent reform, and his presidential race.Afull transcript is below.The Adam Carolla ShowFriday, April 17, 2015CRUZ: Great to be with you Adam.CAROLLA: Great to be with you, man. Thank you so much for calling in and thank you so much for wanting to eliminate the IRS. It's driving me nuts.CRUZ: Well, April 16th is a day when a whole lot of folks, you know, moving to a simple flat tax and just padlocking the IRS  I think that is a powerful populist issue. And today is a day when it's on people's minds.CAROLLA: Well if you want to talk about an issue, and here we are always talking about, you know, gay rights, or immigration, or whatever it is, the transgendered community or something, fine, but that doesn't impact the entire country.BALD BRYAN: Literally everyone.CAROLLA: This impacts hopefully literally everyone who's born into this country so it is a good place to start in terms of policy. Senator, you tell me. It seems weird when politicians get really caught up in nothing, and they're missing sort of the big picture. Why do they do that?CRUZ: Well, a lot of times what politicians are trying to do is distract the voters with smoke and mirrors rather than talk about the issues that really matter to their lives.CAROLLA: So what would you do, and I always hear about the flat tax and all that kind of stuff. And of course we should, everybody should champion this cause because the poor people are saying hey man, I'M tired of rich folk not paying their fair share or even paying taxes. Can I tell you, by the way, Senator, as a rich folk, I am devastated. I grew up my entire life with poor people going, well you know as soon as you're get rich you just buy a windmill and write it off and you don't pay a penny in taxes. I get reamed for taxes quarterly. Like, it's not once a year. Four times a year I just get punished and pummeled. I had no idea it was going to be like this.CRUZ: Well, and the sad reality is much of the political rhetoric you hear is just not true. So for example, the Democrats love to say the Republicans are the party of the rich. But here's the truth of the matter. The rich do just fine under big government. Big business does fantastic under big government. It gets in bed with big government, has armies of lawyers and lobbyists and accountants. The people who are getting hammered are the people who are struggling. Right now today  this is an astonishing statistic  the top 1 percent, the millionaires and billionaires that the president loves to demagogue, earn a higher share of our national income today than any year since 1928. The rich have done well under big government. But you know who's getting hammered?CAROLLA: I gotta vote Democrat. Sorry, who's getting hammered?CRUZ: But the people who are getting hammered are young people, they're Hispanics, they're African Americans, they're single moms. They're people who are struggling to achieve the American Dream. They're people like my dad who 57 years ago, fled Cuba with nothing. Couldn't speak English. Had $100 in his underwear, and washed dishes making 50 cents an hour. Those are the people getting hammered right now.CAROLLA: Well, what's different back, versus then versus now. Versus your father's America when he came here from Cuba. How'd he get here from Cuba? You could do it back then, right?CRUZ: He came legally, he came on a student visa. He had fought in the Cuban revolution. He actually fought with Fidel Castro. Now he didn't know Castro was a communist and none of the kids fighting did. They just knew Batista was a cruel and oppressive dictator. When he was a teenager, Batista's thugs threw him in prison and beat him halfway to death. And he fled to go to the University of Texas in 1957.CAROLLA: So what is different between your father's America and our America in 2015?CRUZ: Well if you look to American history and American economic history, you can see a clear cause and effect. Every time the federal government pursues the policies of out of control spending and taxes and regulations, the result is economic stagnation, and misery and malaise. The result is people who are struggling find it harder and harder to achieve the American Dream.On the flip side, every time we pursue the policies of tax reform and regulatory reform  lessening the burden of Washington on hard working Americans  the result is incredible economic growth. That was true in the 1920s, it was true in the 1960s, it was true in the 1980s.What we've got to get back to  you know, you think of the young people right now are coming out of school and they're up to their eyeballs in debt, and they're scared, are they going to get a job. Are they going start getting skills towards a career or are the going to work part time as a barista at Starbucks?We've got to get back to an environment  an environment like my dad saw as a teenager coming out of the University of Texas where young people can come out and have two, three, four, five job opportunities. Begin building skills to build a career. And the way you do that is getting Washington off of the back of small businesses so they can create jobs and opportunities so young people can have a better future.CAROLLA: Well, I know especially living here in California and so many businesses fled to your state of Texas because it just becomes impossible to tell everyone  the Joel McHale  you know, I don't like to namedrop, Senator, but Joel McHale, friend of mine, from The Soup and many movies. He's from Washington State  I think is where he's from  but he bought a house up in the Hollywood Hills and he knows I'm a former contractor and he said 'Hey, I'm putting a pool in the back yard. I'm gonna put a pool in the back yard.' And I just said, 'good luck.' And he said, 'What do you mean?' And I said, 'next time I see you in a few months tell me how that's going.' And he got back to me a few months later and I said, 'how's that pool going?' And he's like, 'Ah g**d**.' I said, 'What?' And he said, 'A soils report, an environmental impact report, tests' and kept going and going and going.He said, I couldn't afford a $400,000 pool in my back yard. And I said, 'Well, what are you doing?' And he said, the kids use the neighbors'. There's a gay couple across the street. They use the gay guy's pool.' And I said, 'Good!' The contractor doesn't get the work. The guy who manufactures the rebar doesn't get the work. The guy who makes the Gunite doesn't get to work. The pool man who's going to be servicing that pool weekly does not have a gig. Everyone's lose-lose. And I drove Bryan Cranston to the airport. He's shooting Breaking Bad in New Mexico. Supposed to be in Riverside. He's leaving. Pool guy's leaving. Everyone's leaving. So should we get some more regulation going?CRUZ: Well, I guess you can be glad that at least Cranston didn't bring the Mexican drug cartels to shoot up Riverside.CAROLLA: That's good.BALD BRYAN: Speaking of government helping small business, Ted Cruz, you know what you guys can do, especially in Texas, is patent reform. Cause you know that is where all the patent trolls go to take people to court because it is very favorable for them. What is your take on that?CRUZ: You know, I think it is very important to do two things at the same time with regard to patent reform. That number one, we need to limit abusive litigation. And I've long been an opponent of trial lawyers abusing the system to enrich themselves at the expense of job creators.CAROLLA: Thank you. I got sued. Yes.CRUZ: But two, I think it's important to protect intellectual property. And so you've got to make sure innovators  people who are inventing and designing new technologies have the ability to protect their IP. And so it's a balance in terms of how you reform it. And you want to do both at the same time.CAROLLA: Well, where do you come down, and then I'll ask you about taxes and let you get on with your busy day, which I'm sure is very hectic, but I want to know. I feel, Senator, that we make rules, and then they get away from us, and we end up hurting ourselves with our rules. It's like you go through the airport. You see the 68 year old elderly woman going through the metal detector having to be carried because we can't push her wheelchair through it and at some point somebody yells at her to take her shoes off and put them through the scanner, and it's like, why are we doing this to ourselves? Why?Yes, there should be rules that protect innovation. There shouldn't be guys who hang their shingle in Lubbock, Texas, and sue everybody around them to just get paid off for the threat of taking them to court. Why? Can we let common sense start trickling back into the land that is built on common sense?CRUZ: Well, I think we need to and part of the problem is, the way Washington works right now, is that Washington is fundamentally broken. That we've got  I've said a lot of times I think the biggest divide we have politically in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats. The biggest divide we've got is between career politicians in Washington in both parties, and the American people.And I think the central issue that's going to be facing this country in 2016 and in the elections is do you want Washington playing a bigger and bigger role in your life? Or do you want more freedom, more opportunity to get back to the Constitution and get Washington out of our life? And part of the problem when legislation on patent reform or anything else comes up, is right now the way Washington resolves it, it's a battle of the lobbyists, whoever has the most lobbyists ends up getting elected officials rushing to hand out special favors. We need to make government less and less relevant in our lives and have as much decision-making as possible being made by individual citizens, by each of us, rather than some unelected bureaucrat in Washington.CAROLLA: I concur. And you know, you've got Hillary Clinton on one side, you got Jeb Bush on the other, what do you think of the two?CRUZ: Oh look, I like Jeb Bush, I think he was a good governor in Florida. I think people are going to have to make a choice of whether they want to elect someone who's going to continue business as usual in Washington, who's going to continue to grow government, grow government spending and power and debt, or whether they are going to have someone who's going to stand with the people and who's willing to stand up to both parties in Washington. You know, if you want someone who will go along to get along, there are a lot of choices in this election...CAROLLA: Jeb Bush being one of them, perhaps?CRUZ: You know I'll let the voters figure that out and assess the record of each of ours. But I'll tell you my time in the Senate, what I've tried to do more than anything else is number one tell the truth and number two, do what I said I would do. And for that reason, you know when we launched our campaign for President three weeks ago, the New York Times explained that 'Cruz cannot win because the Washington elites despise him...'CAROLLA: That's the greatest compliment ever right?CRUZ: There you go that's the central point of our campaign. If you want the Washington elites, go with someone else, but if you want to change things, then we've got to be willing to stand up and say 'this doesn't make any sense.'CAROLLA: This just in, Hitler and Charles Manson, not a fan of Ted Cruz. I don't know if you know that. Put that on the bumper sticker. TedCruz.org is where you go if you want to support Ted, I want to support Ted, I love me some Ted Cruz and I just finally want to ask, I've heard all about the flat tax, I just don't know how it would be implemented and what the rate would be and how it would work, so could you coach me up just a little bit?CRUZ: So, I have laid out broad principles, we have not yet rolled out a specific tax plan, we are developing it right now so we will be rolling it out in the coming months. But what I've said is that we should have a simple flat tax that is fair, that lets every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard. So it's a simple rate that applies to everyone. And, which would enable us  number one, it would reduce hundreds of billions of dollars of compliance costs that people are paying all across this country. Number two, it would produce enormous economic growth. But number three, it would enable us to abolish the IRS  to get government out of our lives in a very fundamental way.And the most potent reason to support a flat tax is it reduces the power of Washington politicians. Right now, where lobbyists in Washington focus the most is on special tax exemptions and loopholes. There are more words in the IRS code today than there are in the Bible. If you've got a flat tax that applies to everyone, that means politicians have less power to extract favors and to extort the private sector. It keeps power where it belongs, with the American people.CAROLLA: That is a very good note to go out on. TedCruz.org is where you go if you want to know anything about Ted and contribute, and find out about him. Very impressive background, by the way, very impressive story. Senator, thank you very much for phoning in.CRUZ: Thank you my friend, God bless you.CAROLLA: God bless you. Senator Ted Cruz, everybody."

See excerpt below, and the full op-ed may be viewed here.Putting Congress in Charge on TradeWall Street JournalBy Ted Cruz and Paul RyanBut Congress can't just take the administration's word that it will drive a hard bargain. We have to hold it accountable, and that is what trade-promotion authority will help do.Under TPA, Congress lays out three basic requirements for the administration. First, it must pursue nearly 150 specific negotiating objectives, like beefing up protections for U.S. intellectual property or eliminating kickbacks for government-owned firms. Second, the administration must consult regularly with Congress and meet high transparency standards.And third, before anything becomes law, Congress gets the final say. The Constitution vests all legislative power in Congress. So TPA makes it clear that Congressand only Congresscan change U.S. law. If the administration meets all the requirements, Congress will give the agreement an up-or-down vote. But if the administration fails, Congress can hit the brakes, cancel the vote and stop the agreement.Read the full op-ed here."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 29, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI: Washington Times: Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, stars as 2016 campaign supersurrogate","HOUSTON, Texas  The Washington Times recently published a profile of Sen. Ted Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz. In the article, the Washington Times notes:Sen. Ted Cruz has one advantage in the 2016 Republican presidential field that no one else can match: He essentially can be two places at one time thanks to the stardom of his father as a supersurrogate on the campaign trail......To political activists who have followed his son's career, Mr. Cruz has become a familiar and often celebrated figure. Two years ago, the elder Cruz introduced his senator son before a Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, and afterwards attendees were buzzing more about the father than the son.The full article is below and may be viewed here.Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, stars as 2016 campaign super surrogateBy Kelly RiddellThe Washington TimesMonday, April 27, 2015Sen. Ted Cruz has one advantage in the 2016 Republican presidential field that no one else can match: He essentially can be two places at one time thanks to the stardom of his father as a supersurrogate on the campaign trail.Rafael Cruz, 76, a pastor, has become a celebrity with the tea party, evangelical activists, local GOP chairmen and radio talk shows. In the last 18 months alone, the elder Cruz has spoken at more than 60 pastors' conferences, not including keynoting dozens of local Republican chapter dinners, home-school events and official campaign stops.""We are at a point where we are seeing for the first time in the history of the United States many people worried their children will inherit a lesser America than they inherited  that has never happened in America,"" Rafael Cruz told The Washington Times. ""We need a strong constitutional conservative to move this country back to the right path, just like Ronald Reagan was able to do in 1980.""And, of course, like any proud father, he feels that his son should be that Reagan heir.Rafael Cruz became a key surrogate on his son's 2012 senatorial campaign, and now he's full-time with his new job as campaigner in chief. He's part political scout, event surrogate, consultant, fundraiser, media personality, political bomb-thrower, mentor and get-out-the vote generator.The elder Cruz doesn't get paid by the campaign; he's a volunteer. But sometimes the campaign picks up his father's expenses. In 2012-13, for instance, the elder Cruz was reimbursed $16,700 in travel expenses and mileage by his son's campaign. Other times, the elder Cruz is hosted by a church or other group and is reimbursed for expenses or paid an honorarium.There is no requirement the elder Mr. Cruz disclose what he is paid from private groups, and to date neither he nor his son have offered an accounting. He said he often will stay in the home of one of his hosts to keep costs down and to get to know those he is coming to address.""I love staying at people's homes because I get to develop relationships with those people, and it is actually  life is all about relationships,"" Rafael Cruz told The Times. ""I know there are people who would rather have the privacy of a hotel room, but I don't want to be staring at four walls at a hotel room. I'd rather be sitting around a kitchen table, having a cup of coffee and chatting with a family and getting to know them.""White-haired, with wire-trimmed glasses and a crisp pressed suit, he is charismatic and relishes debate, even controversy.""I would say if we are not being criticized, then perhaps we are not making an impact,"" Mr. Cruz said about he and his son's impassioned beliefs. ""But we have to speak the truth. The truth will come out.""In March BuzzFeed released an article entitled: ""The 68 most controversial things Ted Cruz's dad has ever said,"" which included saying Fidel Castro used the same ""hope and change"" language as President Obama and other politically incorrect, oftentimes misquoted, items that have made the elder Cruz a target of the left.""Well, actually I started to read that article and got down to No. 27, and I said 'Well, I'll say every one of those things again!' So I stopped reading,"" the elder Cruz laughed. ""They call outrageous that we need to abide by the Constitution, that we need to follow the rule of law, honor separation of powers. This president is acting like an imperial president making laws by executive order. If those are outrageous statements, I stand by them.""To political activists who have followed his son's career, Mr. Cruz has become a familiar and often celebrated figure. Two years ago, the elder Cruz introduced his senator son before a Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, and afterwards attendees were buzzing more about the father than the son.""You can tell a lot about a person by the father that they have  what kind of cloth are they cut from. I think Ted is hugely benefited by Rafael willing to go on the circuit with him and for him,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader group and a Republican kingmaker in Iowa. ""Rafael's is a compelling story  it's an American story.""In the speech at the summit, and many times since, the elder Cruz spoke about coming to America at 18 in order to flee the dictatorship of Batista's Cuba. With only $100 sewn into his underwear, he took a boat to America and rode a bus for two days to Austin, Texas, where he was accepted to study at the University of Texas on a student visa. He got a job washing dishes for 50 cents an hour and taught himself English by going to the movies.Eventually, Mr. Cruz worked his way through school, earning a degree in math and chemical engineering, and started an oil and gas exploration company. After turning his life over to Christ, he recommitted himself to his wife and family and began teaching his son Ted about American exceptionalism, helping him memorize the Constitution, introducing him to free market scholars like Milton Friedman and ingraining in him that there is no better country to live in.After telling his story with the delivery of a seasoned pastor, Mr. Cruz stepped down from the stage in Iowa two years ago to thunderous applause and a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. His speech was so well received that the younger Mr. Cruz joked he was breaking one of his cardinal rules never to follow his dad.""Rafael's story is one of faith, family and freedom lived out,"" said Mr. Vander Plaats, who recalled the event and has since invited the elder Cruz to speak at other engagements. ""And Rafael has such a passionate way of telling it. He has a lot of wisdom. He's lived the American dream.""The elder Cruz started speaking to conservative activists when his son couldn't make a campaign event in 2012 in West Texas.""In the early months, we didn't have much of a campaign. One day, I couldn't make an event, so he [Rafael] drove out to West Texas alone  no staffers, nothing  and he spoke on my behalf,"" Ted Cruz said in a 2013 interview with the National Review. ""A few hours later, I called and asked how it went. He said, 'Even surrogates for the other candidates were asking for Cruz yard signs.'""The elder Cruz started getting politically active during the Carter administration, citing the stagflation, unemployment, gas shortages and weak foreign policy as his inspirations.In the early 1980s he joined the Religious Roundtable, a Judeo-Christian organization which, together with Moral Majority, founded by Jerry Falwell, worked to mobilize millions of Christians across the U.S. to help elect Ronald Reagan to office. It was Jerry Falwell's Liberty University where Ted Cruz made his presidential announcement.When the elder joined the state board of the Religious Roundtable, his son was about 10 years old. Dinner table discussions revolved around Republican politics, faith, the Constitution and the principles of democracy and the free markets, the father said.""You have to realize I came from a dictatorship. I came from seeing the impact of communism upon the country I was born in,"" the elder Cruz said. ""So I'm a constitutionalist, and so is he [Ted]. He grew up loving the Constitution.""Before Ted started high school, Mr. Cruz got his son involved with the Free Enterprise Institute through one of his business associates. Soon the younger Cruz was reading the works of Friedman, Hayek, Bastiat, Mises, the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers, Rafael recalls proudly. The group brought in a memory specialist and taught five students, including Ted, to memorize the Constitution, and then Rafael would quiz him.During the four years the younger Cruz went to high school, he'd tour Texas Rotary clubs  80, to be exact  where they would set up easels in front of the room for the students to write out the Constitution and give 30-minute speeches about free enterprise economics or U.S. founding principles.""So I'll tell you, before he [Ted] left high school, he was passionate about the constitution, about free markets, about limited government, about the rule of law,"" Rafael Cruz recalled. ""And that passion became like fire in his bones.""That's why the elder Cruz was thrown when, in high school, someone asked his son what he wanted to become, and he answered he'd like to go into computer science specializing in robotics or artificial intelligence.""I said, 'Ted, you're a people person. You'd be crazy locked up in a cubbyhole.' And I said, 'And all you talk about is the Constitution,'"" the elder Cruz recalled. ""And so he said, 'You know, you're right.' So off he went to Princeton to study public policy.""And so the elder Cruz went on to cheer him at big debate tournaments at Princeton, his graduation from Harvard Law School and his clerking for then-Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The father can recall all of his son's milestones  even the title of his school thesis and key parts of his recommendation letters  with loving admiration and pride. When the younger Cruz took his oath of office for U.S. Senate, his father cried.""It's really bone-chilling, when you think about it. Here's a man who has overcome such obstacles, and through his faith and commitment to the American cause, he has a son at the doorstep to the highest office in this land,"" said Robert Stovall, chairman of the Bexar County, Texas GOP, which has hosted Rafael to speak. ""As a father you must be so proud, and as a son you must be so proud of your father. It's just inspiring. You can hear it in their voices when they speak."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 29, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI: Sen. Cruz Op-Ed in The Washington Times: ""Congress Must Approve of Any Iran Deal""","WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote the following op-ed for The Washington Times about the necessity for Congress to have proper oversight over any deal President Obama might make with Iran. It must be the top priority for the Senate to be able to stop a bad Iran deal that jeopardizes U.S. national security.Full op-edmay be viewed here.Congress must approve of any Iran dealWashington TimesBy: Ted CruzApril 29, 2015Today, there is no greater threat to U.S. national security than the prospect of a nuclear Iran. Led by theocratic zealots who have pledged to ""annihilate Israel"" and who regularly lead chants of ""Death to America,"" an Iran with nuclear weapons poses an unacceptably high risk of murdering millions of Americans or millions of our allies.For that reason, the top priority for the Senate should be to stop a bad Iran deal.The Senate is now considering the Iran Nuclear Review Agreement Act (Corker-Cardin), which provides that any Iran deal must be submitted to Congress. This legislation started out with good intentions, and I supported moving it forward in committee. Indeed, I support anything that slows down the Obama administration's headlong rush into finalizing an Iran deal that jeopardizes U.S. national security.On the floor of the Senate, however, I intend to press vigorously for a critical amendment to this legislation. At the end of the debate, if this bill is not strengthened, I will have a great deal of difficulty supporting it.Right now, the President has statutory authority to relax some Iran sanctions, and he has the constitutional authority to try to negotiate with foreign nations any deal he desires. Yet we must remember that in order for any foreign deal to become binding U.S. law, there are two and only two paths under our Constitution: First, he can submit his proposal as a treaty to the Senate, which requires 67 votes for ratification. Or second, he can submit it as legislation, get a majority vote in both Houses of Congress, and then sign it into law.President Obama chafes at these constitutional requirements. The current Iran deal is so bad on the merits that he knows that it cannot meet either threshold. Hence, the Administration has suggested it wants to circumvent Congress, perhaps by trying to go the United Nations for ratification. But the UN, likewise, lacks the authority to create binding U.S. law. If it is not codified in a treaty or a statute, a UN resolution cannot bind the next President.So what does Corker-Cardin do? It requires the President to submit an Iran deal to Congress, and then it provides that Congress can pass a ""resolution of disapproval"" to kill the deal. Any such resolution would be subject to a possible Democratic filibuster, which would take 60 votes to overcome. And, even if both Houses were to pass a resolution of disapproval, President Obama could veto it, which would then require two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to override.If those super-majorities cannot be mustered, the President's bad Iran deal would go into effect.Thus, Corker-Cardin motion of disapproval reverses the ordinary presumptions. Instead of the President needing 67 Senate votes to ratify the Iran deal, it would now require 67 votes to stop an Iran deal.This makes no sense. Why is the current legislation so weak? Because the price of getting support from Democratic senators has been to water down the legislation to the point where it is almost entirely meaningless.As written, the legislation would do two things. First, it would provide Democratic senators with a show vote to say they were tough on Iran (before tacitly approving it). Second, it would virtually ensure that President Obama's bad Iran dealwhich endangers the lives of millions of Americansstands.President Obama's proposed deal makes military conflict with Iran a virtual certainty. Under the terms that have been publicly announced, Iran will keep its nuclear centrifuges, will keep its enriched uranium, and will keep developing its ICBM program (which exists for the sole purpose of carrying a nuclear weapon to America). Under the terms of the deal, Iran will receive billions of dollars  which it will surely use to keep developing nuclear weapons. And, because Iran will remain the leading state sponsor of terrorism (the deal does nothing to change that), those billions of dollars will also be funneled directly to Hezbollah and Hamas and radical Islamic terrorists across the world.Along with Sen. Pat Toomey, I have introduced an amendment to switch the presumption of power back where it belongs: to Congress.If the President cannot secure either a majority in both Houses, no sanctions relief should be implemented.Without this amendment, Corker-Cardin will likely do more harm than goodsimply providing political cover for a bad Iran deal (which is why the Obama administration is now supportive of the legislation).President Obama is fond of posing a false dichotomy: either you support his current Iran deal, or you want war. But, as Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rightly observed, ""a bad deal is worse than no deal."" As it stands, Corker-Cardin is a bad deal that paves the way for the President's worse deal with Iran.In January 2017, we will have a new President. He or she will likely encounter an Iran on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. If President Obama has implemented his bad dealif he has unraveled the international consensus in favor of strict sanctions on Iranthen sanctions will in all likelihood be impossible to re-impose. Doing so would take months or years (if at all), probably too far out to prevent a nuclear Iran.Thus, the next president would be left with two choices: acquiesce to Iran having nuclear weapons (which it could then use to murder Americans and our allies), or launch a targeted military attack to destroy Iran's nuclear capacity.The Obama deal makes those the only two realistic options in 2017. That's why the Senate should stop it. Peace through strength is the only way both to avoid war and to prevent a nuclear Iran.And that is why we need Iran sanctions legislation with teeth.Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) serves on the Committee on Armed Services."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 29, 2015",Press Release - Cruz for President Welcomes Iowa Leadership Team,"Names Matt Schultz Iowa State Chairman and 23 co-chairs comprised of Iowa lawmakers, activists, and influencersHOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced his Iowa Leadership Team, naming prosecutor and former Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz his Iowa State Chairman, in addition to 23 other state lawmakers, conservative activists and influencers as Iowa state co-chairs.Cruz for President's Iowa State Director, Bryan English, sent the following letter to the team welcoming them to the campaign. The text of the letter is below:To the Cruz Iowa Leadership Team,First, congratulations on joining the team that will elect the next President of the United States! From Iowa, to Texas, to New Hampshire, and all across the country, Cruz for President is putting together some of the most committed, skilled, and hardworking grassroots leaders to build our campaign. We are going to have the money, manpower, and message to be competitive, win the nomination, and beat Hillary next November!Keep in mind, we're not going to just walk into the nomination. We are going to have to fight every step of the way. There is no candidate the political elites are more afraid of than Ted Cruz. He represents a new way of doing things in Washington that upsets the big-government status quo the entrenched interests depend on. They will try to divide his base, distort his record, and distract voters from the real issues. It is our job as courageous conservatives to make sure people know who Ted is, how he's fought for us, and the truth about his record.That's why we've built a team in Iowa to reflect the broad coalition we will need to win. It includes leaders from across Iowa, including those in evangelical and homeschool circles, some who were instrumental in building the Liberty Iowa movement, plus energetic business owners and elected officials.We have a number of individuals who were active in the campaigns of the last two winners of the Iowa Caucuses, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. There are some who helped strong performers in past cycles like Rep. Ron Paul, Rep. Michelle Bachmann, and Governor Mitt Romney. This diversity of backgrounds is an indication of our strength.Yet, having such a broad coalition does not come without risk. The media and the other campaigns may try to use it against us. That's why candidates typically look for a niche, attempt to fill it, and then defend their turf. But that's not who we are, and it's not how we are going to win.Ted Cruz is a bold, visionary, Republican candidate of conviction who knows you build a big-tent party through consistent leadership on conservative principles. He is going to do extraordinarily well in Iowa, and be competitive in every other state, by bringing together all sides of the GOP coalition: social, fiscal, and national security conservatives; traditional Republicans, libertarians, and right-leaning independents; the $25 donor and the ones who can max-out; middle-class workers trying to stretch a paycheck and the moms and dads making the most important investment in America's future.And we will win if we all clearly see and effectively promote Ted's positive vision for the future of this great country. As he said on the day he announced for President:It is a time for truth. It is a time for liberty. It is a time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States. I am honored to stand with each and every one of you, Courageous Conservatives, as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children, and our children's children. We stand together for liberty.This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington it will come from only the men and women across this country from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution, it will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country:When the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that made this country great, we will get back and restore that shining city on a hill, that is the United States of America.I want to thank Matt Schultz, former Iowa Secretary of State and prosecutor, for chairing the team and helping to bring together such an impressive group of leaders.It is my honor to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this fight, and look forward to working with each and every one of you to elect Ted Cruz the next President of the United States.In Liberty,Bryan EnglishIowa State DirectorCruz for PresidentThe Cruz Iowa Leadership TeamMatt Schultz, Chair, TruroMarlin and Becky Bontrager, KalonaState Senator Jake Chapman, AdelPastor Bradley Cranston, BurlingtonVicki Crawford, GrangerPastor Mike Demastus, Des MoinesState Senator Dennis Guth, KlemmeState Representative Greg Heartsill, MelcherState Representative Steve Holt, DenisonJames Knox, Cedar RapidsJoel Kurtinitis, PerryKelsey Kurtinitis, PerryBill Salier, Nora SpringsDick Schlitter, OnawaDorothy Schlitter, OnawaState Senator Jason Schultz, SchleswigState Representative Larry Sheets, MoultonCouncilman Mick Snieder, Orange CityAdam Steen, West Des MoinesChad Steenhoek, AmesJohn Wacker, GarnerState Representative Ralph Watts, AdelPastor Darran Whiting, Marion"

Ted Cruz's month-old presidential campaign has won strong reviews from GOP insiders in key states who say he's managed to tap into the anti-establishment sentiment of primary voters, and his allies have proved they have the ability to raise tens of millions of dollars to boost his bid.The Texan's presidential aspirations hinge on his ability to lay claim to being the chief conservative alternative in the race, which means he'll have to find a way to expand beyond the tea party and social conservative base that he begins with.""He is expanding his base, and he is right now hitting on a lot of cylinders and I think the mechanics of the campaign have done well,"" said Dave Carney, a GOP operative in New Hampshire. ""My advice is: do not underestimate him. He is a serious, serious, guy and the more the nation's elites make fun of him, the stronger he will be. Everyone ignores him at their own peril.""Robert Vander Plaats, head of The Family Leader, an Iowa-based Chritstian group, said Mr. Cruz's rollout has been ""exceptional.""""I am one of these who believes if the caucuses were held today, Cruz would definitely compete for winning it,"" Mr. Vander Plaats said. ""I think he is really being rewarded for his bold leadership in the Senate, and his willingness to expose both sides of the aisle  not just the Democrats.""Mr. Cruz's outreach continued Wednesday with an appearance at a forum in Washington hosted by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, where the freshman senator called for lower taxes and a more aggressive U.S. posture on the world stage. He said he plans to make the presidential election a referendum on abolishing the IRS and pushing for a flat tax.He also dismissed the notion that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's hardline ""self-deportation"" stance on illegal immigration cost him with Hispanic voters, instead blaming Mr. Romney's infamous remark that he wasn't trying to win the ""47 percent"" of voters who were on the government dole and wouldn't vote for him anyway.""I cannot think of a statement in all of politics that I disagree with more strongly,"" Mr. Cruz said. ""I think Republicans are and should be the party of the 47 percent.""He also accused President Obama of inflaming racial tensions, suggesting the Democrat deserves some blame for the riots in nearby Baltimore, and said that he has never seen a Hispanic panhandler.Mr. Cruz kicked off the presidential contest with his official entry into the race last month in a speech at Liberty University in Virginia.Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida have since announced bids, and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson are expected to enter the GOP race next week.On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has declared her candidacy.Mr. Cruz, who is running in the middle of the pack in polls testing GOP candidates, has butted heads with both parties on Capitol Hill, and grabbed attention in 2013 when he led an effort to defund Obamacare that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown, which some Republicans said tarnished the party's image.But Republican insiders in Iowa and New Hampshire  which host the first two nomination contests  say Mr. Cruz is trying to shed his fringe image and broaden his appeal among primary voters.Mr. Carney, who is sitting out the GOP presidential race after being a longtime advisor to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, said Mr. Cruz is resonating with voters who are surprised that he does not fit the way he has been portrayed in the media or by the establishment wing of the party.""His expectations are such that the elite and the political insiders discount him and that actually is a huge benefit for him in this environment because he comes out and makes a presentation and people go, 'Wow.' That is not that they expected,"" Mr. Carney said.Several news outlets reported this month that pro-Cruz Super PACs were on pace to raise $31 million in a matter of weeks, helping to counter worries that he would struggle to raise the money to compete with establishment candidates.That's always been a hurdle for conservative candidates, who have faced a danger of getting chased from the campaign because of lack of funds.""I don't know that there were doubts that he could raise that money, but I think it is refreshing to conservatives that he can raise that money,"" Mr. Vander Plaats said. ""If you recall in '08, we launched Huckabee [out of Iowa], but Huckabee did not have a whole lot of money. Then we got behind Santorum, and then he would win 11 states but he did not always have enough money to compete."""

With your help, Ted Cruz is going to perform very well in the Palmetto State primary, earn the Republican nomination, and become the next President of the United States.Cruz's message continues to resonate with the people of South Carolina. He won five straw polls conducted in Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson, Dorchester, and Aiken counties , and received ""the most enthusiastic responses from the crowd"" at the State Convention this weekend, according to CNN.As the First in the South primary, South Carolina is a pivotal place for a strong full-spectrum conservative like Senator Cruz. Our campaign relies on bringing together a broad coalition of Republican voters, many of whom feel abandoned by party leaders in Washington. Cruz will be the only candidate in the race that can unite traditional GOP voters, tea party conservatives, liberty supporters, and right-leaning independents. He has demonstrated broad appeal from the social, fiscal and national security branches of our coalition by consistently fighting for the conservative values we share.Make no mistake: the attacks are coming. The political elites in Washington are desperately afraid of a candidate that upsets the status quo, and they will do everything in their power to distort Senator Cruz's record to stop him. That's why we have to be vigilant in aggressively promoting his message, growing his base of support, and showing voters that he has a proven record of fighting for us on the issues we care about most. From Obamacare, to gun rights, to amnesty, and traditional marriage, only Ted Cruz has stood up and led every time.That is why we've built a team in South Carolina of courageous conservative champions. Our diverse coalition of leaders reflects a broad base of support from across the Palmetto State, including Republican Party officers and elected officials, those in evangelical and homeschool circles, grassroots organizers, College Republicans, a leader of the Republican Liberty Caucus, as well as enthusiastic business owners and informed policy experts.Many of our leaders were actively involved with the last winner of South Carolina's First in the South Primary, Newt Gingrich. Several members of our team helped successful campaigns in previous cycles like Rep. Ron Paul, Rep. Michelle Bachmann, Governor Mike Huckabee, Senator Rick Santorum and Governor Mitt Romney. This diversity of backgrounds is an indication of our strength and full-spectrum support in the Palmetto State.We have a long road ahead of us, but I am certain that our team will be successful if we clearly understand Senator Cruz's vision. As he noted in his announcement-day speech:From the dawn of this country, at every stage America has enjoyed God's providential blessing. Over and over again, when we faced impossible odds the American people rose to the challenge...The power of the American people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds.I want to thank State Senator Lee Bright, State Representative Bill Chumley, and Sheriff Ray Nash (Ret.) for co-chairing this team and bringing together this remarkable group of conservative grassroots leaders.I am ready to meet this challenge with you as we work to make Ted Cruz the next President of the United States.Sincerely,LaDonna RyggsSouth Carolina State DirectorCruz for PresidentCruz for President South Carolina Leadership TeamState Senator Lee Bright, Co-Chair, SpartanburgState Representative Bill Chumley, Co-Chair, WoodruffSheriff Ray Nash (Ret.), Co-Chair, SummervillePaul Anderko, Rock HillJavan Browder, GreenvilleDebbie and Stephen Brown, GreenvilleRenee Cannon, North CharlestonSandy Chiong, LugoffLt.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 8, 2015",Press Release - Cruz for President Names New Jersey and Tennessee State Chairs,"Campaign Continues Building Robust National Leadership TeamHOUSTON, Texas  Today, U.teve. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced that former Bogota mayor andlongtime conservative activist Steve Lonegan willbecome the New Jersey State Chair and former Williamson County Republican Party Chairman and statewide conservative leader Kevin Kookogey will become the Tennessee State Chair of the Cruz for President campaign.""Steve Lonegan has been a tireless advocate for taxpayers and was one of America's most fiscally responsible mayors,"" said Cruz. ""He brings a wealth of knowledge in both New Jersey politics and conservative governance to our campaign, and I deeply appreciate his support.""""Kevin Kookogey has been a consistently strong voice for conservative principles and an active member of our party for a number of years,"" said Cruz. ""His experience and knowledge of both the landscape in Tennessee and the issues that matter to Tennesseans will be critical components to our success in the Volunteer state.""During his time as mayor,Steve Loneganled statewide campaigns on behalf of New Jersey taxpayers. Whether it was fighting the unconstitutional state bonding or gasoline tax hikes, Steve was willing to take on leaders in both parties to do what was right for New Jersey's working families. Steve has won hard-fought victories over a proposed 8% sales tax on the statewide ballot, a $38 billion toll hike, and taxpayer-financed legislative elections. Steve was reelected as mayor in 1999 and 2003 by double-digit margins over his Democrat opponents in a two to one Democrat town, demonstrating that conservative leadership resonates across party lines. Most recently, Lonegan was the Republican nominee for the special election for U.S. Senate in 2013.Steve Lonegan said, ""America needs a President that understands that only liberty can lead us to prosperity. We need a President who will support our Constitution fearlessly and cut the size of government, not just slow down its growth. Senator Cruz not only understands this, but has the record to prove it. He has shown the courage to lead our nation back to greatness in the world.""Kevin Kookogey will serve as Tennessee Chairman for Cruz for President. Based in what the Daily Caller once designated as ""the most conservative friendly county in America,"" Kookogey served as Chairman of the Williamson County Republican Party from 2011-2013, and Treasurer from 2009-2011. A grassroots political activist, Kookogey is also a Heritage Action for America Sentinel and 2014 ""Wall of Honor"" recipient. In 2013, as President and Founder of Linchpins of Liberty, Kookogey was the first IRS target to testify before the House Ways & Means Committee concerning the Obama Administration's unlawful obstruction and delay of tax-exempt status for his and hundreds of other conservative and liberty-minded organizations. Kookogey has led the very public fight against Common Core in Tennessee, and has developed a reputation for leadership on issues of American sovereignty, defense, and religious liberty. He and his wife are long time members of the President's Club of the Heritage Foundation and Kevin is also a member of The Philadelphia Society.Kevin Kookogey said, ""I first witnessed the leadership of Ted Cruz back in 2011 at an event in Texas, well before anyone even knew he was running for Senate. There is not another political leader in America who possesses both an understanding of the challenges of our times and the moral courage to meet them. Senator Cruz is a lion who knows no retreat, a defender of the American order, and I am humbled and honored to be serving him."""

Ted Cruz: Obama Has No Complete ISIS Strategy  Turkey Can HelpTIMEBy: U.S. Sen. Ted CruzIn Sunday's parliamentary elections, the people of Turkey fired a warning shot against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). While it is true AKP received the largest number of votes and remains the most powerful political party in Turkey, it is also true that this is hardly the result the former prime minister and current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted. In emulation of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, Mr. Erdogan has paid lip-service to his country's democratic institutions by moving between executive positions, a cumbersome process he proposed to eliminate by amending the Constitution to consolidate power in the presidency he holds, had the voters given him sufficient support in the parliament....But now the people of Turkey have gone where the Obama administration has feared to tread, and signaled they want a new course, one that is more inclusive of minorities and, we can hope, more friendly to America. This election may thus represent something that has been in short supply in the Middle Eastan opportunity for the United States. The president admitted Monday what has long been apparent to most observers, that we have no coherent strategy against ISIS. Now might be the moment to develop one, starting with exerting pressure on Turkey to take aggressive action against the ISIS fighters moving across its borders and to give us access to our air base at Incirlik so we can see how ISIS reacts to a serious, concerted air campaign.Mr. Erdogan remains in power for the moment, and it may be that he will never agree to these requests. But the United States should make them loud and clear because while their president may not listen, the Turkish people might be open to partnering with America against the vicious scourge of terrorism that threatens both our nations.Read the full op-ed here."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke withJames Hohmann of the Washington Post to discuss what his first actions would be if elected President, which include rescinding President Obama's overreaching executive orders, taking action to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and advocating far-reaching tax and regulatory reform, specifically the implementation of a flat tax and the repeal of Obamacare.Full text of the article is below and may be viewed here.""If you live by the pen, you die by the pen""Washington PostBy James HohmannJune 10, 2015Ted Cruz would spend his first day in office trying to undo some of Barack Obama's biggest achievements via executive order.In a wide-ranging interview about how he'd spend his first 100 days as president if he won, the Texas GOP senator pledged to roll back more than just the president's controversial orders related to immigration.""If you live by the pen, you die by the pen,"" Cruz said by phone Tuesday, as he traveled from Dallas to an afternoon tour of the Southern border. ""Everything put in place by executive order can be undone by executive order.""Cruz said he would use the transition to bring a team together ""to engage in a careful, systematic review of each executive action and to rescind every one of them that exceeds the Constitutional and legal authority of the president.""Cruz's comments underscored the tenuousness of some of Obama's biggest second-term accomplishments, enacted by executive order because of a Republican-dominated Congress. He's the first of several presidential candidates to outline his governing priorities in an interview with PowerPost, a new Washington Post site that will focus on the intersection of policy and politics.Other highlights from the interview:Cruz promised to do whatever it takes to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, which he calls ""the single greatest national security threat to the United States.""""On day one, I would expect to convene the national security team for a serious, careful, sober assessment of where Iran stands  how close they are to acquiring nuclear weapons  and to review every tool at our disposalto assure that under no circumstances does Iran acquire nuclear weapons,"" he said.On Israel, he responded to this week's Supreme Court decision by saying that he would allow Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their birthplace on passports. Though Republicans and Democrats have promised in the past to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Avivto the contested city, Cruz pledges that he would actually follow through.The senator, who was the first major party candidate to formally announce his candidacy back on March 23, said he's running to try ""to get a mandate from the electorate"" to push far-reaching tax and regulatory reform. He really wants to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service, which he believes would be possible with a flat tax, but he recognizes how politically challenging such a proposition would be. So he would want to get the public behind it through the primary and general election.""I intend to do everything possible to make 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare and adopting a flat tax,"" he said.Asked about his legislative priorities, Cruz said he would focus on tax and regulatory reform first. He would also push for Congress to ""repeal every word of Obamacare.""He described himself as ""cautiously optimistic"" that the Supreme Court will side against the government in King vs. Burwell on the grounds that the federal government has ""illegally collected billions of dollars in taxes from Americans who do not owe them."" If the court invalidates coverage for millions now receiving health subsidies, Cruz said he wants legislation that would let states ""opt-out of Obamacare"" altogether.Cruz promises on the trail to repeal the Common Core state standards.""This administration has used Race To The Top funds to pressure states to adopt Common Core standards,"" he said. ""At the very outset, if I'm elected, the administration would no longer use federal authority to coerce states into adopting Common Core.""Asked who he might appoint to his Cabinet if he were elected, Cruz said that engaging with that question in a detailed way would be like telling a woman on a first date what he would like to name his children.""One step at a time,"" he said.But Cruz said he could definitely see picking some of his GOP rivals in the 2016 race for prominent posts.""Any Republican president would be a fool not to look very seriously at the men and women who will be on that debate stage as very serious and even likely members of a Republican cabinet and even a Republican dream team,"" he said."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 11, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz discusses Trade Promotion Authority and Trans-Pacific Partnership,"Joins the Hugh Hewitt ShowHOUSTON, Texas  Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined the Hugh Hewitt Show to discuss TPA/TPP, his op-ed on redefining the mission against ISIS, and the NDAA.On TPA/TPP, Sen. Cruz said:TPA is Trade Promotion Authority, it's also known as fast track.That is the process by which free trade agreements are negotiated. Historically, since FDR virtually every president has had fast track authority. What fast track provides is simply if a free trade agreement is negotiated, that Congress will vote on it up or down without amendments and history has demonstrated for the last 80 years that the only way to get free trade agreements adopted is to have fast track. That if there is no fast track, free trade agreements do not end up being negotiated.TPA is what the Senate voted on recently. I voted in favor of fast track because I support free trade. I think free trade benefits America. It creates jobs  opening markets to our farmers, to our ranchers, to our manufacturers, improves economic growth. In Texas alone, roughly 3 million jobs depend on international trade.And if you support free trade, the only way history has shown free trade agreements get negotiated is through fast track.Now there is a second issue which has caused a great deal of confusion and that is TPP...it is one specific trade deal that is being negotiated. It is separate from TPA. Congress has not voted on TPP, and there's a great deal of concern about TPP.Now, I have not voted on TPP, and I haven't decided if I will support it or not, because the negotiation isn't complete, and I'm going to wait and review and see what the agreement is first before assessing if it would be beneficial or harmful."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 11, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: Our mission should be to destroy ISIS  not to turn Iraq into a democratic utopia,"Writes op-ed in Washington ExaminerHOUSTON, Texas  Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on the need for the United States to redefine its mission against the Islamic State. Text of the op-ed appears below:Redefining the mission against ISISWashington ExaminerBy: U.S. Sen. Ted CruzA year ago today, the Iraqi city of Mosul fell to Islamic State militants, an event that should have shattered any lingering illusions that the Islamic State was the ""JV"" of radical Islamic terrorist groups. For the past 12 months we have seen its vicious campaign to establish a new Caliphate carved out of Syria and Iraq play out on computer and television screens across the globe. We have seen American, Israeli, British and Japanese captives beheaded. We have seen a brave Jordanian pilot burned alive. We have seen mass executions of Egyptian Christians. We have seen the civilian populations of Syria and Iraq brutalized, with woman and children crucified, raped, tortured and forced to accept the Sharia law imposed by the Islamic State.While these atrocities have grabbed the headlines, the Islamic State has also been engaged in a steady campaign of territorial expansion, both in the region and beyond. Other major Iraqi cities, including Fallujah and Ramadi, have fallen to the Islamic State. It has extended its operations to Libya and allied with Boko Haram in Nigeria. So-called ""lone wolf"" plots to attack us here at home have cropped up from Texas to Massachusetts.Just this week, the Islamic State has captured dozens of Eritrean Christians in Libya and announced its intention to conquer the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, a threat that may be more sensational than real, but which demonstrates its broadening ambitions. Even more disturbingly, reports are surfacing that the Islamic State may be working on chlorine-based chemical weapons and even a crude ""dirty bomb"" fashioned out of the radioactive material seized from Iraqi medical facilities.Even so, the Islamic State is not yet invincible, and we should not fall into the trap of thinking it cannot be defeated. Determined efforts against it have proved effective, for example at Tikrit in Iraq and Kobani in Syria. But Tikrit was captured by the Iran-backed Shiite militias, some of whom have proven almost as vicious as the Islamic State. Kobani was defended by the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, not the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). And these defeats have proven isolated events, while the larger momentum has been in the Islamic State's favor.It's time to tell the American people the truth. One year into the program, we must admit that the Obama administration strategy, which has consisted of a limited U.S. air campaign, a program to train and equip the ISF and a directive to achieve sectarian political reconciliation in Baghdad, is failing.Unfortunately, the administration cannot see this simple truth. While the president did admit this week that his strategy is imperfect and lacking in details, his solution appears to be more of the same as he recommended more trainers and made increasingly desperate pleas to Baghdad to fill in the blanks.Enough. We can't afford another year of deliberation and half-hearted measures that will only further embolden the Islamic State and tip it toward victory. What we have been doing isn't working, and doubling down on a failed strategy will not result in success. There are still choices besides continuing President Obama's botched strategy, or re-deploying tens of thousands of American combat troops to Iraq.For starters, we have to stop understanding the mission against the Islamic State as an extension of the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, which then mushroomed into an effort to turn Iraq into a western-style democracy. Our mission now should be to destroy the Islamic State terrorists whose avowed purpose is to harm America and our allies, not to turn Iraq into a democratic utopia.Given the dysfunctional state of Iraq, we also need to let go of the fantasy that the ISF is going to be our boots on the ground. The fact is, as Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren admitted this week, that we simply do not have the requisite number of Iraqi recruits to make this strategy effective. It doesn't matter how many trainers we send if there is no one there for them to train.The goal of political reconciliation in Baghdad, which the administration has also prioritized, has proven equally illusory. We are marking another unhappy anniversary this monththe anniversary of Haider al-Abadi becoming prime minister of Iraq. While Shia, there were hopes among the Sunni Arab nations such as Egypt and Jordan that Mr. al-Abadi would reverse the disastrous sectarian policies of his predecessor, Nouri al-Malaki, and bring Iraq together to fight the existential threat of the Islamic State.However well intentioned he may be, however, Mr. al-Abadi has not been able to perform this miracle. Surrounded by entrenched al-Maliki loyalists, he has taken no significant actions to reduce the militant Shiite influence of Iran or to liberate the Sunni territory invaded by the Islamic State. Absent a dramatic shift in the prime minister's policies  something that would have to come from within his administration and cannot be imposed by the U.S.  making political reconciliation in Baghdad a keystone of our strategy dooms it from the get-go.It is time to shake free of the failures of the past year and engage in some fresh thinking. In last weekend's Washington Post, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula proposed an alternative strategy, which would consist of exploiting our asymmetric advantage over the Islamic State through an overwhelming air campaign unfettered from the rigid and restrictive targeting rules ostensibly designed to protect civilians, but which have effectively enabled the Islamic State to continue oppressing them. The recent election in Turkey, a rebuke to the anti-American President Tayyip Erdogan, who has refused us access to the NATO air base at Incirlik, might present an opportunity for us to press for use of this vital asset.We might also look into by-passing Baghdad to arm the Kurds directly to ensure the free flow of ammunition and heavy weapons, and then embed our special operations troops with them to provide the targeting intelligence our air campaign requires. The Kurds have proven their value in battle against the Islamic State, and we should allow them to help us while providing them the assistance they need.For our allies such as Israel, Jordan and Egypt, such actions would be a welcome demonstration of decisive and engaged American leadership. The United States is blessed with the greatest fighting force in the history of the planet, and the destruction of the Islamic State is not beyond our capability, especially when we work with our effective regional partners. But if we hope to get the job done before it is too late, we must make clear that that is our mission."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 16, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Sen. Cruz Leads GOP Field in Facebook Interactions Occurring on Day of Presidential Launch,"Cruz ""share of voice"" on social media nearly triple that of other GOP contendersHOUSTON, Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, drew the same amount of Facebook interactions on the day of his Presidential campaign launch as the next four ranked GOP candidates combined on their respective announcement dates. According to data provided by Facebook to POLITICO, Sen. Cruz leads the Republican field in both unique mentions and interactions on the social networking site.""Social media is the new 'coffee shop' where neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family gather to discuss issues, talk about the candidates, and influence others,"" Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said. ""That is the most important space to succeed as a candidate, especially early on. The opinions of your friends on Facebook or Twitter are far more influential than what any pundit may say on TV. Headcount matters more than headlines.""A recent study conducted by George Washington University and Zignal Labs showed that Cruz's ""share of voice"" on social media during his launch was 27 percent, nearly triple that of his closest GOP rivals during their respective launches. That means that better than one-in-four discussions about the presidential race included a mention of Cruz, while others lagged by about one-in-ten.""That's a great sign for us because that's where you start to create volunteers, supporters, donors, and ultimately the people who show up and vote for you on Election Day,"" Roe added. ""Our strong positioning across social media mirrors growing ground operations we are building in the states, both early states and beyond.""In recent weeks, Sen.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 16, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz in Washington Times: State Dept. must release the Iran human rights report now,"HOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Timescalling on the State Department to release the long-overdue annual report on Iran's human rights abuses. The full text appears below and the op-ed may be viewed here.State Dept. must release the Iran human rights report nowWashington TimesU.S. Sen. Ted CruzA little over a month ago, five Senate colleagues and I sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry requesting information about the ongoing delay of the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. In recent days the State Department informed my office it has been unable to release the long-overdue annual report on Iran's human rights abuses because of a scheduling conflict.The State Department is required by law to release this report on February 25 of this year. On April 16, the department announced a further delay but gave no indication of when it might appear. Our letter requested the department release the report by May 15 or furnish a thorough explanation for the delay.In a letter dated June 9, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield responded that Secretary Kerry's rigorous travel schedule caused the delay: ""The Secretary's participation in the rollout, even if it must be delayed by his travel, elevates the report. The Secretary has needed to travel abroad for extended periods, often on short notice, during the past three months to address a variety of pressing foreign policy concerns""thus implying that the report is complete but that scheduling conflicts with more pressing matters have prevented its release.With all due respect to Assistant Secretary Frifield and Secretary Kerry, this is unacceptable. The single greatest threat to the national security of the United States is a nuclear-armed Iran. If allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, there is a dangerously high chance that the Iranians would use them, or share them with their terrorist proxies who are currently on a violent rampage through the Middle East, from Gaza to Lebanon to Syria to Iraq to Yemen.As my colleagues and I noted in our letter, the issue of Iran's abysmal human rights record is inextricably intertwined with its nuclear ambitions. ""The history of the twentieth century,"" we wrote, ""elucidates a dangerous axis between internal suppression of human rights and external aggression."" There is every reason to believe that the mullahs' willingness to oppress their own people at home would extend to their perceived enemies around the globe, if they had the means to threaten them.For this reason, Congress must have access to the most recent information our government has collected on Iran's human rights violations. While many hoped that the election of the so-called moderate President Hasan Rouhani in 2013 would lead to an improvement in the regime's behavior, the opposite has proven true.For example, last year's report documented:""The government executed 624 persons during the year [2013], according to the NGO Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (IHRDC), which reported that many trials did not adhere to basic principles of due process. The government officially announced 334 executions but did not release further information, such as the dates of executions, the names of those executed, or the crimes for which they were executed. According to an October 8 statement by the [International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran], authorities conducted more than 50 executions in public. Authorities also conducted group executions on several occasions.""""Branch 26 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court sentenced a dual-citizen Christian pastor [Saeed Abedini] to eight years in prison on January 27 on charges of undermining national security through house-church activities. Authorities had held the pastor since September 2012 in Evin Prison, where international civil rights groups reported that prison officials subjected him to physical and psychological abuse and deprived him of medical treatment. On November 3, authorities transferred the pastor to Rajaie Shahr Prison where, according to international civil rights groups, other inmates threatened him with violence and prison officials denied him medical treatment.""""According to the UN special rapporteur's October [2013] report, at least 40 journalists and 29 bloggers and online activists were serving prison sentences in the country, and 23 journalists had been arrested since the start of the year.""This is hardly an encouraging record, and the media reports we have suggest that the 2014 report may be even grimmer. Extensive negotiating with their American counterparts does not appear to have improved the Iranians' behavior. We know, for example, that Americans Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, currently unjustly held in Iranian prisons, are suffering increasing abuse, while American Robert Levinson remains unaccounted fordespite Assistant Secretary Frifield's assurance that representatives from the State Department ""raise these cases regularly with the Iranian government."" All evidence suggests summary executions are on the rise, with as many as 56 inmates from one prison alone dead since May 6 of this year. Also in May, some eighteen Christian converts were sentenced to jail terms for their beliefs. And this is just what we know from media reports.Congress must have access to our State Department's next official assessment before it can cast judgment on any deal the P5+1 might strike with Iran. If Iran's already dismal human rights record has indeed continued to worsen over the last year, it would raise significant additional concerns about engaging in nuclear negotiations with this regime.I appreciate Secretary Kerry's enthusiasm for his job and the frequent overseas travel it entails, and hope for a quick recovery from the recent accident that has caused further strain on his calendar. But as the June 30th deadline looms, we cannot wait any longer. Anyone alarmed by Tehran's brutal and aggressive conduct should take a keen interest in this report even if Secretary Kerry is unable to attend its release.If, as Assistant Secretary Frifield suggests in her letter, the report is complete, it should be released immediately. If it is not immediately released, a full and thorough explanation for the delay must be forthcoming. For this reason, I intend to file legislation that will fine the State Department five percent of its operating budget for every 30 days the report is delayed. As inconvenient as this may be for the State Department, it must respect the law and Congress owes it to the American people to gather all relevant information before it casts what may well be the most significant vote of this legislative session."

He was rewarded with the most frequent and loudest applause and the highest praise from the gathering of social conservatives at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.It wasn't just the dramatic delivery that separated him on the dais, though  it was his smartly tailored speech that began with a silent prayer for the victims of the mass church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and ended with a spontaneous leap off the stage into the center of the ballroom audience, where he was swarmed like a rock star.There are still more than a half-dozen 2016 contenders who will speak on Friday and Saturday. But none is likely to match Cruz's dynamism."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 23, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz: TPA in this Congress has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom deal-making,"Writes op-ed in BreitbartHOUSTON, Texas  Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote an op-ed in Breitbart explaining why he cannot continue to support TPA, specifically stating, ""TPA in this Congress has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom deal-making, along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements typically do not include."" Full op-edmay be read here or below:ObamaTrade Enmeshed in Corrupt, Backroom DealingsBreitbartU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz06/23/2015The American people do not trust President Obama. And they do not trust Republican leadership in Congress. And the reason is simple: for far too long, politicians in Washington have not told the truth.Both President Obama and Republican leadership are pressing trade promotion authority, also known as TPA, or ""fast-track."" Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) both oppose it.As a general matter, I agree (as did Ronald Reagan) that free trade is good for America; when we open up foreign markets, it helps American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers.But TPA in this Congress has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom deal-making, along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements typically do not include.Since the Senate first voted on TPA, there have been two material changes.First, WikiLeaks subsequently revealed new troubling information regarding the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, one of the trade deals being negotiated by Obama.Despite the administration's public assurances that it was not negotiating on immigration, several chapters of the TiSA draft posted online explicitly contained potential changes in federal immigration law. TPA would cover TiSA, and therefore these changes would presumably be subject to be fast-track.When TPA last came up for a vote, both Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and I introduced amendments that would have barred fast-track treatment for any trade agreement that attempted to impact immigration law. Two other Republican senators objected, and we were both denied votes on our amendments. Instead, the House inserted substantially weaker language in related legislation.At the time that Sessions and I introduced our amendments, many said our fears were unfounded. But now we have far more reason to be concerned.Second, TPA's progress through the House and Senate appears to have been made possible by secret deals between Republican Leadership and the Democrats.When TPA first came up for a vote in the Senate, it was blocked by a group of senators, led by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were conditioning their support on the unrelated objective of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.The Ex-Im Bank is a classic example of corporate welfare. It is cronyism at its worst, with U.S. taxpayers guaranteeing billions of dollars in loans for sketchy buyers in foreign nations. Ex-Im is scheduled to wind down on June 30. But powerful lobbyists in Washington want to keep the money flowing.After witnessing several senators huddle on the floor the day of the TPA vote, I suspected that to get their votes on TPA, Republican Leadership had promised supporters of Ex-Im a vote to reauthorize the bank before it winds down.At lunch that day, I asked Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY)what precise deal had been cut to pass TPA. Visibly irritated, he told me and all my Republican colleagues that there was no deal whatsoever; rather, he simply told them they could use the ordinary rules to offer whatever amendments they wanted on future legislation.Taking McConnell at his word that there was no deal on Ex-Im, I voted yes on TPA because I believe the U.S. generally benefits from free trade, and without TPA historically there have been no free-trade agreements.But then the vote went to the House. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), to the surprise of many, led House Democrats to oppose TPA en masse. (Technically, they voted against TAA, which was wrapped into the deal on TPA.)At that point a group of House conservatives went to Speaker Boehner and said they could support TPA if Boehner agreed not to cut a deal with Democrats on Ex-Im, and just let the bank expire.Boehner declined. Instead, it appears he made the deal with Democrats, presumably tossing in the Ex-Im Bank and also increasing tax penalties on businesses.Moreover, the Speaker punished conservatives, wrongly stripping Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) of his subcommittee chairmanship, and reportedly threatening to strip other conservatives of their chairmanships as well.Why does Republican Leadership always give in to the Democrats? Why does Leadership always disregard the promises made to the conservative grassroots?Enough is enough. I cannot vote for TPA unless McConnell and Boehner both commit publicly to allow the Ex-Im Bank to expireand stay expired. And, Congress must also pass the Cruz-Sessions amendments to TPA to ensure that no trade agreement can try to back-door changes to our immigration laws. Otherwise, I will have no choice but vote no.There's too much corporate welfare, too much cronyism and corrupt dealmaking, by the Washington cartel. For too long, career politicians in both parties have supported government of the lobbyist, by the lobbyist, and for the lobbyist  at the expense of the taxpayers. It's a time for truth. And a time to honor our commitments to the voters."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 23, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: What we see today is another manifestation of the Washington Cartel,"Sen. Cruz Joins the Mark Levin ShowHOUSTON, Texas  Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined the Mark Levin Show to discuss his vote against TPA as a result of thelatest manifestation of the Washington Cartel.Excerpts appear below:I voted against TPA today and I wrote a long op-ed in Breitbart this morning explaining why. And as you know, I support free trade  I'm a longtime supporter of free trade. I campaigned on free trade in the state of Texas. However, there were really two things that drove me to oppose TPA today.The first was something that came out after the first vote on TPA, which is Wikileaks released the text of a portion of the Trade in Services Agreement which explicitly purports to change immigration laws of the signatory countries. Now at the time TPA came up for a vote initially, Jeff Sessions introduced an amendment and I introduced an amendment to add to TPA to make explicit that no trade deal can impact immigration law and that any one that attempted to impact immigration law wouldn't be subject to Fast Track. We didn't get a vote on those amendments.And based on the subsequent leak of the text of a trade agreement attempting to do just that, I informed leadership that if they wanted my vote on TPA, they needed to pass the Cruz-Sessions amendment to take immigration off the table forever on trade agreements.The second aspect that led me to vote no was the corrupt deals we've seen that leadership pursued in order to get TPA passed. And in particular is a deal that by all appearances they cut to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.Now as you know, Mark, the Export-Import Bank is a classic example of corporate welfare, it is hundreds of billions of dollars of loan guarantees that taxpayers give that benefit primarily a handful of giant corporations. Now, it's scheduled to expire on June 30th. And would be a tremendous victory  it should be a tremendous victory  for Republicans to show we're not about cronyism, we're not about picking winners and losers, to defend the free market.Unfortunately, it now appears that Republican leadership cut a deal in order to get TPA through where they agreed to tee up a vote and allow the Export-Import Bank, that corporate welfare, as well. And at the end of the day it was too much so I announced I would vote no and I did vote no today....I informed leadership that if they publicly, number one, committed to allowing the Export-Import Bank to expire and stay expired  to end that corrupt Washington cronyism deal making  and number two, if Congress would pass the Cruz and Sessions amendment taking immigration off the table forever in trade agreements that I would support it, but leadership did not accept my offer....And unfortunately what we see today is another manifestation of what I call the ""Washington Cartel."" It is a corruption. It is a cartel of career politicians in both parties in union with the lobbyists on K Street. And it's the reason why six of the ten wealthiest counties in America surround Washington, DC. Because this town is all about more and more power and money in Washington, and the working men and women, their lives being made harder and harder. And what we saw today is another example of government of the lobbyists, by the lobbyists, and for the lobbyists, and that's not what Republicans were elected to Congress to do."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz: The last thing Republicans in Congress should do is codify President Obama's lawlessness and extend Obamacare subsidies,"Discusses Obamacare, ISIS on Special Report with Bret BaierHOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today participated in the Center Seat panel on Special Report with Bret Baier, taking questions from Baier and panelists George Will, Mara Liasson, and Jonah Goldberg. They covered several issues including Trade Promotion Authority, the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare, what must be done to defeat ISIS, and why Americans should vote for Ted Cruz for President.Select excerpts are below and full video may be viewed below:Regarding Trade Promotion Authority:""Two things have changed since that first vote. Number one, WikiLeaks released the text of a portion of the Trade in Services Agreement that explicitly contemplates changing immigration laws of member countries. Over and over again, we'd been assured there were no changes in immigration laws. That leak was one material change. And then a second material change was the backroom Washington deals that were cut on the Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank is a classic example of corporate welfare, and it appears now that leadership cut a deal to reauthorize this cronyism. Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars on the lien to help giant corporations as the price for TPA. And the two together were too much, so I voted no.""Regarding the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare:""Under no circumstances should Republicans in Congress extend Obamacare. If the Supreme Court rules, as many observers expect, it will conclude that the Obama IRS violated federal law and illegally imposed billions of dollars of taxes on millions of Americans  millions of young people who are working. Right now, the Obama IRS is extracting taxes from them. And if the Supreme Court includes that Obama violated the law, the last thing Republicans in Congress should step up and do is codify his lawlessness and extend the subsidies.""What I say is we should use this opportunity to address the real problem, which is that Obamacare has driven health insurance premiums through the roof. In fact, President Obama promised that the average family's health insurance premium would drop $2,500 under Obamacare. In actuality, the average family's premiums have risen $3,000.""""What we should do instead is allow states to opt out. Opt out of the individual mandate, opt out of the taxes, opt out of the employer mandate, opt out of all the mandatory coverage, which is driving up premiums for a lot more than six million people. You're talking about hundreds of millions of people who are seeing their premiums go up for Obamacare.""""What you replace it with is something that expands competition and empowers consumers and disempowers government from getting between patients and their doctors in three specific reforms. One, you let people purchase health insurance across state lines. That creates a 50 state marketplace that lowers cost and gives you more choices, which expands access. Number two, you expand health savings accounts, so that people can save in a tax advantage way for routine healthcare. And number three, you work to delink health insurance from employment, so health insurance is portable.""If you or I lose our jobs we don't lose our life insurance, our car insurance, or our house insurance, there's no reason we should lose our health insurance, and that's what causes much of the problem of preexisting conditions. We should be empowering patients, not putting government bureaucrats between us and our doctors.""Regarding defeating ISIS:""What is plausible is number one, air power, when used aggressively can have a dramatic impact. Right now we got such restrictive rules of engagement that it is more a pinprick strike  it is a bomb here it's a missile there. I've characterized it as photo op foreign policy rather than using concerted overwhelming airpower to take out ISIS.""Secondly, you're right, the Kurds can't solve everything, but they're right now fighting and winning on the ground, and it is a miracle they are because ISIS is using U.S. military equipment they've seized in Iraq. The Kurds' equipment is hopelessly outclassed and yet they're fighting.This administration is obsessed with seeking conciliation with the Sunnis and Shias and uniting Iraq. It sends weapons to Baghdad that doesn't get passed along to the Kurds. That doesn't make any sense at all, we ought to use the Kurds as boots on the ground along with overwhelming air power.""Now that could likely involve embedding in more special forces to target that airpower but I think our principle boots on the ground can be the Kurds and we should be giving them the tools they need to defeat ISIS.""Regarding why Americans should vote for Ted Cruz for President:""You know Albert Einstein famously said, 'the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.' Over and over again the Washington world of consultants says we've got to run a moderate, an establishment moderate and every time we do it, we lose.""If you compare 2004 the last race Republicans won to '08 and '12 by far the biggest difference is the millions of conservatives who showed up in '04, who stayed home in '08, who stayed home in bigger numbers in '12. They fall into two groups. Number one evangelical Christians, number two so-called Reagan Democrats, largely blue collar Catholics up and down the Midwest and into New England.""Heidi and I we spent months thinking about and praying about whether to run for President our daughters our four and seven you don't lightly throw a young family into the maelstrom of a Presidential race. The reason we decided to go forward is because I look at the rest of field there are a lot of people who are talented, who I like who I respect. But, I don't see a lot of candidates who I think are likely to energize and mobilize and bring back to the polls those Conservatives.""I think based on the record I've built of standing and fighting for Conservative principles over and over again that I am in the best position to energize and bring back those Conservatives and at the same time to bring back together that old Reagan coalition of Conservatives, and libertarians and evangelicals and young people and Hispanics and women and Reagan Democrats. That's what we've got to do to win."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 26, 2015","Press Release - Cruz: We must not submit our constitutional freedoms, and the promise of our nation, to judicial tyranny","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz writes op-ed in National Review OnlineHOUSTON, Texas  Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote an op-ed in National Review Online in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on Obamacare and marriage. The op-ed is below and may also be viewed here.Constitutional Remedies to a Lawless Supreme CourtNational Review OnlineU.S. Sen. Ted CruzThis week, we have twice seen Supreme Court Justices violating their judicial oaths. Yesterday, the Justices re-wrote Obamacare, yet again, in order to force this failed law on the American people. Today, the Court doubled down with a 5-4 opinion that undermines not just the definition of marriage, but the very foundations of our representative form of government.Both decisions were judicial activism, plain and simple. Both were lawless.As Justice Scalia put it regarding Obamacare, ""Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is 'established by the State.' . . . We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare."" And as he observed regarding marriage, ""Today's decree says that . . . the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court.""Sadly, the political reaction from the leaders of my party is all too predictable. They will pretend to be incensed, and then plan to do absolutely nothing.That is unacceptable. On the substantive front, I have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage. And the 2016 election has now been transformed into a referendum on Obamacare; in 2017, I believe, a Republican president will sign legislation finally repealing that disastrous law.But there is a broader problem: The Court's brazen action undermines its very legitimacy. As Justice Scalia powerfully explained,""Hubris is sometimes defined as o'erweening pride; and pride, we know, goeth before the fall. . . . With each decision of ours that takes from the People a question properly left to themwith each decision that is unabashedly based not on law, but on the 'reasoned judgment' of a bare majority of this Courtwe move one step closer to being reminded of our impotence.""This must stop. Liberty is in the balance.Not only are the Court's opinions untethered from reason and logic, they are also alien to our constitutional system of limited and divided government. By redefining the meaning of common words, and redesigning the most basic human institutions, this Court has crossed from the realm of activism into the arena of oligarchy.This week's opinions are but the latest in a long line of judicial assaults on our Constitution and the common-sense values that have made America great. During the past fifty years, the Court has condemned millions of innocent unborn children to death, banished God from our schools and public squares, extended constitutional protections to prisoners of war on foreign soil, authorized the confiscation of property from one private owner to transfer it to another, and now required all Americans to purchase a specific product, and to accept the redefinition of an institution ordained by God and long predating the formation of the Court.Enough is enough.Over the last several decades, many attempts have been made to compel the Court to abide by the Constitution. But, as Justice Alito put it, ""[t]oday's decision shows that decades of attempts to restrain this Court's abuse of its authority have failed.""In the case of marriage, a majority of states passed laws or state constitutional amendments to affirm the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. At the federal level, the Congress and President Clinton enacted the Defense of Marriage Act. When it comes to marriage, the Court has clearly demonstrated an unwillingness to remain constrained by the Constitution.Similarly, the Court has now twice engaged in Constitutional contortionism in order to preserve Obamacare. If the Court is unwilling to abide by the specific language of our laws as written, and if it is unhindered by the clear intent of the people's elected representatives, our Constitutional options for reasserting our authority over our government are limited.The Framers of our Constitution, despite their foresight and wisdom, did not anticipate judicial tyranny on this scale. The Constitution explicitly provides that Justices ""shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,"" and this is a standard they are not remotely meeting. The Framers thought Congress' ""power of instituting impeachments,"" as Alexander Hamilton argued in the Federalist Papers, would be an ""important constitutional check"" on the judicial branch and would provide ""a complete security"" against the Justices' ""deliberate usurpations of the authority of the legislature.""But the Framers underestimated the Justices' craving for legislative power, and they overestimated the Congress' backbone to curb it. It was clear even before the end of the founding era that the threat of impeachment was, in Thomas Jefferson's words, ""not even a scarecrow"" to the Justices. Today, the remedy of impeachment  the only one provided under our Constitution to cure judicial tyranny  is still no remedy at all. A Senate that cannot muster 51 votes to block an Attorney General nominee openly committed to continue an unprecedented course of executive branch lawlessness can hardly be expected to muster the 67 votes needed to impeach an Anthony Kennedy.The time has come, therefore, to recognize that the problem lies not with the lawless rulings of individual lawless Justices, but with the lawlessness of the Court itself. The decisions that have deformed our constitutional order and have debased our culture are but symptoms of the disease of liberal judicial activism that has infected our judiciary. A remedy is needed that will restore health to the sick man in our constitutional system.Rendering the Justices directly accountable to the people would provide such a remedy. Twenty states have now adopted some form of judicial retention elections, and the experience of these States demonstrates that giving the people the regular, periodic power to pass judgment on the judgments of their judges strikes a proper balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability. It also restores respect for the rule of law to courts that have systematically imposed their personal moral values in the guise of constitutional rulings. The courts in these states have not been politicized by this check on their power, nor have judges been removed indiscriminately or wholesale. Americans are a patient, forgiving people. We do not pass judgment rashly.Yet we are a people who believe, in the words of our Declaration of Independence that ""when a long train of abuses and usurpations . . . evinces a design to reduce [the people] under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security."" In California, the people said enough is enough in 1986, and removed from office three activist justices who had repeatedly contorted the state constitution to effectively outlaw capital punishment, no matter how savage the crime. The people of Nebraska likewise removed a justice who had twice disfigured that state's constitution to overturn the people's decision to subject state legislators to term limits. And in 2010, the voters of Iowa removed three justices who had, like the Supreme Court in Obergefell, invented a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.Judicial retention elections have worked in states across America; they will work for America. In order to provide the people themselves with a constitutional remedy to the problem of judicial activism and the means for throwing off judicial tyrants, I am proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that would subject the Justices of the Supreme Court to periodic judicial retention elections. Every Justice, beginning with the second national election after his or her appointment, will answer to the American people and the states in a retention election every eight years. Those justices deemed unfit for retention by both a majority of the American people as a whole and by majorities of the electorates in at least half of the 50 states will be removed from office and disqualified from future service on the Court.As a constitutional conservative, I do not make this proposal lightly. I began my career as a law clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquistone of our Nation's greatest chief justicesand I have spent over a decade litigating before the Supreme Court. I revere that institution, and have no doubt that Rehnquist would be heartbroken at what has befallen our highest court.But, sadly, the Court's hubris and thirst for power have reached unprecedented levels. And that calls for meaningful action, lest Congress be guilty of acquiescing to this assault on the rule of law.And if Congress will not act, passing the constitutional amendments needed to correct this lawlessness, then the movement from the People for an Article V Convention of the Statesto propose the amendments directlywill grow stronger and stronger.As we prepare to celebrate next week the 239th anniversary of the birth of our country, our Constitution finds itself under sustained attack from an arrogant judicial elite. Yet the words of Daniel Webster ring as true today as they did over 150 years ago: ""Hold on, my friends, to the Constitution and to the Republic for which it stands. Miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in 6,000 years, may not happen again. Hold on to the Constitution, for if the American Constitution should fail, there will be anarchy throughout the world."" We must hold fast to the miracle that is our Constitution and our Republic; we must not submit our constitutional freedoms, and the promise of our nation, to judicial tyranny."

When we last spoke in January, you advised that the best way to convince Branch not to run was to bring aboard as many ""old bulls"" across the state as possible, so that the rest of the state would counteract his natural base in Highland Park. Since then, I've spent 18 hours a day doing nothing but working to follow that course of action, and we've been fortunate to enjoy significant success.None of that matters, though. I got my start in politics (such as it was) working for you and for President Bush 43, and I've spent much of my adult life working to support the President. The last thing I would ever want to do is place either of you in a difficult situation.When I asked to visit with President Bush 41, and he very kindly agreed, I imagined that we would spend maybe 20 minutes talking about the race, he would give his insights on Texas politics, and that would be it. I could not have been more astonished when he offered his support and gave me a personal check for the campaign.Obviously, I recognize that President Bush 41's support is a very big deal, and inded I had been in discussions with his office about our issuing a press release about the endorsement. Given the concerns you expressed this afternoon, I have told 41's office that we will skip the press release altogether (see below).His support will of course attract attention (much of which will be beyond my control), but I will very much follow your counsel to downplay the support and not highlight it in any way.My hope is that this race will ultimately end up in a win-win scenario, that Dan will choose to run for the new Dallas congressional seat that will be drawn in 2012 and that he and I can work together as friends and allies for a long time. I know that a number of key donors have been urging precisely that course of action, which, if Dan were to choose to follow, would perhaps alleviate some of the concerns we discussed.I know that it doesn't rise to the importance of what you have been doing these past eight years, but I do think there is a real need right now for new leadership in the Republican Party, and I am hopeful that this campaign can play at least some role in helping provide that leadership. Your legacy and President Bush 43's legacy, and especially the enormous progress y'all made in the Hispanic community, are too important not to keep pressing ahead.Karl, you've been a friend and mentor a long time, and I value that friendship immensely. Please let me know anything I can possibly do to address your and President Bush 43's concerns.Thanks so much.Ted. Forwarded Message -From: Ted Cruz <email address redacted>To: President George H.W.

The last thing I want to do is cause any trouble, so it's probably wiser just to forego this press release.So, unless you disagree, I think it probably makes sense simply to include 41 on our overall list of donors, but not to do any separate release or anything highlighting his support, for which I remain deeply, deeply grateful.Thanks so much,Ted."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"June 29, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz: A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America,"Book exposing the 'Washington Cartel' hits stores Tuesday, June 30HOUSTON, Texas  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced today the release of his long-anticipated book, A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America. The book will hit stores nationwide on Tuesday, June 30. A Time for Truth offers unique insights of the inner workings of Washington through the lens of Cruz's personal experience. In the book, Cruz pointedly identifies the underlying fundamental corruption of Washington's power players or as he has recently described them, 'the Washington Cartel'. Cruz convincingly exposes how the rigged game works for DC insiders at the expense of the American people.In A Time for Truth, Cruz shows how the Washington Cartel has made politicians more accountable to lobbyists and special interests than to the people who elected them. He offers a rare look behind the curtain at Washington's backroom deal-making including the emblematic story of the debt ceiling fight where the Republican leaders in the Senate tried to have it both ways  rigging the game to raise the limit while voting against it. He remarks how surprising it was to him how easily politicians assimilate into Washington's corrupt culture and how few resist it.He calls out the deceitfulness of Republican leadership in the Obamacare fight where Senate Leader Mitch McConnell won his own race campaigning against it but inside the Senate, led the fight to keep it.A Time for Truth also gives readers a lesser-known in-depth perspective into Cruz's career leading up to his unlikely win in the 2012 race for United States Senate in Texas. He writes about his time working as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist and as Solicitor General for the State of Texas arguing nine times in front of that same court. In his role as one of the nation's top litigators, he gives surprising details of a Supreme Court case he won against the George W. Bush administration. The win was a major victory for the Second Amendment and U.S. sovereignty where the administration argued in favor of placing international law over the Constitution.But A Time for Truth goes well beyond politics and policy. Cruz writes introspectively about his own remarkable personal journey. As the son of an immigrant father and glass-ceiling breaking mother who both instilled in him a love for America and inspired him to work hard to keep its promise for the next generation. Cruz tells the remarkable American story of being the son a working-class Irish-Italian mother and a Cuban father who came to this country with almost nothing, to becoming a U.S. Senator and candidate for President of the United States.Cruz will spend the next two weeks promoting the message of A Time for Truth in a national tour that begins today in New York and continues on with stops in Texas and several other states after that.

We are building a grassroots team that will touch each county and reach every precinct, and I know that Bill will help build that strong team here in western Iowa.""Anderson, who works in the Congressional office of Rep. Steve King when not serving in the Iowa Senate, is also a former member of the Iowa Republican Party State Central Committee.

Ted Cruz promises to take readers behind the scenes in Washington with his new memoir, A Time for Truth. And what he writes is not always flattering  even about himself....In an interview with The Texas Tribune, Cruz said he wrote the book during ""lot of late nights, a lot of weekends, a lot of hours on the road. ... A significant chunk of the last Christmas vacation, while my girls were opening presents under the tree, I was back in the home office pounding away at the keyboard."" Here are seven new insights Cruz offers in the book.Roll Call: 'A Time For Truth' Pulls No PunchesAs to be expected from a senator who has openly sought to undermine GOP leadership, ""A Time for Truth"" does not pull punches, leading off with anecdotes about one of the more bizarre sequences of events in recent Senate history: the day the clerk's microphone was turned off for a crucial vote on raising the debt limit...""When I made my case to my colleagues, they looked at me like I was a fool. I heard more than one variation of, 'That's what you say to folks back home. You don't actually do it.' They were convinced they had a brilliant maneuver to raise the debt ceiling without any fingerprints,"" Cruz writes. ""And here was a freshman senator with the temerity to screw it all up.""Daily Caller: Ted Cruz: 'Voters Would Be Astonished' To Know What GOP Senators Say And Do In Private""During my time in the Senate, I've been amazed how many senators pose one way in publicas fiscal conservatives or staunch Tea Party supporters, for exampleand then in private do little or nothing to advance those principles,"" Cruz writes in his new book, ""A Time For Truth."" ""Indeed, if transcripts of our Senate lunches were released to the public, I think many voters would be astonished,"" the Republican presidential candidate writes.Texas Tribune: Cruz: Far More Important to Stick to our PrinciplesIn adolescence, young adulthood, and now as a junior senator running for the presidency, he has rubbed people the wrong way  and he is self-aware about it. ""When I was in junior high and a geek, I thought that popularity was the Holy Grail,"" Cruz said in a New York City interview with The Texas Tribune about his new memoir, A Time for Truth. ""And in high school, where I achieved some modicum of popularity, I discovered it wasn't all that,"" he added. ""That it was far more important to stick to your principles and maintain your integrity.""Dallas Morning News: Cruz Touts Aspirations in New Book""I've endeavored to be candid and straightforward about personal victories and personal failures,"" Cruz said Monday from New York at the outset of a two-week book tour....Long passages defending his role in the 2013 government shutdown or expressing his antipathy toward President Barack Obama, Obamacare, Iran, Russia and squishy moderates, among others, will sound familiar to anyone who has heard him speak. But there are also surprises. As a clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Cruz once watched online pornography with his boss and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. As a policy adviser to George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, he spent the afternoon of Election Day bowling with actress Bo Derek.MSNBC: In Book, Cruz Battles Senate Colleagues""Sometimes, people ask me, 'When you have a room full of Republican senators yelling at you to back down and compromise your principles, why don't you just give in?

But without a doubt, particularly among those who currently hold office or once did so, Cruz is a standout not just for his smarts but for that willingness to follow through on this promise to his Texas constituents in his successful Senate campaign against a Texas GOP establishment figure:""If I go to Washington, and I just vote right a hundred percent of the time, I will consider myself an abject failure. If I am not standing on the front lines with arrows sticking out of my torso, I won't be doing my job.""Without doubt, Ted Cruz now has some of those scars from the arrows coming his way  many of them from establishment Republicans whose favorite firing position is from the back.

For example, this week's #1 and #2 books on Bookscan are also #1 and #2 on the NYT list. But the #3 book, Cruz's A Time for Truth, has been omitted altogether from the top twenty spots on the New York Times list.This is despite the fact that Cruz's book sold more copies last week than 18 of the 20 books on the list.Their decision to blackball Cruz's book suggests that the Times very much does not want people to read the book.The Times's initial explanation was cryptic: ""We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold.""When the Times was roundly condemned for its obvious political bias, they issued a revised statement: ""In the case of this book, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.""This statement is false, and the Times knows it.There were no ""strategic bulk purchases."" Cruz spent last week on a nation-wide book tour, signing copies of his book at multiple locations. Booksellers at each event had long linessometimes over 400 people per event.Pictures from some of these signings may be found here: Arlington, TX, Katy, TX, and Sioux City, IA.Simultaneously, Cruz's book was ranked the #1 political seller on Amazon, and made it as high as the #9 overall seller (across all categories, including fiction).""The Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out. But their responsealleging 'strategic bulk purchases'is a blatant falsehood,"" said Cruz campaign spokesperson Rick Tyler. ""The evidence is directly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has tried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher Harper Collins.""""We call on the Times, release your so-called 'evidence.'

Cruz and HarperCollins editor Adam Bellow (NRO.com, 7/10/15).As a factual matter, there are only two possibilities: (1) the Times possesses some mysterious, hidden evidence of bulk salesthat neither HarperCollins nor any other best-seller list could manage to discover, or (2) no such evidence exists, and the Times deliberately lied in order to hide their partisan bias.""The New York Times holds itself out as the 'newspaper of record,'"" said Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler. ""If it lied deliberatelyif the Times tried to slander the character of Senator Cruz and his publisher, knowing the charge to be falsethen that goes directly to the journalistic integrity of the institution.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"July 16, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz on The Kelly File: Video Highlights the Evil of Planned Parenthood's Actions,"Calls for Criminal Investigation by DOJ and State Attorneys GeneralHOUSTON, Texas  Yesterday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with Megyn Kelly to discuss the reports regarding Planned Parenthood's alleged practice of selling aborted babies' body parts.Specifically, Sen. Cruz said:""These tapings of Planned Parenthood selling body parts are grotesque. It really highlights the evil of what they are doing.""Two things need to happen. Number one there needs to be a criminal investigation  there are at least three federal laws that are potentially violated. One, selling the body parts of unborn children for profit. Number two for any transfer of tissue, there has to be written consent from the mother. And number three, under federal law, you cannot change the method of abortion if you are trying to get tissue  in that tape, you see they are discussing different methods to capture.""So I am calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate  has federal law been violated? And I am calling on state officials and  any location where Planned Parenthood exists  for state district attorneys, state attorneys general to investigate criminal conduct.""And I'll say in addition, that I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe the Judiciary Committee will hold oversight hearings to get to the bottom of what they did. I chair the oversight, federal rights and federal courts subcommittee, and if the full committee doesn't hold hearings, I intend to hold hearings to get to the bottom of what appears to be barbaric practices being carried out by Planned Parenthood."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"July 20, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Rep. Jim Bridenstine Endorses Cruz for President,"Oklahoma Conservative Says Cruz is a ""Winner"" and ""Proven Fundraiser""HOUSTON, Texas  Oklahoma Representative Jim Bridenstine, one of the most principled conservatives in the House of Representatives, has endorsed U.S.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for President. Bridenstine is a vocal leader among a growing group of young conservatives in the House that have pushed for smaller, more accountable government, full repeal of Obamacare, and protections for religious liberty. The Oklahoma Republican becomes the sixth Member of Congress to endorse Cruz following announcements from Texas Representatives Louie Gohmert, Michael Burgess, John Culberson, John Ratcliffe, and Brian Babin.In a recent Breitbart.com op-ed Bridenstine wrote:At a time when judicial activism and DC's perverse incentives are concentrating power in Washington, we need a tested candidate who has confronted the giants from the inside, rejected them, and defeated them. Selecting such a nominee is critical, because nobody comes to Washington and becomes more principled.I have seen Sen. Ted Cruz meet the test by standing up to the Washington Cartel. In 2013, when both political parties suggested we needed to change our approach to the Second Amendment, Sen. Ted Cruz fought back and came out the winner. In the same year, when both political parties were moving at breakneck speed to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that included amnesty, Sen. Ted Cruz once again fought back, stood against the Washington Cartel, and came out the winner.Some say he stands alone, but I say he stands with the American people. I saw that most clearly when he fought with everything he had to defund Obamacare. He told Republicans that funding Obamacare subsidies would create a dependency that Congress would never repeal and the Supreme Court would never overturn. He quoted Ronald Reagan: ""A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth."" After June's Supreme Court ruling, we now know that Ted Cruz was correct....Ted Cruz is a proven fundraiser, and that will be necessary to defeat the Clinton machine. True grassroots candidates, like Ted Cruz, generally struggle after the first few primary states due to funding. Ted is different. He will go the distance. This alone should excite and motivate all of us who have been waiting for a full spectrum, grass-roots candidate to vie for the Republican nomination.I am proud to be the sixth Member of Congress to endorse Ted Cruz for President. I believe he is the strongest candidate and that he will beat Hillary Clinton for the Presidency in 2016.Read the full endorsement here."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released a video telling the story of Dick and Betty Odgaard, the Iowa couple who recently had to shut down their business as a result of the Iowa Civil Rights Commission's efforts to force them to host a same-sex wedding ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs. The video highlights the Odgaards' experience with government-sanctioned religious intolerance, as well as their reaction to being targeted. Cruz will host a special event in Des Moines, IA, next month featuring the Odgaards.""It was devastating to hear that we were bigots, we were homophobes, we were haters,"" Betty Odgaard recounts. ""We just kept thinking, 'they don't know us.' How can they be calling us all these horrible, horrible things when they don't know what's in our hearts? We don't have any hatred toward gay people.""As a result of the suit, the Odgaards stopped hosting weddings at their event venue, which all but destroyed their business, leading them to the decision to close their doors at the end of the summer.""And that has been quite painful,"" tells Dick Odgaard. ""As a result of that, the business has declined. We just can't support it. So we're within  by the end of August we'll be shutting our doors.""New data show Americans are strongly opposed to government forcing business owners to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. Nearly three out of five people (59%) now say that businesses with wedding-related services should not have to provide those services to same-sex couples, an increase of seven percent from April.""Our country was founded by people who risked everything for religious liberty, free of the government getting in the way,"" Cruz tells the Odgaards in the video. ""And I want to thank both of you, number one, for taking a stand. But number two, for telling your story.""Your story is powerful. Your story is inspirational and inspires me, and it inspires millions of believers, believers of many faiths across this country who want to live in a land where we're free to live out according to our faith and our convictions and it's not second guessed by the government stepping in and saying, we don't share your faith and we're going to shut you down.""Cruz will host a ""Rally for Religious Liberty"" in Des Moines, Iowa on August 21 at 6:30 pm CT. The event will take place at the Iowa Events Center and feature the Odgaards as special guests. Registration is open to the public here.

Excerpts from the article appear below:A New Poll Shows the Contours of the GOP FieldNational JournalJuly 23, 2015Charlie CookThis poll is particularly interesting because unlike surveys conducted by most news organizations, it starts off sampling from a data file of actual registered voters, then screens down those most likely to actually cast their vote in their state primary or caucus....The poll for the Cruz campaign starts off with a trial heat, with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at the top with real likely voters at 17 percent, followed by Trump with 15 percent, well within the 3.5-point margin of error for this survey. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush follows in third with 11 percent, then a two-way tie for fourth between Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson. Next comes Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida with 6 percent, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 5 percent, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky with 4 percent. Another 12 percent chose someone else, and 16 percent were undecided (polls of likely voters usually show lower numbers of undecided)....When looking at these ratings it's useful to look at the ratio of favorables to unfavorables. Carson had the best ratio with 7.4 to 1, Rubio and Walker tied at second with 5.5-1 and Cruz fourth at 3.8 to 1. The four with weakest ratios were Huckabee at 2.7-1, Trump and Bush tied with 1.7-1 and finally Paul 1.5-1....Cruz pollster Chris Wilson looked at the new data through the lens of the Selzer Score, finding Walker at the top with a Selzer Score of 74, followed by Trump with 64.5, Bush third with 63.5 and Cruz fourth with 54, just ahead of Rubio's 53.5. The bottom three were Carson at 46.5, a hair ahead of Huckabee's 46 then Paul rounding out the pack with 37.5....Obviously many more polls will be coming out and new theories will emerge but this survey, along with others that screen down hard are important to consider. Right now, the ""plus four"" to go along with Trump are Bush, Cruz, Rubio and Walker.Read the full article here."

Generally speaking, I prefer governors to Senators, and I have an especial wariness for first term Senators...However, episode three billion in the GOP Failure Theater tour, this time featuring Planned Parenthood failure theater, has pushed me into the camp that makes me want, more than anything, to see a Presidential candidate who is willing to fight and show the cowering squishes who run this party how it is done....Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), on the other hand, has shown time and time again a willingness to put himself at risk of personal and professional alienation for the sake of his principles. Whatever you think about Cruz's repeated efforts to repeal Obamacare, his actions with respect to the Planned Parenthood defunding fight have demonstrated, even for those who have been inclined to defend leadership over the years, how well and truly rotten the Senate leadership is....If you are coming increasingly to the belief  as I am  that willingness to fight is the most important qualification for our 2016 nominee, then it's time to take a second hard look at Sen.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"August 6, 2015","Press Release - Ted Cruz, Proven Record: ""Cruz has stood in decidedly Reagan-style against the Republican Washington Establishment""","CLEVELAND, Ohio  Ted Cruz is a conservative who's willing to stand up not only to the Democratic insiders in the Washington Cartel, but also to the insiders from his own party. He's willing to stand up to the media. And most important, Ted Cruz has a proven record of standing up and fighting for these conservative beliefs when others have turned and ran for the tall grass. This race isn't about who can be the best campaign conservative, it's about who can be the most consistent conservative.In response to a question about how he would work with Republican leadership, Sen. Cruz responded: ""The American people are looking for someone to speak the truth... There is a reason that we have $18 trillion in debt because as Republicans, as conservatives, we keep winning elections  we got a Republican House, we got a Republican Senate  but we don't have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.""As was noted in American Spectator:In a conversation with The American Spectator, Cruz made it plain that he intends to pursue a 21st-century version of the insurgency strategy pioneered by the late Ronald Reagan. Bringing together the Reagan wing of the GOP that is composed of national security, social, pro-growth, and libertarian conservatives. The Reagan coalition broadened the base of the party to bring in everyone from evangelicals to women to union workers to Latinos. Reagan's nomination battles in both 1976 (when he almost defeated GOP Establishment favorite and sitting president Gerald Ford) and 1980 (when he defeated Establishment favorite George H.W. Bush) summoned a virtual army of supporters who had previously never spent a day in politics.This would be well in keeping with Cruz's record in the Senate, where Cruz has stood in decidedly Reagan-style against the Republican Washington Establishment, notably with his bold plan to defund Obamacare in 2013. That line-in-the-sand tactic, something Reagan used repeatedly as candidate and president to draw a bright red line between Republicans and Democrats, was furiously assaulted by many of Cruz's Republican Senate colleagues and most of the Establishment GOP, with some GOP senators going out of their way to deliberately sabotage the Cruz effort to defund the highly unpopular mandatory health program.Cruz was also opposed at the time by other potential GOP presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Chris Christie, as well as the losing 2012 party nominees Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.

""Enough of the concessions, capitulations and backroom deals that make up President Obama's catastrophic nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran.""He continued: ""The most recent revelation that Iran will be selecting its own inspectors to verify the nature of its nuclear program is made all the more egregious by the fact that as the single largest contributor to the IAEA (support that is mandated in the JCPOA) United States taxpayers will be paying for a farce that is a direct threat to their own security.""Cruz, who has been an outspoken critic of the Iran nuclear deal since it was announced, argued the agreement is a matter of national security, not politics.""This is not a partisan issue.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"August 20, 2015",Press Release - Joe Carr Endorses Cruz for President,"HOUSTON, Texas Today, former three-term State Representative and U.S. Senate candidate Joe Carr endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz for President. Carr, a conservative stalwart in the Tennessee state legislature for six years, said Cruz's proven record of fighting for the issues that matter most to conservatives makes him the best qualified leader to restore American greatness.""Ted Cruz is not only willing to stand firm on principle every time, but has done so when it mattered most,"" said Carr. ""He has taken on the Establishment in both parties, even when it was unpopular and victory was far from certain. That's the kind of fighter we need in the White House defending the American people, the sovereignty of the states, and our constitutional rights. In our U.S. Senate race our campaign received over 271,000 votes. Those are Cruz voters and I am going to do all I can to make sure they understand Ted Cruz is our best candidate for President of the United States.""During his tenure in the Tennessee state legislature, Carr developed a reputation for his willingness to take on the leadership of his own party, especially on the issue of illegal immigration. While a member of the Tennessee General Assembly he authored, sponsored, and passed some of the strongest immigration laws at the state level in the country. He made the fight against amnesty a central piece of his Senate campaign in 2014 and convinced conservatives around the country  including nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham  to support his campaign. He is also a passionate advocate for religious liberty and restoring constitutional principles in government.""Joe Carr is a conservative's conservative,"" said Senator Cruz. ""He is willing to stand firm and speak out even when his own party gets it wrong. That shows not only great respect for principle but estimable character, as well. Tennessee will play a critical role in the primary and, along with the top-notch team we've assembled in the state, having Joe's support gives us a big advantage.""""We are pleased to welcome Joe Carr to our Tennessee leadership team,"" added Tennessee State Chairman Kevin Kookogey. ""Joe demonstrated a commitment to taking on the establishment in 2014, and we look forward to working with him to move Tennessee even further into the Cruz category."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"August 20, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Ted Cruz in USA Today: End Planned Parenthood funding,"Accounting gimmicks can't hide the fact that federal support ultimately pays for abortion.HOUSTON, Texas  Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote an op-ed in USA Todayresponding to the latest horrific videos showing Planned Parenthood callously discussing killing unborn children in order to sell their body parts. The full op-ed is available here and excerpts may be viewed below:Over the past few weeks, Americans have seen a series of videos come out of Planned Parenthood that are nothing short of horrifying. The footage shows senior Planned Parenthood officials laughing, swilling chardonnay and casually, callously, heartlessly discussing killing unborn children in order to sell their body parts. These videos also force Americans to face the grim reality of what happens to the babies' remains.While the sheer candor of these Planned Parenthood officials has shocked most, what is more disturbing is the admission that these barbaric actions are standard practice in some abortion clinics. Worse still, Americans are currently forced to fund the organization that commits these acts. This must end. An organization that generates a large part of its revenue from terminating innocent human life should not receive one penny of taxpayer money and those who engage in what may be criminal activity must be held to account.For this reason, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should not schedule or facilitate the consideration of any legislation that gives federal money to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the Department of Justice needs to investigate and prosecute Planned Parenthood for any potential criminal actions of commercial trafficking of fetal organs....The abortion industry places more value on killing babies than it does on the sanctity of human life, and under no circumstance should it receive taxpayer funds. This is more than a mere fiscal matter  this is a moral issue. How we handle this issue reflects who we are as Americans and what we value most  either the lives of the most innocent and the health of our nation's mothers, daughters and sisters or the fiscal solvency of an industry that exists to abort babies.For these reasons, I intend to lead the fight in the United States Senate to defund Planned Parenthood, even while investigations continue. The time for show votes is over. Funding the federal government does not require funding Planned Parenthood. But basic decency and our commitment to the right to life does require that we stop taxpayer funding of abortions and any trade in baby parts."

Cruz lauded them as ""heroes.""Betsy Klein@betsy_kleinA closing prayer with@tedcruzas the Rally for Religious Liberty moves on to its musical act,@newsboysDes Moines Register: Cruz: Threats Against Religious Liberty Never GreaterIn his opening remarks during the ""Rally for Religious Liberty,"" Cruz referenced a number of Supreme Court cases regarding religious issues that came down to a 5-4 decision.""You want to know what this election is about?

Cruz has been courting faith leaders here, dispatching his father Rafael, a pastor, to speak at events around the state and announcingFridaythat he wants to recruit a pastor in each of Iowa's 99 counties to do faith outreach...While Cruz will be competing for the evangelical vote with candidates including former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former senator Rick Santorum and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, few have been as vociferous about the notion that religious liberty is under attack than Cruz. He brought up the issue repeatedly during a bus tour of the South last week, repeatedly promising that on his first day in office he would direct federal agencies not to meddle with people who believe they have stayed firm to their religious beliefs in the face of social change.""The persecution of religious liberty ends today,"" Cruz said to cheering crowds from the altar of a church in Chattanooga, Tenn., an outdoor stage in Little Rock and the flatbed of a pickup truck in Tupelo, Miss.CNN: In Iowa, Ted Cruz Rallies Religious RightAt his ""Rally for Religious Liberty,"" Cruz sought to appeal to evangelical Republican voters and frame himself as a fighter for religious rights...Cruz spoke about his experience defending freedom of religion at the Supreme Court and what he said were the threats facing religious liberty.""These threats have been growing, they have been growing for decades but never have the threats been greater to religious liberty than they are right here and now today,"" he said.""These threats are not imagined, they're not made up.

Robinson was one of the founders of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and Citizens United, and has served as CEO of YAF for over thirty years. He initiated and directed the effort to save President Reagan's Presidential Home (aka, the Western White House), Rancho del Cielo. Robinson is also a board member of the American Conservative Union, Citizens United, The Government Accountability Institute and several private foundations.""I enthusiastically endorse Ted Cruz for President because, more than any of the other candidates in the race, Ted Cruz has shown that he is a consistent conservative who does not weaken or abandon his principles when the going gets tough. He does not take actions that make him comfortably loved inside the DC Beltway. Just the opposite, Ted Cruz takes bold stands, publicly articulates what all of us conservatives are really thinking, and fights to restore the promise of America. In short, Ted Cruz is a man we can trust to be the same principled conservative before, during, and after the electionand to do what he says he'll do.""Americans are disappointed with their governmentand not just with the current president. In the last twenty-five years, we've had presidents who promised not to raise our taxes, but who did. We've had Supreme Court justices who pledged to fulfill the Founders' vision of limited government and judicial restraint, but who did not. We've had leaders in the House and Senate who boldly promised a consistent and robust opposition to the Democrats' agenda, but once in office provided nothing of the sort. Who we need for America's next president is someone we conservatives can be certain will abide by his principles and promises. That man is Ted Cruz.""I'm a man who has spent his life working with young people, helping to educate America's youth about conservative, constitutional principles and activism. No candidate can better restore hope and optimism among the young than Ted Cruzbecause no candidate can better advance freedom for all of America than Ted Cruz. I urge all conservatives to get behind Ted now. Don't wait. We need to be unified for as long as possible before the primaries if we are to beat the Establishment. Let's win with Ted!"""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 1, 2015",Press Release - Ted on the Trail: Ted Cruz Brings 'Consistent Conservative' Message Back To New Hampshire,"Cruz ""all in"" in New HampshireHOUSTON, Texas On Sunday and Monday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz returned to New Hampshire for several public events as well as the grand opening of the Cruz for President Headquarters in the Granite State. Below is a roundup of some of the coverage from the recent campaign swing:NHPR:Ted Cruz Brings 'Consistent Conservative' Message Back To New HampshireAt a town hall meeting Sunday afternoonCruz told a crowd at New Boston Central School he'd be a different kind of Republican president if elected. By way of example, here's how he described the to-do list for his first day in office, vowing to""rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action,"" ""open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos"" and ""rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal."" He added he would tell federal agencies""the persecution of religious liberty ends today!""Cruz said if voters looked back at the big debates of the last few years, they'd find only he had been involved in every single one  and that, in each, he'd invariably aligned himself with what he considered the true conservative position... Responses like these repeatedly brought the crowd of roughly 200 people to its feet.Concord Monitor:Cruz: NH Leadership Team Is Much Stronger Than Any Other Candidate's In The FieldSen. Ted Cruz is talking about the establishment these days: the one he plans to tear apart in Washington, D.C., and, in the meantime, the one he's building up among his grassroots supporters in early-voting states. The Texas Republican says the latter is the strongest of any presidential candidate.Before unveiling his Manchester headquarters Monday, Cruz stopped in Concord and touted his dedicated teams in New Hampshire and in Iowa, South Carolina and ""across the Super Tuesday states"" as the heart of his campaign. ""Here in New Hampshire, our leadership team is  on any objective measure  much stronger than any other candidate's in the field,"" he said after a business roundtable at The Draft Sports Bar and Grill.Former speaker of the house Bill O'Brien, former U.S. senator Bob Smith and Executive Councilor David Wheeler headline that team, but the list is long. Last week, Cruz announced 66 new endorsements from Granite Staters whose titles range from former state senator or four-term state representative  brothers Fenton and Warren Groen of Rochester, respectively  to ""first-time campaign activist.""@brucereddenjr.@tedcruz #NH office opening. Join us at http://tedcruz.org #CruzCrew #CruzToVictory #Cruz2016Foster's:In NH, Cruz ""is Really Dynamic""More than 150 people visited David and Lydia Scott's farm off Back Road in Dover on a misty, perfect Sunday morning, to meet Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. Although the majority were New Hampshire residents, folks like Conrad Baldini made the trek from Salem, Massachusetts. ""He is really dynamic,"" explained Baldini. ""I really look forward to seeing and hearing him in person."" If elected president, Cruz said he would tackle the IRS, illegal immigration, education and the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare...Cruz commented that if they could entice just a portion of the group at the campaign stop, many of whom did not vote in the past presidential election, it would be a boon to his campaign. He likened the tenor of the country today as similar to the time just before Reagan with Russia and Iran the most dangerous countries then and now.After a spirited question and answer period, the candidate bade farewell, leaving the many to chat among themselves about their impressions of first time senator.Washington Times:Ted Cruz knocks 'campaign conservatives' in New Hampshire""I think all of us are frustrated. We're frustrated with Washington and we're fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another,"" Mr. Cruz said at a Concerned Veterans for America town hall in New Hampshire. ""We've seen that over and over and over again  we always see, every cycle, what I call campaign conservatives  people who on the campaign suddenly become ... the most conservative person you've ever seen.""You notice on that debate stage in Cleveland not a single person stood up there and said, 'I'm an establishment moderate squish. I stand for nothing,'"" he said. ""They don't say that. Every person there claims to be a conservative.""I think as voters and citizens, the test we should apply  Scripture tells us you shall know them by their fruits,"" he said. ""We need to ask not what are you saying on the campaign trail but have you walked the walk? Have you been a consistent conservative, the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow?""[emailprotected].@tedcruz talking with @steinhauserNH1 outside of #TheDraft in #NH #CruzCrew #CruzToVictory #Cruz2016Boston Globe:Ted Cruz sells himself as antiestablishment candidateUS Senator Ted Cruz wrapped up a two-day New Hampshire trip for his presidential campaign, arguing that he is the proven antiestablishment candidate in a crowded field of GOP contenders.Speaking to the New Hampshire House Business Caucus at a sports bar, Cruz told a crowd of about 150, ""If you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run and hide."" There are others in the race, the Texan said, who are ""squishy Washington establishment moderates, but they don't tell you that...""[Rice University professor Robert Stein said] ""It's also worth noting that Cruz has a clear plan for his path to the nomination, one built on becoming the standard bearer for evangelicals, Tea Party, and nonestablishment Republicans. If he survives through South Carolina, Super Tuesday states look very hospitable to his candidacy.""The Federalist:Ted Cruz: 'Grassroots Army' Is Key To VictoryDuring a business roundtable at the Concord, New Hampshire bar, the Texas senator and GOP presidential hopeful slammed the Obama administration and presented his plan to fix the country despite the machinations of what he calls the ""Washington cartel"" including through healthcare and tax reform and a tough foreign policy stance.Cruz's campaign stops Sunday drew hundreds across the Granite State where the Tea Party icon said support has been ""electric"" and ""unbelievably strong...""""Conservatives, evangelicals, we're seeing young people, Hispanics, African-Americans, women, Reagan Democrats, all coming together and it's from the grassroots,"" he said, adding his approach to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina is ""all in"" and can appeal to the more conservative voters of Iowa as well as the more varied libertarian, conservative and Independent voters of New Hampshire.@brucereddenjr.@tedcruz at the New Boston Town Hall #NH #CruzCrew #CruzToVictory #Cruz2016NHPR:Cruz ""All In"" in New HampshireCruz says going forward his campaign will be ""all in"" when it comes to New Hampshire.

The electrician and father of two said he's not ready to choose a candidate yet, but liked what he heard from Cruz.""He seems like he could be the real deal,"" Gagnon said, ""like a genuine person that's willing to go to bat for the American people, not just the Republican establishment but for all people."""

Political activist Wyatt English of Iowa and Secretary of the High School Republicans of Texas Adam Hoffman will serve as co-chairs.""Young people are looking for someone who does more than just talk a good game. They want someone who has walked the walk,"" Sen. Cruz said. ""They're looking for a fighter. But most importantly, they're looking for someone who cares. Someone who cares about their struggle, cares about their future and has actually stood up and fought for it. In the Senate, I fought back against raising the debt ceiling and spending away their future, while many of my colleagues decided to lay down their arms and do just that. I fought for their Fourth Amendment rights, guaranteed to them by our Constitution, when the illegal and unconstitutional mass data collection practices of the NSA were exposed. Young people care about these issues, and so do I. I'm proud to have CJ, Wyatt, and Adam leading these efforts as we seek to capture the youth vote in 2016.""At 13 years old, CJ Pearson commands a brand, following, and political message that inspires the youngest of followers to even an older generation of conservatives. Since the age of 8, CJ has considered himself a conservative. With a Facebook base of over 45,000 followers and a YouTube channel viewership of well over 3 million, in less than five months, CJ Pearson's work has been seen on many networks. He's been featured on Fox News, the Washington Times, USA Today, and featured by commentators including Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham. Strongly believing that young people, regardless of political affiliation, must become involved in the political process, CJ founded the Young Georgians in Government. He served as Executive Director where he has introduced pieces of legislation to the Georgia General Assembly, including a House resolution seeking to lower the age to seek office in both the state House and Senate.

Beren Academy in Houston, Texas and also serves as the Secretary of the High School Republicans of Texas.

In 2013, Adam founded Food4them, a nonprofit organization which distributes more than 3 tons of food annually to food pantries in the Greater Houston Area""It is truly humbling to be given the opportunity to serve in such a capacity within this campaign's youth operation,"" says Pearson. ""Cruz For President is the first campaign, on both sides of the aisle in this 2016 presidential election, to specifically target teenage voters. In 25 states, seventeen year olds will be given the opportunity to cast their ballot in the presidential primaries. It is my firm belief that Sen. Cruz's bold message of limited government and constitutional conservatism will be a leading factor in our campaign capturing their much valued support. """

Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 10, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Washington Times: How Ted Cruz is running the Republican table,"With Churchillian defiance, the Texas senator doesn't believe in surrenderHOUSTON, Texas  The Washington Times' Monica Crowley writes that Cruz, ""the original outsider"" stands a world apart from other candidates running in the Presidential race because he has ""waged so many lonely battles against President Obama, the left, the media and many in his own party."" Crowley continues, ""proud of the battle scars he's earned trying to restore America, he charges ahead with Churchillian defiance.""The article from The Washington Times may be viewed here and below:In the spring of 2011, I heard about a dazzling young conservative, the former solicitor general of Texas, who was running for a soon-to-be-open U.S. Senate seat. Brilliant and charismatic, he was a Princeton and Harvard Law graduate who seemed to relish rubbing that pedigree in the faces of Ivy League liberals who couldn't fathom why he wasn't ""one of them."" But Ted Cruz would never be ""one of them,"" and that gave him the makings of a conservative superstar.So I invited this political unknown with negligible poll numbers to appear as a guest on my national radio show. One of the first  and most dynamic  candidates to emerge from the then-nascent Tea Party movement, Mr. Cruz spiritedly championed limited government, fiscal responsibility and economic freedom. When I asked if we could trust him to stay true to those principles, he replied unequivocally, ""I give you my word. I will fight with everything I have for them and for this great country.""And he did. He waged so many lonely battles against President Obama, the left, the media and many in his own party  over Obamacare, the debt ceiling, taxes, Mr. Obama's executive orders, gutting of the military and global retrenchment  that I began tweeting, ""Must Ted Cruz do everything?""He was the original outsider.That earned him the enmity of those who resented how bad his leadership made them look. But he wasn't sent to Washington to be a party apparatchik, and he's remained one of the very few who has staunchly resisted that town's seductive call to sell out.Now running for the GOP nomination, he is playing the long game very skillfully. Having already raised substantial money, Mr. Cruz has made the strategically smart decision to establish something of an alliance with another outsider, current poll leader Donald Trump. If Mr. Trump recedes, Mr. Cruz will be best positioned to inherit the significant, passionate anti-establishment vote.Mr. Cruz is now consistently the top-ranked candidate after the three unconventional candidates, Mr. Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. He's betting that when voters must make a final decision, they will choose a fighter, but the fighter who has actually been in the arena.I spoke with Mr. Cruz this week about a range of issues, starting with whether he believes that Mr. Obama and the left have succeeded in changing the very nature of America. ""They have certainly tried and not without some success,"" he replies. ""But I am deeply optimistic that we can reverse that trend. But here's the good news, I think that a great majority of Americans want to stand on their own feet. And they will if they are empowered to do so.""We do that by creating a fairer, flatter tax code, putting an end to stifling regulations that hinder innovation and job creation like Obamacare, and returning power from Washington back to the people.""How would he wage his longstanding fight against the entrenched ruling class differently as the chief executive?""Leadership starts at the top,"" he says. ""And once we have a commander in chief that fights for the interests of the people instead of the Washington cartel  the career politicians in both parties, who are in cahoots with lobbyists and special interests to maintain their own power  we will finally see change in Washington.""But we will not break the Washington cartel without a mandate from the people, and a leader willing to follow that mandate. Once that happens, it will be more politically risky for the politicians in Washington to do the wrong thing than to do the right thing.""I also asked this constitutional lawyer how he would reconcile defending our rights and freedoms while fighting a religiously-based enemy  the Islamic State, al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood  that uses those liberties to destroy us.""Religious liberty is the first liberty protected in the First Amendment; it is foundational to every other liberty,"" he says. ""But Americans are not fooled by those hiding behind the perversion of religion to promote death and violence across the globe. I think we need to see this enemy not in terms of religion, but in terms of a vicious, totalitarian ideology that is the radical Islamism espoused by the groups you name.""After citing Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and King Abdullah of Jordan as Arab leaders the United States should be supporting in this fight, Mr. Cruz turns his attention to protecting the homeland:""I'm proud to have sponsored legislation in the United States Senate that would revoke U.S. citizenship from any American fighting for or supporting ISIS or other designated terrorist group. If you go fight for ISIS, you are essentially signing your death certificate, and you will under no circumstances be returning to our homeland. Those actively promoting the views held by radical Islamic terrorists who seek to destroy everything that is foundational to America must be stopped, and under my administration they will be.""Mr. Cruz may be in a race with 16 other candidates, but as usual, he stands a world apart. Proud of the battle scars he's earned trying to restore America, he charges ahead with Churchillian defiance. And like Churchill, Mr. Cruz runs the political table strategically, with precision  and doesn't believe in surrender."

""You cannot wash your hands of that blood."" He said Republican leaders in Congress have the power to stop the deal, even though Democrats have the votes to protect it, if they delay a vote on a resolution of disapproval on the grounds that the president violated the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act by failing to disclose ""side deals"" between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency.Linda Suhler, Ph.D. [emailprotected]Ted Cruz: Dems Must Reject Party Loyalty & Kill #IranDeal#NoNuclearIranhttp://bit.ly/1ieccuKWashington Post:Cruz warns of ""catastrophic consequences"" of Iran DealBusiness mogul Donald Trump and Sen.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 14, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Union Leader: Why liberty-minded conservatives should choose Ted Cruz,"HOUSTON, Texas  Emily O'Neill, a small-business owner from Bedford, NH writes in the Union Leader that Cruz is the right presidential candidate to support because he can ""unite independents and conservatives while remaining a strong defender of the Constitution and our economic freedoms."" O'Neill continues, ""Cruz has a solid record of fighting for our civil and economic liberties.""The article from theUnion Leader may be viewed here and below:OVER THE YEARS, our liberties have suffered a thousand razor cuts from neoconservatives who vote to sacrifice our natural privacy rights for security and progressives who push to expand the size and scope of government, supposedly in the name of social justice.I've been actively involved in promoting libertarian causes and candidates since 2009. I've campaigned for Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Justin Amash, and even ran as a candidate for state rep last year.I believe the right presidential candidate to support is one who can unite independents and conservatives while remaining a strong defender of the Constitution and our economic freedoms. I found that candidate in Sen. Ted Cruz.In August, I had the fortune of meeting him at a campaign dinner. While I had been on the fence about whom to support, it didn't take long for me to make a decision afterward. I can tell you firsthand that Cruz is the type of leader whose presence is felt without speaking a word. He commands his audience and presents well-reasoned arguments. Beyond his speeches, Cruz has a solid record of fighting for our civil and economic liberties.He rails against Republican leadership for failing fiscal conservatives, and he doesn't appease them in return for political viability. He's voted down the National Defense Authorization Act since he's been in office, as he's argued that certain provisions put Americans' fundamental rights in jeopardy. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he's been outspoken about conflicts that contradict American interests and violate the Constitution. He's been a vocal critic of the TSA, NSA, IRS and countless wasteful and dangerous government programs.Policy aside, I've witnessed how he brings a humanness and sense of humor to a political landscape that's full of talking points and devoid of emotion. During the dinner event I attended, Cruz wasn't immediately engaged in intense political conversation, which admittedly, I would have expected. Instead, he spent most of the time listening to guests talk about their viewpoints and living in New Hampshire, and he later shared funny stories from the campaign.When heated issues were discussed, he cracked jokes and lightened the mood in a respectful way. It was refreshing to see a candidate make the event about everyone else, which demonstrated his emotional intelligence. It's easy to see how he can maintain such strong views, yet continue to gain supporters.Sure, there are some stances that Cruz has taken that I'm either to the right or left of, namely a couple of national security positions and drug policy. For some liberty-minded folks, disagreements on these issues relegate candidates to the 'do not consider' category. This is where I differ.I want progress in the right direction that will garner the most amount of support. I want to make libertarian views mainstream rather than fight in vain. It takes more than a strong ideology to accomplish these goals. It takes tenacity, personality, and a finesse that I believe Cruz possesses.Many acknowledge Cruz's intelligence. His brilliance has translated into a very savvy, strategic ground game that will position him well to win the Republican nomination. He's already raised north of $50 million to fuel his campaign  second behind Gov. Jeb Bush. If you were to remove super PAC funds from the equation, the Cruz campaign has raised the most by far.To me, this proves he has the resources to go up against any establishment candidate. Considering he's fought to rein in the NSA, abolish the IRS, and audit the Federal Reserve, it excites me that he's broadened his appeal, and should for real conservatives and libertarians alike.In sum, my goal in sharing these views is not to knock other contenders, as I have a great deal of respect for a few others. I simply encourage fellow liberty leaning Republicans to take a second look at Cruz. Perhaps they will find, as I have, that we have a candidate with the right views, leadership qualities and strategy to win."

Ted Cruz has been on the front lines fighting to stop this administration's lawless actions who have repeatedly undermined the rule of law.""The Constitution designs a system of checks and balances for our nation, and executive amnesty for immigrants here illegally unilaterally decreed from the White House would seriously undermine the rule of law,"" Cruz wrote in Politico.Our founders repeatedly warned about the dangers of unlimited power within the executive branch; Congress should heed those words as the president threatens to grant amnesty to millions of people who have come to our country illegally.To be clear, the dispute over executive amnesty is not between President Obama and Republicans in Congress; it is a dispute between President Obama and the American people. The Democrats suffered historic losses in the midterm elections largely over the prospect of the president's executive amnesty.President Obama was correct: His policies were on the ballot across the nation in 2014. The elections were a referendum on amnesty, and the voters soundly rejected it. There was no ambiguity.Undeterred, President Obama appears to be going forward. It is lawless. It is unconstitutional. He is defiant and angry at the American people. If he acts by executive diktat, President Obama will not be acting as a president, he will be acting as a monarch."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 16, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz Has Been Leading the Fight to Stop the Nuclear Iran Deal,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.  Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to stop this catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran, that will in no doubt, if it goes through create a path for Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.""The specter of a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic of Iran is the single greatest threat facing our nation, and if President Barack Obama's catastrophic nuclear deal with the mullahs goes forward, there will be nothing to stop them from obtaining a nuclear bomb,"" Cruz wrote in Politico.Today I sent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner a letter that lays out the legal authority they possess as leaders in both Houses of Congress to actually stop this deal.If we believe what we say about this dealthat it is a profound threat to our national security, to the survival of our friend and ally the nation of Israel and potentially to the lives of millions of Americansthen we should act like it. No show votes that are destined to lose; instead, the leadership should exercise their legal authority to actually prevent more than $100 billion from going to the Ayatollah Khamenei.The approach I recommend entails a three-step process, and McConnell and Boehner should seize this opportunity to demonstrate leadership and make it happen.First, both leaders should formally declare that President Obama has not submitted the agreement to Congress as required by Corker-Cardin...Second, Leader McConnell should schedule a vote on a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that, if the agreement had been introduced as a treaty, it would not be ratified...Third, given President Obama's regrettable history of lawlessness, it is reasonable to assume that he will simply ignore the law and declare that he is lifting sanctions under the agreement anyway."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 16, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz Has Been Leading the Fight to Secure the Border,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.  Ted Cruz has consistently led the fight to secure our borders, which is of vital interest to our national security.""We have got to get serious about securing the borders. And if you go and you talk with law enforcement  as you know, I represent Texas. We have got 1,200 miles of border with Mexico. When you go visit with law enforcement, when you visit with Border Patrol agents about what works, the number one most effective tool that works is boots on the ground,"" Cruz told CBS's Face the Nation.That's why I filed legislation to triple the Border Patrol. I was very glad to see that Donald Trump agrees with that proposal.The legislation I filed would also increase four-fold the fixed- wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so we use technology to monitor the border to supplement the boots on the ground. But then, beyond that, 40 percent of illegal immigration doesn't come across the border at all. It's visa overstays.So, the legislation I introduced would put in place a strong biometric exit-entry system, so we can stop visa overstays. And, finally, we should put in place a robust E-Verify system, so you can't get a job without demonstrating you're here legally.It's not that we don't know how to solve illegal immigration. What is missing is the political will to get it done. And, as president, I will get it done. We will secure the borders."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 16, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz Has Been Leading the Fight Against Judicial Activism,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.  Ted Cruz has repeatedly fought to defend life and stand up for marriage when it has come under assault from activist judges.""This week, we have twice seen Supreme Court Justices violating their judicial oaths. Yesterday, the Justices re-wrote Obamacare, yet again, in order to force this failed law on the American people. Today, the Court doubled down with a 5-4 opinion that undermines not just the definition of marriage, but the very foundations of our representative form of government. Both decisions were judicial activism, plain and simple. Both were lawless,"" Cruz wrote in National Review.On the substantive front, I have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage. And the 2016 election has now been transformed into a referendum on Obamacare; in 2017, I believe, a Republican president will sign legislation finally repealing that disastrous law...Not only are the Court's opinions untethered from reason and logic, they are also alien to our constitutional system of limited and divided government. By redefining the meaning of common words, and redesigning the most basic human institutions, this Court has crossed from the realm of activism into the arena of oligarchy.This week's opinions are but the latest in a long line of judicial assaults on our Constitution and the common-sense values that have made America great. During the past fifty years, the Court has condemned millions of innocent unborn children to death, banished God from our schools and public squares, extended constitutional protections to prisoners of war on foreign soil, authorized the confiscation of property from one private owner to transfer it to another, and now required all Americans to purchase a specific product, and to accept the redefinition of an institution ordained by God and long predating the formation of the Court.Enough is enough."

Following the debate, the ad will run during Fox News Channel's post-debate coverage in early states. The total ad buy is $33,000. Details about the ad,as written by theNew York Times, are below, followed by alink to the adand transcript.Ted Cruz Ad Uses Scorpion to Depict Threat of Islamic TerrorNew York TimesTrip GabrielSeptember 15, 2015For aficionados of political ads, the line ""There's a bear in the woods"" still brings a shivery memory of a 1984 spot for Ronald Reagan that helped define his foreign policy of peace through strength.During the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California on Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will evoke that memory in a 30-second ad featuring a scorpion crawling in the desert.The text of ""Scorpion"" is a line-by-line homage to the Reagan spot, evoking the threat of Middle East terrorism rather than the Cold War-era Soviet Union, which the Reagan ad symbolized by using a grizzly bear walking menacingly in a forest.""There's a scorpion in the desert,'' an announcer says in the Cruz ad, as the camera shows various angles of the insect and its hooked stinger.""For most of us, its venom is a clear and deadly threat,"" the announcer continues. ""But others refuse to even speak its name. Since the scorpion seeks our destruction, isn't it time we recognize the scorpion for what it is before it strikes again?''A spokesman for Mr. Cruz said the campaign had paid for the ad to run in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada during the debate on CNN and during post-debate analysis on Fox News.Like the original ""Bear"" ad, which contrasted Reagan with his Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale, ""Scorpion"" is mostly subtext: It is a jab at President Obama for his reluctance to use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" to refer to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, a reluctance Republicans see as a form of weakness. The president has said the term gives terrorists a cover of religious legitimacy""Bear,"" which was written and narrated by Hal Riney, who died in 2008, has been copied before. During his re-election campaign in 2004, President George W. Bush ran ""Wolves"" comparing terrorists to timber wolves.Click here to view ad.TRANSCRIPT:Voiceover:There is a scorpion in the desert.For most of us, its venom is a clear and deadly threat.But others refuse to even speak its name.Since the scorpion seeks out destruction, isn't it time we recognize the scorpion for what it is?Before it strikes again?Ted Cruz:I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"September 16, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz Has Been Leading the Fight to Protect the Unborn and Defund Planned Parenthood,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.  Ted Cruz has continuously led to fight to defund Planned Parenthood and protect and defend life.""While the sheer candor of these Planned Parenthood officials has shocked most, what is more disturbing is the admission that these barbaric actions are standard practice in some abortion clinics. Worse still, Americans are currently forced to fund the organization that commits these acts. This must end,"" Cruz wrote in USA Today.An organization that generates a large part of its revenue from terminating innocent human life should not receive one penny of taxpayer money and those who engage in what may be criminal activity must be held to account.For this reason, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should not schedule or facilitate the consideration of any legislation that gives federal money to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the Department of Justice needs to investigate and prosecute Planned Parenthood for any potential criminal actions of commercial trafficking of fetal organs...For far too long, Planned Parenthood has hidden behind the well-crafted charade that that it exists to protect women's health. In reality, it is in the business of killing unborn children on an industrial scale. Despite what Planned Parenthood contends, abortion procedures, not women's health, are its lifeblood. Hundreds of thousands of annual abortions generate nearly 40% of Planned Parenthood's clinic revenues. Simply put, Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion profiteer. For every woman who gets prenatal care at Planned Parenthood, the organization reports more than 15 abortions. For every woman who is referred for adoption assistance, there are more than 150 abortions...I intend to lead the fight in the United States Senate to defund Planned Parenthood, even while investigations continue. The time for show votes is over. Funding the federal government does not require funding Planned Parenthood. But basic decency and our commitment to the right to life does require that we stop taxpayer funding of abortions and any trade in baby parts."

He's been talking about the Washington Cartel and they're really going to try to emphasize his record in Washington going against the Washington Establishment whether it comes to voting against Chuck Hagel, and really leading that fight a long time ago, leading the fight against gun control, leading the fight against immigration reform, leading the fight against Obamacare. They really want to emphasize that. This week he's going to be on Stephen Colbert tomorrow, he's also going to be with the Pope incidentally.

It's great to be with you Megyn, you know the mainstream media they are not fair and impartial observers, they are partisans, they are Obama's number one protectors and they're rooting for Hillary. Pope Francis has been an incredible voice for life, he's been an incredible voice for marriage, he's been an incredible voice for religious liberty and in all three of them we are seeing an assault that is unprecedented in the history of our country.""The Democrats and media don't want to talk about the fact that today Senate Democrats stood virtually united in support of late term abortion they don't want to talk about these horrifying Planned Parenthood videos that show them selling the body parts of unborn children, they don't want to talk about the assault on marriage that Pope Francis has stood up against, and they certainly don't address the continued assault on religious liberty. In Egypt when we saw 22 Coptic Christians beheaded by ISIS and the Obama White House described it as they're being killed because of their Egyptian citizenship, Pope Francis powerfully spoke out he said, 'their blood confesses Jesus Christ.' I'm very glad to welcome Pope Francis to America, I'm very glad he's with us.""On defunding Planned Parenthood:""Well Megyn you're exactly right. And as you know I have pledged if I'm elected president on the first day in office I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrific videos and on the first day in office I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends that day and that will mean among other things that the case against the Little Sisters of the Poor will be dismissed. I mean this is an administration, the Obama administration that is litigating against a Catholic charity, the Little Sisters, attempting to force the nuns to pay millions of dollars of fines under Obamacare in order to try to force them to pay for abortion-inducing drugs it makes no sense it's radical and extreme and I'm curious if the mainstream media will ask Democrats how they feel about litigating against nuns while the Holy Father is here in America."""

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, went to the floor of the Senate to keep a promise he made to the American people: to fight to keep Congress from funding Planned Parenthood. He also sought to prevent Iran, a known sponsor of terrorism, from accessing more than $100 billion, which he pointed out would be used to fund more terrorist activities.In his one-hour remarks, Cruz outlined how Republican Leadership has failed to lead on the issues important to the Americans who elected them to office. By immediately giving in to the demands of the Democrats, Republican leadership effectively joined with them and President Obama to fund their priorities. Despite his colleagues' frequent claims of wanting to defund Planned Parenthood and deny Iran money to support terrorism, not one made any attempt to back up their words with deeds. Instead, each sided with leadership's plan to surrender to the Democrats.Below is excerpted news coverage from Sen. Cruz's speech:Sen.

""When you are breaking the commitment you've made to the men and women who elected you, the most painful thing in the world is accountability.""

Ted Cruz is excoriating the Republican leadership in the House and Senate for failing to ""lift a finger to defend life"" by eliminating taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood......The 2016 Republican contender attempted to submit an amendment that would ""restrict the use of Federal funds for Planned Parenthood Federation of America"" as well as those to ""implement the nuclear agreement with Iran or for assessed contributions to the United Nations until the President submits the agreement and all related materials to Congress.""Sen. Mitch McConnell, however, ""filled the tree"" of amendments on this bill to fund the government, preventing any other senators from offering amendments to change the measure, a tactic used on numerous occasions by Sen. Harry Reid when he was the Majority Leader. The strategy would prevent any amendments to bills and keep Reid's Democrat members from having to be on record for difficult votes......Despite all that has been exposed about Planned Parenthood, Cruz said, ""You notice how much energy Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner have devoted to attacking conservatives? When has leadership shown that level of venom to President Obama?""Cruz said that, in fact, Reid and the Democrats often laugh because the Republicans generally lead the onslaught against conservatives, dismissing them as ""ignorant hicks and rubes."" ""Why, then, does it matter if we have a Republican or Democrat House or Senate?"" Cruz asked, adding that Boehner's recent decision to resign was a direct manifestation of the ""disconnect"" between the base of the Republican Party and its leadership.Breitbart: Ted Cruz: 'Republican Leadership Leads The Onslaught Attacking Conservatives'Texas Sen. Ted Cruz slammed Republican leadership on Monday for slavishly serving the interests of major corporations  and worse, leading attacks from the Left on its conservative grassroots base.The Democrats are ""relentless"" in pursuing their principles, Cruz said, which include ever-increasing government spending and unlimited abortion rights. They're ""willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife between their teeth to fight for their principles,"" Cruz said.Republican leadership ""reflexively surrenders,"" Cruz said. ""President Obama simply has to utter the word 'shutdown' and Republican leadership runs for the hills.""......Republican leadership told voters they needed a majority in the House of Representatives in 2010, and a majority in the Senate in 2014 in order to effectively oppose Obama. Voters delivered in ""tidal wave"" elections, Cruz said. But now, nine months after the November election in which Republicans gained nine Senate seats, voters ask Cruz in town halls: ""What exactly have those Republican majorities accomplished?"" The spontaneous response to their own question is ""absolutely nothing.""But Cruz said it's far worse than that. ""It would have been better if the Republican majorities did 'absolutely nothing,'"" he said, but they took the lead in imposing the cromnibus, Obamacare, executive amnesty, continued funding of Planned Parenthood, and confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general  even after she promised to act as lawlessly as Eric Holder and to never oppose Obama.""We keep winning elections but the people we put in office don't do what they said they're going to do,"" Cruz said. GOP leadership is ""quite competent and willing to fight. The question is what they're fighting for."" A list of major corporations' priorities would be identical to that of the GOP leadership's, Cruz said. Voters' are far, far down on the list. And defunding Planned Parenthood isn't among ""the priorities of K Street,"" Cruz added."

Excerpt of segment transcript included below:Gretchen Carlson: Time now for the 2016 Presidential Power Index, where we look every week at who's up, who's down in the race to the White House. Well this week, there's a huge shakeup in the Republican contest. Chris Stirewalt, the Fox News Digital politics editor and author of Fox News First joins me now, as he does every Monday. Okay let's get right to it  Ted Cruz, up one, knocking Jeb Bush out of your top spot...Why the shift Mr. Stirewalt?Chris Stirewalt: Jeb Bush has been number one in this index since the day it started. It has been Jeb Bush all the way along for a very simple reason, that the Republican establishment usually gets its way. In the end, the guy with the most money and the core support of elected officials, etcetera, outlasts his challengers and wins it.That's what's happened the last two cycles, it's what usually does happen. And Jeb Bush has been in that position  even though as many people who have emailed and tweeted, ""Well this guy's in fifth place, he's not winning, why is it Jeb Bush?""  well, we care about things other than just how are you in the polls today, we care about how do you look for the long haul.And here's how Jeb Bush looks like for the long haul right now. He looks like a guy that might be able to pull off winning that establishment wing of the party and locking that in, but Marco Rubio is a real and genuine threat to his chances to lock down that part of the party.

I see the same courage of conviction in him that I've seen in Ron Paul... We have to form a conservative/libertarian wall. Ted Cruz is the candidate that can do that.""Joel Kurtinitis: ""There are a lot of things that impress me about Ted Cruz and the way that he's really picked up the mantle of Ron Paul in a lot of ways... And that's been a consistent message of his that it's not really a divide between left and right it's a divide between Washington and the American people... I've seen him lead against unnecessary foreign intervention, when he talked about staying out of the Syrian civil war. He led on Internet freedom, when net neutrality came up... There's really not a liberty position that he hasn't had a record on.""Kelsey Kurtinitis: ""He's a champion of the constitution just like Ron Paul was... He's not afraid to stand up to leadership when leadership is wrong, regardless if they are team Republican or Team Democrat.""Vance Nordaker: ""When it comes to the issue of pro-life, when it comes to the Constitution, when it comes to religious liberty, when it comes to the rule of law... he really has the full spectrum of conservative issues that he's proven that he'll fight for.""Tony Seliquini: ""I think he's shown himself to be consistent.""Tom German: ""I think his message matches his actions.""Jason Schultz: ""Very few people can combine the principle, the communication skills, the presence, the personality...

In turn, each CruzCrowd member has the ability to track and compare their own progress against other users across their state and the nation. Badges are earned in a variety of ways (there are also several ""mystery badges""). The badges themselves tell the story of the American Revolution and the drafting of the Constitution, and celebrate the brave men and women whose principled actions founded our great nation.Users are rewarded when they accomplish the primary function  raising money  but are also rewarded when they accomplish the more important function: recruiting more users for the Cruz Campaign's grassroots army. This structure is key to the platform's potential for organic, viral growth and success. There is no minimum donation placed on the individual donor."

Number two, there were at the time twenty-two applications pending to export liquid natural gas... The President should have approved all of them, export our natural gas to help people stand free of Russia's blackmail and to hit Putin where it hurts, in the pocketbook.""Later in the segment, Cruz discussed the success of his growing grassroots operation in the states, most recently with the announcement that the campaign has a county chair operating in all 171 counties that comprise the early states.""I am incredibly encouraged because what we're seeing are conservatives coalescing behind our campaign,"" Cruz said. ""The moderates are fighting like scorpions in a bottle, but conservatives are coming together and I could not be more encouraged by where we are right now.""The full interview and transcript are included below.HEMMER: Texas Senator Ted Cruz is running for President, on the Armed Services Committee, with me now out of Washington, Senator how are you? And welcome back here to America's Newsroom.CRUZ: Thank you Bill, good morning, good to be with you.HEMMER: Here is the quote from our folks at the Pentagon, 'the first time it happened we thought the Russians got lucky then it happened two more times.' How dangerous is this Senator?CRUZ: Look it is extraordinarily dangerous and the tensions between Russia and America are only escalating. And sadly this is a direct manifestation of the weakness of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, leading from behind. This is what it produces, and we've got a reality now that Vladimir Putin not only doesn't respect the President of the United States, but he considers him a laughing stock. And that is profoundly dangerous for America and the world. We are seeing the chaos in Syria and the chaos in Iraq is also a direct consequence of the failed foreign policy of this administration.HEMMER: Let me go through a numbers of things. You heard what the President said last Friday, 'have at it Russia, we tried, we failed, have at it. You'll be there for a long time.' Is he right about that?CRUZ: Of course he's not and this is what happens when you look at leading from behind is one of the most honest characterizations of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, America recedes and so Russia is stepping in and taking advantage.I'm reminded of former Democratic Senator Scoop Jackson's characterization of the old Soviet Union, he characterized them as a burglar who walks down the halls in a motel jiggling the door handles to see what's open and to go in and rob. In this instance Putin is being opportunistic there's an opportunity to go into Syria to strengthen his position to become a dominant force in the Middle East and that's possible only because America is so weakened that it has created the opportunity for them to do so. Unfortunately what we're seeing is our friends and allies are getting the message that President Obama is not a reliable ally and that at least with Putin you know what you're getting. Our enemies are learning that America can we trifled with, there's nothing to worry about there but Putin is far more dangerous. That is very bad for America and for the world.HEMMER: Deal with what's happening right now, we can debate decisions of yesterday. What should our role be now there? And what should our role be in cooperation perhaps with Russia? Are we now finding ourselves moving towards that direction? Or not?CRUZ: No I don't think so at all. No one in their right mind would believe Putin's assertion that he's there to help go after the terrorists. Obama did but it's only because he's hopelessly nave. Putin is supporting Iran. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. It was sadly to the surprise of nobody that Putin's military began bombing the so-called moderate rebels that we spent hundreds of millions of dollars training. His intention is to boost and prop up Assad, who is a puppet for Iran and that is not furthering U.S. interests.Now, you ask Bill what should we be doing? We should stop engaging in the fiction of trying to find these moderate rebels and support them. We should stop the fiction of trying to bring together the Sunnis and the Shias to put down their arms and embrace like brothers. Instead we should defend U.S. national security interests and do what works to defeat ISIS. Now what would that mean? That'd mean number one, using overwhelming air power to target and destroy ISIS. Number two, we need to be arming the Kurds, the Kurds are on the ground, the Peshmerga, the fighting forces of the Kurds are terrific fighters, they're strong allies of America and yet the Obama administration refuses to fund them because it wants to send the weapons to Baghdad, who's not using it to defeat the terrorists. We need to focus on what works.HEMMER: We've been having that specific debate for a long time. Politico this morning talks about the President urging strategic patience with Russia, says Vladimir Putin is playing a psychological game. Is there truth to that?CRUZ: Putin is playing to win. Putin is not a complicated man; he's essentially a KGB thug. Putin very candidly said in his opinion the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century and I think what Putin is attempting to do is systematically re-assemble the old Soviet Union and expand Russia's influence. We ought to be standing up to Russia. Now, we don't want to do so through direct military conflict, no one in their right mind wants to see a shooting war between the world's two leading nuclear super powers. But what should we be doing? When Putin invaded Ukraine, I called on President Obama to do two things. Number one, immediately install the anti-ballistic missile batteries in Poland and the Czech Republic that were scheduled to go into effect in 2009 that Obama canceled in a failed effort to appease Putin. Number two, there were at the time twenty-two applications pending to export liquid natural gas. Putin uses energy to blackmail Europe to fund his military aggression. The President should have approved all of them, export our natural gas to help people stand free of Russia's blackmail and to hit Putin where it hurts, in the pocketbook.HEMMER: Once a spy, always a spy. The psychological game continues. I want to pivot quickly to two other topics. Do you have a problem with President Obama going to Oregon this week? To console the community in Roseburg.CRUZ: He's welcome to go anywhere. Now, I would note that he didn't come to the funeral of Deputy Goforth in Texas who was murdered and murdered because a significant part of the escalating rhetoric from President Obama, from the Attorney General against law enforcement. He doesn't seem to stand with the brave men and women, the police and fire fighters and first responders and instead he's vilified them. In regard to Oregon, our hearts go out, every one of us should be lifting up those families in prayer for the victims of that horrific crime. Especially, as facts came out that it appears this shooter was targeting Christians for their faith. It is all the more horrific. But it's also sad and cynical that the President's response and Hillary Clinton's response is to immediately try to politicize this, not to go after violent criminals  which is what we should be doing, but instead to try and go after the second amendment rights of citizens. I think it's wrong I think it's cynical.HEMMER: We'll see if this visit involves politics or not on Friday. Now quickly hard turn here. You're trying to move in the polls it really has not happened just yet. Are you satisfied with the state of your campaign today, Senator?CRUZ: Beyond satisfied. I am incredibly encouraged the momentum we're seeing on the ground. This week we rolled out county chairmen in all 171 counties in the first four primary states, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada. No other Republican has that. Our grassroots support is enormous, and then our fundraising. To date we have received over 350,000 contributions. In the last two quarters we have outraised every other Republican candidate as people all over the country went to tedcruz.org, contributed, signed up, volunteered. I am incredibly encouraged because what we're seeing are conservatives coalescing behind our campaign. The moderates are fighting like scorpions in a bottle, but conservatives are coming together and I could not be more encouraged by where we are right now."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: We Have No Business Getting in the Middle of the Syrian Civil War; Goal Should be to Defeat ISIS,"Speaks with WRKO's Jeff KuhnerHOUSTON, Texas  Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with The Kuhner Report regarding the Obama administration's disastrous foreign policy, the 2016 presidential race and the President's decision to politicize the tragedy in Oregon.Below is an excerpt. Listen to the full interview here:""I think it would be a mistake to get involved in the Syrian civil war. There have been voices in Washington eager for us to send our sons and daughters over to fight that civil war for some time. I haven't been one of them. I think the touchstone of U.S. military policy should be protecting the national security of this country.""What we're seeing Putin in Russia do is a direct response to the profound weakness of Obama over six and a half years. Putin views Obama as weak, as ineffective, and frankly, as a laughingstock. And, as a result, he is moving in, he is invading his neighbors  like Ukraine  he's kidnapping Estonians, and he's moving into Syria to gain a stronger foothold in the Middle East. What our focus should be is not on the Syrian civil war, but rather on defeating ISIS. Why? Because ISIS poses a clear threat to us. ISIS, they are the face of evil, they are crucifying Christians, they are murdering Americans, and they have pledged to wage jihad and kill more Americans, and what we need, Jeff, is a strong Commander-in-Chief, that says we will defeat ISIS, and we should do so using overwhelming air power, not this photo-op foreign policy of a bomb here and a missile there, but overwhelming airpower going after ISIS. And number two, arming the Kurds on the ground who are fighting ISIS. Let them be our boots on the ground.""We have no business, I think, getting in the middle of the Syrian civil war. And part of the reason the Obama foreign policy has failed so badly, is he spent hundreds of millions of dollars pursuing these mythical, moderate rebels  that by and large don't exist  and instead of arming our actual friends, the Kurds, the Israelis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, all of them who are actually right now helping go after ISIS, we should stand with our real allies, not engage in this weak and politically correct nonsense that's coming out from the Obama Administration."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - Cruz for President Announces $26.5 Million Raised Since Campaign Launch; $12.2 Million in Q3,"Cruz ""Sustainers"" Fuel the Field Operation Each MonthHOUSTON, Texas  The Cruz for President campaign today announced it has raised $26.5 million since its campaign launch six months ago, with just over $12.2 million coming in during the third quarter.

In September, the campaign announced it has named more than 500 leadership team members throughout the nation, far ahead of any other Republican candidate in the race.""We are thrilled to see a grassroots wave of support for our campaign gaining momentum all over the country,"" Cruz said. ""Not only are we seeing a surge of new donors and recurring donors to our campaign, but also continued growth of our organizations in the early states and all across the country. Americans are ready for real change, and I am ready to stand with them to take on the Washington Cartel and return power to the American people. We have both the financial and organizational resources to compete for the long haul and to take our optimistic message all across the country.""Cruz has one or more donors from 58 percent of the zip codes in America, a 10 percent growth from the second quarter.In the last 24 hours of the quarter, the campaign raised more than $1 million, following the similar $1 million surge in fundraising that was generated in the 48 hours following the second debate.Cruz continues to stand at the top of GOP leaders in social engagement, which remains crucial to targeting new and low-dollar donors.

He has also gathered more than 418 million impressions on Facebook, more than 215.6 million impressions on Twitter, and has been tweeted about more than 6 million times since the campaign launch."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"October 12, 2015",Press Release - CRUZ: If I'm Elected President the Federal Government Will Stop Releasing Violent Criminal Illegal Aliens,"Speaks with WHO's Jan Mickelson regarding Sanctuary CitiesHOUSTON, Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with Jan Mickelson regarding immigration, Syria refugee crisis and 2016 presidential race.Below is an excerpt featuring the Senator's remarks on stopping sanctuary cities and enforcing immigration law. Full interview? can be listened to below:MICKELSON: You are in the right place, right time to talk about sanctuary cities, you've introduced along with David Vitter, the Stop Sanctuary Policies Protect American's Act. Talk to us about that:CRUZ: Well the Senate is going to vote on that next week, I've joined with David Vitter of Louisiana and actually Iowa's own Chuck Grassley were the co-authors of this legislation. It does two things. Number one, it strips federal funding of any sanctuary cities. So if you have a city, typically led by a Democrat Mayor and a Democrat city council, that declares they are going to fight federal immigration laws, that they're going to oppose enforcing the immigration laws, than the federal government is not going to be sending them any money. And I think if we pass that into law, it will have a powerful effect ending the lawlessness of these local elected Democrats.And the second component of this is Kate's law, which is the legislation I introduced in the senate. That provides any illegal alien that has been deported who comes back who has an aggravated felony, that individual faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison. We're going to vote on both of those next week in the Senate.MICKELSON: Technical question, does a city or jurisdiction have to declare themselves a sanctuary city to be under the provisions of this act?CRUZ: Well they don't and actually the act includes transparency and accountability. One of the things that makes a sanctuary city is when the federal government, immigration officials issue what's called a detainer. Which is let's say a local city picks up someone for committing a crime and the feds discover that person is here illegally, they can issue a detainer which is asking the local government will you hold this person so we can pick him up and deport him. There are a whole bunch of cities that ignore federal detainers. That say, 'nope sorry we are not going to cooperate with you, we're going to let this guy go,' And one of those cities is San Francisco. We were all horrified at the murder of Kate Steinle just a couple of months ago. Yet that's an example where San Francisco, the federal government issues a detainer and asks them will you hold temporarily this illegal alien who is a criminal so that we can process him and deport him. San Francisco says no we welcome illegal aliens including badly, violent criminal illegal aliens to our city and so the numbers in terms of cities that refuse to honor detainers will all be publicly reported that's part of this legislation so that anyone can go look at the website and see what their city is doing and just how many criminal illegal aliens their city has released.MICKELSON: The city of Des Moines has never declared itself a sanctuary city. However, various members of law enforcement here have publicly stated that they will not do the 287 or 387 G agreements; I can't remember the number at the moment. They've expressed the outspoken desire not to enforce immigration laws and not to cooperate.CRUZ: It is a problem Jan that we're seeing it across the country and not only is it local cities which are an enormous problem but it's true at the federal government level too. The Obama administration in 2013 released over 103,000 violent, criminal illegal aliens including 196 murderers. Including nearly 400 illegal aliens convicted of sexual assault. And that's one of the things I pledged, if I am elected President, that will end. The federal government will stop releasing violent criminal illegal aliens. It's indefensible, it's lawless we're seeing cities doing it and sadly we're seeing the Obama administration doing it as well."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"October 15, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Washington Post: Ted Cruz to report $13.5 million cash on hand  at or near the top of the GOP field,"HOUSTON, Texas  The Washington Post's Katie Zezima and Tom Hamburger write that Cruz may have more money than any other GOP presidential candidate in the race, spending only 14 percent on non-fundraising operations. Along with donor lists, the use of text messages and direct mail, the campaign has ""built a formidable two-pronged fundraising system designed to provide funds through a long campaign,"" showing Cruz's ability to be competitive in the early primary states and beyond for the long haul to win the nomination.Below is an excerpt. The full article may be viewed here.Cruz's campaign said it has so far spent $3.7 million to run the non-fundraising portion of its campaign operations, just 14 percent of the total. The campaign meantime invested much of its resources back into high-tech fundraising efforts that used data analytics and a technique called ""donor modeling."" The result, as described by campaign manager Jeff Roe, raised $18 million from a fundraising investment of $8 million so far this year.Cruz campaign officials said in an interview Wednesday that they have built a formidable two-pronged fundraising system designed to provide funds through a long campaign, an effort that draws support from both small-dollar donors and bundlers who bring in larger sums from associates and friends. The campaign has 219 bundlers who secured $9 million for Cruz as of Wednesday, Roe said. He added that the campaign has had 120,000 total donors through the quarter that ended June 30.Developing donor lists is an extremely valuable asset to a campaign, noted Kenneth Gross, a former deputy counsel to the Federal Election Commission who advises campaigns  and the one the Cruz team has assembled is ""a significant base of names,"" he said.The campaign has begun experimenting with an array of fundraising techniques, including the use of text messages, an endeavor that has already proven lucrative thanks to a system of constant monitoring and adjustment of messages.The operation pulled in $6.1 million online this quarter, spending $1.8 million for a return on investment of 328 percent, Roe said. It is also using sophisticated analytics to pull donations via a more traditional form of campaign solicitation: direct mail. The campaign has spent $1.1 million on mail, getting about $2.7 million in return."

The 603 Alliance is New Hampshire's largest gathering of conservative activists, comprised of a broad coalition of Tea Party, Liberty, faith-based, and Republican women groups from all over the state.The 603 Alliance grew out of conservatives' concern that various factions were splitting the conservative vote and allowing establishment moderates to win in New Hampshire. Determined to give the conservative coalition a stronger voice, the 603 Alliance decided to coalesce behind and endorse one conservative candidate. Today's lopsided vote clearly shows that New Hampshire conservatives overwhelmingly support Ted Cruz.""I am inspired by the number of New Hampshire conservatives who believe that our campaign can win,"" said Cruz.

It has spurred innovation and offered hope and opportunity to millions of people from around the world. Many of our greatest innovators have been doctors and researchers who have risked everything to save lives. Yet now scientists and patients are too frequently being denied the opportunity to advance medical cures.We continue to lose far too many of our loved ones to the ""invisible graveyard,"" as economist Alex Tabarrok has described: lives that could have been saved but for a bureaucratic barrier that rejects medical cures and innovation. In 2015, 700,000 Americans are expected to die of Alzheimer's; nearly 600,000 lives will be taken by cancer. Moreover, millions of Americans suffer from countless chronic diseases that significantly impair their daily well-being.

""The person who coalesces the majority of conservatives is gonna be the winner,"" Roe said. ""It's not the establishment. There's not enough people there any longer. There's just not.""The full article is below and availablehere.Ted Cruz's plan to pick off the competitionAn exclusive interview with the man who thinks he can consolidate the conservative vote.By Shane Goldmacher10/27/15GLENWOOD, IOWA  It was a rainy morning when Ted Cruz arrived for the first of five stops on his Iowa schedule. He could barely squeeze in the door. So many people were stuffed in the three-room coffee shop that some opted to stand outside in the drizzle rather than jostle for position indoors.It's an old campaign trick to pack a small room rather than swim in a large one, but the size of this crowd seemed to surprise even the organizers. ""It's a good problem to have,"" Cruz said with a smirk.Cruz skipped his stump speech and instead spoke to, shook hands with, and signed autographs for every person there, scribbling his name on copies of the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, a homemade ""God and Country"" shirt and his most recent book. And after about an hour, he climbed into the front seat of his Iowa state director's Dodge Dakota and opened up to POLITICO about the state of the 2016 campaign.""There's no other candidate in the field who has a national team that is comparable to the team of conservatives that has coalesced around this campaign,"" he said.Certainly, Cruz is riding high. Cash reports this month showed the contender sitting on the most money of any Republican candidate in the field. Two of his most direct rivals  for funds (fellow Texan Rick Perry) and for votes (Scott Walker)  have already dropped out. Jeb Bush is slashing payroll. And a Des Moines Register poll out Friday showed Cruz in third place in Iowa, behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson, neither of whom has ever won an election to anything.From the start, Cruz and his political brain trust have divided the 2016 primary into four clear lanes: a moderate-establishment lane, in which he would not compete; a tea party lane, which he needed to dominate; an evangelical lane, where he had strong potential but little initial traction; and a libertarian lane, which began as the turf of Rand Paul.""The players that were expected to be formidable in those lanes have not got the traction they had hoped,"" Cruz said. ""The most encouraging thing I would say is that I think three of the lanes are collapsing into one, which is the evangelical lane, the conservative tea party lane, and the libertarian lane are all collapsing into the conservative lane and we're seeing those lanes unify behind our campaign.""On this point, Cruz and the Republican establishment that hates him seem to agree. Cruz has yet to pop in the national and early-state polls but his foes and allies alike say he is poised to break through.""He's not to be underestimated,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. Cullen is no fan of Cruz but he predicted the senator is ""likely to be one of the final four"" in the primary. ""I think he stands a pretty good chance of cornering the right-wing vote, which is remarkable given how large the field is.""Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a symbol of the GOP establishment that Cruz rails against on the trail, said the Texan ""is shaping up to be a real finalist in Cleveland,"" where the Republican nominee will be crowned next summer. ""Cruz has a strong team, approaches every week with goals and a strategy,"" Reed said. ""If you look away from Cruz's TV coverage and just listen to the audio, he has the strongest message to GOP activists and primary voters.""Even former President George W. Bush singled out Cruz as one of his brother's top rivals, particularly in Southern states that vote on March 1, saying at a recent private fundraiser, ""I just don't like the guy.""Cruz, who again is in the midst of battling his own party leadership on Capitol Hill, this time over a potential budget deal that would lift the debt ceiling, is accustomed to such remarks. Asked if Bush's comments were a badge of honor, the ever-cautious Cruz paused nearly 7 seconds before he declared with self-satisfaction, ""It's not surprising that he would attack candidates who he perceives as a threat to his brother's campaign.""Cruz's Houston headquarters is brimming with confidence, and no date looms larger on its collective calendar than March 1. He was the first to recruit chairmen in all 171 counties in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada but his entire strategy seems centered on the SEC primary, when a set of conservative and evangelical states across the South will dominate the voting, including Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and his home state of Texas.""My 19-month-old daughter couldn't color a map that's better for us on March 1,"" said Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager.By then, if not before, Cruz hopes to have consolidated the conservative side of the 2016 ledger. Within three weeks, by March 22, almost two-thirds of the Republican delegates will have been allocated.""In past election years a candidate could essentially move to Iowa or move to New Hampshire, live there for a year, and hope to catch lightning in a bottle and surprise everyone and ride that momentum to having a shot at the nomination,"" Cruz told POLITICO. ""I don't think that's possible this cycle and the reason is the [Republican National Committee] dramatically accelerated the process.""""For the candidates who have not been able to raise any money, it is simply not feasible for them to run a national campaign, and so they're not,"" Cruz said.Still, Trump and Carson stand in his way. Trump, to a large extent, has scrambled the neat lanes Cruz has delineated, drawing from angry voters everywhere. Meanwhile, Carson is pulling a large share of the evangelical vote, even Cruz's top advisers admit.But to the Cruz campaign's delight, Trump and Carson have begun aiming at each other, with Trump questioning Carson's religion and energy level over the weekend, and Carson retorting that he'd worked through 20-hour surgeries: ""Doesn't require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration.""Cruz has drafted behind Trump for months, hoping to sweep up his supporters when what many have seen as an inevitable fall comes. But increasingly the Cruz campaign is preparing for Trump to remain a force through the primaries.Carson, on the other hand, the Cruz campaign thinks will fade as scrutiny intensifies. Plus, Cruz intends to box out the retired neurosurgeon by winning over the movement conservatives who are desperate to unite behind a single candidate early in 2016, after back-to-back cycles nominating a more moderate Republican, who, they believe, failed to get out the Christian vote.""It's almost like a fable, like the Holy Grail that nobody can ever do,"" said Roe, the campaign manager, of uniting the movement. ""We have the unique chance this time to pull it off.""For more than a year, Cruz has aggressively courted social-conservative leaders such as Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, who has not endorsed yet but will appear next month with Cruz at a South Carolina rally for religious liberty. One critical movement convener, Paul Pressler, on whose ranch Christian leaders gathered in early 2012 to throw their support behind Rick Santorum, has already backed Cruz. And the Cruz campaign expects two other influential Iowa leaders  The Family Leader's Bob Vander Plaats and Rep. Steve King, whose son is working for Cruz's super PAC  to line up behind him. ""I think it would be a stunner if they didn't,"" said a senior Cruz operative.Cruz pointed to straw-poll wins as evidence of his broad coalition: He finished first both at FreedomWorks, which trends libertarian and tea party, and at the Values Voter Summit, which draws social conservatives.""If I woke up tomorrow and decided I wanted to run as a moderate, I couldn't do it,"" Cruz said. He is running hard to the right on gay marriage, abortion, taxes, Israel, immigration, Iran, environmental regulations, appointing judges, you name it. There is little nuance. Asked this weekend in Iowa how he would handle the Islamic State, Cruz replied, ""Kill them all.""The other candidate Cruz thinks could be left standing by springtime will be a GOP establishment contender. But he couldn't guess who that might be, given Bush's weakness. ""The moderate lane is crowded as all get-out,"" Cruz said. ""Three months ago, every observer would have assumed that Jeb Bush would run away with being the moderate establishment candidate. At this point, I have no idea who the moderate establishment candidate will be.""Whoever emerges, Cruz is betting the conservative will win out in a one-on-one race, especially if he gets a head start.""The person who coalesces the majority of conservatives is gonna be the winner,"" Roe said. ""It's not the establishment. There's not enough people there any longer. There's just not.""Cruz has run this game plan before: navigating a multicandidate GOP primary against a well-funded Republican who began as the darling of the GOP establishment. That's how he won his Senate seat in 2012, consolidating the conservative side of the electorate, forcing early favorite Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a runoff, and then crushing him.""I think the dynamics are very, very similar,"" Cruz said of 2016.Perhaps the most significant variable for Cruz is the dropouts this field has already seen. For the first eight months of the year, it appeared Cruz and Walker were on a collision course for hard-line conservative voters, especially in Iowa. No longer. And the departure of Perry cleared the way for a flood of Texas money.On Monday, Cruz announced that some of Perry's top financiers are now backing him, including Darwin Deason, who gave $5 million to a pro-Perry super PAC, and other Texas rainmakers, including Jim Lee and Brint Ryan.Significantly, while both Walker and Perry ran out of campaign cash, they had the two richest super PACs that could have been used to go after Cruz. Now many of his remaining rivals for the evangelical vote, save for Carson, are woefully underfunded.Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum have less than $1 million between them. Bobby Jindal has only $260,000. None has a well-heeled super PAC, let alone the $38 million reported by Cruz's outside allies. But Huckabee, Santorum and Jindal could bleed votes from Cruz. They combined for 7 percent in the most recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll.Cruz and his allies take particular delight in his cash advantage over Bush. ""You were mentioning one of the other campaigns that is slashing salaries,"" Cruz told POLITICO. ""We're not slashing salaries because we started paying people low amounts at the beginning.""And Kellyanne Conway, who is running one of Cruz's super PACs, Keep the Promise I, added, ""As far as I can tell Jeb Bush is slashing so much staff, and so much payroll, that Jeb! Is getting rid of the exclamation point.""(Bush's campaign did not comment for this story.)With fewer than 100 days until the caucuses, Cruz's paid Iowa team has just jumped from two staffers to eight, POLITICO has learned, with more reinforcements from Houston on the way. The campaign has already used its analytics department to crunch the number of target voters who live in every Iowa precinct (as well as some other early states), and scored them individually for their likelihood to turn out for Cruz.But Cruz and his allies are trying to manage expectations too: doing enough to win in Iowa, but not investing so much the state becomes a must-win. ""He's built to last,"" Conway said. ""This is a process of elimination nomination. It's a war of attrition.""Indeed, Cruz is already planning deep into the calendar, with efforts to lock up delegates everywhere from Guam and American Samoa, to California, which doesn't vote until June 7. Few now expect Cruz to exit the race if it becomes a prolonged delegate fight. ""It is not like he has to rush back to a Senate colleague congeniality meeting,"" said Reed, the Chamber strategist who also managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.Other campaigns have taken notice of Cruz's growing infrastructure. ""I would say Cruz is the next best organized behind us,"" said a senior Bush campaign official.Cruz's Houston-based team is a close-knit operation that works, eats and lives together. On Wednesdays, they hold group Bible study. There are wine nights, too. Rick Tyler, Cruz's national spokesman, shares an apartment with Chris Wilson, his director of analytics. And just past the front desk of his 7th floor headquarters is a children's playroom with a hot pink carpet, four pink and red beanbag chairs, a giant stuffed animal and a half-dozen pillows with raspberry prints on them.The play space was the brainchild of Cruz's wife, Heidi, a former Goldman Sachs executive who took a leave to help with the campaign. The Cruzes daughters use the space. So do the children of his aides, almost all of whom moved to Houston for the campaign. Roe relocated not only his wife and young daughter but his in-laws to Houston. On the day POLITICO visited, Cruz's mother, Eleanor, was there making calls for her son.The fact that the campaign's senior leaders work beside one another is a particular contrast with the sprawling Bush operation, which, at least in the first half of 2015, was holding some meetings at the Dallas airport, as strategists flew in from Miami, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.""There are a lot of political campaigns that are staffed by mercenaries, that are staffed by people who are essentially selling a bar of soap. The candidate's a bar of soap. OK, let's go sell it. If this doesn't work, we'll move on and sell the next bar of soap,"" Cruz said. ""I think one of the greatest strengths of our campaign is the team that has come together.""Others are impressed too. Reed, the Chamber strategist, said: ""Cruz's senior team moved to Houston, moved their families to Houston, and are all in this effort. No consultants flying in and out but real accountability. Very impressive.""Roe, the campaign manager, said they are all-in for the rare chance to elect an unabashed and unapologetic conservative.""If you tried to create the perfect constitutional conservative, you would make them like Ted Cruz,"" Roe said. ""You would have them be the son of an immigrant. You would have them memorize the Constitution in their teenage years. You would have them go to the best colleges in the world. You would have them study and apprentice under the best conservative jurists. Then have them run a campaign where they had to run against the moderate establishment and beat them. Like, that's what it would be. And that's exactly what it is.""Despite his discipline, his pedigree and his hard-line message, Cruz has not had his breakout moment. If he does, the Republican political establishment he has so angered on Capitol Hill and across Washington is ready to pounce. But Cruz has already proved adept at turning scars from congressional battles  John McCain's ""wacko bird"" insult to name a prominent one  into assets, if not a Teflon shield on the campaign trail.""If you see a candidate Washington embraces,"" as Cruz likes to say, ""run and hide."""

Presidential candidate Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to stop the corruption in Washington and force the Washington Cartel to listen to the American people.Since even before he was sworn in as a Texas Senator, Cruz has been trying to use the debt ceiling as a way to limit increasing the debt for future generations. In 2013 Cruz argued:""The debt ceiling historically has been among the best leverage that Congress has to rein in the executive,"" Mr. Cruz, Texas Republican, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""""Since 1978, we've raised the debt ceiling 55 times. A majority of those times  28 times  Congress has attached very specific and stringent requirements,"" he said.

Now thank God, my father was invited to a Bible Study and became Born Again, and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But the struggle of the single mom was extraordinary, and you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of women, not a one of them mention the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women entered poverty.""Not a one of them mention the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.

Kennedy has been in the habit of praying at games since 2008, and was often joined by students. He is currently barred from participating in any activities related to the high school football program.Pastor David Welch of Texas was among the five pastors whose sermons and personal communications pertaining to homosexuality and transgender issues were subpoenaed by the mayor of Houston. The pastor was even ordered to turn over all communications with members of his congregation regarding a controversial law supported by the mayor's office. The pastors refused to comply, and after local and national public outcry, Mayor Annise Parker ultimately rescinded the order.College student Angela Hildenbrand was valedictorian of her Texas high school in 2011 and was threatened with jail if she exercised her right to pray during her graduation speech. Thanks to an emergency motion from the Liberty Institute and support from Texas officials, the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a district judge's restraining order and Hildenbrand was allowed to exercise her constitutional rights.Dick and Betty Odgaard of Grimes, Iowa, will join Cruz. When the Odgaards declined to host a same-sex wedding ceremony in a historic chapel they owned, a complaint was filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.

Full video may be viewed here.Sean Hannity: You released your tax plan on the day of the last debate, I want to put up on the screen. You would abolish the IRS, 10 percent flat tax rate on personal income, eliminate all corporate taxes, 16 percent business flat tax, universal savings accounts, by the way end the death tax  which is double and triple taxation. Would that come in to balance in your view and how does it get into balance? And what would the percentage of growth need to be for it to be in balance?Ted Cruz: So it absolutely comes into balance, I would encourage your views if you go to our website tedcruz.org, tedcruz.org we have the detailed numbers there. You can see that this tax plan, a simple flat tax would produce 4.9 million new jobs, would increase capital investment by 44 percent and every income group in America would see your after tax income grow by at least 14 percent. So if you're a single mom making $40,000 a year, it means your after tax income is an additional $5,600 a year.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 9, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: National Review: Ted Cruz Is Right: The Muslim Brotherhood Is a Terrorist Organization,"Cruz could not be more right in describing the Brotherhood as 'the key foundation stone for radical Sunni terrorism that has spawned both al-Qaeda and ISIS.'""HOUSTON, Texas  This weekend in National Review, Andrew McCarthy praised recently filed legislation by presidential candidate Ted Cruz that designates the Muslim Brotherhood ""as what it actually is: a terrorist organization."" The full column may be viewed here and excerpts appear below:This week, finally, Ted Cruz decided enough is enough. The Texas senator and Republican presidential hopeful has proposed a bill to force the designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as what it actually is: a terrorist organization.The legislation, Senator Cruz tells me, ""is part of a larger effort to expose the various radical elements that are trying, both at home and abroad, to undermine our very way of life.""A parallel focus of this effort is Iranian aggression  manifested again this week with the regime's taking of yet another American hostage. Cruz has been a vigorous critic of the deal, negotiated by President Obama, that will make the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism a threshold nuclear power while materially supporting its terror promotion with over $100 billion in funding. The senator has also joined with colleagues in the House on a bill to apply the terrorist designation to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps  the elite regime force that orchestrated much of the terrorist insurgencies against American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, to say nothing of the 1995 bombing that killed 19 American airmen at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia.The menace that is Iran is clear to most Americans outside the Obama administration. The Brotherhood, though, is a ""complicated case,"" Cruz acknowledges. They've managed to ""convince the Obama administration they are a secular, political entity"" that can be America's ""moderate partner and assist in outreach to the Muslim world.""The proposed legislation corrects this dangerous misimpression by sketching the Brotherhood's history and the centrality of violent jihad to it. It details, for example, the instruction of Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna that ""jihad is an obligation from Allah on every Muslim and cannot be ignored or evaded.""...Cruz could not be more right in describing the Brotherhood as ""the key foundation stone for radical Sunni terrorism that has spawned both al-Qaeda and ISIS."" In fact, as the bill describes, there is a significant history of Brotherhood underwriting of terrorism. In addition, key al-Qaeda figures have been launched by immersion in Brotherhood ideology....To disastrous effect, the Obama administration has indulged the fantasy that American interests are served by making common cause with virulently anti-American Islamists who want Israel wiped from the map. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has been an enthusiastic partner in the project to cultivate the Brotherhood. And too many Republicans have fallen prey to the illusion of a Middle East tamed by ""sharia democracy""  an illusion that portrays enemies as friends and is continually surprised by the rising tide of jihadism.Ted Cruz understands the threat and is distinguishing himself by charting a very different policy direction. It will serve him well. And it would serve the country well."

Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.""And I will say, for those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally, we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant, it's offensive. I am the son of an immigrant who came to this country legally from Cuba to seek the American Dream, and we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law. And I would note, try going illegally to another country, try going to China or Japan or try going to Mexico, see what they do. Every sovereign nation secures their borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're going to enforce the laws and drive down the wages for millions of men and women. That is abandoning them."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 10, 2015","Press Release - Ted Cruz has been Leading the Fight for Simple, Fair Tax Reform","MILWAUKEE, WI  Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz rolled out his Simple, Flat Tax Plan in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed. The Simple Flat Tax will effectively abolish the IRS and dismantle the Washington Cartel. Under Ted Cruz's Simple Flat Tax, Americans in all income brackets will see double-digit after-tax wage growth, and giant corporations will be unable to use loopholes to avoid paying taxes.The Simple Flat Tax keeps Cruz's promise to Abolish the IRS and dismantle the Washington Cartel that uses our complex tax code as a political weapon. It levels the playing field for businesses. No longer will giant corporations be able to avoid paying what they owe while small businesses and hard-working Americans pick up the tab. The Cruz plan allows every American to do their own taxes in a matter of minutes and allows families to save up to $25,000 per year completely tax-free, until they decide to spend it, how they want to spend it. The Tax Foundation has evaluated it and said that all Americans will see their incomes increase by at least 14 percent, maybe more. It will eliminate six taxes including the death tax, the payroll tax, the alternative minimum tax, and every last unconstitutional and unconscionable tax found in Obamacare.Details of Cruz's Simple Flat tax can be viewed here."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 10, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz in National Review Op-Ed: Five for Freedom,"Bringing government spending under control.HOUSTON, Texas  Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz published an op-ed in National Review outlining his plan to eliminate four federal departments and the IRS, and get government spending under control. The details of the full plan can be found at TedCruz.org.Five for FreedomNational ReviewTed CruzAt the last Republican Presidential debate, I presented the Simple Flat Tax  which, for a family of four, exempts the first $36,000 from all income tax, and then above that collects one low rate of 10 percent for all Americans; eliminates the Death Tax, the payroll tax, the corporate income tax, and the Obamacare taxes; ends the corporate carve-outs and loopholes; and requires every business to pay the same simple Business Flat Tax of 16 percent. That plan unleashes unprecedented growth, creates millions of new jobs, raises after-tax incomes for all income levels by double-digit percentages  and it abolishes the IRS as we know it.But eliminating the IRS is only the first step in my plan to break apart the federal leviathan that has ruled Washington and crept into our lives. We can't stop there. In addition to eliminating the IRS, a Cruz Administration will abolish four cabinet agencies as well. And we will sharply reduce the alphabet soup of government entities, beginning with the ABCs that should not exist in the first place: The Agencies, Bureaus, Commissions, and other programs that are constitutionally illegitimate and harmful to American households and businesses. It's time to return to a federal government that abides by our constitutional framework and strips power from unelected bureaucrats.The need is urgent. The total federal debt currently stands at $18.6 trillion, larger than our entire economy. That is up 75 percent since the President took office, and by the end of his tenure, he is expected to have added almost as much to the national debt as all past presidents combined.And what does the Obama Administration have to show for its uncontrolled spending? A stagnant economy, lagging job creation, and the lowest labor-force participation since the Carter Administration. The Obama economy has burdened each American household with the equivalent of $57,000 of federal debt. Under such stifling circumstances, it's no wonder that 84 percent of college graduates do not have a job lined up after graduation, and 13.2 percent of young adults are out of work. The current level of spending is not only irresponsible, but immoral and unjust to future generations.It is time for bold change. Change that stops Washington from squandering Americans' money; that creates jobs and restores growth with a single, fair, low rate for everyone; that reins in Washington's costly regulations; that honors the people's work with the dignity it deserves; and that finally gets the government out of our pockets and off our backs.Of course, because entitlements constitute roughly two-thirds of federal spending, no government spending plan is complete without addressing entitlement reform. And in the coming months, I will be laying out a detailed plan to do just that, to strengthen and preserve Social Security and Medicare and to ensure their fiscal strength for decades to come. But we should start with federal discretionary spending.First, to begin the process of reducing the scope and cost of government, I have identified the Five for Freedom: During my first year as President, I will fight to abolish the IRS, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. To do that, I will press Congress relentlessly. And I will appoint heads of each of those agencies whose central charge will be to lead the effort to wind them down and determine whether any programs need to be preserved elsewhere because they fall within the proper purview of the federal government. I do not anticipate lists to be long.The IRS and these cabinet agencies are unnecessary and will be shuttered for the following reasons:The Internal Revenue Service to dramatically simplify the tax code and enable everyone to fill out their taxes on a postcard or smartphone app.Department of Education  to return education to those who know our students best: parents, teachers, local communities, and states. And to block-grant education funding to the states.Department of Energy  to cut off the Washington Cartel, stop picking winners and losers, and unleash the energy renaissance.Department of Commerce  to close the ""congressional cookie jar"" and promote free-enterprise and free trade for every business.Department of Housing and Urban Development  to offer real solutions that lift people out of hardship, rather than trapping families in a cycle of poverty, and to return authority to the states by block-granting the lion's share of the remaining programs, such as Section 8 housing.Second, besides these unnecessary cabinet agencies and the IRS, we will sharply reduce the alphabet soup of government entities, beginning with the ""ABC""s that should not exist in the first place: The Agencies, Bureaus, Commissions, and other programs that are constitutionally illegitimate and harmful to American households and businesses  including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Together with the four departments and the IRS, our conservative estimate of the effects of these eliminations and reductions is a savings of over $500 billion over ten years. And that's just a start. The true savings  of scaling down the scope of the federal government, of restoring the rightful authority to the states, and of unleashing the people's ingenuity  cannot be measured by a number. We are uprooting the centralized power that we have lived under for far too long.Third, we will bring back a proven approach from the prosperous days of the Reagan Administration: a private sector panel to assess federal spending levels and evaluate areas of waste and fraud for removal. At President Reagan's behest, the Grace Commission recommended 2,478 ""cost-cutting, revenue-enhancing"" suggestions, without raising taxes, weakening defense, or harming social welfare. It was a major success among other polices that created a great economic boom, and it deserves a reprise.Fourth, we will hold Congress accountable; it too often relegates its authority to unelected bureaucrats. We will enact a strong Balanced Budget Amendment. And, by enacting the REINS Act, we will require that a majority of members approve any major, cost-inducing regulations.Fifth, we will put in place a hiring freeze of federal civilian employees across the executive branch. For those agencies in which it is determined that a vacant position needs to be filled, I will authorize the hiring of a maximum ratio of one person for every three who leave. And rather than automatically increasing federal workers' pay annually, workers will have more opportunities for merit-based pay increases.The full details of this plan can be found at www.tedcruz.org. It's past time to dramatically reduce the size of government and restore congressional accountability to the People. Doing so, along with instituting fundamental tax reform and regulatory reform, will reignite the promise that has made this the freest and most prosperous nation in the world.Ted Cruz is U.S. Senator from Texas and a Republican candidate for President."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 13, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz Announces Policy to Stop Illegal Immigration,"Cruz Plan Will Secure the Border, Enforce the Rule of Law, and Protect AmericansORLANDO, Florida Presidential candidate Ted Cruztodayannounced his ""Stop Illegal Immigration"" plan  the policy he will implement as President to secure the border and enforce the rule of law in order to create the environment necessary to finally fix our legal immigration system. Only when the border is secure and the rule of law enforced can reforms be meaningfully implemented to fix our legal immigration system. Cruz presented his plan at a grassroots rally of more than 1,500 in Orlando, Florida.""We have a serious immigration problem in America,"" Cruz said. ""The American people understand that we must reverse the policies that invite criminals and terrorists to defy the law, allow manipulation of our generous immigration system, and reward illegal immigrants for their actions. Sadly, while the Obama Administration ignores our immigration laws and abuses its executive authority, the Washington Cartel refuses to stand up and insist that the law be followed. A strong President can and must secure the border. Under current law, there is more than enough legal authority to do so; what is missing is the political will. In the Senate, I have stood consistently with the majority of Americans against amnesty and lawlessness, and I will do the same as President.""SECURE THE BORDERA Cruz Administration's first priority for immigration reform will be to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. We will:Build a wall that works. The unsecured border with Mexico invites illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists to tread on American soil. A Cruz Administration will fulfill the promise Congress made to the American people almost 10 years ago by completing all 700 miles of priority fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, and dedicate the resources necessary to replaceallsingle-layer fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border to build a fence that keeps people out and that is technology-supported and law enforcement-accessible.Triple the number of Border Patrol agents. Securing the border is the federal government's obligation, and sufficient human resources must be allocated for the task. In 2013, Cruz introduced legislation to triple the number of Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border. A Cruz Administration will work with Congress to pass and sign this legislation to make more boots on the ground a reality.Increase vital aerial surveillance and other technology along the border. Adding boots on the ground is not enough. Eyes in the sky and other equipment are necessary to find and detain all illegal entrants. In 2013, Cruz introduced legislation to increase fourfold the number of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft that are deployed to the border to ensure valuable reconnaissance and protection for our Border Patrol. A Cruz Administration will continue to press for this to become law.Finish the biometric tracking system at our nation's ports of entry.It is disgraceful that our federal government cannot keep track of those who enter our country. Since 1996, Congress has ""required"" full implementation of an entry-exit system at all of our ports of entry, yet multiple administrations, both Democrat and Republican, have refused to follow that law. In the first 100 days of a Cruz Administration, those who have broken the law will be held accountable, regulations that stand in the way of finishing the system will be eliminated, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will complete implementation in the first year.Hold DHS accountable to the American people. Under the Obama Administration, DHS has failed to perform core national security tasks. The Department of Homeland Security must be able to fulfill its obligation to American citizens, and its officials must be held accountable. A Cruz Administration will appoint a no-nonsense, security-focused leader as Secretary of Homeland Security, will empower the Secretary to remove DHS employees who refuse to abide by the law, and will partner with the states so they can assist with immigration enforcement and border security.RESTORE THE RULE OF LAWWe need a President who will follow the law, hold those who break it accountable, and take seriously the duty to protect Americans. To restore the Rule of Law, a Cruz Administration will:End President Obama's illegal amnesty. President Obama has issued no fewer than 20 illegal executive memoranda that grant amnesty, ignore the law, and worsen our immigration problems. A Cruz Administration will rescind every one of them, will push for passage of the Immigration Slush Fund Elimination Act, and will ensure that fees paid by legal immigrants go toward supporting legal immigration only, to improve and streamline legal immigration.Increase deportations and end catch-and-release. Our laws are not being enforced. A Cruz Administration will restore our commitment to enforcement, public safety, and the Rule of Law by rededicating DHS to fully enforcing the law, including through deportations and returns. It will end catch-and-release on our southern border and at our ports of entry  people who are apprehended trying to enter the United States without permission will be detained until they are removed from the United States.End sanctuary policies, sign Kate's law, and deport criminal immigrants.There are about 340 sanctuary jurisdictions in the United States that make a mockery of our laws and endanger our citizens. A Cruz Administration will work with Congress to pass and sign the Stop Sanctuary Cities and Protect Americans Act, and will strip funding from jurisdictions that implement sanctuary policies. A Cruz Administration will also find, prosecute, and deport criminal immigrants, sign Kate's Law, and regain control of immigration courts.Prevent asylum abuse and criminalize visa overstays.Many illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the border are released into the United States based on questionable claims of persecution in their home countries. Additionally, about 40 percent of the illegal immigrants currently in the U.S. came legally but overstayed their visa. A Cruz Administration will institute new standards that allow for summary dismissal of dubious asylum claims and will penalize visa overstays by making it a misdemeanor for a first offense, and a felony for any subsequent offense, for any individual to be unlawfully present in the United States after the expiration of a visa.Prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving financial benefits and strengthen E-Verify. American taxpayers should not be funding benefits for those who are here illegally, and American jobs should not go to those who are here illegally. A Cruz Administration will protect Americans' wellbeing by stopping the flow of taxpayer dollars to those here illegally and instituting a strong, widely accessible e-verify system.REFORM LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO PROTECT AMERICANSIn order to strengthen our immigration system, protect national security, and better serve American workers, we must:Suspend the issuance of all H-1B visas for 180 days to complete a comprehensive investigation and audit of pervasive allegations of abuse of the program.New allegations detail appalling abuses of the H-1B visa program  a program meant to create American jobs and spur economic growth. I will suspend the program for 180 days to investigate abusesand enact fundamental reforms of this program to ensure that it protects American workers. A Cruz Administration will enforce existing protections for American workers and amend the H-1B visa program to fulfill its original purpose through the following actions:Create a ""layoff cool-off"" period for all H-1B visa applications: Companies must wait one or two years between laying off a worker and bringing in any H-1B foreign workers to ensure that the program is not used to displace American workers.Establish accreditation or recognition requirements for overseas schools: The recent lack of federal oversight of the H-1B visa program has fueled a cottage industry of diploma mills. Foreign academic institutions must meet minimum accreditation standards at least as stringent as those imposed on American universities in order to qualify for the advanced-degree requirement.Require sworn affidavits describing domestic hiring efforts: Companies will provide sworn statements and documentation that detail their efforts to hire Americans before requesting foreign workers through the H-1B visa program. Individuals who make false statements in these affidavits will be subject to perjury charges.Suspend companies from H-1B visa eligibility for failure to help foreign workers obtain green cards:Many companies misuse the H-1B visa program to train foreign workers that they intend to send back overseas to compete with America. The law must impose additional requirements on employers to pursue Legal Permanent Resident status on behalf of their H-1B visa-based foreign workers, or risk loss of access to the program.Halt any increases in legal immigration so long as American unemployment remains unacceptably high. The purpose of legal immigration should be to grow the economy, not to displace American workers. Under no circumstances should legal immigration levels be adjusted upwards so long as work-force participation rates remain below historical averages.Enforce the public-charge doctrine. Current law requires legal immigrants to certify that they will be economically self-sufficient. A Cruz Administration will ensure they do not receive government assistance, which defies the law and harms American taxpayers.End birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship was not intended to legalize the children of people who are breaking the law by entering and staying in the country illegally. I will take steps to pass legislation or a constitutional amendment to end it.Eliminate visa programs and strategies that do not serve national goals. Some existing entrance policies and visa programs do not support our long-term, national security, and economic interests. A Cruz Administration willend chain migrationby only allowing entry of immediate family of immigrants who qualify already for skills-based immigration, andend diversity visasthat are premised neither on skill nor family, but are distributed at random based solely on the race or nationality of an applicant.Cruz's full ""Stop Illegal Immigration"" policy may be viewedhere."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 14, 2015",Press Release - Cruz Condemns the ISIS Terrorist Attacks on Paris,"We stand in solidarity with the people of France.""GREENVILLE, S.C.  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz appeared on Fox and Friends this morningto discuss the horrific terrorist attacks in Paris.""First of all I want to say we stand in solidarity with the people of France with President Hollande with the families of all of the victims of these acts of horrific terrorism, and the American people are standing as one. We're grieving with a nation of France today. We're standing as your friend and ally."" Senator Cruz said. ""But secondly these attacks under score that we are facing an enemy who is fierce, who is relentless who is at war with us even if our own President does not understand that it is at war with us, and who will not stop until it is defeated.""That enemy is radical Islamic terrorism. As long as we have a Commander-in-Chief unwilling to even utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, we will not have a concerted effort to defeat these radicals before they continue to murder more and more innocents, whether it's Europeans or Israelis or Americans."" Senator Cruz concluded, ""In a Cruz Administration we would be using overwhelming air power and the Kurds as our boots on the ground, and it would be clear to any militant on the face of the earth if you go and join ISIS, if you wage jihad against America, you're signing your death warrant.""Full transcript below.TUCKER CARLSON: Presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas is live from Greenville, South Carolina. Good morning Senator Cruz. It's difficult to take obvious lessons away from a story that is still unfolding as this one is but to the extent that you can tell us, what does this suggest about America's path forward in the fight against terror?TED CRUZ: Well, first of all I want to say we stand in solidarity with the people of France with President Hollande with the families of all of the victims of these acts of horrific terrorism, and the American people are standing as one. We're grieving with a nation of France today. We're standing as your friend and ally. But secondly these attacks underscore that we are facing an enemy who is fierce, who is relentless, who is at war with us even if our own president does not understand that it is at war with us, and who will not stop until it is defeated. That enemy is radical Islamic terrorism. As long as we have a Commander-in-Chief unwilling to even utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, we will not have a concerted effort to defeat these radicals before they continue to murder more and more innocents, whetherEuropeans or Israelis or Americans.CARLSON: So France's immigration policy is under scrutiny this morning for fifty years immigrants have moved from the Middle East into France, some have been assimilated, many others have not and it looks like some of those committed those acts of terror last night. At exactly the moment we're looking at France, the United States is beginning to accept refugees from the battlefields of Syria some just landed in New Orleans, what do you think of the Administration's policy of paying for refugees from Syria to come here in large numbers, should they be halted?CRUZ: You know President Obama and Hillary Clinton's idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syria Muslim refugees to America is nothing less than lunacy. If you look at the early waves of refugees that have flooded into Europe one estimate was that 77 percent of those refugees were young men, that's a very odd demographic for a refugee wave. The director of national intelligence here in America has said of those refugees in Europe, it is clear that a significant number of them may well be ISIS terrorists.It makes no sense whatsoever for us to be bringing in refugees who our intelligence cannot determine if they are terrorists here to kill us or not. Those who are fleeing persecution should be resettled in the Middle East in majority Muslim countries. Now on the other hand Christians who are being targeted for genocide for persecution, Christians that are being beheaded or crucified we should be providing safe haven to them.But President Obama refuses to do that and all of this is a consequence of being unwilling to acknowledge  the President and his administration say it's violent extremism it is not random unconnected violent extremism it is particular form radical Islamism that takes the view that anyone that doesn't embrace their radical Islamic view must be murdered or forcibly converted. That's what we're seeing happening in Paris, it's what we're seeing happening in Israel.And I am sorry to tell you, this will be coming to America. ISIS plans to bring these acts of terror to America it's one of the reasons that Congress needs to pass immediately the Expatriate Terrorist Act legislation that I've introduced that says that any American that travels abroad that joins ISIS that takes up arms and wages jihad against America, they immediately forfeit their citizenship. Because we should not be letting people use U.S. citizens and U.S. passports to come back to America and to wage jihad and murder innocent Americans just like we saw these terrorists do yesterday in Paris.JOHN SCOTT: Senator Cruz, we have a couple of more questions for you. We have to take a quick break if you can stay with us we'll be back with you in South Carolina in just a moment.SCOTT: We are back once again with Presidential candidate Ted Cruz. Senator, as you well know President Obama won the presidency in part by recognizing that Americans were tired of war. If you do succeed in winning the office, does it mean application of military force toward ISIS?CRUZ: It means that we will have a Commander-in-Chief who takes seriously defeating radical Islamic terrorism. I recognize that Barack Obama does not wish to defend this country. That he may have been tired of war, but our enemies are not tired of killing us.And they're getting stronger. Every region on earth has gotten worse under the Obama/Clinton foreign policy. Now that doesn't mean that we should be sending our sons and daughters to invade foreign countries and stay there forever and engage in nation building trying to turn Iraq into Switzerland. That's not what our object should be. But we need a commander in chief who says we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.Let me tell you what that would look like. That would look like number one, using overwhelming military power, particularly air power. You know in the first Persian Gulf War we had roughly 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama right now is doing 15 to 30 attacks a day. It's pinprick, it's photo op foreign policy.Number two, we should be arming the Kurds. The Kurds are on the ground fighting ISIS. They are fierce allies of ours. They're out armed, and yet they are our the boots on the ground and Obama for political reasons, he doesn't want to upset Baghdad so he won't arm the Kurds.In a Cruz Administration we would be using overwhelming air power and the Kurds as our boots on the ground, and it would be clear to any militant on the face of the earth if you go and join ISIS, if you wage jihad against America, you're signing your death warrant.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: Senator Cruz, if it were to become President Cruz, what would you do differently in terms of the number of troops committed to the ground. The President saying that he will be committing 50 troops, also juxtaposed to this he is wanting to and intending to close GITMO.CRUZ: You know, both of those are mistakes. Let's start with the latter  closing GTMO. If he does that, these are hardened terrorists. As we're releasing people from Guantanamo, a substantial percentage of them are returning to wage war against us.I understand that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are ideologues and they don't recognize that enemies of America want to kill us. You look at the Bowe Bergdahl trade where we traded senior terrorist leaders for someone who is right now being tried for effectively deserting his troops.That makes no sense, and then with regard to sending 50 troops. There's no reason to be putting our sons and daughters in harm's way without a military plan to keep them safe and to win.What's missing, listen, our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are risking their life for us. But they have a Commander-in-Chief who has no strategy. He will not even utter the words radical Islamic terrorism. And he's not setting out to defeat them.And I have to say the last major terrorist attack we saw in Paris, you know it was heartbreaking when you had every world leader just about marching and standing in solidarity with France. Nowhere to be found was President Obama. Nowhere to be found was Hillary Clinton. Nowhere to be found was John Kerry.The Obama Administration abandoned our friend, the nation of France. When the rest of the world came together arm and arm to say we stand against radical Islamic terrorism, we need a president willing and able to do exactly that."

He calls for the United States to stop bringing in refugees from Syria as long as our intelligence cannot determine who may or may not be a terrorist. He has also repeatedly called for the passage of his bill, the Expatriate Terrorist Act, which will rescind citizenship from any American that travels abroad to join ISIS or any other designated terrorist group..Cruz states that in order to defeat ISIS, we need to utilize overwhelming air power  far more than current levels  and arm the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are serving as boots on the ground in the region.Transcript of Cruz's words in the video, excerpted from his recent interview on Fox and Friends:We stand in solidarity with the people of France, with President Hollande, with the families of all of the victims of these acts of horrific terrorism.These attacks underscore that we are facing an enemy who is fierce, who is relentless, who is at war with us even if our own president doesn't understand that it is at war with us.As long as we have a Commander-in-Chief unwilling even to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, we will not have a concerted effort to defeat these radicals before they continue to murder more and more innocents.And they're getting stronger.

Cruz could very well rise late and win IAand nomination. David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 16, 2015The Washington Post: ""Ted Cruz is now the favorite (or close to it) in the Iowa caucuses... Where King helps is, yes, organizationally  he is the face of the ideological right in Iowa and a major player in the western part of the state where lots and lots of Republicans live. ""He has a very faithful grassroots following,"" longtime Iowa conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats told National Review in late October. ""And these are the people that show up on caucus night. They take politics, these elections, very seriously, and so they respect Steve King's voice a lot."" King also adds symbolic heft. He is a true-blue conservative standing up and saying that Cruz is the best conservative in the race. That matters in a field this crowded and this unpredictable.""New York Daily News: ""King is Iowa's best-known and most influential conservative leader, and his endorsement will likely boost Cruz's already-rising star in the key early-caucus state. Cruz has been inching up in the polls there, reaching double digits in some recent surveys, and has been building out a ground game that could make him a real threat to place well in Iowa and propel himself to the top of the GOP field.... The Iowa congressman is immensely popular with his state's evangelical and anti-immigration conservatives, and joins popular local radio host Steve Deace in backing Cruz. He's also a leading national voice opposing immigration""The Guardian: ""Ted Cruz received one of the most important endorsements in Iowa on Monday as Congressman Steve King announced his support for the Texas Republican...The endorsement of perhaps the most popular conservative in Iowa comes at a key time for Cruz's campaign, as the senator has established himself in the top tier of Republican candidates with confident performances in debates and a strong grassroots organization.""CNN: ""King is a powerful voice in the first-in-the-nation caucus state popular with conservative Christians, and his support could be key to turning out Iowans for Cruz on caucus night February 1.""FoxNews.com: ""King is known to be outspoken on immigration issues  vocally opposed to ""amnesty""  and in opposition to ObamaCare. The endorsement is helpful to any candidate looking to pick up the evangelical vote in Iowa, which Cruz has courted.""The Weekly Standard: ""King's district spans northwest and north central Iowa, a rural and conservative part of the state. The six-term congressman has become a sought-after supporter in the Iowa caucuses in recent cycles....The endorsement could certainly help Cruz as the Tea Party favorite works to earn support from across many of Iowa's influential conservative networks.""Dallas Morning News: ""U.S. Rep. Steve King, an influential Iowa Republican, endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for president on Monday morning. King's blessing gives Cruz a prized voice in the early caucus state among the conservatives he'll need to win the first nomination contest in 2016. ""I believe that Ted Cruz is the answer to my prayers,"" said King, ""a candidate God will use to restore the soul of America.""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 16, 2015",Press Release - Iowa Congressman Steve King Endorses Ted Cruz for President,"HOUSTON, Texas Today, the Ted Cruz for President campaign announced that Cruz hasreceived the endorsement of Congressman Steve King, an influential and outspoken conservative, particularly on the issues of immigration and fiscal responsibility. Congressman King has consistently said that it is critical the next President be someone who will fight unapologetically for conservative principles.""Ted Cruz has the positive conservative vision for the country that we need to correct the failures of the Obama Administration,"" said King. ""When I survey the challenges facing our country, and the slate of individuals who have stepped forward to offer to lead, one man stands out as the courageous conservative whom I believe can restore the soul of America. That man is Ted Cruz. He has consistently and tirelessly fought on the issues that matter most to conservatives, such as Obamacare, religious liberty, life, and stopping Obama's lawless executive actions. Cruz has a proven record of standing up to both Democrats and Republicans to put the American people first, and I believe he is the only one who can unite conservatives around his campaign and build the organization needed to beat Hillary Clinton. With Ted Cruz, conservatives no longer have to accept a Republican nominee who doesn't truly share our values. I am endorsing Ted Cruz because I know we can trust him to do exactly what he says he will do, and we need that kind of commitment and dedication in the White House. That is why I am asking every one of my fellow Iowa Republicans to join me in caucusing for Ted Cruz.""""I am beyond honored to receive Steve's endorsement,"" said Cruz. ""Steve is a tremendous leader in the House and one of the few truly principled men and women in Washington. He is a courageous conservative who stands up for our values and refuses to back down. His support comes at a fantastic time for our campaign as we are seeing people in Iowa and across the country signing up, volunteering, contributing, and joining our campaign to reignite the promise of America. I can't thank Steve enough and know that his help gives us a significant advantage as we continue to grow and have success in Iowa and across the nation.""King's backing is a coveted endorsement in the Iowa caucus. The seven-term Congressman has been a consistent leader on issues such as immigration and protecting innocent life, and his endorsement is considered among the most influential in Iowa. Cruz has built a top-notch organization in the Hawkeye State, with at least one chair in each of Iowa's 99 counties. He is among the leaders in total visits to Iowa and held one of the largest GOP campaign rallies in Iowa to date by organizing his ""Rally for Religious Liberty"" in Des Moines in August."

Rohrabacher, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for human rights and freedom around the globe, is currently serving his 13th term in the House of Representatives. He serves as the Chairman of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.""Today I enthusiastically endorse Senator Ted Cruz in his bid for President of the United States,"" said Congressman Rohrabacher. ""Ted is a man of great intellect great courage and the right principles. Having worked so closely with Ronald Reagan, I can identify Reagan's best traits in Ted Cruz. Under Ted's leadership we can put America back on the right track.""""I am thrilled to have Dana's support in this campaign,"" Cruz said. ""Dana is one of the most ardent champions of freedom around the world and a courageous conservative here at home. For over a quarter century, he has fought for lower taxes and government spending. I'm proud to call Dana a friend and our campaign is further strengthened by his support.""""Dana Rohrabacher is a conservative fighter, and his endorsement shows how conservatives determined to put ideas into action are uniting behind Ted Cruz for President,"" said Ron Nehring, California State Chairman of Ted Cruz for President former Chairman of the California Republican Party.Mr. Rohrabacher's proven record of fiscal restraint and pro-growth economic policies has earned him praises from trusted conservative groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Federation of Independent Business. He has also been a strong advocate for protecting American citizens by securing our borders and fighting proposals that would provide amnesty to illegal immigrants.Prior to his first election to Congress in 1988, Dana served as Special Assistant to President Reagan. For seven years he was one of the President's senior speechwriters. During his tenure at the White House, Rohrabacher played a pivotal role in the formulation of the Reagan Doctrine and in championing the cause of a strong national defense. He also helped formulate President Reagan's Economic Bill of Rights, a package of economic reforms that the President introduced in a historic speech before the Jefferson Memorial.Below is Congressman Rohrabacher's full statement endorsing Ted Cruz for President of the United States:""Today I enthusiastically endorse Senator Ted Cruz in his bid for President of the United States,"" said Congressman Rohrabacher. ""Ted is a man of great intellect great courage and the right principles. Having worked so closely with Ronald Reagan, I can identify Reagan's best traits in Ted Cruz. Under Ted's leadership we can put America back on the right track. Ted has more foreign policy experience than Ronald Reagan did when he became President. But he has the same focus on what's in the best interest of the American people. Like Reagan, he doesn't apologize for facing foreign policy challenges in a strong and forceful manner but at the same time he realizes that we should not be belligerent toward others who might want to work with us to achieve specific goals nor are we the policemen of the world.""I have no doubt that Ted will reaffirm America's leadership in thwarting evils like radical Islamic terrorism. Ted is a real freedom fighter both at home and abroad and he's the kind of statesman we need to ensure that Americans will live in security, prosperity and freedom. Consistent with that, Ted is the toughest and most realistic of the candidates on the issue of illegal immigration. Like me, he would prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs and government benefits that should go to Americans and legal immigrants, thus eliminating the major attraction that draws illegal immigrants into our country."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"November 30, 2015",Press Release - Ted on the Trail: Ted Cruz Surges in Iowa,"HOUSTON, Texas Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz visited 16 counties throughout Iowa this past weekend where crowds of courageous conservatives who want a president that fights for the issues that matter most to them turned out to meet and greet Ted. Below is a sampling of some of the press coverage of the events:.@Tedcruz organizers say crowd count is about 90 in Coralville, solid for Johnson county, which is primarily liberal pic.twitter.com/DhIxtKeI80 Samantha-Jo Roth (@SamanthaJoRoth) November 30, 2015New York Times:Ted Cruz Surges in Iowa, Powered by Outsider FervorCampaign officials, assessing their momentum, have pointed to a strong field operation, diligent legwork with crucial groups like evangelicals and the support of local figures like Representative Steve King. They also concede their good fortune that the race has, to date, unfurled more or less as Mr. Cruz had hoped, with establishment Republicans failing to coalesce around a single candidate and other religious conservatives in the race failing to gain traction.""What Washington wants is conservatives divided,"" Mr. Cruz said at a Pizza Ranch in Newton on Sunday. ""That's how the moderate establishment candidate runs up the middle with 23 percent of the vote, steals the nomination and then loses the general because millions of conservatives stay home.""Yet as Mr. Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, crisscrosses Iowa, railing against the Obama years and establishment figures in his own party, his rise is particularly notable for the rhetorical feat that has helped fuel it.In an election season that has rewarded political outsiders like Mr. Trump and Ben Carson, placed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on the defensive over his congressional record and tormented the current and former governors in the field, Mr. Cruz has proved the exception: He seems to have persuaded an electorate deeply skeptical of its government that his time in Washington has been an asset.""When I see how he's fighting right now in Congress for us, I trust him in the presidency,"" said Melinda Shervheim, 49, of Redding. She cited Mr. Cruz's push to repeal President Obama's health care law and his hard-line positions against immigration.Packed house for @tedcruz at Pizza Ranch in Newton.

People were packed into the meeting room and dozens more standing at the doorways to hear the candidate speak.The event started with U.S. Rep.

Liberty is never safer than when politicians are terrified,"" the Texas senator said.As the days tick closer to Iowa's Feb. 1 caucuses, Cruz's campaign is pushing to get him in front of as many Iowans in as many counties as they can  even if it means an event at 10 p.m. at a gas station in a town with a population just above 4,000. The effort is in part due to a pledge the presidential candidate made in June: to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties, a feat dubbed the ""full Grassley"" in reference to Sen. Chuck Grassley's full tour of the state's counties each year.""We're going to push hard every day that he's here and use every moment as effectively as possible,"" said Bryan English, the campaign's state director.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 1, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Rubio Wrong To Attack Cruz On National Security,"HOUSTON, Texas Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is proud to stand with conservatives like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and theNRAon the USA Freedom Act. The NRA states that, ""the availability of sophisticated means of analyzing the metadata to create detailed profiles of individuals could effectively create an end-run around federal prohibitions on firearm registries."" The USA Freedom Act will stop President Obama from engaging in the mass collection of personal data from law-abiding citizens, while keeping America safe and intercepting intelligence from real terrorists. Below is a sampling of some of the press coverage of what others are saying about the important components of the USA Freedom Act.Fox News: Judge Nap Fires Back at Warnings About End of NSA's Bulk Data CollectionWill the imminent end of the NSA's controversial bulk collection of phone data put the American people at risk?On Fox NewsSunday, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, argued that ending the program is a big mistake.Burr argued that a cell phone recovered after the Paris terror attacks helped investigators in France and Belgium ""expand their search net"" to stop further attacks and make arrests of terror suspects.Judge Andrew Napolitano pushed back this morning, accusing Burr of ""mixing apples and oranges"" with his warning about the end of the NSA surveillance program.Napolitano explained that a cell phone recovered at the scene of a terror attack could be searched quickly and easily with a warrant from a judge.He said that represents hard evidence and ""old-fashioned police work,"" not the indiscriminate surveillance of millions of citizens.The judge emphasized that authorities could not stop theNov. 13attacks despite France having the ability to surveil cell phones and emails without warrants.The Daily Caller:Rubio Is Wrong To Attack Ted Cruz On National SecurityThis deserves some explanation: First, USA Freedom was about domestic wiretaps, so using the Paris attacks as a catalyst requires an understanding that it wouldn't have prevented what happened in Paris. Second, USA freedom did not stop the practice of obtaining information; the government must now obtain a warrantand the records are kept by the phone companies as part of their normal business practices.Third, it's important to note that USA Freedom was compromise legislationand that, in fact, one could reasonably argue that Cruz's efforts helped keep us safe by preventing the complete repeal of the Patriot Act's provisions.AsUS News & World Report noted last year, ""There [were] not enough votes in the House to reauthorize the Patriot Act without amendments limiting its authority, according to statements from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who is the Freedom Act's co-author.""Hot Air:Ted Cruz to Marco Rubio: Stop impugning my patriotism by claiming I'm soft on national securityRubio was prepared to let the Patriot Act lapse entirely in hopes that that would scare Congress into reauthorizing it lock, stock, and barrel. Cruz took half a loaf (or really, nine-tenths of a loaf) by reauthorizing everything except a few parts that forced the NSA to jump through extra procedural hurdles in accessing domestic phone records data for a terrorism investigation. Rubio's taking a maximalist position on surveillance above and beyond what even most members of his own party insisted upon and yet Cruz is the unreasonable one?"
Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 1, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz Moves to Seize the Moment in Iowa,"Cruz finds his presidential bid riding a wave of momentum in the Hawkeye State""HOUSTON, Texas Presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has experienced a surge in the polls nationally and in Iowa, just completed a three-day, 16 county campaign swing through the Hawkeye State. TheTexas Tribunewrote that Cruz ""finds his presidential bid riding a wave of momentum."" In recent weeks, the Cruz for President campaign has announcedcongressional district coordinators in each of the 163 congressional districtsthat comprise the states that hold primaries or caucuses before March 15th,county chairmen in each of the 171 counties that comprise the first four primary and caucus statesincluding all 99 counties in Iowa, as well as the endorsement of influential conservative leaders in Iowa such asCongressman Steve Kingand radio hostSteve Deace.Thefull article may be read hereand excerpts appear below:Texas TribuneCruz Moves to Seize the Moment in IowaPatrick SvitekWith two months until its first-in-the-country caucuses, Cruz finds his presidential bid riding a wave of momentum in the Hawkeye State, propelled by a visceral appeal to voters disgusted with Washington D.C. and a surgical approach to consolidating conservative support in the otherwise volatile GOP race for the White House.His surge here  punctuated by a poll last week that had him rocketing to second place  comes as no surprise in his camp. Campaign staff and supporters say he has been plugging away in Iowa for months, largely out of view from a national media training its attention on shinier objects....While some campaigns would be wary of the heightened expectations  or caught unprepared  Cruz's appears to be leaning into his glide path here, more than ready for his close-up. That was evident as Cruz on Monday finished a three-day, 14-stop tour of the state that drew raucous receptions and overflow crowds, some in cities and towns whose populations total only three digits....Cruz's Iowa moment has not dawned overnight. His swing through the state Saturday was his sixth trip to Iowa in seven consecutive weeks. His team has quietly ramped up from earlier this year, when it had just one paid staffer. And his anti-establishment message has appeared to find an increasingly captive audience among Iowans furious with Washington but not ready to take a chance on political neophytes Ben Carson and Donald Trump.As he crisscrossed the state, Cruz offered plenty for the anti-Washington crowd, deploying line after line about his outsider status within even his own party. During a town hall Saturday night inside a high school cafeteria in Lamoni, Cruz paused to acknowledge the large red letters on the wall spelling ""Concessions,"" joking that the room was named after ""Republican leadership in Washington.""For good measure, he brought along another congressional antagonist  U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler, one of six GOP members of the Texas delegation who have endorsed Cruz for president. Gohmert regularly reminded audiences Saturday and Sunday of his friendship with Iowa Congressman Steve King, an influential figure in conservative circles who threw his support behind Cruz earlier this month....Waiting for Cruz on Saturday night in Chariton, Cruz supporter Chris Downey suggested the senator's commitment to visiting all 99 counties  a tradition known as the Full Grassley, named after the state's senior U.S. senator  could set him apart from the other top-tier candidates in the state. By the end of the trip Monday evening, Cruz was believed to have crossed roughly half of the counties off his list.""It's an intense expectation, but it forces the candidate to go into places that are pretty small potatoes by most standards,"" Downey said. ""And yeah, you don't see Donald Trump doing that."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 3, 2015",Press Release - Ted Cruz's Pastors Speak Out About His Faith,"Cruz Welcomes Endorsements From His Current and Childhood PastorsHOUSTON, Texas  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today welcomed the endorsement of Pastor Gaylon Wiley, who led him to the Lord as a youth, and Pastor Gregg Matte, his current pastor. At eight years old, Cruz accepted Christ as his Savior and was baptized by Pastor Gaylon Wiley of Clay Road Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. Cruz attended Second Baptist High School in Houston as a teenager.Gaylon Wiley has been an evangelist for more than 40 years. Now retired and living in Tennessee, he still preaches the gospel.""Ted was just like all the other kids,"" Wiley remembered. ""Except he had the IQ of his father  he was three stages ahead. I baptized both of his parents and had the privilege of baptizing Ted and leading him and his cousin Bibi to the Lord. I believe he is God's man for this hour, for such a time as this. He is the most constitutional, conservative candidate in either party. The hand of God is on him, and if God's people rise up, he will be the man.""Gregg Matte is the senior pastor of Houston's First Baptist Church. Under his leadership, the church, founded in 1841, has experienced tremendous growth. Matte also founded Breakaway Ministries at Texas A&M; University, which has become the nation's largest college Bible study. He is a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and the author of Unstoppable Gospel.After returning to Houston in 2008, Cruz and his wife Heidi began attending Houston's First Baptist Church. When the sermons and personal communications of five Houston pastors were subpoenaed by the city mayor last year, Pastor Gregg Matte and Ted Cruz rallied pastors and local Christians in protest. The mayor's office subsequently backed down.""I consider it an honor to be the Cruz family's pastor,"" Matte said. ""We all know Senator Cruz as a brilliant, strong, and confident leader, unswervingly handling the Constitution with respect and wisdom. But I also know him as a husband, father, and friend. We have eaten hot dogs in our church's gym as our kids played, walked in the park as our kids rode bikes together and our wives talked, and eaten pizza by the pool on a summer evening as our children swam. Ted Cruz is in touch with the normal routines of every day life while also being outstanding in dealing with the complex issues of our day. This combination of character and competence gives me confidence that, under Ted's leadership, America can once again head in the right direction. Because of what I have seen of Ted Cruz, as a father, a husband, and a Christian, both in and out of the political arena, I heartily give my personal endorsement to Ted Cruz as our next president.""""I am honored by this support from two pastors that I respect so deeply,"" Cruz said. ""I will always be grateful for the way Brother Wiley challenged my father in 1975, leading him to redemption in Jesus Christ and paving the way for a reconciliation between my parents. Inviting Christ to rule my life with Pastor Wiley's encouragement at eight years old is the best decision I have ever made. As an adult, Pastor Matte has been a mentor and a friend. Early this year, when Heidi and I were making a decision about whether or not to run for president, we met with Pastor Matte, his wife, and my top advisors for a time of prayer. We are grateful for his advice and encouragement.""""We are honored to have the endorsement of Pastor Gregg and Kelly Matte in Ted's bid for the Presidency in 2016,"" Heidi Cruz said. ""Our family has been deeply blessed by Gregg and Kelly's ministry and friendship over the years, and know that Gregg and Kelly have had a tremendous impact on many lives, including our own, through their loving, practical, and genuine spiritual leadership in our community. We know that God will continue to use their talents as we seek to show His face of grace, freedom and individual liberty to this country. Thank you Gregg and Kelly for joining arms with us in seeking to restore our nation!""*Titles and affiliations of both pastors are provided for identification purposes only."

""His plan eliminates all loopholes, stops corporate welfare, and specifically allows every company, including ethanol producers, to immediately expense all of their capital costs, treating everyone fairly, without subsidy. Ted Cruz believes the tax code shouldn't pick winners or losers in the market and that all industries should compete on a level playing field.

Those are tax subsidies  and furthermore, they're subsides that are ""widely-accepted as preferences exclusive for the oil and gas industry.""Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier fired back: ""Cruz has consistently supported ending subsidies across all energy sectors, and his tax plan would do just that.""His plan preserves a few tax breaks, but none for oil, she said.""All that remains in terms of subsidies/exemptions"" in his tax plan are the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as existing deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments, she said.""So to suggest that the senator hasn't promoted policy to back up his rhetoric is completely dishonest,"" Frazier said.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 4, 2015",Press Release - Cruz Campaign Calls on Rubio to Correct False Claims About America's Intelligence Gathering Capabilities,"HOUSTON, Texas  Today, the Cruz campaign called on Senator Marco Rubio to correct the false and misleading statements he made regarding the data-collection capabilities of America's intelligence services.In an interview with CBS ""This Morning"" Rubio criticized the USA Freedom Act, which maintains America's ability to target terrorists and keep the country safe without violating Americans' constitutional rights, that passed earlier this year with overwhelming bipartisan support and went into effect on December 1.""First of all, we have to have robust intelligence gathering capabilities to disrupt plots. It's one of the reasons why I was opposed to this law that even some of my opponents running for president voted for, this USA [Freedom] Act that passed a few months ago,"" Rubio told CBS. ""It took away the right to collect metadata, which means that we can now not access the phone records of individuals that we either suspect of being involved in terrorism or who carry out an attack to see who they were coordinating or talking to."" [Emphasis added]The assertion that ""we can now not access the phone records of individuals that we either suspect of being involved in terrorism or who carry out an attack"" is patently false. Under the USA Freedom Act, America's intelligence services, the FBI, and local law enforcement have all the authority they need to target suspected terrorists, access phone records, and track all those with whom they've been communicating.In a letter to Congress last May, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence wrote, ""The intelligence community believes that the [USA Freedom Act] preserves the essential operational capabilities of the telephone metadata program and enhances other intelligence capabilities needed to protect our nation and its partners.""""Particularly inaccurate is the assertion that we couldn't target someone who carries out an attack,"" said Chad Sweet, the Cruz for President National Campaign Chairman who has also served in the CIA's National Clandestine Service and as Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security. ""The USA Freedom Act preserves America's ability to track down, kill or prosecute America's enemies, particularly those who have carried out attacks. In fact, it strengthens our hand in fighting terrorism by giving our intelligence services access to more information, ending the blind spot when persons who are being monitored enter the country, and increasing penalties for providing material support to terrorists. And it does all this without warrantless collection of the phone records of millions of law abiding Americans.""The USA Freedom Act was supported by Senator Mike Lee, the NRA, scores of House conservatives, and millions of Americans who believe the federal government can achieve its chief responsibility of keeping Americans safe while also protecting their liberty.The falsehood told by Senator Rubio is perhaps the result of a lack of success in attacking Ted Cruz. Rubio and his Super PAC allies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to distort Ted Cruz's strong record on national security and yet have only seen Cruz's support catapult while the Rubio campaign is essentially treading water.""Honest and accurate policy debates are important for our democracy. This particular assertion  that America couldn't target those who have carried out attacks  is beyond the pale and Rubio should correct the record immediately, instead of attempting to instill a false fear among Americans. Our campaign is calling on him to formally correct these inaccurate statements and to start telling the truth about America's intelligence capabilities,"" said Sweet."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 4, 2015",Press Release - Cruz For President Announces Second Amendment Coalition,"Totaling an astounding 24,030 membersHOUSTON, Texas Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz today rolled-out his Second Amendment Coalition at a rally in Johnston, Iowa. The group represents gun rights advocates across the country who believe in the fundamental constitutional right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.The coalition already has 24,030 members, including 1,084 members in the four early primary states. The coalition will be co-chaired by Gun Owners of America President Tim Macy, former Congressman Bob Barr, President and Co-Founder of Heroes Hunting Sgt. Patrick Perkins, Richard Rogers and Dave Funk.""The right to self-defense is an essential component of the liberty we enjoy as Americans and is embodied in the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is not about hunting; it's not about target practice. It's about our basic right to protect our homes, our children, and our lives,"" said Cruz. ""I am honored to have the leadership of our National Co-Chairs and am humbled by the tens of thousands of Americans who have signed up to join me as, together, we strive to protect our Second Amendment freedoms.""Clickhereto watch Ted's coalition announcement video:Tim Macy's distinguished career includes serving as the Chairman of Gun Owners of America, overseeing all GOA operations. Tim has served on the Board of Directors of GOA since its creation over 35 years ago. He also serves as Vice-Chairman of Gun Owners of California.""I am honored and excited to serve as a National Co-Chair of the Second Amendment coalition,"" said Tim. ""Finally, we have a constitutional leader running for President: Ted Cruz. Ted understands the Second Amendment and the importance of protecting the rights of gun-carrying Americans and I am proud to support him in his run for the White House.""Former Congressman Bob Barr has been a lifelong advocate of preserving Second Amendment rights of Americans, serving on the Board of Directors of the National Rifle Association. Barr represented the 7th District of Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives for 8 years, served as a U.S. Attorney under President Ronald Reagan, and currently practices law in Atlanta, Georgia.""There is no candidate for President who is more genuinely and deeply committed to protecting our God-given and constitutionally-guaranteed right to keep and bear arms, than Sen. Ted Cruz,"" said Bob. ""I am honored to stand with him and serve as Co-Chair of his Second Amendment Coalition.""Sgt. Patrick Perkins is a Co-Founder of Heroes Hunting, a Veteran operated non-profit organization, which gives veterans of all ages an opportunity to hunt as a form of therapy. Sgt.

Perkins. ""Much like the majority of Republican voters, I'm tired of all these 'talking heads' in Washington that speak a big game, but then fold on each and every issue, (i.e. defunding Obamacare, defunding immigration reform, and vowing to not allow the last budget deal to pass). Is their 'promise to protect our right to bear arms' on the same list? Ted Cruz is the candidate I trust to protect my Second Amendment rights and I am honored to help him in this race.""Richard Rogers is a Board Member of the Iowa Firearms Coalition, the leading pro-second amendment group in Iowa and a NRA Affiliate and a lifelong Republican activist.Rogers said, ""At its core, the Second Amendment isn't about guns so much as it's about liberty.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 5, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI: McCarthy: Cruz Will Uphold Our Constitution, Protect Our Homeland","HOUSTON, Texas  Today, columnist and national security expert Andrew C. McCarthy endorsed Ted Cruz for President, saying Cruz ""understands that the most immediate enemy the United States confronts on the world stage is Islamic supremacism."" McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney who led the 1995 terrorism prosecution against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, said only one candidate ""can be depended on to face down Washington"" and ""[t]hat candidate is Senator Ted Cruz.""""Reinvigorating American principles will require taming Washington. It calls for restoring the Constitution as a vital limit on government, not a relic...or an obstacle,"" McCarthy wrote in a recent column. ""Ted Cruz gets this. Many Republicans talk the talk  we hear it in every election season, right up until it is time to stop campaigning and start governing. Senator Cruz walks the walk. That is why I believe he should be the next president of the United States.""Cruz understands that the most immediate enemy the United States confronts on the world stage is Islamic supremacism, which ignites jihadist violence through its state sponsors, terror networks, and activist organizations. The senator has not just fought against President Obama's disastrous Iran deal, which enriches the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism while making it a threshold nuclear power. Cruz has concurrently pushed for the designation, at long last, of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.""McCarthy defended Cruz against recent attacks from others who have questioned Cruz's positions on national security.""Speaking of imaginations run wild, noticeably absent from [Max] Boot's critique of Cruz is the word 'Libya.' That, you may recall, is where Senator Rubio and other Beltway Republicans decided it would be a fabulous idea to collude with President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to help Islamic supremacists oust the regime of Moammar Qaddafi. Up until the moment Washington switched sides, Qaddafi had been supported by the Bush administration, the Obama administration, and the bipartisan Beltway clerisy as a critical American counterterrorism ally.""He continued: ""Today, Libya is a failed state: a jihadist sanctuary where Americans have been murdered, where Western nations and institutions have fled after repeated attacks, and where, in Sirte, the Islamic State now controls a 'colony' just 400 miles from Italy.""When Ted Cruz says 'the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend,' he is saying we should resist in Syria a repetition of the Libya debacle, which begins with resisting the temptation  in Washington, the obsession  to presume that the Middle East teems with secular democrats.""He finished, ""The office of the president is mandated to uphold our Constitution, pursue our interests, and protect our homeland. Ted Cruz's extraordinary gifts give me confidence that he will execute these solemn duties faithfully and effectively. I am proud to support him."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 7, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: We Need a Commander in Chief Who Stands Up and Doesn't Refuse to Say Radical Islamic Terrorism,"Spoke with The Mike Gallagher Show this morningHOUSTON, Texas  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz joined Mike Gallagher on the radio this morning regarding the fight against ISIS, that President Obama is completely out of touch with the American people, and how the USA Freedom Act strengthens our ability to target radical Islamic terrorists.Below are excerpts, listen to entire interview here:Regarding the President's AddressMike Gallagher: I mean it's inconceivable to me that the President of the United States wants to stand at the podium in the Oval Office and talk about things like the no fly list and gun control, as if ISIS inspired terrorists are going to worry about gun control laws anywhere in America...Ted Cruz: That is exactly right. You know last night's speech, the President is so out of touch and so unprepared and unwilling to defend this nation, which makes the next year extraordinarily dangerous. We saw the President lecture the American people like some condescending schoolmarm about the need to avoid Islamophobia.What we need is a Commander in Chief who stands up and, number one, doesn't engage in politically correct doublespeak, doesn't refuse to say the words radical Islamic terrorism as Obama and Hillary and all the Democrats do. Number two, who says we will defeat ISIS, we're going to carpet bomb them in oblivion, we're going to arm the Kurds, we're going to go and find them and hunt them down and kill them...Regarding USA Freedom ActGallagher: It came out over the weekend it seemed the government was a little bit handcuffed from accessing metadata regarding the San Bernardino attack because it's NSA access lapsed under this kind of legislation that you've been opposed to. Can you help us explain your vote..?Cruz: Well sure this issue is quite straightforward and I'm very proud of having joined with Mike Lee and other strong conservatives in crafting the USA Freedom Act and passing it. And it is legislation that strengthened America's ability to target terrorists...What Senator Rubio believes is that we would be safer if the federal government had access to your and my cell phones and emails and location at every point.And indeed unfortunately Senator Rubio last night dismissed the fourth amendment of the Bill of Rights is 'ideological silliness'. Now I have to say I don't think the Bill of Rights or the Constitution is ideological silliness. And I don't think America is safer by giving Lois Lerner access to your and my cell phones and emails.So what did we do in the USA Freedom Act? We ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of law-abiding citizens. But at the same time we strengthened the ability to go after terrorists...Under the USA Freedom Act we can now intercept more cell phones we can get more metadata on the terrorists than we did before. The old program only included a portion of the phone records in existence. Under the USA Freedom Act, law enforcement and national security can now access a much broader universe to target terrorists, which is in fact what we did after San Bernardino...Gallagher: It frankly reminds me a bit of Democrats response to gun control, I mean it's the same idea. Let's take everybody's right away to keep and bear arms in order to try and keep it out of the hands of terrorists, let's make sure everybody's cell phone is tapped into and everybody's communication is monitored to try and keep terrorists from being able to communicate, rather than focus on the actual terrorists themselves.Cruz: That is exactly right."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 7, 2015",Press Release - Rep. Sam Graves Endorses Ted Cruz for President,"HOUSTON, Texas  Today, Ted Cruz received the endorsement of Congressman Sam Graves of Missouri. During his eight terms in Congress, Rep. Graves has been a strong advocate for the conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, a strong national defense, and protecting the unborn.Graves has been a staunch supporter of ending government bailouts, balancing the budget, and cutting wasteful spending. He was one of only a few members of Congress to vote against all the Bush stimulus packages and bailouts, while supporting tax cuts for middle-class families. Graves has fought tirelessly to protect veterans, improve border security, and ensure our military has the resources it needs to keep America safe. And, as a long-time leader in the fight to protect life, Graves strongly backed the recent push to end taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.""I have personally seen Ted Cruz stand up and fight on the issues that matter the most to conservatives, even when it wasn't popular in Congress,"" said Graves. ""He has never wavered. He has always stood on principle. And he has always put the American people first. That is the kind of leadership we need at this critical time for our country. As threats emerge  from ISIS, to Russia, to the Iranian nuclear program  we need a president with the resolve to defend our country and not back down. We must secure our borders and restore the rule of law, and more than anyone running, Ted Cruz has fought to make this nation secure, while protecting our constitutional rights. I proudly endorse Ted Cruz for President.""""I am thrilled to have the support of Congressman Graves,"" said Cruz. ""He is a man of great principle, who has not shied away from taking the unpopular position in Washington if it was for the good of the country. Very few can match his record of fiscal conservatism, including opposing every corporate bailout, or his dedication to the men and women in uniform who serve this country, both retired and active. I look forward to working with him to get our message out in the great state of Missouri and deeply appreciate his support."""

Trump in the state...This time, Mr. Vander Plaats said, Mr. Cruz is much better positioned to be the nominee because of deep financial resources and a national grass-roots revolt against the Republican establishment.""We will be going all in for Senator Ted Cruz,'' Mr. Vander Plaats said, speaking in the rotunda of the state Capitol.In an Iowa poll this week, Mr. Cruz was in first place for the first time in an early voting state, but a second poll showed Mr. Trump leading. The two are increasingly in a battle for the state's more conservative voters, with Mr. Cruz appealing more to evangelicals and Mr. Trump to more secular, disaffected blue-collar Iowans.Bryan English, Mr. Cruz's Iowa director, called the endorsement ""a very significant day in the campaign"" because of Mr. Vander Plaats's influence with ""an audience that is highly motivated.'' Evangelical Christians represented about 60 percent of voters in the past two Republican caucuses, ensuring Mr. Huckabee's victory in 2008 and Mr. Santorum's in 2012. Their eventual collapse, in the view of many conservatives, was because the party's right wing never united behind them.National social conservative leaders have sought to avoid the same fate this year, holding many private meetings to discuss which candidate to endorse.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 11, 2015",Press Release - Rabbis Stand in Support of Ted Cruz During Chanukah,"Cruz Welcomes Endorsements From More than Two-Dozen American RabbisHOUSTON, Texas  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz this week welcomed the endorsements of more than two-dozen rabbis, influencing a community of around 10,000 Jewish Americans.In conjunction with Chanukah, the group released a letter of support for Cruz, citing a shared commitment to the Judeo-Christian ethic, human freedom, and the futures of Israel and the United States. The coalition represents a range of leaders, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi to Modern Orthodox leaders.Yaakov Rosenblatt, a leader of the coalition, is a rabbi and businessman in Dallas, Texas. Rosenblatt received his masters of Talmudic Law in 1999 from Beth Medrash Gevoha and his rabbinic ordination in 2002: the author of two books, he is a frequent contributor to Jewish and general publications on issues of faith and culture.""Rabbis generally avoid political affiliation or endorsement,"" Rosenblatt told the Jewish World Review. ""[But] with the Middle East and Europe unraveling and the United States stepping back from its role as a check against the expansion of evil, rabbis from coast to coast are sensing the need to weigh in on the issues of the day, including choosing a man they feel is most articulate and consistent in expressing the core values they hold dear.""Rabbi Michael Friedman is also instrumental in recruiting rabbis to rally around Ted Cruz. Friedman is completing an internship as a clinical mental health professional, has a Masters of Education, and received rabbinical ordination from Israel in 2009.""I am honored to have the support of these leaders from the Jewish community,"" Ted Cruz said. ""Today religious faith and liberty are under attack across the world, and innocent people suffer at the hands of violent extremists. No one knows the dangers of ambitious dictators and of terrorism more vividly than the Jewish people. During Chanukah, as we commemorate the Maccabees' historic stand against oppression, we must also accept the call to fight evil and oppression in our own times. I am proud to stand with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in defending the Judeo-Christian ethic and holding up the light of faith and liberty.""The statement of endorsement reads:""Once stable and predictable, the world has become chaotic and dangerous. The Middle East is aflame, Europe is adrift, and the United States is unsure of its moral mission. ...Pushing back against destructive cultural trends and reversing them, takes a very special leader. The individual must be fearless, articulate, a person of faith who understands the premise and promise of America. He must be someone who understands the threat of radical Islam, and capable of inspiring the masses to return to spirit and purpose.Not representing any religious institution but wholeheartedly representing the values to which we have dedicated our lives, we the undersigned rabbis have reviewed the field of candidates and endorse Senator Ted Cruz for President of the United States. He is the most articulate and passionate delegate of the values we hold dear; he is fearless and unwavering in these core beliefs. He is resolute toward defending our values and has consistently displayed the courage of his convictions.In the spirit of Chanukah, when a small group inspired a tired populace to combat and defeat tyranny, we pray that his voice finds resonance, his spirit finds strength, and that the people of this great, moral nation once again feel great, become great, and spread the light of liberty, the message of morality throughout the world.""The names of the rabbis endorsing Ted Cruz for President appear below:Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt  Dallas, TXRabbi Michael Friedman  Dallas, TXRabbi Elchanan Aisenstark  Oak Park, MIRabbi Ahron Dov Barkany  Miami Beach, FLRabbi Yaakov Berger  Lakewood, NJRabbi Abraham Bloch  University City, MORabbi Michael Bodeheimer  Dallas, TXRabbi Zeev (William) Brown  Far Rockaway, NYRabbi Benzion Buchman  Brooklyn, NYRabbi Jeremy Cassius  Dallas, TXRabbi David Ceder  Staten Island, NYRabbi Yosef Chazanow  Los Angeles, CARabbi Samuel Chazanow  Los Angeles, CARabbi Nosson Dubin  Houston, TXRabbi Yerachmiel Fried  Dallas, TXRabbi Yisrael Gruman  Chicago, ILRabbi Avrohom Jurkowitz  Kew Gardens, NYRabbi Yekusiel Kalmenson  Los Angeles, CARabbi Herzel Kranz  Silver Spring, MDRabbi Simcha Merkin  Silver Spring, NYRabbi Menachem Rabenstein  St Louis Park, MNRabbi David Shanik  Lakewood, NJRabbi Maximo Shechet  Omaha, NERabbi Joseph E.

As he writes in a Conservative Review op-ed, Cruz's plan safeguards American jobs and protects against terrorists who seek to commit atrocities on American soil.""I have stood with millions of Americans who understand the dangers of a porous national border, the foolhardiness of President Obama's amnesty, and the lunacy of accepting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees. Americans see the crushing economic consequences of low-skill labor flooding our job market every day. But the atrocities in Paris and Beirut spur us to fight even harder to protect not only American workers, but also vital national security interests,"" Cruz writes.He continues, ""A porous border tempts terrorists to set foot in our homeland. A lax visa entry-exit system invites enemieslike the 9/11 hijackersto hide in our communities. More than 340 'sanctuary cities' and jurisdictions lure murderers and crooks to roam our streets. And a leader who refuses to enforce the rule of law creates a void that criminals and evildoers are eager to fill, as we have witnessed again and again on the world stage....""It's past time to secure the border, to make the law mean what it says, and to ensure that our own immigration system does not open the door to economic hardship, crime, or terrorism. We know how to strengthen our immigration system and how to once again put American interests first. We simply lack the political will to get it done. As president, I will not waste a day. I will immediately rescind all of the Obama administration's lawless executive actions on immigration. I will stop Obama's amnesty. I will restore the rule of law. And I will dedicate time and resources to protecting Americans' jobs and security."""

I want to kill the bad guys, and you want to sit here tonight tell me why I can't here, and why I can't there, and why we can't over here.I want to beat the bad guys. I want America great again.'""Cruz, the same thing. The PC crowd and the moderators say: Well, you can't do that! There are innocent children and civilians and so forth. I'm tired of hearing why we can't do things. There are things that we're gonna have to do, and I want to go do 'em, and don't bog me down with these little details here. Big picture.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 17, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI: Rush, Sessions, Lee, King Join With Ted Cruz to Push Back on Marco Rubio's False Attacks","HOUSTON, Texas Conservative leaderstodaystepped forward to support Ted Cruz's consistent and conservative record of opposing amnesty and fighting to secure the border while pushing back on Gang of Eight leader Marco Rubio and his desperate and false attacks.Earlier today, Cruz continued to demonstrate hiscommitmentto fighting amnesty saying,""let's have a moment of simple clarity: I oppose amnesty, I oppose citizenship, I oppose legalization for illegal aliens; I always have and I always will. And I challenge every other Republican candidate to say the same thing, or if not, then to stop making silly assertions that their records and my records on immigration are the same.""Below is a sampling of coverage:WATCH VIDEO Rush LimbaughLook if you're trying to follow this Rubio Cruz thing, it long ago got so deep in the woods that it's gotten so muddled here that you're going to be thankful for this program in not too long a time because what we do here is make the complex understandable. And I'm going to wade deep into the muck. And I'm going to go there in the weeds, I'm going to grab the essentials, I'm going to bring them out, and I'm going to tell you what it is all about.Which is very simple.Marco Rubio was part of the Gang of Eight trying to secure amnesty and wishes he wasn't. Ted Cruz never was and they're trying to make it out like he was. And at the end of the day, when people go vote, people are going to remember of the two, it was Marco Rubio that was a member of the Gang of Eight and Ted Cruz that wasn't. And that's as complicated, or simple, as it's going to end up being.WATCH VIDEO Sen. Jeff SessionsSenator Cruz stood with me. We recognized that the talking points that Senator Rubio and others were using to describe this monumental bill were not accurate. It would not do the things they said it would do. The law enforcement people opposed it viciously and vigorously. And so one of his amendments was to block citizenship, and he made it just to block citizenship for anybody who entered the country illegally, which I think is exactly right.And of course the bill allowed for citizenship as part of amnesty, and it didn't fix everything in the bill, and I of course voted for it, and so did he and he's spoken for it, and he's sort of teased or mocked the other side by saying ""well, you say you want your immigration  you can have your immigration but give up citizenship."" Oh no, they wouldn't do that. It's humorous. He'd debate, and Ted won that debate. He lost the vote, but he won the debate.WATCH VIDEO Sen. Mike LeeI was there with Ted Cruz the entire time as we spent weeks on the Gang of Eight immigration bill.I was there with him when we both drafted and presented amendments trying to make this really bad Gang of Eight amnesty bill not as bad. And at no time during that process  at no moment did I ever see Ted Cruz take any action that was tantamount to saying he was embracing amnesty.He filed amendments designed to make the bill less bad. But that didn't mean, and that does not mean now, and never will mean that he was going to vote for that bill. He was just trying to make it less bad.And insofar as anybody is trying to suggest that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had the same position with regard to amnesty or with regard to the Gang of Eight bill, That is absolutely false. 100% false.WATCH VIDEO Congressman Steve KingAs I watched that tape and the debate in that committee, and I was aware, almost up to the minute of what was taking place at the time  it was clear that Senator Cruz, if he was going to make the point and force a vote that there would be no path to citizenship and expose the objective of especially the Democrats that Marco Rubio had been swept up with  that that's about the only way you could draft that amendment.And then I listen to his rhetoric on that, and you want to make an argument that your amendment has the best chance of passing. Then I looked at who voted on which side of that.The border security, rule of law people voted with Ted Cruz. The pro-amnesty people voted with Marco Rubio and others, so that's how I would characterize it, Chuck....But at no point did Ted Cruz indicate that he was going to vote for this bill. I think what's missing here  if Marco Rubio can assign a motive for Ted Cruz, then we also ought to look at the Gang of Eight bill and recognize that it is instantaneous amnesty, it's retroactive amnesty  if you've been deported in the past, it invites people to come back to America. But also, Marco Rubio and the Gang of Eight did not address protective amnesty that is implicit in the bill. Which means that if you can get into America after that day, they don't address that at all in in the Gang of Eight bill.So I think that if Ted Cruz wanted to play the same game on this, he could open that whole avenue up and say that there's going to be no enforcement going forward with the people that get into America under the Gang of Eight bill, and that's very troubling to me....And by the way, I'd ask people also, goread the eleven page document on immigrationthat Ted Cruz rolled out about two and a half weeks ago. I had some voice in that. That's real clear, and I wish that Marco Rubio would read that document too."

[VIDEO]But in Washington, far from the watchful eyes of the voters who elected him, he joined Senators Chuck Schumer and John McCain in the backrooms of the U.S. Senate to write a bill that creates a ""path to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants""  amnesty exactly what he promised he would not do.And even on the Senate floor, when his fellow Republicans offered amendments to require strict border security, construction of a border fence, Congressional oversight, and a common-sense screening program for immigrants from countries that export terrorism, Rubio rejected each of them in order to protect the reckless deal he cut with Obama and liberal Democrats.Rubio claims he is for border security but when given the chance he voted against Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley's amendment to require the border be secure before granting Rubio's own proposed amnesty.(2013 RC#148)When given the chance to protect America's national security by prioritizing the building of a border wall, Rubio voted against an amendment from Senator Thune that would have required the completion of 700 miles of border fence before any illegal aliens could get a green card.(2013 RC#151) Rubio talks tough about protecting America yet he voted against Senator Vitter's amendment that would have required the full completion of the US VISIT program, an anti-terror initiative recommended by the 9/11 Commission.(2013 RC#152)Rubio voted against Rand Paul's amendment that would have created a ""Student Visa National Security Registration system to add increased security screening of students coming from countries known to be incubators of extremism and exporters of international terrorism.""(2013 RC#154)It is clear Marco Rubio said one thing to get elected and promptly broke his promise once in office. How can voters trust what he says now?Today, the Cruz campaign has released another television ad, ""Border,"" in Iowa that highlights Marco Rubio's lead role in pushing the Gang of Eight amnesty bill  a measure that Ted Cruz helped fight against and ultimately defeat.Watch the ad here:"

Cruz doesn't""HOUSTON, Texas Today, theWashington Examiner's Byron York wrote about the facts of the immigration records of Ted Cruz,who played a critical role in killing the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, and Senator Marco Rubio, who joined in a secret agreement to kill any substantive amendments to the bill and ""still supports a path to citizenship.""The full article may be read hereand excerpts appear below:Washington ExaminerThe facts on Rubio, Cruz, and immigrationByron YorkThen-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid allowed just a handful of amendments to reach the Senate floor. One, from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, would have prohibited the legalization of illegal immigrants in the United States until after the administration could prove it had maintained ""effective control"" of the borders for six months.Rubio voted against the Grassley amendment. Sen. Ted Cruz voted for it.Another Republican amendment, from Sen. John Thune, would have required the completion of 350 miles of fencing along the U.S. border that Congress had ordered in 1996 but had never been completed...Rubio voted against the Thune amendment. Cruz voted for it.The other substantive GOP amendment allowed by Reid was from Sen. David Vitter. It would have delayed the granting of legal status until a biometric visa identity system first ordered by Congress in 1996 had been ""fully implemented at every land, sea, and airport of entry"" into the United States.Rubio voted against the Vitter amendment. Cruz voted for it....Under a pre-arranged plan, the gang, including Rubio, agreed to kill any amendments they felt would threaten their legislation.""The eight met in private before each committee hearing, hashing out which amendments they would support and which oppose as a united coalition,"" the Washington Post reported in May 2013. ""Senate aides said amendments were rejected if either side felt they would shatter the deal.""...The Gang of Eight bill came up for a final Senate vote on June 27, 2013. Rubio, as a key author of the legislation, voted for its passage. Cruz voted against it....It remains unclear where Rubio stands on the thousands of other provisions in his 1,197-page Gang of Eight bill. In five Republican presidential debates, he has been asked exactly one question about the substance of the bill. (The question was whether Rubio still supports a path to citizenship; he does, while Cruz doesn't.)"

Ted Cruz,R,p,"December 30, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI: Commentary: Tony Dolan on Max Boot on Ted Cruz,"Cruz is 'great in the crunch' and he won't 'let us down'HOUSTON, TexasYesterday, Tony Dolan, former Chief Speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan and current adviser for Ted Cruz, wrote inCommentary Magazinethat Cruz's positions mirror those of Reagan.Cruz, like Reagan, Dolan writes, is unequivocally true to his word and is not afraid to stand up and fight for the America people. Dolanconcluded, ""they know that [Cruz] means it, that he'll win the argument, that he'll speak for freedom, thathe will keep America safe andbecause he has both tactical sense and strategic visionbring victory to the democracies in the world struggle.""Dolan's full column is below and may be viewedhere.Tony Dolan on Max Boot on Ted CruzCommentary MagazineJohn PodhoretzDecember 29, 2015""In attempting to stir up neocon opposition to Ted Cruz's presidential candidacy in his recent post, Max Boot admits to not knowing Ronald Reagan. As someone who didhaving spent eight years with President Reagan as his chief speechwriterI can readily attest to Mr. Boot's accuracy on that point if not much else in his article.""Mr. Boot's most recent offering is a cause of some dismay, since he has a record of thoughtful and sometimes compelling contributions in what is also a thoughtful and compelling publication. He throws a lifeline though to those who wish to retain a good opinion of his judgment, verisimilitude and maturity because in the body of his article. Mr. Boot tells us he now advises Senator Marco Rubioa current rival to Senator Cruz for the Republican presidential nomination. In saying this he offers a kind of explanation for the uncharacteristic emotional license he shows on the matter of Senator Cruz, sounding all too much like a French critic on the subject of German opera. His recent plunge into partisan politics raises the possibility Mr. Boot's judgment is being affected by the allure that intellectual-journalist types sometimes see at the end of the campaign rainbow, that of official power. This offers the hope that what currently ails Mr. Boot is entirely temporary. Senator Cruz's poll numbers, after all, are climbing. Senator Rubio's are stagnating. So it is possible that once the campaign is over Mr. Boot will go back to writing articles that unlike his most recent one contain some semblance of the qualities he so rightly attributes to Ronald Reaganveracity, fairness, and, yes, niceness.""In the meanwhile though, it's important to correct Mr. Boot's misrepresentations about Senator Cruz. In doing so, however, I should make my own full disclosure. To wit: I am an adviser to the Cruz campaignthough here I can offer a note that readers will find reassuring as to why in this matter I suffer none of Mr Boot's infirmities. As a person of surpassing spirituality I am, as it happens, immune to considerations of self interest, the blandishments of power or this-world inducements of any sort.""For readers who may have the temerity to question my assurances of objectivity on the Boot-Cruz matter, here is the more specificthe harder evidenceto consider.""Syria and Libya. Senator Cruz wants the United States to demur from choosing sides in the chaotically multi-sided Syrian civil war. In doing so he has adopted the same position as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believing that no nation should enter another's civil war without knowing the real nature of the forces it is backing and without having at least a reasonable expectation of an acceptable outcome. What Senator Cruz has made clear though is that as president he will incinerate terrorist strongholds in Syria and elsewhere.""In much the same way, Senator Cruz has criticized as precipitous and ultimately catastrophic the policy of Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Libya. That Obama-Clinton policywhich Senator Rubio vocally and publicly supportedtoppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi even as he was working with the West in suppressing terrorist groups. This approach has harmed, in Senator Cruz's view, U.S. interests, resulting in a Libyan chaos that has strengthened Al Qaeda and ISIS and led to the loss of four American lives in the attack on the US enclave in Benghazi.""Surely then, Senator Cruz's positions seem reasonable enough andI would add as someone who went through eight years of foreign policy crises in the Reagan administration Reaganesque enough. After all, President Reagan, except for a brief and tragic expedition into Lebanon, stayed clear of direct interventions in the Mideast. And, as Senator Cruz recently noted about Libya: Rather than topple Gaddafi, President Reagan chose instead to send a corrective in the form of a wakeup call from the US Air Force and a bomb down his front porch. So, again, much like Reagan, Senator Cruz has made it clear he considers Assad, Gaddafi and their ilk anathema to all that America stands for in the world. But he has resisted the temptation to make the reflexive calls for intervention that foreign policy specialists and academics sometimes make too easily.""But, oh reader, consider what these Cruz positionsand , if you will Netatanyuesque and Reaganesque positionsbecome in the hands of Max Boot, Senator Cruz is not just being cautious about undertaking regime change against those he also considers reprehensible dictators. No indeed, Senator Cruz is 'egregious'and he is 'egregious' because he 'backs' Assad and Gaddafi, and he 'embraces' Assad and Gaddafi, and he gives 'blanket support' to Assad and Gaddafi.""Now none of that is true. Nor is it fair or nice. But such is the emotional pitch at which Max Boot examines this Cruz position. And others.""Immigration. Mr. Boot says Senator Cruz is against immigration. You read that right. Mr. Boot puts no 'illegal' in front of 'immigration.' Mr. Boot says Senator Cruz is just against 'immigration.' An allegation that as far as I know not even Senator Cruz's most fervent critics have attempted.""Mr. Boot's emotional wattage, while circuit-busting, also gets his own candidate in trouble. In making an implicit comparison to Senator Rubio's current position, he says approvingly that Ronald Reagan favored 'amnesty' and then criticizes Senator Cruz for disapproving 'amnesty.' In doing so, Mr. Boot seems unaware that in renouncing his formerly strong support for Schumer- Gang of 8 blanket amnesty, Senator Rubio has spent the last year trying to convince Republican voters his regret is sincere, really, really sincere. Now though comes Mr. Boot nd his willingness to reopen that question, justifying perhaps this headline: KEY RUBIO ADVISER INDICATES RUBIO STILL FAVORS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. There's something to keep the rapid response team busy at the Rubio HQ.""Now normally I would say here about Mr. Boot's claim that Ronald Reagantodaywould favor amnesty for the more than 11 million illegal aliens currently in the U.S. that as one who worked on the texts explaining the Reagan administration immigration legislation (Simpson-Mazzoli), I can assure him such is not the case. Though if he is distrustful of my personal assurances on this point he might talk instead to one of my former colleagues and one of President Reagan's oldest and most trusted followers, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher. The congressman can explain not only why comparing the Schumer-Rubio position on amnesty to that of President Reagan's is an absurdity but why he recently endorsed Senator Cruz as easily the most Reaganesque of the Republican candidates.""Free Trade. Senator Cruz's quite detailed and explicit call for tax cuts, regulatory reform, spending restraint, sound money and free trade has brought accolades from conservative economists who range from supply-siders to tea-party libertarians. He understands Reaganomics. When, however, he voted against giving the Obama administration fast-track trade authority, Senator Cruz explained he has no intention of adding further to the powers of the most lawless administration in U.S . history. (In doing so he has again separated himself from a Republican congressional leadership which seems to laboring under the extraordinary misapprehension that the voters, in their historic 2014 rebuke to the President and his party, were actually demanding that GOP legislators collaborate more intimately with the Obama Democrats.)""Now Mr. Boot has every right to think Senator Cruz's vote on fast-track authority was unwise. But what he has no right to withhold Senator Cruz's careful explanation and misrepresent his position as he does, claiming the senator has 'turned against free trade.' He owes his readers more.""Intelligence gathering. Senator Cruz is against the government collection of metadata, the endless sweeping seizure of everyone's personal data, phone call numbers, and emails. In a compromise piece of legislation that law enforcement and intelligence agencies find quite acceptable, however, he does favor mandating private companies hold onto such records.""Somehow Mr. Boot contorts his support for the USA Freedom Act into implacable opposition by Senator Cruz to intelligence-gathering of the sort President Reagan advocated. Once again, the Reagan reconstuctionism here hits the surreal. Mr. Boot apparently thinks that President Reagan's libertarian streakas high as it was widewould lead him to sanction a sweeping government invasion of personal privacy and the empowering of some future Lois Lerner to acts of repression against any citizen who incurs her displeasure.""Democracy promotion and 'neocons.' Mr. Boot mentions President Reagan's pro-democracy 'crusade for freedom' speech to the British Parliament in 1982. He then invokes neocon luminaries such as Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Jeane Kirkpatrick. All this is a prelude to excoriating Senator Cruz for being hostile to liberty and its champions.""I apologize for this but I simply know no other way to untangle Mr. Boot's confusions than to pull some rank again and cite for the reader some personal though I think quite relevant experience: The pro-democracy stuff was very much a part of my own White House portfolio. First, I should mention the draft from which President Reagan worked for his Westminster address was one that I more or less smuggled (with the help of National Security Adviser William Clark ) past a West Wing wall (manned by James Baker and David Gergen) that sought to keep the President's eyes uncontaminated by anything too robustly anti-Communist. Second, the neocon luminaries were my colleagues, my allies, and my friends. Mr. Perle and I have stories to tell about confounding the State Department accommodationists not to mention the less annoying if more formidable forces of the international Communist conspiracy. (Stories I am not unready to tell, incidentally, as evidenced by the behavior of some of my Cruz campaign colleagues who, having heard perhaps one or two of the anecdotes before, will flee the room at the mere mention of Mr. Perle's name.) And not too many years ago I helped organize the public relations operation that removed Paul Wolfowitz from the gunsights of House Democrats like then Congressman Rahm Emanuel over to the presidency of the World Bank. So too, as I write this now I look across the room at a souvenir from White House daysa Styrofoam cup from my office whose lipstick-smeared lid has below it the words: Jeane Kirpatrick Drank Here,July 13, 1984.""In knowing Reagan, then, and helping with his democracy promotion, and in knowing the neocons, I do not think they would mind if I said that they were initiallyunlike those of who had grown up in the conservative movementnot entirely sure about Ronald Reagan. Though as they grew to know and loyally serve Reaganand heard his eloquence for the cause of human freedom and saw him stand for it at critical moments like Reykjavikthose doubts dissipated.""Which leaves me to also say this: I regret Mr. Boot's unfairness. But I hope he and other neocons will hear me further on this. I always knew Ted Cruz was the best polemicist of all the candidates. Just as I knew that his rhetorical style, though radically different than that of Ronald Reagan's, could also successfully take the argument against the political and media elites to the American people. But, since that time I have also found that Senator Cruz knows how to run a political campaignthe indicator the American people look for in deciding whether a candidate knows who to run a presidency.""And I've learned something else as well.""'Isn't this guy great in the crunch?' CIA Director William Casey once said to me after a Reagan triumph. Recently I thought of that moment when I read a quote in the national press from a Cruz Texas constituent: 'He never lets us down.'""Those who get to know Ted Cruz his staff and othersfeel that way. They know that he means it, that he'll win the argument, that he'll speak for freedom, that he will keep America safe andbecause he has both tactical sense and strategic visionbring victory to the democracies in the world struggle.""Which is why I am hoping Max Boot's article might do some good after allas a prompt to what I hope neocons everywhere will hear, that I think Ted Cruz is also 'great in the crunch' and that he won't 'let us down.'""I hope they will sign up.""Or, as Reagan used to say, 'Come, my friends and let us make a newer world.'"""

Education is a state and local issue and parents should have direct input and control of what's being taught to their children. The single most important thing in a child's education is parental involvement,"" Cruz said. ""If you or I disagree with what some bureaucrat in the federal Department of Education says, you can't change that, and that is not the way it should be.

In July 2011, he also took on lobbying for ParentalRights.org as the organization's Director of Federal Relations, where he advocates before Congress for the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.""I spend my days fighting for homeschool freedom. It's not easy because much of the education establishment is against us. So, when I was deciding whom to support for President of the United States, I evaluated each candidate by his or her willingness to consistently fight for conservative, constitutional principlesby his or her eagerness to take on the political establishment in both parties as part of those fightsand by his or her record of reducing the role of the federal government in the everyday lives of American citizens. Only one candidate truly fit the bill, and that's Ted Cruz"" said Estrada.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"January 6, 2016",Press Release - Cruz Corrects False Accusations from Ethanol Lobby on RFS,"Spirit Lake, IA  Today, the Cruz campaign responded to the false claims from the ethanol lobby that presidential candidate Ted Cruz has shifted his position on the Renewable Fuel Standard mandate:Cruz has consistently supported a five-year phase out of the Renewable Fuel Standard. Cruz first introduced the five-year phase out in 2014.Cruz publicly called for the phase out at the Iowa Ag summit last March: ""But Cruz, who has called for phasing out the RFS program over five years, said Americans are fed up with ""career politicians"" who pander to voters, especially in places like Iowa, with its outsized role in the presidential nominating process.""Cruz reiterated this strategy in an interview with RFD-TV last September: ""And so I've introduced legislation to phase out the mandate, not to drop it out immediately, but phase it out over five years, in part to recognize, as you pointed, the investment-back expectations and to give some time in terms of changing the rules. ""Further, Cruz has always said government shouldn't pick winners or losers. Which means government shouldn't be handing out subsides or creating mandates to or for favored industries, but they also shouldn't create barriers that prevent industries from having access to and expanding their markets.To that end, he would instruct the Justice Department to vigorously enforce antitrust laws and he would eliminate the EPA's regulations that impose a hard wall against the general sale of mid-level ethanol blends, such as E25 (25% ethanol, 75% gasoline). This opens up entire new markets for ethanol. Indeed, his argument is that ethanol manufacturers would more likely be better off without government interference than with the mandates and regulations. Far from a ""shift,"" this approach is consistent with Cruz's free market principles that encourage innovation and competition."

Cruz said that along with passing the Expatriate Terrorist Act (ETA), ""we need to see a systematic and careful retroactive assessment of refugees brought in from high risk countries to examine the public record, to examine all the evidence of whether these individuals have ties to radical islamic terrorists."" He adds that we need a President less concerned about political correctness and more concerned about keeping this country safe, that's the leadership Americans are looking for.Video and transcript below.CRUZ: The fact that these two have been apprehended underscores how real this danger is and how much we need a President who is focused on protecting the men and women in this country. We should not be allowing ISIS terrorists to come back to America with U.S. passports and wage jihad to attempt to murder innocent men and women in this country."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"January 9, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: Law-Enforcement Officers 'Deliver Us from Evil',"Take Time to Honor Our Police on Law Enforcement Appreciation DayHOUSTON, Texas  Today Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed in National Review to thank police officers for their service on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day (LEAD).""Law enforcement forms a thin but powerful line protecting us not just from violent criminals, but from terrorists on our own soil. In the case of Garland, Texas, Islamic terrorists could have taken unknown numbers of lives if it were not for the brave traffic officer who stopped their attempted attack.""Below is an excerpt and the full op-ed may be viewed here.On Thursday evening, Edward Archer approached Philadelphia Police Officer Jesse Hartnett and proceeded to shoot at him 13 times. Friday morning, he professed to have done so in the name of Islam and it's reported that he has pledged his allegiance to ISIS.This violent attempt to murder a law-enforcement officer is in keeping with ISIS's ongoing effort to attack those whose job it is to keep America safe, as we have seen in Fort Hood, Boston, and Chattanooga.Yet in the wake of another attack in the name of radical Islamic terrorism, it is unfortunate that we have already seen so many officials bow down to political correctness rather than recognize the existential threat of radical Islamic terrorism to our very way of life.We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and that starts by calling it by its name. And we must stand with law enforcement against those who seek to do us harm.The same night that Officer Hartnett was shot in Philadelphia, terrorist suspects were arrested in Sacramento and Houston with the help of state and local law enforcement. These events underscore just how essential our officers are in keeping Americans safe and free.Law enforcement forms a thin but powerful line protecting us not just from violent criminals, but from terrorists on our own soil. In the case of Garland, Texas, Islamic terrorists could have taken unknown numbers of lives if it were not for the brave traffic officer who stopped their attempted attack.We must thank every officer for their service, not make excuses for the terrorists trying to kill them. Saturday is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day (LEAD). It is an opportunity to stand emphatically with our police force and to express our gratitude for their bravery, especially in a national climate that has been hostile towards our men and women in blue.By contrast, not only does President Obama refuse to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name, he has also perpetrated a national movement to vilify the very officers who keep our communities safe from this threat. He has nominated an individual to a top Department of Justice post who had represented and lionized a cop killer, and in 2015, he said ""There are some police who aren't doing the right thing."" He continued, ""We can't just leave this to the police,"" suggesting that he should stand as the judge and jury in convicting police officers....I am reminded of the memorial service I attended a few months ago in my hometown of Houston for Deputy Darren Goforth, an officer who was shot while he was at a gas station. At the service, thousands of officers dressed in blue filled the sanctuary. Dr. Ed Young, the pastor of Second Baptist Church, powerfully observed that in the Old Testament the Levites, the priests, wore blue. And he drew from the Lord's Prayer to describe the core mission of police, and in particular, one phrase in the Lord's Prayer: ""Deliver us from evil."" That is the mission statement of our police  to deliver us from evil in the most horrifying moments of our lives.So today, and every day, let us stand unequivocally with the brave men and women of law enforcement and thank them for their service. And let's ensure that we remain safe by honoring our blue heroes with the respect and gratitude they deserve."

As President Reagan showedand before him, President Kennedy in the 1960s (average annual growth of 5.3%) and Presidents Harding and Coolidge in the 1920s (4.7% growth)tax reform is a powerful lever for spurring economic expansion. Along with reducing red tape on business and restoring sound money, it can make the U.S. economy boom again.That's why I'm proposing the Simple Flat Tax as the cornerstone of my economic agenda.In constructing my plan, I had several requirements. The plan should: spur robust economic growth and job creation, while raising after-tax income for all Americans; be dramatically simpler, to allow working people to file their taxes with a postcard or phone app; and shrink Washington by getting rid of the rat's nest of complex tax requirements, credits and loopholes.With these goals in mind, based on a structure suggested by President Reagan's tax adviser, Arthur Laffer, my Simple Flat Tax plan features the following:For a family of four, no taxes whatsoever (income or payroll) on the first $36,000 of income.Above that level, a 10% flat tax on all individual income from wages and investment.No death tax, alternative minimum tax or ObamaCare taxes.Elimination of the payroll tax and the corporate income tax, to be replaced by a 16% Business Flat Tax. This would tax companies' gross receipts from sales of goods and services, less purchases from other businesses, including capital investment. Simple, efficient, fair.A Universal Savings Account, which would allow every American to save up to $25,000 annually on a tax-deferred basis for any purpose.Today, the U.S. taxes American producers that export goods, but it imposes no burden on imports. My business tax is border-adjusted, so exports are free of tax and imports pay the same business-flat-tax rate as U.S.-produced goods. By shifting to a territorial tax system that doesn't tax income earned overseas twice, my plan will reverse the incentive for U.S. companies to relocate overseas. Instead, businesses will be relocating to America."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"January 18, 2016",Press Release - Cruz for President Announces Endorsement from Eagle Forum Activists,"20 Eagle Forum leaders endorse Ted Cruz for PresidentHOUSTON, Texas  In a letter today, 20 Eagle Forum state leaders and activists endorsed Ted Cruz for President, naming Cruz as the leader America needs and the best of the candidates competing for the Republican nomination.""I am honored to have the support of so many Eagles, at the grassroots and all across this nation,"" Cruz said. ""Phyllis Schlafly has given me much good advice over the years, and I admire the courageous grassroots activists who are carrying on her great work. Our nation is indebted to Eagle Forum for their conservative leadership, now in its fifth decade. Eagle Forum understands the unequaled power of the American people when they rise up against the Washington cartel and in defense of our nation's founding freedoms.""Full text of the letter appears below.In the conservative trenches, Eagle Forum activists have been shaping American policy and electing conservative leaders for nearly 45 years. We know the urgency of this presidential election, and we have weighed the candidates seriously and thoroughly.Among the Republican candidates, Ted Cruz stands out. His courageous conservatism is indisputable. As Solicitor General of Texas, he successfully protected the Ten Commandments and the Pledge of Allegiance. He stood up for veterans' free speech rights. Ted Cruz defended religious liberty in public schools, the workplace, and the church. Ted Cruz' resume is just as remarkable as his courage: Cruz does not simply choose the right side in the battles that matter: he leads the battle to victory.As a United States Senator, Ted Cruz has led the fight against Planned Parenthood and Obamacare. He has defended marriage, opposed judicial activism, exposed Common Core, and worked to secure our border. He has eloquently defended our freedom of speech and 2nd Amendment rights.The Washington cartel has betrayed the American people. Too many Republicans have abused the trust of conservatives. It is time for conservatives to claim our nation for liberty and to restore opportunity: as Ted Cruz says, to reignite the promise of America.Ted Cruz embodies Eagle Forum's mission: ""to enable conservative and pro-family men and women to participate in the process of self-government and public policy making so that America will continue to be a land of individual liberty, respect for family integrity, public and private virtue, and private enterprise.""Ted Cruz is the Reaganesque leader our country needs in 2016. While establishment Republicans led the charge for amnesty and betrayed the trust of those who elected them, Ted Cruz fought to uphold the law and defend our borders. Ted Cruz has demonstrated steadfastness, character, and intelligence in Washington.50 years ago, during another strategic election, Phyllis Schlafly reminded America that ultimately, the people do not serve the government: government must serve the people. Now once more, it is time for a law-abiding, truth-telling president in the Oval Office.With this in mind, we, the undersigned Eagle Forum state leaders, enthusiastically endorse Ted Cruz for President of the United States. From the grassroots up, we will work to ensure his victory: Ted Cruz is our choice, and we refuse to be an echo.Faithfully,Anne Cori, State Leader, Missouri Eagle ForumCathie Adams, State Leader, Texas Eagle Forum and Eagle Forum Board MemberTrayce Bradford, Incoming State Leader, Texas Eagle ForumMerryLynn Gertenschlager, Vice President, Texas Eagle ForumBetty Anderson, Montgomery County Texas Eagle Forum LeaderSkeet Workman, Lubbock Texas Eagle Forum LeaderPat Andrews, State Leader, Florida Eagle ForumNena Arias, State Leader, North Carolina Eagle ForumEunie Smith, State Leader, Alabama Eagle ForumElaine Little, Vice President, Alabama Eagle ForumJayne Schindler, Co-Director, Colorado Eagle ForumJames Schindler, Co-Director, Colorado Eagle ForumRosina Kovar, Leader, Colorado Eagle Forum and Eagle Forum Board MemberGayle Ruzicka, State Leader, Utah Eagle ForumOrlean Koehle, State Leader, California Eagle ForumDavid Lehman, Orange County Leader, California Eagle ForumSandy McDade, State Leader, Louisiana Eagle ForumSusan Ellsworth, Vice President, Arizona Eagle ForumCindy Honcoop, State Leader, Washington Eagle ForumLois O'Brien, State Leader, Oregon Eagle Forum*Titles and affiliations provided for identification purposes only."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"January 20, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: The Resurgent: How Ted Cruz Came to Know Jesus,"HOUSTON, Texas  Today in The Resurgent, Erick Erickson writes about Ted Cruz's personal journey of faith and how his father found the Lord, after walking out on Cruz and his mother. This journey profoundly influences Cruz's life and affects how Cruz would govern the United States as President with moral clarity and conservative values. Erickson writes, ""This is not a stunt for Ted Cruz. His father walked out on the family, lost himself in a bottle, and was finally rescued by a Bible Study and a preacher willing to debate and answer questions.""Below is an excerpt and the full article may be viewed here.I hear friends say Ted Cruz sounds like a preacher. They say he is using the gospel to round up voters. They don't like it and they are not sure if Ted is authentic. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who watched his sister consumed by a heroine addiction. She died of an overdose. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who maxed out his credit cards to rescue his sister's son from that situation. The Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who, as a boy, was abandoned by his father and watched his mother struggle. And the Ted Cruz I know is the Ted Cruz who came to know Jesus as his Lord and Savior and credits the Lord with bringing back his father.Ted Cruz is a not an academic evangelical. He's a country music evangelical. He lost his father, found Jesus, got back his father, lost his sister, and did what it took to keep his family above water. When he gets on a stage and connects with Christian audiences, yes he is trying to woo Christians to his side, but he also believes in the power of scripture. This is not a stunt for Ted Cruz."

The announcement marks the final milestone in Cruz's impressive Iowa organization. The campaign is putting its massive Iowa organization to the test this week by mobilizing the grassroots and turning them out to caucus for Cruz.Leading up to the Iowa Caucus on February 1, the Cruz for President campaign has put together an unmatched ground game throughout the Hawkeye state. It has named a county chair for each of Iowa's 99 counties. The campaign has recruited 247 notable activists, pastors, and lawmakers including Congressman Steve King, Bob Vander Plaats, Steve Deace, and Cruz's chairman Matt Schultz, former Iowa Secretary of State.As of last week, over 12,000 volunteers have signed on and are now working to identify and turn out caucus goers for Cruz. Volunteers, on average, are making up to 20,000 phone calls and knocking on 2,000 doors every day. During the month of January, 836 people will have stayed at Camp Cruz, the former college dorms that are filled beyond capacity with volunteers from all over the country, some tripling up in rooms using air mattresses.""In my experience the Cruz organizational effort here in Iowa is unrivaled,"" said Bryan English, the Cruz campaign's Iowa state director. ""We have coalesced conservatives from across the state because they want a conservative leader who will change Washington, break the DC Cartel, and bring power back to 'We the People'.""This week, Cruz will be barnstorming the state holding 30 public events in 22 counties leading up to the caucuses. By Monday, he will have completed the 'Full Grassley,' visiting and holding events in all 99 counties in the state. Over the course of the campaign, Cruz has met thousands of Iowans who have come out to his events. He has made it a point to spend time listening to and getting to know the people of Iowa face to face. Governor Rick Perry, who endorsed Cruz earlier in the week, will be attending events today with Cruz along with Bob Vander Plaats and Congressman Steve King.All the campaign has done up to this point in Iowa leads to Monday's caucuses. Cruz noted that this incredible effort would not have been possible without the sacrifices made by thousands of courageous conservatives and their families from Iowa and from around the country. The Cruz campaign believes that conservatives in Iowa have united behind their campaign because Cruz is the only candidate in the race with a proven conservative track record and because he has stood up to Washington, including the leaders in his own party."

That is why when deciding who to support, I'm looking for a candidate who has a record that matches their rhetoric and a history of following through on their word. I believe that candidate is Senator Ted Cruz.""I didn't run for Congress to make friends, I ran to fight to restore the America that we love. Sometimes in these fights I've been in the majority, other times I've been in the minority, and often I'm one of a few. But I've never been alone, and that is because Ted Cruz has been in the middle of nearly all of those fights with me.""I believe Ted Cruz is the right candidate for the right time in our country's history. A proven leader and a consistent conservative who will fight the Washington cartel and stand up for the American people. Ted doesn't just talk about the Constitution, he's lived it and defended it tirelessly. I believe Ted's record sets him apart on this race and it is why I am proud to support him for President of the United States.""""Jeff has spent every day that he's been in Congress fighting for the liberties of his constituents,"" said Cruz. ""He is a tremendously important voice for freedom and a champion for conservative principles. He has fought tirelessly to repeal Obamacare, to stop Obama's lawlessness and to protect life and marriage. I am thrilled to have his support and look forward to working to bring conservatives together to win the White House in 2016."""

Marco Rubio wrote, ""While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.""FACT: Donald Trump Has Refused to Denounce Taxpayer Funding for Planned Parenthood and Said ""It Does Do Wonderful Things""FromBreitbart:When pressed on non-abortion services Planned Parenthood allegedly provides, Trump said, ""What I would do when the time came, I'd look at the individual things they do, and maybe some of the individual things they do are good. I know a lot of the things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government, absolutely.""Trump continued, ""I would look at the good aspects of [Planned Parenthood], and I would also look, because I'm sure they do some things properly and good and that are good for women, and I would look at that, and I would look at other aspects also. But we have to take care of women.""In other words Trump is open to a status quo many conservatives find unacceptable and immoral; also a typical federal government shell game to skirt around the law. If you give Planned Parenthood money for these so-called ""other things,"" the abortion provider can shift money from those ""other things"" to abortion.During the South Carolina Debate:CRUZ: You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on...TRUMP: That's a lot of lies.CRUZ: You said, ""Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.""TRUMP: It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion.FACT: Trump Lied About His Opposition to Transferring Federal Lands to the StatesAt a a rally in February, Trump said:""He's got an ad, something to do with I want to take away your land and I want to keep it in the federal government...I don't even know what the hell they're talking about.""However, as CBS reported in JanuaryReal estate mogul Donald Trump would not let states take control of federal lands, the Republican presidential candidate said in a recent interview.""I don't like the idea because I want to keep the lands great, and you don't know what the state is going to do,"" Trump said during a talk with Field & Stream magazine earlier this week.The trade publication, sitting down with Trump at Las Vegas' Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show, had asked about the issue of turning over federally controlled lands to individual states  an idea previously floated by rival 2016 contender and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and supported by staunch states-rights activists.QUESTION: There's a lot of discussion about the federal government transferring those lands to states, divesting of that land. Is that something you would support as president?TRUMP: I don't like the idea because I want to keep the lands. I don't know what the states are going to do with them.Politifact rated Cruz's statement, ""Trump 'wants to keep big government in charge' of federally-owned land,"" as Mostly True, citing only a small issue with the use of the word ""big."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 15, 2016",Press Release - Cruz Campaign: Rubio Can't Handle the Truth,"HOUSTON, Texas After spending most of the campaign unable to explain his record of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants, Marco Rubio has now simply resorted to calling anyone a ""liar"" who points out the truth. Today, the Cruz campaign responded to Rubio's repeated charges that Cruz ""lied.""""Apparently, Marco Rubio can't handle the truth,"" said Communications Director Rick Tyler. ""But the record is crystal clear and every word Ted Cruz said at the debate about Rubio's record is absolutely true.""At the South Carolina Debate, Ted Cruz correctly pointed out that Marco Rubio supported amnesty, in-state tuition for illegals, and refusing to end Obama's executive amnesty immediately:CRUZ:You know, the lines are very, very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that. But I would note not only that, Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office. I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.Rubio responded that these and other accusations were lies:RUBIO:Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies...He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He's lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.But here are the facts.FACT: Marco Rubio Told Univision He Would Not End Obama's Executive Amnesty on Day OneRUBIO: ""DACA...applies to young people that arrived in this country at a very young age before they were adults and I don't think we can immediately revoke that...I'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away.""FACT: Marco Rubio Supported In-State Tuition for Illegals...Twice.Rubio twice co-sponsored legislation granting in-state tuition to illegal-aliens. (2003 HB 119, 2004 HB 119)DAILY BEAST: ""[B]ack in 2003 and 2004, he was even more generous to undocumented immigrants. Rubio and Rivera co-sponsored legislation that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition in community colleges and state universities. Those who resided in the state and attended a Florida high school for three years prior to graduation would be able to pay in-state tuition, the legislation proposed, if the student pledged to file an application to be a U.S. permanent resident as soon as he or she is able to do so.""Legislative Analysis of HB 119.FACT: When Conservatives In The Senate Were Trying To Defund Planned Parenthood, Marco Rubio Did Not Show Up For The Vote...Twice.POLITICO: Rubio avoids Cruz's Planned Parenthood-shutdown push""Many of the Republican candidates on the debate stage Wednesday night joined in a full-throated endorsement of Ted Cruz's damn-the-torpedoes strategy to defund Planned Parenthood, even if it means shutting down the federal government.""But two candidates who'll soon be casting votes on the matter were noticeably silent: Sens. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul...""When it comes to the premier congressional debate over the next two weeks, Rubio (R-Fla.) and Paul (R-Ky.) are in danger of being overshadowed by the bawdy Cruz. The Texas senator making a direct play for tea party voters is all-in: Do whatever it takes to deny Planned Parenthood its federal funding, including shuttering the government if necessary.""Votes:2015 September Cloture vote on Continuing Resolution funding Planned ParenthoodRubio (R-FL): Did Not Show UpCruz (R-TX), Nay2015 September vote on final passage of Continuing Resolution funding Planned ParenthoodRubio (R-FL): Did Not Show UpCruz (R-TX), NayInstead Marco Rubio voted for a drive-by ""show vote"" that had no hope of becoming law and gave up the leverage Republicans had to actually defund Planned Parenthood.WASHINGTON POST: ""The Senate voted, 52 to 47, on Thursday night to repeal large portions of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.The repeal was wrapped inside a budget reconciliation bill that needed a simple majority of 51 senators to make good on a longstandingpromise to voters that a GOP-led Congress would eliminate large portions of Obamacare... The reconciliation bill is under a veto threat from President Obama and isnot likely to become law anytime soon.""FACT: While Conservatives Were Promising to Fight for Traditional Marriage, Marco Rubio Said Americans ""Must Abide"" By the Gay-Marriage Supreme Court DecisionFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio wrote, ""While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.""This prompted theNational Organization for Marriage to say it could not support Rubio for President:""We need bold leadership from the next President to fight back against an imperial judiciary,"" [NOM President Brian] Brown said in an email to Breitbart News. ""Senator Rubio is merely giving lip service when he says he supports traditional marriage...Rubio and Bush, on the other hand, are simply caving. Period.

PLEASANT, SC Today, Ted Cruzannounced a major policy proposal to rebuild America's militaryafter seven years of President Obama's failed stewardship of the country's armed forces. Highlights of media coverage are below:.@tedcruz aboard the USS Yorktown on his guiding military philosophy: ""more tooth, less tail."" pic.twitter.com/ZAyOaGI1W1 Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) February 16, 2016ABC News:Cruz Offers Plan to Rebuild the MilitaryAboard a decommissioned World War II-era battleship here, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz unveiled a sweeping plan to rebuild the U.S. armed forces, arguing that the military ""has fallen to the bottom"" of President Obama's priority list.""If there is a silver lining in the Obama-Clinton foreign policy debacle, it is that now we know what a world without America would start to look like,"" the Texas senator said. ""Far more dangerous and beholden to terrorists and criminal regimes.""Less than a week before the South Carolina primary, the Texas senator offered his ideas for expanding the size of the military, in both equipment and personnel, bolstering bases, updating technology and improving services for veterans. His guiding principle, he said, would be simple: ""more tooth, less tail.""""Starting next year our sailors won't be on their knees with their hands on their heads,"" Cruz said referring to the U.S. sailors who were held in Iranian custody after their ship entered that country's waters. ""Our secretary of state will not be apologizing and thanking their Iranian captors. Instead, they will be standing on the decks of the mightiest ships the world has ever known with their heads held high, confident that the great country that they volunteered to serve has their back.""Aboard the Yorktown to unveil my plan to rebuild our militaryone of the most serious tasks facing our next POTUS pic.twitter.com/O5gRnYoSQK Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 16, 2016Washington Examiner:Cruz invokes Reagan in call to strengthen militaryTexas Sen. Ted Cruz invoked President Reagan's foreign policy and took a subtle shot at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during a speech in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Tuesday.""It is clear now more than ever that far from being the hectoring menace to multiculturalism that Mr. Obama set out to humble, the United States is an indispensable force for global order and stability,"" Cruz said. ""And now after seven years of neglect it is time for America once again to prioritize its strong, advanced and robust military.""I am confident that if we put in the hard work, we can, as Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s, rebuild our military so that it will be feared by our enemies and trusted by our allies.""Unlike his routine stump speeches throughout early nominating states where Cruz roams the stage speaking without notes, the senator stood behind a podium and read his remarks aloud. He also stood with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a veteran and former 2016 presidential candidate who endorsed Cruz's campaign aboard the USS Yorktown.Dallas Morning News:In S.C., Ted Cruz turns his focus to the militarySpeaking aboard the USS Yorktown, Cruz promised more troops, more planes and more ships. He pledged to fix the VA. He said he would end the ""political correctness"" and ""social experiments"" that he says have run amok in the military.And touting the effort as ""one of the most serious tasks facing our next commander-in-chief,"" Cruz said the process ""should not be an indiscriminate exercise in re-inflating the tire.""""It will require serious thought and planning,"" he said. ""Our goal should not be simply to pour back into the Defense Department the vast sums that President Obama has so irresponsibly drained out. But rather to seize this opportunity to make generational investment...""But Cruz's speech was enough on Tuesday to lock up the support of 63-year-old Chris Meredith, who had long leaned toward Marco Rubio.""The military is close to my heart,"" said Meredith, a Johns Island resident whose late husband was a Navy veteran. ""And so this just really spoke to me today."".@tedcruz at USS Yorktown in #SC delivering a strong vision for the #USMilitary #CruzToVictory #CruzCrew #Cruz2016 pic.twitter.com/CZ6jwnFR7x bruce redden (@brucereddenjr) February 16, 2016Associated Press:Cruz proposes plan to bolster U.S. militaryTexas Sen. Ted Cruz is laying out his proposal for bolstering the U.S. military, in a state with a large military and veteran population.Cruz, in South Carolina Tuesday, detailed his military platform inside the U.S.S. Yorktown, a World War II-era aircraft carrier.Cruz called for increasing the number of active duty troops, airplanes and battleships. He did not put a price tag on his plans, but pointed to former President Reagan's approach as a model for how he would get it done.Cruz said he will pay for it by cutting federal spending by at least $500 billion, sell federal assets and properties and also audit the Pentagon to find savings.Politico:Ted Cruz pitches military buildup: 'More tooth, less tail'In a sign of the speech's seriousness and importance, Cruz, who prefers to speak extemporaneously, stood at a lectern in a blue suit and tie and spoke from notes, with American flags and war planes behind him, aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown.For much of the 2016 race, Cruz has sought a middle ground between the Republican Party's most hawkish wing, represented by Marco Rubio, and its libertarian wing, represented by Rand Paul. But ahead of the vote in South Carolina, where Cruz noted there are 400,000 veterans, he more forcefully aligned with the hawks.""The world needs a strong America, and America must be strong if we are going to protect our great nation and the freedoms that we hold so dear,"" Cruz said. ""It is clear now more than ever that far from being the hectoring menace to multiculturalism that Mr. Obama set out to humble, the United States is an indispensable force for global order and stability.""On USS Yorktown w/Apollo-era capsule nearby @tedcruz ""We are not going to draft American women into military combat"" pic.twitter.com/JQ1gWYqEv3 Major Garrett (@MajorCBS) February 16, 2016Washington Post:Ted Cruz looks to project military strength in South CarolinaThe senator has said the military shouldn't be a ""caludron for social experiments,"" including allowing transgendered soldiers to serve. Cruz saidTuesdaythat he would review a request by the Marine Corps to be exempt from military policy allowing women to serve in combat roles and would not allow women to register for the draft, should one be reinstated.""Combat is death, honor and chaos,"" Cruz said. ""The last thing any commander should need to worry about is the grades he is getting from some plush-bottomed Pentagon bureaucrat for political correctness or social experiments  or providing gluten-free MREs.""InTuesday'sspeech, as well as a foreign policy address in December, Cruz is seeking to draw a clear line between himself and Rubio, whose foreign policy platform is much more interventionist.""We will not go picking fights around the globe,"" Cruz said here.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 17, 2016","Press Release - Cruz for President Responds to Trump Campaign Demand to Pull TV Ad ""Supreme Trust""","Will air ""Supreme Trust"" with greater frequencyHOUSTON, Texas Today at a press conference, presidential candidate Ted Cruz responded to a 'cease and desist' letter dated February 16, 2016 from Jeffrey Goldman, an attorney representing Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. The letter demanded that the Cruz campaign immediately stop running a campaign ad entitled ""Supreme Trust"" featuring Donald Trump currently running in South Carolina in advance of the state's Republican Party primary on Saturday. The letter was addressed to Ted Cruz, Chad Sweet, the campaign's chairman and Jeff Roe, the campaign manger.The recent death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia left a vacancy on the nation's highest court. Ted Cruz called on the Senate not to confirm any nominees from President Obama but instead to await the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, allowing the voters to have a say in what kind of Justice would replace Scalia who was a constitutional conservative. The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged that he would not allow the Senate to confirm an Obama nominee, effectively allowing the next administration to make the nomination.The30-second spotmakes the case for how consequential electing the right candidate for the White House, is because the next president will fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and as many as four vacancies over his term. Those appointments will set the ideological direction of the Court for a generation by nominating constitutional conservatives or liberal activists Justices.The ad begins with the words: ""Life, Marriage, Religious Liberty, the Second Amendment. We're just one Supreme Court Justice away from losing them all."" The ad continues with Donald Trump in his own words including Mr. Trump answering a question by the late Tim Russert about whether he would ban the controversial abortion procedure known as partial-birth abortion where a late-term unborn child's life is taken just prior to birth. Mr. Trump, who was flirting with running as a Reform Party candidate at the time, answers the question by saying that he is ""very pro-choice"". When asked directly if he would ban the procedure, twice Mr. Trump says, ""no"" then goes on to say that he is ""pro-choice in every respect.""The ad's announcers says, ""We cannot trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions.""The Goldman letter sent to the Cruz campaign insists that the ad stop running because the Trump campaign is claiming that the ad is defamatory and meets the definition of a libelous statement.The Cruz campaign disagrees. A letter sent to Mr. Goldman in response says the ad is not an attempt to mislead the public. The objective of the ad is precisely the opposite  to provide the voters of South Carolina with important and accurate information so that they can make an informed decision when they go to the polls.The Cruz letter goes on to say that every statement in the ad concerning Mr. Trump's pro-abortion views comes from Mr. Trump's own mouth.According to the Cruz campaign, the point of the ad is that they do not believe Mr. Trump's recent campaign claim that he is pro-life and, more importantly, the voters should not believe Mr. Trump either.""Mr. Trump's implausible claim that he is pro-life doesn't meet a reality test,"" said Rick Tyler, a campaign spokesman. ""His words and actions simply cannot be reconciled. Mr. Trump last week said that Planned Parenthood does do wonderful things, but supporting Planned Parenthood is incompatible with holding the pro-life position Mr. Trump is now claiming.""Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider and was caught in a ""baby-parts selling"" scandal last year.Moreover, the Cruz campaign pointed to Mr. Trump's history of generous political contributions to help elect pro-choice candidates to office, including Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Andrew Cuomo, Anthony Weiner and Rahm Emanuel.Tyler went on to say that there is ample and recent evidence casting grave doubt about the truthfulness of Mr. Trump's campaign claims that he is truly pro-life.Tyler questioned the Trump campaign's demand that the voters not be allowed to hear what Mr. Trump himself has said or know what Mr. Trump has done.The Cruz campaign said that based upon these facts it will not pull the the ad because it is accurate and factual whether Mr. Trump and his army of lawyers agree or not.In fact, they now plan to air the ad with greater frequency."

Bridenstine penned an op-ed in National Review applauding Ted Cruz's strong military rebuild plan and setting the record straight in response to the Rubio campaign's false accusations. Ambassador John Bolton and GeneralMichael Flynn also applauded Ted Cruz's release yesterday of aReagan-style rebuild of our military. See the quotes of support and the op-ed below.""Senator Cruz has proposed a forceful defense spending program that is critical to repairing the damage done by the Obama Administration,""Ambassador John Boltonsaid.""I'm particularly impressed by Senator Cruz's continuing strong support for ramping up national missile defense to protect our innocent civilians from the likes of Iran and North Korea.""""Senator Cruz understands the days of 'business as usual' at the Department of Defense are at an end,"" commendedGeneralMichael Flynn. ""The DoD needs some new energy and ideas, from the bottom to the top.Senator Cruz's 'More Tooth, Less TailDefense for America' approach offers a new vision for our nation's defense needs by applying smart, innovative, and highly capable 21st Century tools and rules offering the United States an opportunity to maintain, sustain, and improve our leadership role around the world.""See excerpts of Rep. Bridenstine's op-ed below and read the full piecehere.Ted Cruz's True Record on Military Funding and National Security Is UnassailableNational ReviewAsa military pilot and veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, I am proud that this week Ted Cruz showed us again why he is the candidate best qualified to be commander-in-chief.Yesterday he laid out a serious, detailed plan for a Reagan-style rebuild of our military that will enable us to utterly defeat the radical Islamic terrorists who have vowed to destroy us. Senator Cruz understands that the essence of ""peace through strength"" is having the strength to maintain peace, and he's ready to do this hard work. I am proud to have endorsed him and will be proud to serve under him.Ted Cruz has proven to be a leader who is not afraid to stand up to bullies. He is true to his word. As a combat veteran, I am convinced Ted Cruz is the leader who will keep us safe, support our troops, and defend our nation.Although Marco Rubio haspromisednot to ""badmouth other Republicans,"" he and his campaign are now spreading the falsehood that Cruz doesn't care about our troops and are wrongly smearing a good man. They should know better.The Rubio team has criticized Cruz for voting against National Defense Authorization Acts, suggesting that he's weak on defense. But Cruz had substantive objections to some of provisions in the acts, not to their funding levels. In legislation, sometimes you have to vote no to get to a better yes. You do that because you care about the troops and the Constitution they are sworn to defend.He slams Cruz's principled stand, but Rubiodidn'teven show up to vote onfinal passageof the NDAA in October 2015. The next month, he skipped as well the defense-appropriationvotethat actually funds the military.Cruz was there to do his joband voted to fund our troops. Moreover, in March 2015 he voted for Rubio'sown amendment that would have raised the defense budget from $620 to $697 billion for fiscal year 2016.....Under Cruz, we can be assured that we have the strongest military in the world. To suggest otherwise doesn't match the record or the character of my friend and colleague Ted Cruz.Americans' real concern should be with Rubio's candidacy. He'smade deals withDemocrats at great cost to our national security. As a member of the Gang of Eight, not only did he support massive amnesty while failing to secure the border,but he also supported giving the president unilateral authority to admit more refugees who have not been properly vetted.And he's stood by that dangerous proposition.SenatorCruz andother leaders in the Senate have introduced legislation to ban the entry ofnot-properly-vettedrefugees from terrorist-ridden regions. Senator Rubio has chosen not to support the measure.Recall that Rubio sided with the Obama-Clinton foreign policy in Libya, whichwas anutter disaster.""It turned out fine,""Rubio said,just five months before four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were murdered in Benghazi.Voters should ask whether that is the same kind of judgment that Rubio would use in other areas, such as Syria.He has polished his campaign rhetoric, but when the pressure mounts,he has been quick to abandon conservative principles and slow to keep his promises to voters.We need a leader whom we can trust.We need a commander-in -chief who puts our national-security interests first. And we need a leader who will honor the Constitution and guide America into a secure and prosperous future. Ted Cruz will do just that."

Highlights of media coverage are below:Hot Air: Rubio bails on Conservative Review convention.Look, I get that nobody likes to face a potentially critical audience when they could be talking to supporters and cheerleaders instead, but running for President is hard. It's supposed to be hard. And if you do manage to land the job, you're going to be leading a lot of people who may frequently disagree with or even disparage you. Facing down an audience which may initially be favoring one of your opponents and winning some of them over with your message and presentation is is the hallmark of a winner. If Marco Rubio just walked away from a high profile commitment he'd made for an event of this size because he couldn't take the heat, that's probably not the sort of signal you wanted to send 48 hours before the polls close.Twitchy's recap of the Rubio No-ShowBreitbart: Marco Rubio Cancels Conservative Review Event Appearance Five Minutes Before His SpeechA Conservative Review spokeswoman told Breitbart News that Rubio was scheduled to speak at 8 p.m. and sent former Louisiana Gov.

Gowdy was supposed to introduce him.Moments before he was set to take the stage, the spokeswoman said, Rubio's team informed the Conservative Review team he would be late.

""This isn't about surrogates speaking. Are they running for President of the United States? This is about the candidate speaking. So my position was that if the conservative convention isn't good enough for Marco Rubio, it isn't good enough for his surrogates.""The decision was consistent with the policy that had imposed on other candidates, said Gaston Mooney, the executive editor of Conservative Review. Jeb Bush had previously asked to send surrogates, he said, and organizers had told him they would not permit surrogates to speak in his place. ""This is a conservative convention.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 19, 2016",Press Release - Congressman Mark Sanford Endorses Ted Cruz for President,"CHARLESTON, S.C.  Today, Congressman Mark Sanford announced his endorsement of Ted Cruz for President at a rally in Charleston, S.C. Sanford represents the First District of South Carolina and was sworn-in as a member of the 113th Congress after winning a special election in May of 2013. Prior to serving as Congressman, Sanford was the Governor of South Carolina from 2003  2011. During his tenure as governor he made South Carolina a top destination for entrepreneurs and business development, which led to $24 billion in capital investment  more in his governorship than during any other administration in South Carolina's history. Sanford has a proven record as a consistent and principled conservative fighter for smaller government, working to eliminate wasteful spending and tackling our nation's debt crisis.At today's rally, Sanford said, ""The Constitution matters and too much of what we've seen in this race...just struck me that it's gotten out of balance. When you have folks criticizing this guy for what he said on spending, when you have folks saying it doesn't matter what the Constitution says  it matters what I think. The beauty of the Constitution is that it matters not what one of us thinks, it matters what the Constitution prescribes. And it's my strong belief, that if you won't say it in Iowa, you're not saying it in Washington. What struck me about Ted is the fact that he'd come out against those ethanol subsidies  I've fought against spending my entire time in politics  and all too few people will. Look at this room full of folks, these are fighters right here. We need another fighter in Washington in the Oval Office on that very front.""""Mark is a proven fighter for liberty who has a long record of standing up and fighting for conservative principles,"" said Cruz. ""Throughout his time as a public servant, Mark has been a clarion call for the need to address our long-term unfunded liabilities at both the federal and state levels. As a result, Mark is consistently rated one of the most conservative members of the South Carolina congressional delegation and called a Taxpayer Hero by Citizens Against Government Waste. He's been a staunch defender of the Constitution and has worked to restore the balance of power from Washington, D.C. back to the American people. I am thrilled to have his support for our campaign and look forward to working together to continue uniting conservatives."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 19, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Rep. Jack Kingston: Marco Rubio's Tough National Security Talk is Cheap,"HOUSTON, Texas Congressman Jack Kingston today penned the following op-ed in RedState setting the record straight on Rubio's weak national security record.See excerpts below and read the full piecehere.Rep. Jack Kingston  Marco Rubio's Tough National Security Talk is CheapOn the campaign trail, Senator Marco Rubio has been pushing a media narrative that he is the most ""serious"" foreign policy candidate. It's an odd position since he missed all but one of the 19 votes connected to the National Defense Authorization Act last year! But far more damaging than his missed votes is his inability to learn from our past national security mistakes. Whether it's Libya, border security, or major security gaps in our visa and refugee programs, when he has voted, it's often on the side of misplaced liberal ideals and illegal immigrants instead of America's safety.One disturbing example is Rubio's support for the Obama-Clinton intervention in Libya in 2011. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I traveled to Sigonella Navy base to meet with our military commanders who were conducting our military intervention. Our briefings were shocking. It was clear we had no end game or definition of success. That is to say the decisions and confused strategy was the product of Obama's misunderstanding of the middle east. Yet in a speech at the Brookings Institution in 2012, after complaining that Republicans were so bad on foreign policy that he was forced to work on his policies with Democrats, Senator Rubio said the Libya regime change ""turned out fine."" Senator Rubio had been in the Senate for two years at the time, and should have had some understanding of the conditions on the ground. In fact, our people were already being attacked in the region. In a month, Ambassador Chris Stevens would be pleading with Secretary Clinton for more security. And in less than five months, Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans would stop complaining  because they were killed in the utter disaster that was the radical Islamic terrorist attack on Benghazi.Even today, Senator Rubio refuses to learn the lesson of Libya. For most Americans, the situation in Iraq and Syriaas Benghazi tragically showed usis proof that the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our friends. The result of not properly scrutinizing such movements is often more chaos, and the death toll, like our enemies, often multiplies. Just ask the ISIS brigades rolling around in our tanks and Humveesand read about their victims.....And while fighting both sides of a civil war is bad enough, these mistakes are doubly harmful when we don't carefully watch who is coming into our own country.Too often, immigration is considered a solely domestic issue. But border security is the first and necessary step to securing our nation against the jihadists who are not content to kill each other abroadthey want to kill Americans here at home. And when politicians insist on intervening around the world while voting to grant amnesty, expand refugee admittance  all the while not securing the border  we get the worst of both worlds: thousands of people coming to America from war-torn countries, and no system to tell the innocent from the terrorists. This why a major campaign issue has become the Rubio-Schumer Gang of 8 amnesty bill which prioritizes illegals over the safety of Americans. This isn't a new problem  we need look no further than the evil perpetrators of 9/11. The lesson should have been learned more than a decade ago.Even as Europe reaped the bloody consequences of a borderless welcome-mat policy that led to the Paris atrocity, Sen. Rubio refused to stop the flood of un-vetted Syrian refugees. When Senators like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul called to stop waving in thousands from Syria and other countries with murderous jihadist movements, Rubio did not join them.Our nation's worst foreign policy failures were created by good intentions along with the inability to learn from the past. These are dangerous uncertain times. We cannot risk electing another President who doesn't understand the threats. The next President must do everything he can to put America first and politically correct diplomacy last. Our future and survival is at stake."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 22, 2016",Press Release - MEMO: Ted Cruz is the Only Candidate Who Can Defeat Trump,"If Rubio can't win with all of the advantages and money in South Carolina, where can he win?HOUSTON, Texas Jason Johnson, Chief Strategist for Cruz for President, prepared the following memo explaining why Ted Cruz is the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump:TO:INTERESTED PARTIESFROM:JASON JOHNSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, CRUZ FOR PRESIDENTSUBJECT:TED CRUZ IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO CAN DEFEAT TRUMPDATE:FEBRUARY 22, 2016Three states into the Republican nominating process, the field has narrowed from seventeen to five candidates. And of the five candidates remaining, only three are viable: Cruz, Trump and Rubio.Marco Rubio cannot beat Trump.Trump can't be beaten from the political Left,with a candidate who emphatically supports amnesty and who allows Trump to be considered the ""conservative"" in that context.Rubio has yet to win a primary state. On This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Senator Rubio was asked simply, ""what state can you win?"" Rubio replied, Florida on March 15.Rubio's stated strategy is to lose the first four primary states, lose every state on Super Tuesday, then lose every state on March 5, then lose every state on March 8, and then finally win in Florida(where he's currently polling third, behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz).By March 15, 26 states or territories will have voted, and Rubio does not plan to win any of them. Almost 50% of the delegates will have already been allocated; Rubio will win almost none, and then he'll hope for resurrection in Florida. That's an even less plausible path to victory than Mayor Rudy Giuliani's ""wait for Florida"" strategy in 2008.Rubio might argue that Bush leaving the race gives him both votes and resources. But Rubio and his allies spent tens of millions in the first three states, with disappointing results. And the small percentage of voters supporting Bush would not significantly change the dynamic of the race even if they all moved to Rubiowhich they won't.Rubio is popular in the donor community and the DC lobbyist community, but there is no evidence that money is Rubio's problem.Rubio and his allies have already spent over $75 million with limited results. He has not won a single state.In contrast, Cruz and his allies have spent $15 million less, and despite being outspent, Cruz beat Rubio two out of three times winning first in Iowa (where Rubio was 3rd) and then finishing a strong third in New Hampshire (where Rubio was 5th), before effectively tying Rubio in South Carolina.Even with a massive large-donor advantage, Rubio is seriously behind in fundraising. As of December 31st, Cruz had nearly as much money in the bank as Rubio, Bush, Christie, and Kasichcombined.In South Carolina, Rubio's team repeatedly promised a win. Their proclaimed strategy was ""3-2-1"" with 3rdin Iowa, 2ndin New Hampshire and 1stin South Carolina. Everything lined up in their favor. Much of their senior team is from South Carolina and has run South Carolina campaigns for decades. They ran millions of dollars in ads attacking Cruz. Rubio was endorsed by South Carolina's very popular governor, senator, and congressman and yet, with the full support of the South Carolina establishment, he still couldn't win, losing to Trump by ten points.If Rubio can't win with all of the advantages and money in South Carolina, where can he win?Cruz has beaten and can beat Trump.Cruz is the only candidate that has beatenand can beatTrump. Historically, no candidate that failed to win oneof the firstthree states has ever won the nomination. This cycle, only two people have won an early state: Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.In contrast to Rubio, Cruz has already delivered on his promise to energize Evangelicals andconservatives. The results from the first three states show that only Cruz can compete with Trump for the Republican base, but can also reunite the members of the Reagan Coalition that are critical winning the nomination and the general election.And Cruz wins not just with the winning Republican base of the past, he is also winning with the young voters who will power the Party in the future.Head to head, Cruz beats Trump by 16 points: 56% to 40%.And in the general, Cruz consistently beats Hillary; while Trump consistently loses to Hillary.Cruz can beat Trump for the nomination and can put a Republican in the White House. Rubio has no realistic path to the nomination, and Trump has a very difficult path to general election success.Republican Base VoteRubio does well with moderates. But moderates are only 22% of the Republican primary vote nationwide. To win, to beat Trump, a candidate must do well with the Republican base.Rubio is consistently third with conservatives, very conservatives, and Evangelicals. Cruz and Trump are battling neck and neck for these key groups, which together comprise over two-thirds of the Republican primary vote.Ted Cruz is substantially outperforming Rubio, and in many cases beating Trump, for the Republican base vote. The core of the party is with Cruz and may not be with Rubio head-to-head against Trump.The battle for conservative voters is clearly between Cruz and Trump, with Cruz winning one state and Trump edging out Cruz in the other two; Rubio lags behind in all three.Among very conservative voters (54% nationwide), Cruz has beaten Trump twice, in South Carolina and Iowa. Rubio, in all three states, is again lagging far behind.And Evangelicals are clearly energized by both Cruz and Trump; with Trump edging out Cruz in South Carolina and New Hampshire and Cruz beating Trump in Iowa. Rubio remains consistently in third.Reagan CoalitionRubio does well with wealthy voters. But without the working-class Reagan Democrats, Republicans cannot win the general. And Ted Cruz competes much better against Trump among the blue-collar voters who were critical to the Reagan coalition in 1980 and 1984, and who largely sat out the 2012 election, than does Marco Rubio.Cruz has been second among voters with a high school diploma or less in all three states so far and has been as much as eleven points ahead of Rubio among these voters.Cruz also substantially outperforms Rubio and nearly beat Trump in South Carolina among voters who make less than $50k per year.Young VotersThe future of the party isn't just re-invigorating the Reagan coalition, it is also reaching out to younger voters. While Rubio claims to be the agent of generational change, the data show it is actually Ted Cruz who has won the youth vote in two of the three elections thus far (Iowa and South Carolina) and he came in second with these voters in New Hampshire.Cruz has now beaten Rubio with young voters in three very different states, three times in a row.New Voters ComparisonThere has been record turnout in each of the first three states: 186,874 in Iowa (121,503 in 2012); 284,120 in New Hampshire (248,485 in 2012); and 737,917 in South Carolina (601,166).While some of these voters are undoubtedly Trump voters, there is also a lot of evidence that Ted Cruz is delivering on his promise to energize and engage more conservatives and evangelicals and expand the base of the party.Evangelical participation in the primary process has grown substantially with record-setting participation in South Carolina and growth in Iowa as well. Enhanced Evangelical turnout will be critical to winning the general election in November.The fraction of the vote made up of conservatives has grown in each of the early states.Very conservatives have also been a larger portion of the vote in two of the three states so far.And that energized turnout, among conservatives, very conservatives, Evangelicals, and Reagan Democrats is the only way for Republicans to prevail in the general election in 2016."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 23, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Nevada AG Laxalt: Cruz will fight overreach by courts, federal agencies","HOUSTON, Texas Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt today penned the following op-ed in theReno Gazette-Journal.Read excerpts below and see the full op-edhere.As the attorney general of Nevada, I know firsthand the dangers of a lawless president who oversteps the states' authority and the people's rights. Whereas President Obama has seized every opportunity to usurp Americans' freedoms, a President Cruz will work daily to protect and preserve every constitutional liberty.I have been proud to fight along Senator Cruz in several of the greatest threats to our liberties.When it comes to the First Amendment, we have never before witnessed such a concerted effort to tear down our freedom to live our faith. Ted Cruz has fought to protect religious liberty for decades. He has successfully won historic decisions before the Supreme Court including defending ""under God"" in the pledge of allegiance, ensuring the Ten Commandments monument remains on state capitol grounds, and keeping our crosses standing at the Mojave Desert Veterans' Memorial.In a few weeks, the Supreme Court will hear the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor  a group of Catholic nuns who are being sued by the Obama administration for living by the dictates of their faith. I am proud to stand with the Little Sisters of the Poor,I am grateful for Ted Cruz's tireless leadership to protect the rights of these women who have devoted their lives to caring for the elderly and I am proud to fight alongside him.....When Ted arrived in the Senate, he fought against Mr. Obama's gun legislation. But this wasn't a new fight for Ted. In 2008, he won the landmark Heller v. D.C. case to protect Americans' Second Amendment rights, and this case in particular should remain fresh on our minds as it is one of the greatest achievements of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who authored the opinion.The federal government has overreached its power in countless cases  and one agency that perhaps best personifies this job-crippling regulation is the Environmental Protection Agency. Here in Nevada, we work hard to take care of our land, and yet the EPA, through rules like the ""Waters of the U.S."" rule, stifle economic growth and overstep the rightful authority of the states. I have filed suit to overturn this unconstitutional law, but I know that with a Cruz administration, I wouldn't have to wait on any court decision  Ted Cruz will abolish rules across the federal agencies that are neither constitutional nor conducive to economic prosperity. And, as he has pledged, he will work to return federal land to Nevadans  rather than continuing to allow the federal government to own about 85 percent of the state.President Obama's executive amnesty is another example of his disregard for the states and for the rule of law. Nevada has stood with Texas and 24 other states to stop President Obama's lawless actions. Ted Cruz has led the fight against Obama's unconstitutional amnesty. As he's promised, on day one, he will rescind every unconstitutional and illegal executive order  and we can trust him at his word because he has never bowed down to Washington power brokers; he has stayed true to his word and the Constitution.And right nowthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights have never been more at risk. With the passing of Justice Scalia, we mourn our nation's loss, and it is all the more critical that we elect a president who we know beyond a shadow of a doubt will have the courage to elect principled judges who will abide by the Constitution instead of propping up political agendas.As a current attorney general and an Iraq War veteran, Ted Cruz is the leader I want in the White House because I know that he will always protect the Constitution and defend our nation. As a result, we will be infinitely more free to live in our communities, practice our faith, and achieve unprecedented prosperity."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 23, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Ken Cuccinelli: What Do Donald Trump and Marco Rubio Have in Common?,"HOUSTON, Texas Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli penned the following op-ed in Conservative Review. See excerpts below andread the full op-ed here.Conservative ReviewWhat Do Donald Trump and Marco Rubio Have in Common?Ken CuccinelliAt first, you'd think very little. One is a crony capitalist who has added conservative vocab words to his big government nationalist rhetoric; the other is a senator who came to power as part of the Tea Party wave, but chose to join the establishment upon his arrival in Washington. One wears the mantel of rage, the other purports to be an electable, ""nice"" conservative.But an unlikely alliance between two candidates has formed: both Trump and Rubio have joined forces in personal attacks on Ted Cruz's character.The voters have clearly framed the race in terms of who can best stand up to the Washington Cartel  a term that rightly describes how our political system has been rigged in favor of the politically correct and connected, but contrary to the Constitution. Because the record shows Trump and Rubio have both worked with, not against, the political corruption in both parties, any distinctions either could draw with Senator Cruz on policy wouldn't help them with the primary electorate. This leaves one dangerously desperate weapon at their disposal: character attacks.Bizarrely, Trump has threatened to sue Cruz over advertising that shows Trump's own public words supporting partial birth abortion, his sister, a Clinton-appointed judge who struck down New Jersey's partial birth abortion bill as irrational who Trump has spoken of as a good judge, and Trump's massive monetary contributions to Democrats.....Trump thus resorts to name-calling: ""nasty,"" ""unlikable,"" ""unhinged"" and ""dishonest,"" he hurls at Cruz, all while threatening to use his inherited wealth to bully and sue  just as he has his entire life.For Rubio's part, he has taken to accusing Ted Cruz of ""doing anything it takes to win,"" including lying. He has ceased even trying to engage Cruz on policy, let alone making an effort to correct the record about his support of the Gang of Eight bill, his statement following Obergefel that same-sex marriage was the law of the land, or his refusal to support Cruz's attempt to meaningfully strip funding from Planned Parenthood by sending Obama a budget without it.Like Trump, Rubio hurls insults; but he does not naturally wear the mantel of Trump-esque insult hurling.....While Cruz was fighting against the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight immigration bill, including with amendments that would eliminate citizenship-granting provisions, Rubio was a sponsor of the bill. Now Rubio refuses to list that bill  which passed the Senate with a few Republicans and overwhelming support from Democrats  among his sparse list of accomplishments.....But both the media and other Republican leaders have refused to ref the two-on-one hit job on Cruz's character. That's because ultimately, it is the Washington Cartel that has been and remains willing to use any tactic to protect its power. Cruz represents the most successful, well-organized, well-funded, inspiring, disciplined, and savvy assault on its power since the Reagan revolution, and so they step back and wash their hands because they know Ted Cruz is the greatest threat to the Washington status quo they've ever faced.But they step back in fear. Every time they see 5,000 conservative activists gather to listen to Cruz and cheer, they are afraid. The continued gathering of movement conservatives and liberty-minded Republicans to Ted Cruz is a mortal threat to both Trump and Rubio, and so they attack. But because they cannot go toe-to-toe with Ted on issues, they make personal attacks. It's the oldest trick in the book. This is what doing Washington's dirty work looks like folks, and we must overcome it for the sake of America."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 23, 2016",Press Release - Cruz Campaign Thanks NV GOP for Reaffirming Fair Caucus Protocol,"Response to Trump Campaign's outrageous accusationsHOUSTON, Texas In response to the outrageous claims made by Donald J. Trump for President's counsel regarding Nevada caucuses, the Cruz for President counsel sent a letter to the Nevada Republican Party Chairman echoing the statements of the Nevada Secretary of State and the Nevada GOP refuting Trump's accusations.See the full letterhereand excerpts below.""We note the affirmations of both the Nevada Republican Party and the Nevada Secretary of State late today of our position and understanding of the law,"" said Cruz Counsel Chris Gober. ""The Nevada Republican Party, for example, affirmed that 'members of the general public may observe the caucusing process and encourages any individual who observes any suspicious conduct to immediately notify precinct and/or party leaders,' but that 'no member of the general public shall be permitted to photograph, film or otherwise record the caucusing process...' Indeed, this was precisely the spirit of our note to supporters, and we will instruct them accordingly.""The letter continues, ""As to the misleading allegations leveled by Mr. Trump's counsel, the Cruz campaign was simply urging its supporters to do nothing more than observe, report, and document, if possible, questionable behavior at caucus sites. Rather than welcoming such vigilance, especially in light of the history of the Nevada caucuses, Mr. Trump has instead chosen to tout an Obama Administration dictate issued on the eve of the 2012 election. No doubt, the authors of this order are the same group of leftist lawyers in Obama's Justice Department who dismissed intimidation charges against the pro?Obama New Black Panther Party members accused of threatening voters and the same lawyers who have been fighting common?sense voter identification rules. Counsel's reliance on the Obama Administration's so?called voter protection mandates to level an underhanded political attack is a telling indication of how low Mr. Trump is willing to sink to make baseless allegations in exchange for headlines.""See the Nevada Secretary of State and Nevada GOP statements below:NV Secretary of State: ""NRS 293.274 prohibits photographing, filming or otherwise recording of any kind by the general public at polling places, however this statute does not apply to caucus sites. The political parties have established their own rules and procedures regarding the caucuses and if there are any questions they should be directed to the administering political party.""NV GOP: ""However, once the caucusing process has been completed and ballots have been cast, we would encourage anyone to who sees any suspicious activity to document and immediately report such activity to the precinct and/or party leaders."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 23, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Rep. Justin Amash: Why I Trust Ted Cruz,"HOUSTON, Texas Congressman Justin Amash (R-MI) today announced his endorsement of Ted Cruz for President in an op-ed published inIJ Review. See excerpts below and the full piecehere.Why I Trust Ted CruzRep. Justin AmashAs a libertarian Republican, I have spent several months promoting the candidacy of my friend Senator Rand Paul, who is, in my view, the most passionate defender of our rights on the national stage today. Since his departure from the presidential race, I've been asked many times: what now?It's easy to withdraw from politics when the positions and priorities of the candidates do not precisely mirror our own. But we owe it to our beliefs to find constitutional conservative political allies who not only respect our philosophy but also fight for our views to be heard.We have found such an ally in Senator Ted Cruz.Ted is not a libertarian and doesn't claim to be. But he is a principled defender of the Constitution, a brilliant strategist and debater who can defeat the Democratic nominee in the general election, and the only remaining candidate I trust to take on what he correctly calls the Washington Cartel.The recent passing of Justice Antonin Scalia reminds us of the importance of electing a president committed to nominating justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution and the Rule of Law. Because the Court has not lost a conservative in many years, this selection may become the most influential act of the next president. Replacing Justice Scalia with a poorly chosen justice could alter our country's identity on critical issues such as education, health care, criminal justice, privacy, and even the very meaning of the Constitution.In this regard, history has given us a uniquely qualified candidateTed Cruz served as a Supreme Court clerk (an extraordinarily selective job held each year by fewer than 40 lawyers who work directly with the justices to shape the Court's opinions) and has the rare distinction of having argued many cases before the Supreme Court. The importance of these credentials cannot be overstated in the current context.But the Supreme Court is not the only thing at stake. Our entire constitutional system is under threat.An effective president for the people is going to face massive fights with the lobbyist class and Washington elites. It is not enough for a president to have smart advisers and well-rehearsed lines. Whether or not we agree on every issue, libertarian and conservative Republicans must choose a president who has the courage to stand up for the American people in the face of relentless attacks. Ted has shown that he is a true leader who can defend the principles of our constitutional republic, takes libertarian ideas seriously (even when he disagrees), and will not back down from the battles that must be fought.....Take, for instance, Ted's opposition to cronyism and corporate welfare. Unlike his competitors, Ted understands that when we allow the government to pick winners and losers, the American people lose. He isn't afraid to challenge the rampant corruption in Washington, and he isn't afraid to champion economic freedom. Ted won the Iowa caucuses with a principled stand against subsidies, even though pundits warned that no one could win the state without pandering to the ethanol lobby.....Like me, Ted believes that the United States must be well defended and respected around the globe. He stands with our troops and will not put them in harm's way unless necessary to protect our country. Unlike some other Republican candidates, Ted opposed intervening in Libya and voted against arming Syrian rebels, and he will not use our Armed Forces to engage in nation building.To defend liberty, we must defend our Constitution. I'm supporting Ted because, knowing him personally and having served with him in Congress over the past few years, I trust him as a conservative ally who consistently listens to my perspective and stands firm for what he believes is right."

Dan Patrick: Why I Support Ted Cruz for President,"I can think of no person better suited than Ted Cruz to take the challenges of Obama's failures head on and restore constitutional government""HOUSTON, Texas Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick penned an op-ed inThe Dallas Morning Newsin support of Ted Cruz for President. See excerpts below and read the full op-edhere.The Dallas Morning NewsWhy I support Ted Cruz for presidentTX Lt. Gov. Dan PatrickRight now we are seeing an assault on our freedoms and our security. On the one hand, the Obama administration has come after our Bill of Rights  from his administration's assault on religious liberty to its effort to strip Americans of their Second Amendment right to bear arms and the concerted effort to replace state and local control with federal bureaucratic overreach.On the other hand, the Obama administration continues to compromise our safety by not only failing to secure the border but by creating policies that make the problem worse.....As lieutenant governor of Texas, I can think of no person better suited than Ted Cruz to take the challenges of Obama's failures head on and restore constitutional government.Texas has led the way against President Obama's reckless amnesty, and no presidential candidate has fought harder to end Obama's illegal actions that Senator Cruz. Since the Gang of Eight fight, Ted Cruz has led Congress and millions of conservatives to stop the Obama-Schumer-Rubio amnesty deal.....Ted Cruz, along with Reps. Jeff Sessions, Steve King, and other strong House conservatives, successfully stopped the Gang of Eight bill. We need a president who will have the same resolve not simply to stop bad legislation but also to implement the right reforms. Ted Cruz has adetailed immigration planto do just that. And he has the record and character demonstrating his political will to get the job done.Republicans cannot elect a candidate who stood with Democrats for amnesty for those who have entered our country illegally. Sen. Marco Rubio's record on immigration matches the failed platform of the Democrats. He has said he will not rescind DACA, he has supportedin-state tuition for illegal immigrants, and he double-downed on aflawed and dangerous approach to admitting refugees. He has refused to stand for the rule of law and American safety when the fight mattered most.A broken immigration system is the greatest threat to our safety here at home. We cannot elect a candidate who has consistently sided with illegal aliens over the American people and hasadmittedly failed to foresee dangers of unvetted immigrants and refugees. This need must be addressed, not simply since the San Bernardino attack but dating back to Sept. 11, 2001.Some have touted Donald Trump as the candidate who will be tough on immigration, but his record on that issue is inconsistent with his rhetoric. What's more, while Trump wants to build a wall, he's also said he would let lawbreakers come right back in through""touch-back""immigration  a proposal Democrats have favored.There is not an iota of evidence that Trump would actually follow up and secure our border. We cannot take such a chance on our nation's future.Ted Cruz has always put Americans' safety and freedom above political pressure. His entire career he has defended our Constitutional rights and protected Americans from a lawless government.....Ted Cruz had the clarity and courage to take on that case and others as he fought for our civil liberties and I have no doubt that same strength of character will guide his decisions from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

Greg AbbottWhen the next president of the United States solemnly swears to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, I can think of no one who will more faithfully fulfill that promise than Ted Cruz.For the first time in decades, Texans have the opportunity to play a powerful role in selecting our Republican nominee and the next president of this great nation.After eight years of relentless attacks on our values from the Obama administration, it's our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader we can trust to restore principled leadership and move this country forward.That's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for president.Conservative values are at his core. He's principled and fearless with unbending convictions.Unlike far too many in Washington, the Ted Cruz we've seen in the Senate is the same Ted Cruz we elected.And he's the same Ted Cruz I served with when I was Texas attorney general and Ted was my solicitor general.Ted worked with me in defending U.S. sovereignty against the United Nations and the World Court, defending our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, defending the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments Monument on the Texas Capitol grounds and defending the words ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance.And we won each time.With Ted Cruz as our Republican nominee for president, we will win again.America will win again.....Ted is a constitutionalist whose judgment I trust to appoint judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who will not legislate from the bench.As Ted has said in the recent weeks, not one but two branches of government hang in the balance. We need a leader who we know will have the perseverance to nominate Supreme Court justices who abide by the Constitution, uphold individuals' freedoms and halt the activist agenda of Washington elites.....He will take seriously his obligation to restore freedom, prosperity and security to our nation. He will secure our border. He will take the fight to ISIS. He will rein in the federal government and unleash our job creators and innovators.I know he will champion the top priorities for Texas and America.My fellow Texas conservatives, we need to deliver.This is our time. Ted Cruz is our candidate."

Super Tuesday, I believe, will be the most important day in this entire presidential election,"" Cruz said. ""It is possible that Donald Trump will steamroll through with massive victories and be unstoppable. I hope that does not happen. I think that is a very dangerous outcome...""Cruz, 46, has long been a strident critic of President Barack Obama and also has challenged fellow Republicans, accusing them of being too willing to negotiate with Democrats.When asked by Regent Chancellor Pat Robertson what he would do first if elected, Cruz promised to launch a criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood, claiming the nonprofit is protected ""by some political hack in the White House.""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 28, 2016",Press Release - Jewish Leaders Endorse Ted Cruz for President,"Cruz Welcomes Endorsements From More than Three-Dozen Jewish LeadersHOUSTON, Texas Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the formation of a Jewish leadership coalition featuring a diverse group of rabbis, business, and community leaders from around the country.""Since the day we announced our campaign, we have been honored to see tremendous support from the Jewish community."" Cruz said. ""I have been privileged to speak at synagogue services from New York to California to Florida, to celebrate Passover Seders with my friends in Texas, and to participate in events with Elie Wiesel and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach. My commitment to the nation of Israel and the Jewish people began long before my days as a senator or presidential candidate: it began with the experience my father had as a refugee fleeing oppression in Cuba to come to this country. As president, I will stand unapologetically with Israel, prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and cut off federal funding to any institution that adopts B.D.S. measures.""Last summer, Cruz brought together Jewish, evangelical, and conservative groups in an attempt to stop the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.Sarah Stern, President of the Endowment for Middle East Truth, said, ""I have worked with many congressional offices for many years, and there is no stronger advocate for Israel and the Jewish people than Ted. We have worked closely on bringing justice to victims of Iranian and Palestinian terror and stopping the Iranian nuclear deal. Speaking as an individual, I cannot wait to work with President Cruz and turn our country around.""Rabbi Zev Reichman, Rabbi in Englewood, NJ, and director at Yeshiva University said, ""Ted Cruz has impressed me with his deep respect for people of faith, his dedication to protecting the US homeland, and his unflinching support for America's greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel. A few months ago I had the privilege of spending time with Ted. He displayed a deep regard for daily Talmud study and Jewish religious practice. His respect for the beliefs of others is inspiring. I feel confident that President Cruz will defend religious liberty and preserve our First Amendment rights.""""America and the West face an existential threat to our way of life from radical Islamic terrorists,"" Reichman continued. ""Cruz has been a leader in identifying this threat and boldly taking action to protect American lives. Ted has demonstrated foresight, understanding, and good judgment. Most importantly, he has demonstrated time and again that he is a leader with integrity, strength, and courage. He has introduced legislation to prevent terrorists from coming to the US and to choke off their funding. Most significantly, when the Iran deal was coming to Congress for a vote he led the efforts to stop this catastrophic deal.""On October 6, 1943 hundreds of Rabbis marched in Washington pleading with elected officials to step in and address the dangers to Jews in Europe. President Roosevelt refused to meet with them. Their pleas for help fell on deaf ears. Millions of Jewish lives were lost.""The Iranian regime threatens to do in six minutes what Hitler did in six years. They openly declare their hope to wipe Israel off the map. The Iranian nuclear deal has awarded this hideous regime billions of dollars, international legitimacy, and hundreds of billions of dollars of future economic growth. On September 9, 2015, hundreds of Rabbis returned to Washington to plead with elected officials to step in and reject the Iranian nuclear deal. Ted Cruz stood with us and led at that moment. President Cruz will tear up the Iran deal on his first day in office. The stakes for America, the West, and the Israel have rarely been higher. I hope and pray that the Almighty will help Ted Cruz become the next President of the United States and leader of the free world.""This Jewish leadership coalition is in addition to a group of 25 Orthodox rabbis whoendorsed Senator Cruz in December of 2015.The following individuals are part of the leadership coalition:Ken Abramowitz, ConnecticutRaanan Agus, New YorkDr. Alan Berger, New JerseyDr. Marc Berger, New YorkDr. Ben Chouake, NORPAC President, New JerseyEdward Czuker, CaliforniaElissa Czuker, CaliforniaRabbi Pini Dunner, CaliforniaJoseph Frager, New YorkSaul Gamoran, WashingtonEli Gold, London Center for Policy Research, MarylandTodd Hanik, MarylandRabbi Shmully Hecht, Founder, Yale Shabtai Society, ConnecticutDavid Horwitz, New YorkBenjamin Klein, New JerseyBatya Klein, New JerseyMelissa Jane Kronfeld, New YorkHon.

This comes on the heels of Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, continuing a disturbing pattern.""The possibility that Trump doesn't believe a word he says, especially on critical issues like immigration and the border, is troubling,"" said Alice Stewart, Cruz Communications Director. ""His entire campaign is centered on expanding and enforcing our immigration laws, and now we find out it's possible he doesn't mean a word of it and is just using it for 'strategic purposes.' Trump should demand the New York Times release the tapes tonight before Republican voters go to the polls tomorrow.""If he doesn't, voters have to ask themselves, 'what is Donald Trump hiding?' It's a disturbing pattern. He won't release his tax returns. He won't confirm or deny he's donated to extreme left-wing organizations like Planned Parenthood. When he gets caught taking a different position, he lies. What's he hiding? Trump should immediately come clean with the voters about who he is, what he's done, what he really believes, and what's on those tapes."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Rep. Mo Brooks: Ted Cruz Has the Best Plan for Economic Growth,"HOUSTON, Texas Congressman Mo Brooks (R-AL) penned an op-ed in AL.com in support of Ted Cruz for President because he is the candidate who will unleash the most economic growth. See excerpts below and read thefull op-ed here.AL.comTed Cruz Has the Best Plan for Economic GrowthRep. Mo BrooksMany candidates have made their mark focusing on the Obama administration's past mistakes, and there are a lot of them. But now it's time to look to the future. As this campaign goes on, voters will begin to focus on who has the best plan for dramatic economic growth. It's clear that Ted Cruz's pro-growth policies are the best to increase employment and wages for Americans.....And the economy grows when the government stops overtaxing individuals and businesses, overregulating industry, and stops enabling foreign labor to take American jobs.Out of all the candidates, Ted Cruz solves every side of this problem.First of all, his tax plan would get rid of the IRS as we know it, eliminating carve-outs for politically favored corporations, and have regular Americans pay a flat 10 percent income tax you can work out on a single piece of paper. Corporations would pay 16 percent  a good deal better rate than now  and free them up to hire more workers.....The Cruz plan would grow the economy by almost 14 percent,create 4.9 million new jobs, and increase after-tax income by double digits for every income level, according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation. When you look at the dynamic benefits to the economy over the next ten years, it also has the best ""bang for the buck:"" for every dollar in reduced government revenue, there will be a$23 increase in GDP. This will be great for individuals and families in every economic bracket.In addition, an overhaul of executive branch agencies will have massive impact in eliminating expensive regulations, which were estimated by the Competitive Enterprise Institute to be $1.88 trillion in 2014 alone, while clearing out an ""alphabet soup"" of at least 25 wasteful programs.Getting rid of these programs will be a growth double-whammy: both saving tax dollars and preventing meddling bureaucrats from hampering economic activity, enabling job creators to do what they do best. The dollars and decisions at the eliminated agencies would go back to the states and the people, where they belong.Another key piece of the growth puzzle is immigration enforcement and reform. No initiative to help the middle class or create jobs is credible if it allows foreign workers to displace Americans from those same jobs. As it is, too many companies are sponsoring cheap labor to come from overseas, and forcing Americans to train their replacements on the way out the door.Securing the border and enforcing the laws already on the books will be first priority of the Cruz immigration plan. But in addition to strengthening and simplifying E-Verify, Cruz is ahead of the curve in demanding that the H1B visa program be suspended and audited, and that our entire legal immigration system be redesigned to first benefit America and her workers.Other candidates may have elements of Cruz's plan, but none of them have all of it. The fact is, you can't just talk big about walls and immigration while supporting big-government crony policies. And you can't pretend your tax plan helps the middle class if you're not serious about preserving their jobs from artificially low-priced foreign competition.Ted Cruz's proposals tackle every side of the growth problem: dramatically decreasing the tax rates, shrinking government, letting businesses thrive, and protecting American workers.When we repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, and implement a 10 percent flat taxwhile also freeing up American industries, giving education policy back to the states, and eliminating unfair competition, we'll enjoy a landscape where Americans can find and keep good jobs and prosper. That's the opportunity a Cruz administration offers."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 29, 2016",Press Release - Cruz for President Announces Formation of Religious Liberty Advisory Council,"Top Faith Leaders Continue to Rally with Cruz on Religious LibertyHOUSTON, Texas Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the creation of a 19-member Religious Liberty Advisory Council, which will guide his policies to protect religious liberty and reverse the unprecedented attacks on freedom both at home and abroad.""Religious liberty is the first freedom guaranteed to Americans under the Constitution, and ensuring the protection of that right has been a priority my entire adult life,"" said Cruz. ""Increasingly, renegade government officials seek to coerce people of faith either to act in a manner that violates their faith or forfeit their career. When I am elected President, that will change. It is time for our liberties to be respected in Washington. The right to religious liberty built America, and denying that right is both un-American and morally wrong.""""Religious liberty is the top issue for Americans of faith in this election,"" Cruz continued. ""People of faith must be free to live according to their convictions without being second-guessed or shut down by the federal government. Today I am proud to be joined by such a knowledgeable and committed group of leaders to advance our first freedom.""""I am honored to join Ted Cruz's Religious Liberty Advisory Council at such a critical time in the history of this nation,"" said Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council, who will serve as chair of the council. ""Never before has religious freedom been more endangered than it is today under the policies of the Obama administration. We need a president who upon entering office will immediately begin reversing the damage done to our freedom to believe and our ability to live according to those beliefs.""""While Ted has been effective on an array of national issues, he hasn't strayed from his theme, which is that 2016 is going to be a 'religious liberty election,'"" Perkins continued. ""This continues to resonate with Americans, who open their newspapers every day to a new story of religious hostility.I am confident that Ted Cruz, who has spent his career defending religious liberty in the courts and in the Senate, can be trusted and is prepared to make freedom mean something again in America,"" continued Perkins.""Unfortunately, the future of freedom in America rests largely in the hands of the courts, which is why we need a president who can spot liberal jurists, and who will fight to ensure constitutionalists who respect the rule of law are seated on the Supreme Court. The formation of this Religious Liberty Advisory Council will be an encouragement to the American people.Help is on the way,"" Perkins concluded.Ted Cruz has pledged on day one of his administration to issue an instruction to the Department of Justice, the IRS, and every other federal agency that the abuse of religious liberty will be stopped.Last fall, Cruz hostedrallies for religious liberty in IowaandSouth Carolina. The events featured the stories of religious liberty heroes and highlighted recent acts of government-sanctioned religious persecution against Americans of faith.More than 44,000 Americans have joined the campaign's Faith and Religious Liberty coalition.Members of the religious liberty advisory council appear below.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"February 29, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Kayla Moore, wife of Chief Justice Moore: I Trust Ted Cruz to Pick the Next Supreme Court Justice","HOUSTON, Texas Mrs. Kayla Moore, wife of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, penned an op-ed in support of Ted Cruz as the candidate we can trust to nominate justices who are faithful to the Constitution. See excerpts below and the fullop-ed here.AL.comI Trust Ted Cruz to Pick the Next Supreme Court JusticeKayla MooreVery rarely do I get involved in other political races, but right now our nation is at a crossroads.If we do not choose wisely, we may forever lose our country.Many will say anything to get elected, but we must look at what the candidates have done. In studying and watching those running in this race  one stands for the same values I believe in. One is a true defender of the Constitution.The next president will make many critical appointments and tough decisions with regard to the rule of law, theSupremeCourt, and national security. Ted has been a consistent Constitutionalist and a faithful defender of life, marriage, and small government.....Choosing justiceswho stay faithful to the supremacy of the Constitution and who refuse to create new lawshould not be a partisan issue.However, unable to win the ballot box,Democrats have mastered an unconstitutional game: nominatingactivistjudgeswho legislate liberal policies from the bench. Unfortunately, Republicans have often failed to stop them and have sometimes joined in their nomination.With Justice Scalia's tragic passing, the next president will likely replace three, maybe four justices. With the number of 5-4 decisions  in favor of free speech, the Second Amendment, the Ten Commandments, and religious liberty  just one justice could tip the fundamental trajectory of our constitutional rights and society. Conservatives cannot afford to lose the presidential election, but neither can we afford to nominate justices who will betray our constitutional principles. Ted Cruz is the candidate to ensure we win back both the presidency and the courts.Republicans have picked 12 out of the last 16 Supreme Court Justices  but what do we have to show for it? Lawless decisions affirming abortion, striking down state marriage laws, protecting race-based affirmative action, and upholding Obamacare's unconstitutional overreach. The deciding votes for theseliberal opinionshave been none other than Republican appointed justices.....Ted Cruz is the one candidate in the GOP race who we can trust to break this miserable track record. Cruz knows our Constitution, our legal system, and the Supreme Court better than any conservative who has run for president. After clerking for Justice WilliamRehnquist, Cruz became one of the greatest and most successfulSupreme Court advocates in recent history  writing over 70 briefs as Solicitor General and arguing 9 times before the Court. He has protected the Ten Commandment monument on the state Capitol grounds in Texas, has joined with 31 states in defending the Second Amendment, has protected U.S. sovereignty against the U.N. in theMedellin v. Texas, and he has kept the crosses standing at the Mojave Desert veterans' memorial.....Any Republican nominee for the Supreme Court will have an uphill battle, but Ted Cruz is a proven fighter. And from the fight against Obamacare to the battle against amnesty, from the charge against Planned Parenthood funding to the struggle against the catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal, Cruz has shown he is not afraid to fight just as hard for conservative principles as the Democrats do for liberal policies. When he nominates true constitutionalist judges, he will see them through the Senate and onto the Court. And the legacy of just one justice  as we know so well, especially while still mourning the loss of Justice Scalia  can keep this nation more free for our children and grandchildren.I trust Ted Cruz  a man of character and a proven leader  to not only fight for our values in Washington but, to appoint Supreme Court nominees who will stand by our principles and be faithful to the Constitution  the ""supreme law of the land."" Join me in voting for Ted Cruzon Tuesday."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 5, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Investors Business Daily: Cruz Gets To The Heart Of Making America Great Again,"HOUSTON, Texas An editorial inInvestors Business Dailypraises Ted Cruz's comments in the Republican debate Thursday in Detroit, stating that Cruz ""made one of the clearest economic cases for change we've heard so far."" Cruz explained how he would bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. by pulling back federal regulations, implementing a simple, flat tax and repealing Obamacare, the biggest job killer in America. The editorial concludes, ""[Cruz's answer] was an eloquent, fact-based, carefully thought out and powerful statement that gets to the heart of who's been running the U.S. as its establishment, why change is needed and what greatness really means.""Excerpt below and full article may be viewedhere.Cruz Gets To The Heart Of Making America Great AgainInvestors Business DailyPundits have decried the bickering at the latest GOP presidential debate as an embarrassment to the party and its prospects. But in fact, Ted Cruz made one of the clearest economic cases for change we've heard so far....""Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy,"" Cruz told Fox News moderator Chris Wallace.""You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided  funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In  in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.""And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out.""This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it,"" Cruz declared as his sixty seconds ran out.""I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question,"" Wallace responded, almost appearing to upbraid Cruz. ""What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?"" Wallace asked. Cruz's answer just got better.""The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal ObamaCare, the biggest job-killer in America,"" said Cruz.""I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing....""What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where, when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.""It was an eloquent, fact-based, carefully thought out and powerful statement that gets to the heart of who's been running the U.S. as its establishment, why change is needed and what greatness really means. It was the sort of argument and answer that elevates the national contest and its debates on the great questions, and something that many Americans hope to see more of now. Cruz struck a nerve  and hit a bullseye."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 7, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: What They're Saying... Cruz's Super Saturday,"Cruz has momentum.... keeping the pressure on Trump""HOUSTON, TexasOver the weekend, presidential candidate Ted Cruz racked up two more wins in Kansas and Maine, making him the only candidate who has repeatedly beaten Donald Trump. These two victories now total six wins for Cruz in Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kansas, and Maine. Additionally, Cruz came within three and four points of Trump in both Kentucky and Louisiana. Across the country Americans are rallying behind the campaign and seeing that Cruz is the only conservative alternative to Trump. Highlights of media coverage are below:Washington Post:The Daily 202: Super Saturday results show Rubio collapsing, Trump stoppable and Cruz gaining momentumTed Cruz won decisive victories in Kansas and Maine on what's being called ""Super Saturday,"" and he came within three and four points of scoring upsets over Donald Trump in both Louisiana and Kentucky....It's easier than ever to see the Republican contest becoming a two-way race between Trump and Cruz, with Trump playing the part of the populist and Cruz representing unalloyed conservatism....In addition to his electoral victories, Cruz won a significant moral victory at CPAC in National Harbor yesterday. In the annual straw poll of attendees, he got 40 percent to 30 percent for Rubio and 15 percent for Trump. (See the full results here.)Though Cruz's victories have largely come in caucus states, they are testaments to the value of his organization. Such organization could come in handy during a contested Republican convention in Cleveland.The Hill:Cruz on Trump's heels after victories on Super SaturdayGOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz established himself on Saturday night as the challenger with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, as the Texas senator posted two impressive victories and nearly caught the front-runner in two other states.Cruz won the caucuses in Kansas and Maine in a runaway. Trump edged him at the caucuses in Kentucky and the primary in Louisiana....But it was Cruz who was the story of the night, as he bolstered his argument that the Republican presidential race is down to a two-man contest between himself and Trump, the long-time front-runner.""I want Ted one-one-one,"" Trump said, calling for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to drop out.Earlier in the day, Cruz won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. That poll is unscientific, but generally considered a worthwhile measure of grassroots conservative support.Associated Press:Some in GOP start seeing Cruz as best alternative to TrumpThe Texas senator split contests with Trump in Saturday's voting, bolstering his argument that only he can defeat the real estate mogul. Trump and Cruz are now significantly outpacing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the delegate count, further shrinking the Florida senator's already narrow path to the nomination.If Rubio's slide continues, he would be the latest establishment candidate to fall victim to an angry, frustrated electorate that cares little about endorsements from party leaders or newspaper editorial boards. Rubio has rolled out both at warp speed in recent weeks, but his appeal with voters is not keeping pace....But Cruz has built a loyal following among conservatives and evangelical Christians, and has proved to be a fundraising powerhouse during the 2016 campaign. After winning the leadoff Iowa caucuses, he's also beaten Trump in five more states, more than any other candidate.New York Times:Ted Cruz Keeps Up Pressure on Donald Trump; Bernie Sanders Takes 2 on 'Super Saturday'Senator Ted Cruz scored decisive wins in the Kansas and Maine caucuses on Saturday, demonstrating his enduring appeal among conservatives as he tried to reel in Donald J. Trump's significant lead in the Republican presidential race.Mr. Trump contained Mr. Cruz's advances by winning in Louisiana and Kentucky. But the Texas senator's wins were sure to energize the anti-Trump forces who are desperately trying to stop Mr. Trump's march to the nomination, and they left little doubt that Mr. Cruz, who has now captured six states, is their best hope....The biggest stakes were on the Republican side, and the voters sensed it; turnout in Kansas, for example, was more than double that of 2012. Mr. Cruz won 48 percent of the vote there, while Mr. Trump received 23 percent, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida won 17 percent and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio won 11 percent. The results were tighter in Maine, but Mr. Cruz still easily defeated Mr. Trump there by 13 percentage points. With Mr. Trump's victories coming by smaller margins, Mr. Cruz had the biggest delegate haul of the day, appearing to net at least 15 more than the front-runner."

Ferguson announced his support of Cruz on CNN tonight.""I am formally endorsing Ted Cruz tonight for one reason,"" said Ferguson. ""And that is the fact that I do not believe Donald Trump is going to be able to bring everyone together. I do not believe he has a solid path forward when it comes to the actual issues that he claims he cares about. His record of his past bothers me and it doesn't just bother me, it bothers a lot of other voters. He's not been sweeping first off, second thing is he's not even getting the majority numbers that many claimed he was going to get, above 50% in these states where he's having these victories. The reason why is there's more people voting against him than are voting in favor of him last night. That is something else that we have a problem.""""Now as long as you have a three man race, that works to Trump's advantage,"" Ferguson continued. ""But there are more conservatives now that are more frustrated with Donald Trump than ever before because they are concerned about his past. They are concerned about his flexibility on immigration. They are concerned about what was in theNew York Timesoff the record comments. They're concerned about fraud with Trump University and all the students there that have come out. They're also frustrated with the fact that they made up stats that weren't true with the Better Business Bureau to try and get rid of that issue with Trump University. And they lied about it last week and that is bringing a lot of conservatives I think saying, 'you know what we're not jumping all in on the Trump train.' And there are people that are questioning him and that's the reason why I support Ted Cruz.""Ben Ferguson is a radio talk show host and CNN Political Commentator. At 13, Ben Ferguson became the youngest radio talk show host in the country, and the youngest nationally syndicated host at 20.

That is the Constitution, the Republic, individual sovereignty, separation of powers, the Bill of Rights, family, faith, a secure border, our national security. Nobody is perfect. My great idol Ronald Reagan wasn't perfect. So it's not that we seek perfection, or that we look for nitpicking ways to oppose somebody, no. You look at the whole picture, you take the whole life of the individual, you look at their entire career over a period of time. And when you do that it really is a simple decision is it not? If you're a conservative, if you're a constitutionalist, if you've been a Tea Party activist, if you're a Reaganite or Reagan Democrat, it really is in the end a simple decision. At least it is for me.""My support for Ted Cruz isn't because of opposition to Donald Trump per se, it isn't because of opposition to Rubio or Kasich per se, my support for Ted Cruz is because I honestly believe, this is a man who understands where this country has been and where it needs to go. And we have said so many times, this is the kind of nominee that we must have. Well it doesn't just happen; you have to vote for him. That's how he becomes the nominee of the Republican Party.""Let me suggest if he gets the nomination he will be elected President of the United States. Because if you just think about it in your mind's eye, there on the stage, Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz I think he'd wipe the floor with her. Not because he's the most handsome candidate ever, no. Because he's one of the smartest candidates ever. And he knows how to run and he knows how to speak, and I believe with your help he knows how to win. God bless you."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 15, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: North Carolina Senate Leader Phil Berger Endorses Ted Cruz For President,"HOUSTON, Texas North Carolina Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham)released the following statementyesterday endorsing Ted Cruz in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary:""Of the two candidates with a realistic chance to win the Republican nomination for president, only Ted Cruz can defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the general election this November. Ted Cruz is a principled outsider with a proven track record on fiscal and social issues that conservatives can count on. I hope you'll consider joining me in supporting and voting for Ted Cruz tomorrow.""EDEN, NC  North Carolina Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) released the following statement endorsing Ted Cruz in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary:""Like many North Carolinians, I believe the Obama presidency has weakened our nation abroad, divided us here at home and fueled unprecedented dysfunction in Washington. It has forced on the American people nearly a decade of misguided progressive policy and a blind obedience to foolish political correctness.We've felt it in North Carolina: Obamacare's crushing burden on businesses and working families, activist courts denying the will of our voters, and national headwinds stymying even greater economic recovery. Since 2011, our work in the legislature has provided a model for conservative, state-level reform in the face of Washington's failures. We've put our state on a better, brighter trajectory. But only with a new president, and a new culture in our nation's capital, will the rest of the country experience the comeback we've worked so hard to secure in North Carolina.Fellow Republicans: We have to choose a nominee with the convictions to undo mistakes of the past eight years, and one who can keep Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders from repeating them. The self-avowed socialist or the untrustworthy Obama lieutenant  both promise to cement the change the president has forced on America. We must nominate a conservative who can win in November.Throughout this tumultuous campaign, Donald Trump has shone a national spotlight on issues worthy of more discussion and debate. He's stood up to the liberal media and he's challenged the political correctness that is tearing apart the cultural fabric that has made America great. But while Senator Cruz is leading Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup  an election Republicans must win to maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court  polling shows Mr. Trump losing by large margins.For these reasons I'm endorsing Ted Cruz for president.Of the two candidates with a realistic chance to win the Republican nomination for president, only Ted Cruz can defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the general election this November. Ted Cruz is a principled outsider with a proven track record on fiscal and social issues that conservatives can count on. I hope you'll consider joining me in supporting and voting for Ted Cruz tomorrow.""Phil Berger is the leader of the North Carolina Senate, the first Republican to hold the that position in North Carolina in over a century."

""Throughout the never ending battles to do this, Ted Cruz has always been a principled leader fighting to do the very same thing. With a federal debt that is quickly approaching an unfathomable $20 trillion, our country's future economic growth and prosperity are in grave danger unless we elect a principled conservative who is truly committed to stopping the out of control spending and borrowing that has led us to where we are today.""""It's clear that Ted is the conservative leader that we need as our next president, and my wife Joyce and I are proud to give him our strongest endorsement. In the upcoming Arizona presidential preference primary, Ted is the clear choice for voters who want a conservative president who is truly committed to fixing the mess in Washington,"" Schweikert concluded.""I am thrilled to have such a passionate fighter for liberty on our team,"" said Cruz. ""David has spent his time in Congress fighting against the Washington Cartel and protecting the interests of the American people.

Mr. Trump, if you won't debate in Utah, we'll bring the debate to you.""While the AIPAC speaking opportunity is not a debate, Ted Cruz will use his speaking opportunity to highlight Trump's positions  or lack thereof  in front of the thousands of AIPAC members in attendance, including Trump's recent comments that he would be ""neutral"" in the debate between Israel and the Palestinians.""Donald can't duck us for the rest of this campaign, and so we will happily press the issue until the public pressure becomes too much for him to bear,"" continued Nehring.

""He is among the most brilliant students I have taught and one of the most principled and dedicated public servants I know. But the reason I am recommending Ted to my fellow citizens goes beyond our years of friendship  I am endorsing Ted because he understands the Constitution and has spent his entire career defending it. No one has been stronger than Ted in standing up for religious liberty and other fundamental constitutional freedoms. Moreover, he understands and is determined to restore the basic structural principles of the Constitution that our Founding Fathers knew were the true bulwarks protecting liberty: the separation of powers; federalism; the concept of the national government as a government of delegated and enumerated  and thus limited  powers; the understanding of courts as faithful interpreters of law who have no authority to read things into the Constitution that aren't there, or read things out of the Constitution that are.""In order to protect religious liberty, restore the right of the people to protect innocent human life in all stages and conditions and the institution of marriage as the union of husband and wife, and preserve other key constitutional values, we need a Republican president who has both the record and the judgment to nominate judges and justices who are faithful constitutionalists,"" George continued. ""Ted Cruz will not only devote political capital to ensuring that every nominee will protect our constitutional freedoms, but he will foster a culture, from the top down, that honors the Constitution  the one thing that, despite our differences, binds us all together as Americans.""Dr. George, an eminent scholar and teacher of constitutional interpretation, civil liberties, and philosophy of law, holds Princeton University's celebrated McCormick Professorship of Jurisprudence and is founder and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 18, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Carly Fiorina: Ted Cruz Can Stop Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,"HOUSTON, Texas Former Republican Presidential Candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina today penned the following op-ed inUSA Todayin support of Ted Cruz as the candidate who will reform Washington and restore freedom and prosperity to the American people.See excerpts below and read the full op-edhere.My husband and I live in Virginia where we had a primary recently. While my own name was on the ballot, I checked the box for Ted Cruz.Ted Cruz is a leader and a reformer who isn't afraid to ruffle feathers when he is fighting for the American people.....We need a constitutional conservative to unite our party. Ted has spent his life defending the Constitution. My father was a conservative judge on the very liberal ninth circuit. It takes someone of true principles and convictions like my dad and like Ted Cruz to stick to their guns. Ted has been fighting these fights for decades  whether it's for religious liberty, our right to keep and bear arms or American sovereignty. And he has won.We need a leader and a reformer to challenge the system in Washington and fix the festering problems  whether it's our broken immigration system or the IRS. Throughout my career, I have learned that if you are a real leader, you absolutely must challenge the status quo. Sometimes you make enemies. It's the price of leadership. But it's also the way to deflate the bloated bureaucracy and return prosperity to the people.That's exactly what Ted Cruz will do. He'll grow opportunities not for the government but for the hardworking men and women who are the heart and soul of this great nation. He will abolish the IRS, end the loopholes for Washington's special interests and set one low rate of 10% for all individuals. When April 15 comes, you can simply fill out your taxes on a postcard and carry on with your real work.And rather than choking Americans' innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, Ted Cruz will clean out the excess spending and regulations in Washington, starting with Obamacare. He will audit the Fed and restore a stable dollar. When we do that, we will open up an economic landscape that welcomes new ideas, free enterprise and booming job creation.....Donald Trump can't reform the system; he's part of it. In fact, if we judge a leader on his record, we know what he'll do: use public power for private gain. We've had seven years of that, and we don't need a single year more.If we want to defeat Donald Trump, we must defeat him by offering citizens conservative solutions to the problems in their lives.Ted Cruz is the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump  and who can do so by laying out an optimistic vision of the future  one that recognizes the dignity, purpose, meaning of each person and enables them to reach their potential. That's the way to beat Donald, and it's the way to defeat Hillary come November.....It's time we take our party back, our government back, our country back. It is time to unite behind Ted Cruz. I ask you to join me so that together we reform Washington and restore prosperity to Americans across this country."

In an age when the Obama administration has the audacity to sue the Little Sisters of the Poor, it has never been more critical to stand with those who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Church and its mission of loving the whole world. Especially in this Year of Mercy, we have an opportunity to protect the most vulnerable and safeguard the truth revealed through Scripture and the tradition of millennia.""Dr. Robert George praised Cruz for his loyalty to the rule of law and the principles of a free society. ""No one has been stronger than Ted in standing up for religious liberty and other fundamental constitutional freedoms. ...He will foster a culture, from the top down, that honors the Constitution  the one thing that, despite our differences, binds us all together as Americans,"" said Professor George.""In addition to his exceptional Constitutional credentials, Ted Cruz is a candidate with specific foreign policy proposals to defend persecuted Christians abroad,"" said Ken Cuccinelli. ""At a time when people of faith are under severe attack internationally, we need a president whose foreign policy priorities will leverage America's leadership to defend the defenseless.""""I am very pleased to give my personal endorsement to Ted Cruz for President of the United States,"" Monsignor Ed Lofton, Parish Priest at St. Theresa Catholic Church in South Carolina, said. ""I have followed Ted's time in office and know that he governs grounded in the essential value of protecting life and liberty for all peoples.I am confident that Ted has the intelligence and the will to lead our nation in a positive direction. The Church must not be silent as the nation chooses the leaders who will shape its future. I am personally working for the election of Ted Cruz, and I urge fellow Catholics to join me in giving Ted Cruz our support and our votes.""""Ted Cruz has been a tireless fighter for the most vulnerable among us  starting with the unborn,"" said Jason Jones, a pro-life activist and filmmaker. ""Ted Cruz has defended the sanctity of life at the Supreme Court, has worked to defund Planned Parenthood in Congress, and I am confident that as president he will create a culture of life.""""While many candidates have sadly conceded on the issue of marriage, Ted Cruz has courageously denounced the Supreme Court's decision,"" said Brian Brown, President of the National Organization for Marriage. ""He has upheld marriage as a sacrament, recognizing that it is foundational to all civilizations. As Catholic institutions are facing increasing threats of fines and punishment for living by the teachings of the Church, we need a leader who has proven he won't back down  that he will always stand for our God-given liberties so that individuals, the Church, and communities are free to practice the faith, hope, and charity that uplifts all members of our society.""The following Catholic leaders have endorsed and are among those building support for Cruz within the Catholic community. More than 45,000 Americans, from a broad spectrum of religious traditions, have joined the campaign's Faith and Religious Liberty Coalition.Titles and any affiliations of all endorsers are provided for identification purposes only.Co-Chair Dr. Robert P.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 20, 2016",Press Release - Congressman Matt Salmon Endorses Ted Cruz for President,"HOUSTON, Texas- The Cruz for President campaign announced the endorsement of Congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona. Salmon represents Arizona's Fifth Congressional District. Prior to serving in Congress, Salmon was elected to the Arizona State Senate, where he served from 1991 until 1995. During this time, he served as Assistant Majority Leader and Chairman of the Rules Committee. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives 1994, where he served three terms.

Salmon. ""The future of our country, our security, and our way of life hang in the balance. We need a president that understands the myriad of global security challenges we face from ISIS to Iranian aggression to Russian and Chinese expansionism. Our next president must recognize, embrace, and empower the many Americans who have been left behind while the Obama Administration focused on growing government by sacrificing the middle class. Our next president must be a warrior for smaller government, more freedom, opportunity for all Americans, and a conviction that life, no matter how nascent, must be protected and celebrated. Ted Cruz is such a warrior. He will fight to keep the American Dream alive, grow our economy for all Americans, and keep us safe here at home.

He has spent his career fighting for the people of Arizona and all Americans. I am thrilled to have his support and look forward to having his help coalescing conservatives around our campaign."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 21, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: Right Wisconsin: Why We Are Endorsing Ted Cruz,"HOUSTON, Texas- Today,Right Wisconsinannounced their endorsement of Ted Cruz for President of the United States. The editors write that they are endorsing Cruz ""as the only conservative who has a plausible chance to stop the political and moral disaster of a Trump nomination.""""Wisconsin voters have risen to the challenge time and time again. We need to do so once again, by voting for Ted Cruz on April 5.""See excerpts below and read the full articlehere.Why We Are Endorsing Ted CruzRight WisconsinSo, once again, it comes down to Wisconsin. In recent years, we've grown accustomed to being at the center of American politics, and this occasion is no different. In the next two weeks, we have the chance to stand athwart the GOP's slouch toward the abyss and yell ""Stop.""We take our responsibility seriously; Wisconsin must be a fire wall of rationality in the madness that is the current GOP campaign. That is why we are today endorsing Ted Cruz as the only conservative who has a plausible chance to stop the political and moral disaster of a Trump nomination....We readily acknowledge that Cruz was not our first choice. We would have preferred Scott Walker or Marco Rubio. Some of us would have been more than happy with several of the other candidates who have fallen by the wayside. And we are not unaware of the rap on Cruz or of the reluctance of many Badger state conservatives to embrace the Texas senator. Nor is this the time to critique John Kasich, who is a good man and effective governor, even if we disagree with some of his policies and cringe at his rhetoric and wonder what he hopes to accomplish in a race he cannot win.Our endorsement of Ted Cruz is both tactical and substantive. Trump cannot win Wisconsin if conservative primary voters coalesce around a single choice. If, however, they split their votes between other candidates, Trump could sweep Wisconsin's delegates, despite winning only a narrow plurality of the vote.Unfortunately, that has too often been the story of this campaign. It must stop here.But our endorsement is also substantive. AsNational Review's editors wrote, Cruz is a solid and principled conservative:...Since then, nothing has changed except that Trump is now on the verge of seizing the GOP nomination, with all of the attendant consequences for the party, conservatism, and the coarsening of our culture. Along with a sizable number of primary voters, we have made it clear that we will not support Trump even if he wins the nomination.But that is not yet inevitable. Wisconsin voters stand between Trump and the prize he is so anxious to debase.This is a time for choosing and we choose not to cower in the shadows or attempt to placate or appease the rough beast of Trumpism.Wisconsin voters have risen to the challenge time and time again. We need to do so once again, by voting for Ted Cruz on April 5."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 21, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Ted Cruz: In Cuba, Obama Will Legitimize the Corrupt and Ignore the Oppressed","HOUSTON, Texas- Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed inPoliticoin response to President Obama's visit to Castro's Cuba.See excerpts below and read the full op-edhere.In Cuba, Obama Will Legitimize the Corrupt and Ignore the OppressedPoliticoCommunist Havana has always been a magnet for the radical chic of the left, drawn like moths to the flame of this western outpost of totalitarian Communism. Back in the 1960s, the visitors included Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael, while Che Guevara himself received Jean-Paul Sartre.Now this scene will include a president of the United States. On Sunday, President Barack Obama, a retinue of celebrities in tow, is expected to arrive in the Cuban capital to hang out with Raul Castro and his henchmen, all of which will be breathlessly documented by the media mavens along for the ride.Meanwhile, political prisoners languishing in dungeons across the island will hear this message: Nobody has your back. You're alone with your tormentors. The world has forgotten about you.....Until Obama, siding with the oppressed had always been America's aspiration. We have done so not just out of an abiding sense of justice, but also for hard-nosed reasons of national interest. In Cuba the Castros have been the implacable enemies of the United States for more than half a century. It is in our interests to make common cause with the brave souls who oppose them.Former Soviet political prisoner Natan Sharansky, for example, now a leading Israeli politician and a moral voice, was in the Gulag when President Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union ""the evil empire"" in 1983. Afterward he said, ""It was the brightest, most glorious day ... our whole block burst out into a kind of loud celebration.""This is why it is so sad, and so injurious to our future as well as Cuba's, that Obama has chosen to legitimize the corrupt and oppressive Castro regime with his presence on the island.The White House keeps saying that this trip will chart a new course for people-to-people relations, but all that Obama's appeasement of the Castro dictatorship has done so far is create a channel for inside deals between large corporations and the Cuban military, which holds all the keys to the island's economy. The effect will not be liberalization but rather the institutionalization of the Communist dictatorship as the profits from this dtente will line the pockets not only of Fidel and Raul Castro, but also of Raul's son, Alejandro Castro Espin.Corporate cronyism, meet communist totalitarianism.....I have news, Mr. President: No progress has taken place. Cuba is going backward.Over the weekend a makeshift boat was rescued off Marco Island carrying 18 desperate refugees who were willing to risk their lives rather than endure the ""progress"" in Cuba. Nine had perished on the journey.The independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation says that 1,141 Cubans were detained for political reasons last month alone, following the 1,447 that were detained in January.So sycophancy is having the effect is always does: It is telling our enemies that they can behave with impunity.I have a word for the people of Cuba who will witness the gaudy spectacle in Havana this weekend: America has not forgotten you.I am the son of a Cuban who was beaten and tortured by Batista's regime, and my aunt was likewise brutalized by Castro's thugs. Thankfully, both my father and my Ta Sonia found freedom in the United States.That freedom can come to Cuba, and I pledge to work to make it so. But it cannot happen by enriching and empowering the dictatorship, while they export terrorism throughout Latin America. And it cannot happen by forgetting the heroism and suffering of the brave souls who have opposed the Castros for so many decades."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 22, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Ted Cruz on Brussels attack: ""Until Isis is utterly destroyed they will continue to carry out acts of terror.""","HOUSTON, Texas- Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruzaddressed the media today in Washington D.C. in response to the deadly terror attacks in Brussels.The following is a transcript of Ted Cruz' remarks:Today's attacks in Brussels underscores that this is a war. This is not an isolated incident. This is not a lone wolf. This is a war with radical Islamic terrorism. ISIS has declared jihad on Europe and on the United States of America. They have declared their intention to murder as many innocents as possible and it is long past time that we had a President who will acknowledge this evil, will call it by its name and will utilize the full force and fury of the United States to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, to defeat ISIS. Until they are defeated these attacks will continue. Until Isis is utterly destroyed they will continue to carry out acts of terror, continue to murder. Whether at a subway station, whether at an airport, whether at an opera house in Paris, whether at a community center in San Bernardino.Their target is each and every one of us. And we need a President who sets aside political correctness in the wake of Brussels. We don't need another lecture from President Obama on Islamophobia. We need a Commander in Chief who does everything necessary to defeat the enemy and we need to immediately halt the President's ill-advised plan to bring in tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees.Our vetting programs are woefully insufficient. This administration has no means of preventing those refugees from being ISIS terrorists. ISIS has stated its intention to infiltrate those terrorists, those refugees, with terrorists coming to America to commit acts of jihad. And the time for the President's political correctness has passed. The first priority of the Commander in Chief should be keeping America safe.Q: Beyond Syrian refugees, is it time for a ban on all Muslims, as Donald Trump has called for?CRUZ: It is time for us to implement serious vetting and we should not be allowing anyone to come to this country that we cannot vet to make sure that they are not radical Islamic terrorists. That's part of the problem of not defining the enemy. When you don't define the enemy, then you don't have screening programs designed to keep them out. And I would note if you look at the San Bernardino terrorists, the female terrorist had publically posted on social media calls to jihad. And yet the Obama administration in yet another nod to political correctness refused to even to look to social media. That is an example of the myopia of this administration. It's politically driven. It's not that they cannot see the threats of terrorism, it's that they refuse to look at, acknowledge or name the threats of terrorism because it is inconsistent with their political objectives.Q: What makes you the guy? (inaudible)CRUZ: Well I will say it is striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, that we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered the subject of a radical Islamic terrorist attack. Donald Trump is wrong that America should withdraw from the world and abandon our allies. Donald Trump is wrong that America should retreat from Europe, retreat from NATO, hand Putin a major victory, and while he's at it hand ISIS a major a victory.Q: What should NATO do?CRUZ: NATO should join with the United States in utterly destroying ISIS. And I would note that NATO is ready to act in a way that our President is not. Donald Trump's proposal to withdraw from the world, to withdraw from NATO, to withdraw from Europe is sadly consistent with his statement that he intends to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. We have seen for seven years a President that cannot distinguish between our friends and our enemies- a President that cannot distinguish between the nation of Israel and Islamic terrorists who seek to murder us. And it would be a mistake to elect another President who buys into the same left-wing moral relativism that equates the terrorist blowing himself up and murdering innocent civilians to the brave soldiers and law enforcement officers risking everything to keep us safe.Donald Trump's proposal to withdraw from the world, to withdraw from NATO, to withdraw from Europe is sadly consistent with his statement that he intends to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. We have seen for seven years a President that cannot distinguish between our friends and our enemies- a President that cannot distinguish between the nation of Israel and Islamic terrorists who seek to murder us. And it would be a mistake to elect another President who buys into the same left-wing moral relativism that equates the terrorist blowing himself up and murdering innocent civilians to the brave soldiers and law enforcement officers risking everything to keep us safe.Q: Trump said this morning that he would suspend the visa waiver program. Do you agree with him on that?CRUZ: There's no doubt that we need serious scrutiny to the visa waiver program. The attack in Brussels is in many ways the fruit of a failed immigration policy in Europe that has allowed a massive influx of radical Islamic terrorists into Europe.Europe is in the process of allowing policies to fundamentally threaten the safety and security of its citizens. That is a mistake. And the visa waiver program was designed for a different era when those from Europe were not perceived to be threats.When Europe's immigration policies allow radical Islamic terrorists to make Europe their home- we absolutely need to revisit our immigration policies across the board to prevent radical Islamic terrorists from coming to America.Q: Should President Obama cut short his trip to Cuba and come back to the US?CRUZ: While our friends and allies are attacked by radical Islamic terrorists, President Obama is spending his time going to baseball games with the Castro's. And standing at a press conference with Raul Castro, (inaudible) while Castro denies there are any political prisoners in Cuba. And then even worse, President Obama goes out of his way to agree with Castro's attacks on America.I recognize President Obama began his presidency with a worldwide apology tour. But the people of America deserve a President who doesn't grovel before a communist dictator who hates America; is attacking our nation. And instead of the President enthusiastically agreeing with the Castro's on his attacks with America, we need a President who will stand up and defend America as the greatest light of freedom the world has ever seen.No other nation has spilled more blood, has spent more treasure, has lost the lives of more children preserving liberty, preserving the lives of others than has the United States of America. And President Obama should be back in America keeping this country safe or President Obama should be planning to travel to Brussels.You know in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, world leaders came together in solidarity with the people of Paris. And yet strikingly absent was Barack Obama. A visual manifestation of President Obama and Hillary Clinton's retreat from the world- abdication of leadership in the world.And I would note that retreat from the world- that Obama-Clinton retreat from the world- is very much the retreat from the world that Donald Trump is advocating. Even Barack Obama hasn't gone so far as arguing from withdrawing from NATO.And the way to respond to terrorist attacks is not weakness- is not unilateral and preemptive surrender. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from NATO as Trump suggests, is preemptive surrender."

In a previous statement, Cruz for President Spokesman Ron Nehring said, ""Perhaps Mr. Trump is unable to speak for more than one minute about any given topic because of his shallow understanding of basic policies, or perhaps he is scared of voters learning the truth - that he has spent his entire adult life promoting liberal positions completely opposite of the conservative platform that he has campaigned on.""View videohere.

Donald is afraid to debate.O'REILLY: Debate you one on one?CRUZ: I would love to do a one on one debate. Bill you can moderate. He wouldn't argue that you're an unfair moderator.O'REILLY: Yes he would.CRUZ: So I'm happy to have you moderate.O'REILLY: Alright we're going to work that.CRUZ: And NATO is a perfect example, where he throws out a foreign policy position that is weaker and more liberal than Obama's and Hillary Clinton's and then he doesn't get challenged on it because he's afraid to have a debate.O'REILLY: Okay, let's talk about you. But I will follow up on that debate offer. And I appreciate you making it.CRUZ: I think it'd be terrific."

""Ted is a consistent, principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests.

To win, Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face, and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that.""""I'm truly honored to earn Governor Jeb Bush's support,"" said Cruz. ""Governor Bush was an extraordinary governor of Florida, and his record of job creation and education innovation left a lasting legacy for millions of Floridians. His endorsement today is further evidence that Republicans are continuing to unite behind our campaign to nominate a proven conservative to defeat Hillary Clinton in November, take back the White House, and ensure a freer and more prosperous America for future generations."""
Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 24, 2016",Press Release - Democrat Donald: Trump Supports the Most Liberal New York Democrats,"HOUSTON, Texas- Today, the Cruz for President campaignhighlightedDonald Trump's long history of helping to elect some of the most liberal Democrat office holders as well as contributing heavily to the Democrat machine in New York. Several liberal politicians who have benefited from Trump's contributions have gone on to commit ethics violations, resign in disgrace, or serve time in prison.""Donald Trump has supported the Democrat politicians who have made it difficult for average Americans to get ahead,"" said presidential candidate Ted Cruz. ""I have met a number of hard-working New Yorkers who are excited that they finally have a true conservative on the ballot to vote for. Trump's record of electing Democrats proves he's not being truthful about what he says he supports and what he claims he'll do. The real Donald Trump is a Democrat and should not be our Party'snominee.""Trump has contributed to New York Rep. Charlie Rangel and floated his name as a potential Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. But in 2010, 333 of Rangel's colleagues voted to censure him for eleven violations of House ethics restrictions and other federal rules.In addition:Trump handed over $41,000 to Eliot Spitzer, who made it all the way to the Governor's Mansion before his relationship with a high-priced prostitute became public. And Trump gave almost $4500 to disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner who publicly tweeted lewd pictures of himself.Trump has no problem handing out cash to some of the most liberal politicians hailing from New York. He gave $64,000 to Andrew Cuomo, helped elect and re-elect New York mayor David Dinkins, and donated $8,900 to Chuck Schumer, one of the leading Senate Democrats advocating for amnesty and to put liberal justices on the Supreme Court.Trump is a significant backer of the corrupt Democrat machine in New York, giving $138,000 to the party over several decades. Since 1999, Trump has personally contributed over $350,000 to New York candidates and committees, and at least an additional $50,000 through one of his businesses.Trump's relationship with the Clintons goes back decades. In addition to inviting Bill and Hillary to his wedding, he has contributed to Hillary's New York senate and presidential campaigns, and given at least $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation (though some reports have it closer to $250,000).He's also given thousands of dollars to individuals with legal and ethical violations. Trump gave $56,000 to convicted felon Alan Hevesi who went to prison for a massive pay to play pension scandal. He contributed to a disgraced Queens assemblyman who stole $90,000 from a little league association. And he donated to Sheldon Silver, a former Speaker of the New York State Assembly who is facing 130 years in prison for a corruption.It should come as no shock that Donald Trump would be a financier of Democrats and the Democratic Party because he's long held controversial liberal positions. He has called himself ""very pro-choice,"" has previously supported banning popular guns, advocates for government-funded universal health care, said he's a ""big fan"" of the United Nations, hires illegal labor for his construction jobs, and defends importing cheap foreign labor to work at his country clubs. Donald even supported John Kerry over George W. Bush, and called for President Bush's impeachment.Donald Trump is no Republican and he's certainly no conservative. His long record of contributing, helping, and electing liberal and corrupt Democrats should disqualify him as our party's nominee for the Presidency of the United States."

""I thank this learned and committed group of leaders for their wise recommendations, and as president I will be proud to work with them to protect our religious liberty. Defending religious liberty has been a lifelong passion, and I've been blessed to help win national victories, preserving the Texas Ten Commandments monument, the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance, and the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial.""The recommendations comprise15 initial actions, both legislative and executive, to emphasize and bolster the freedom of religion in the United States. Included are the following proposals:Issue an executive order preventing the federal government from discriminating against Americans who believe that marriage is a sacrament between one man and one woman.Reinstate thorough and protective conscience rights protections in federal healthcare programs.Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to exempt all employers who object for moral and religious reasons from any contraception mandate.Update and revise military regulations to reflect a robust constitutional understanding of the first amendment rights of military personnel, particularly chaplains.Pass the First Amendment Defense Act ""to prevent discriminatory treatment of any person on the basis of views held with respect to marriage.""Direct the IRS to publicly clarify the generous rights of non-profits and religious leaders to engage in political speech without compromising their tax-exempt status.Rescind executive orders which limit the government from partnering with faith-based non-profit organizations.Order the Department of Education to issue guidelines which accurately address the rights of students, teachers, and other school personnel to live out their faith in a school setting.""Our constitutional liberties should not be subject to the whims of the current administration,"" Cruz continued. ""Whether Hobby Lobby or the Little Sisters of the Poor, people of faith should not be made to bow down at the altar of political correctness. As president, I have pledged on my first day in office to rescind every single one of President Obama's unconstitutional executive actions, and to direct every federal agency to respect and protect the religious liberty of every American.""Yesterday, oral arguments were presented before the Supreme Court in the religious liberty caseZubik vs. Burwell, which includes the appeals of Little Sisters of the Poor and Priests for Life for their right to serve the needy without suffering conscience violations from government.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"March 28, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz: If I am Elected President, America Will Have a Commander in Chief Committed to Defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism","HOUSTON, Texas- Today, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed for theNew York Daily Newsregarding what should be done to keep Americans safe at home from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and how he asPresident would make it a priority.See excerpts below and read the full op-edhere.Ted Cruz replies to Bill Bratton on NYPD's demographics unit and the fight against Jihadist terrorismNew York Daily NewsThere is no better example of these ""no go"" zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack  the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels. In attack after attack, from 9/11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels, the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek. At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there. In fact, one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack, Salah Abdeslam, fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary. It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union.Even Belgium's own Prime Minister, Charles Michel, has admitted after the Paris attacks that ""[A]lmost every time there's a link with Molenbeek . . . It's been a form of laissez faire and laxity. Now we're paying the bill.""Many European leaders are now recognizing that passively allowing the Islamist threat to fester was a serious error. We cannot make the same mistakes in America....The Islamic State ""is not Islamic,"" President Obama absurdly tells us.Everyone knows that's nonsense. Of course, there are many peaceful Muslims in America, and hundreds of millions across the world, who can be our allies in this global battle. But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy. Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad, to murder or forcibly convert the infidels (by which they mean everyone else). Islamism is the enemy, and it must be defeated.To do so, we must take a risk-based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive. Just as with law enforcement's successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia, we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be. We need lawful surveillance operations. And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism.In the wake of 9/11, there was a broad consensus in favor of a common-sense domestic counterterrorism strategy. But over the last seven years, the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost. The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal. And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home, even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America....The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here.I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive, hard-headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front.The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be. That's not profiling or spying. It's common sense.An investigation of Wall Street fraud wouldn't focus on community banks in the outer boroughs. If we want to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists.The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law-abiding citizens. Indeed, patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law-enforcement, intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots. And we need their help in the war on terrorism.These are dangerous times. If I am elected President, every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism. This is a battle we must win. If we don't want to become Europe, we need to put aside the political correctness, focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe."

In 2014, their voter guides were credited with turning out the Catholic vote nationally, enabling Republicans to take back the Senate.See Catholic Vote'sstatementbelow.""Since the presidential race began over a year ago, many talented leaders have run the race. Of those that remain, we are convinced that Ted Cruz is far and away the best choice - and the only acceptable choice with a viable path both to win the Republican nomination this summer and the general election in November.Ted Cruz has a consistent record of supporting pro-life causes, of supporting religious freedom, of supporting marriage, and, despite what the tabloids say, has by all trustworthy reports conducted himself as a good husband and father.We knew at the outset of this process we could never support Hillary Clinton. It did not take us long to definitively conclude we could not support Donald Trump. The field is now clear enough for us to unambiguously support Ted Cruz.The media wants you to believe that Donald Trump's nomination is inevitable, but as usual, they're wrong! In every state that has voted so far, Trump has failed to win a majority of votes. Trump has amassed a little more than 8 million votes so far. But almost 13 million votes have been cast for other candidates in the race - nearly 5 million more!Historically, candidates who fail to achieve a majority of delegates going into a contested convention do not win the nomination.John Kasich has only won his home state, has lost every other contest, and continues to raise doubts about his commitment to the things we believe are foundational. It is impossible for him to win enough delegates during the primaries to secure the nomination.The next state in the nomination contest is Tuesday, April 5th: the winner-takes-all Wisconsin primary. The two most recent polls show Ted Cruz with a slim lead over Donald Trump. This could be the state that changes everything.

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 2, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: Scott Walker: Ted Cruz Will Restore Jobs, Freedom, and Security","HOUSTON, Texas- Wisconsin Governor and former Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker today penned the following op-ed in theWisconsin State Journalin support of Ted Cruz as the candidate who recognizes this race is about restoring jobs, freedom and security for the American people and future generations.See excerpts below and read the full op-edhere.When I was a kid, I loved history, especially American history. The American founders, especially the signers of the Declaration of Independence, were my ""superheroes"" for building this country. The first time I was in Philadelphia, at a governor's conference in 2011, I snuck off to Independence Hall.As I stood in that room, I realized this: the founders weren't superheroes. They were ordinary people who did something exceptional because they put the service of our country ahead of themselves. And since then, whenever our country has faced a crisis, ordinary men and women have courageously stood up to do extraordinary things.That's why I am proud to endorse Ted Cruz for president. He is leader who recognizes this isn't about him; it's about our country and leaving our kids with a more promising future.....Right now, our nation is facing steep economic challenges. Wages are stagnant. The number of people who are not in the work force, who aren't even looking for a job, is the highest it's been in decades. Our education system is failing and our kids are falling behind. College debt is crushing students. Health care is more expensive even as wait-times grow and actual doctor-patient care is shrinking. Permanent barriers to economic success are slamming small businesses, farmers, and manufacturing workers.But as Ted often says on the trail, we know how to turn things around, we reignite the Reagan revolution and create more jobs and opportunity. That's what we've done in Wisconsin - and as a result we have seen unemployment drop from 8.1 to 4.6 percent. We've created over 180,000 private sector jobs since 2011 and just a few months ago Wisconsin's employment reached an all-time high, with more people working than at any time in state history.....Ted Cruz will ignite the same kind of growth on a nationwide scale because he recognizes that what has made this country extraordinary is not the government but every one of you - the people across this country who risk everything to build a better life for themselves and their families. And so he'll get the government out of the way. He'll repeal Obamacare and roll back the EPA and the regulatory agents who are stifling your business.Ted Cruz's tax plan will increase the median household's take-home pay by $7,600, as estimated by the Tax Foundation. It will get rid of the loopholes for special interests, abolish the IRS, and make it so simple to complete your taxes that you can fill them out on a postcard.But it's not just our economy that's at stake; it's our fundamental freedoms - those same freedoms the founders so tirelessly fought to enshrine in our Bill of Rights. With Ted Cruz, we will have a leader who has spent his life defending our right to free speech and to freely live our faith - and every other right in the Constitution - and who will nominate rock-solid judges who have the same record of faithfully upholding our constitutional freedoms.Abroad, ISIS is applauding themselves for their brutal attacks in Paris and Brussels - and they have made it clear their intent is to come after us. Yet our President continues to deny that radical Islamic terrorism is the enemy. Our kids will live in a safer world with Cruz as Commander in Chief because our nation will be stronger. He will rebuild the military and stand with our allies.We need a leader who recognizes that it's not his own exceptionalism but America's that we are working to preserve; who serves the people above all else; and who will make this nation abundantly more prosperous, free, and safe. That's why I am casting my ballot for Ted Cruz, and I ask you to do the same nextTuesday, April 5. If voters unite, just like we've done here in Wisconsin, we can reverse course and restore the principles that have made this nation a land of opportunity."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 5, 2016","Press Release - Cruz Calls Wisconsin Victory a ""Turning Point""","Issues Challenge for Hillary Clinton to Get Ready for NovemberHOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz tonight delivered remarks after a resounding victory in Wisconsin and challenged Hillary Clinton to get ready for a general election where Republicans put forth an optimistic vision for bringing back jobs, freedom, and security. See excerpts and full remarks below.""God bless the Great State of Wisconsin. What an incredible victory. And thank you to your tremendous governor, Governor Scott Walker, for his principled, passionate leadership.""Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: we have a choice. A real choice....""And tonight, here in Wisconsin, a state where the media had said just a few weeks ago was a ""perfect state for Donald Trump to win,"" the working men and women of Wisconsin have stood up and campaigned tirelessly to make sure that tonight was a victory for every American who cares about the future of our country....""So I ask you to join us, as we continue to unite Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, Americans who care about our future- as we've done here in Wisconsin. So that we can come back to this state in November and, for the first time since 1984, paint the Badger State bright Republican red.""Hillary, get ready, here we come.""Full remarks below:God bless the Great State of Wisconsin. What an incredible victory tonight. And thank you to your tremendous governor, Governor Scott Walker, for his principled, passionate leadership.Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: we have a choice. A real choice.The national political terrain began to change two weeks ago. In the state of Utah, we won 69 percent of the votea landslide election, winning every single delegate in the state.Then three days ago in Colorado, two congressional districts voted. They elected six delegates. Of those six delegates, we won all six.And then two days ago in North Dakota, we had another tremendous win. They elected their delegates. Of the delegates who have specified their support, eighteen are supporting our campaign; one is supporting Donald Trump. Eighteen to oneI'll take that ratio any day of the week.And now tonight, here in Wisconsin, a state that just three weeks the media had written offthree weeks ago the media said Wisconsin was a ""perfect state for Donald Trump."" But the working men and women of Wisconsin stood and campaigned tirelessly to make sure that tonight was a victory for every American.Four very different states, Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin. Four victories.So just how significant is tonight? Well, just today, our campaign has raised over $2 million. People all over America coming to tedcruz.org, tedcruz.org, tedcruz.org, contributing $10 or $25 or $50. We've had over 1.3 million contributions.In the last two weeks, and in the coming days when Colorado and Wyoming finish voting, we are likely to have gained over 100 delegates on Donald Trump.And as a result of tonightas a result of the people of Wisconsin defying the media, defying the punditsI am more and more convinced that our campaign is going to earn the 1237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November.Tonight was a bad night for Hillary Clinton. It was a bad night in the Democratic primary, and it was an even worse night for her in the Republican primary.We are winning because we are uniting the Republican Party. Of the 17 candidates who started this campaigna terrific, talented, dynamic fieldfive have now endorsed this campaign. Rick Perry, and Lindsey Graham, and Jeb Bush, and Carly Fiorina, and Wisconsin's own Governor Scott Walker. When you toss in Senator Mike Lee and Mark Levin, we've got the full spectrum of the Republican Party, coming together and uniting behind this campaign.In 1960, accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, John F. Kennedy observed, ""I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us to see through that darkness to a safe and sane future. As Winston Churchill said on taking office, ""If we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future.""The same is true today. Tonight, Wisconsin has lit a candle guiding the way forward. Tonight, we once again have hope for our future.Tonight is about unity, and tonight is about hope.Young people in America once again have hope that we will bring jobs back to America. By repealing Obamacare, reigning in the federal regulators that are killing small businesses, passing a flat tax, and abolishing the IRS, we will unleash incredible economic growth.Our border will be made secure, and sanctuary cities will end.Truck drivers and mechanics and plumbers and steel workers, union members and the men and women with callouses on your hands, once again will see wages rising. Opportunity expanding.Working momsworking moms struggling to make ends meet, will see take-home pay rising, the cost of living falling, and Common Core ending.Catholic schools and Jewish Day Schools, Brigham Young and the Little Sisters of the Poor, will see a Supreme Court that protects their religious liberty, the fundamental freedom of every one of us to live according to our faith and our conscience.We'll see a Supreme Court that protects the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and our fundamental right to protect our families and our homes and our children.We'll see a President who stands with Israel. Clearly and unapologetically.Instead of negotiating with terrorists, we'll rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS.We will have a President who keeps us safe.To the soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines, to the police officers and firefighters, and the first responders who risk their lives to keep us safe, we will have a Commander in Chief who has...your...back.Jobs, freedom, and security. That's what this next election is all about.In 1980, Milton and Rose Friedman wrote ""Free to Choose."" They explained that the American free enterprise system has been the greatest engine for opportunity and prosperity that the world has ever seen. Too much government can stifle opportunity, but if we get Washington out of the way there is no limit to what we can accomplish.It's what allowed my Dad to escape Cuba and come to America with nothing, washing dishes making 50 cents a day, to start a business and today to be a pastor traveling the country.It's what allowed my Irish-Italian Mom to become the first in her family to go to college, to smash glass ceilings by becoming a pioneering computer programmer.It's what allowed my wife Heidi I may be biased, but isn't she going to make an amazing First Lady?She's the child of missionaries, my best friend in the world, and she's become a successful business leader, a loving Mom, and every day she's teaching our daughters Caroline and Catherine that strong women can accomplish anything in the United States of America.That's America. It's what we're fighting for. Our children. Our future. And, Wisconsin has made clear, we are free to choose.For centuries, America has been a shining city on a hill, a beacon of liberty to the world. And we can and will be once again.So I ask you to join us, as we continue to unite Republicans, and Independents, and Libertarians, and Reagan Democrats and Americans who care about our future who want jobs and freedom and security. Just as we've done in Wisconsin, we're doing all across this country.And Governor let me tell you, I look forward to coming back to the state of Wisconsin this fall. And in November, for the first time since 1984, painting the Badger State bright Republican red.So let me just say, Hillary, get ready, here we come.God bless you!"

Cruz stated,""A candidate that can't be trusted to protect the right to life can't be trusted to protect any of our other God-given rights either. When you look at the voting records of politicians, what you'll find is if they're bad on life, they're always - repeat always - bad on everything else too. If a politician will rob a fellow person of their right to life, rest assured they'll rob you of your private property rights, religious liberty, and look for new taxes and regulations to rob you of your hard-earned money as well. Liberty isn't safe in the hands of a politician that doesn't hold all life sacred."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 7, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: ""This Race is Very Simple. If We Unite, We Win. If We Do Not, We Lose.""","Cruz speaks to TIME Magazine for cover storyHOUSTON, Texas- Presidential candidate Ted Cruz spoke withTIME Magazinereporters before his sweeping Wisconsin primary victory, to discuss his success in uniting all factions of the Republican Party. Cruz says, ""I believe the path to winning the Republican nomination and winning the general election is standing up for hardworking men and women of America who have been left behind by Washington.""TIME Magazine'sMichael Scherer also remarks on the Cruz campaign's strong national organization, ""There is little mystery about who has the best operation for wrangling, recruiting and securing delegates. From Tennessee to Colorado, Cruz's delegate-hunting operation has dominated.""This morning, Scherer appeared onMSNBC's Morning Joe to discussCruz's path to the nomination and his broader appeal to the Republican Party, ""When [Cruz] says I am the principled conservative that is true, he is the principled conservative there's no wavering there.""Excerpts below. View full interview transcripthereand full articlehere.The following evening, after changing from his Texas jeans into his election-night suit and powder blue tie, Cruz sat down with TIME for an interview. Sitting on the hotel sofa, the candidate was at ease, relishing what by then was a clear victory. He had coalesced a broad swath of GOP voters for the first time, winning nonevangelicals and evangelicals, young and old, of all ideological bents. ""This race is very simple,"" he said. ""If we unite, we win. If we do not, we lose.""Good politicians know how to recast their message for the moment. The great ones seem to do it without contradiction, alienation or any actual change in position. This is the leap that Cruz is now attempting. He won the Iowa caucuses with devotion and red meat. His rallies began like prayer circles and continued into fury. He would describe the hatred for him from his own party as ""the whole point of the campaign."" He promised not just to repeal Obamacare but to rescind ""every word"" on Day One. More than unwind the Iran nuclear deal, he vowed to rip it ""to shreds."" He would not just destroy Islamic extremism, he would find out if ""sand can glow in the dark.""Those bold positions all remain, but their packaging has been muted. The clenched fists are now open arms. ""From the beginning, our objective was to reunite the old Reagan coalition to bring together Republicans and independents and libertarians and Reagan Democrats,"" he said. ""I believe the path to winning the Republican nomination and winning the general election is standing up for hardworking men and women of America who have been left behind by Washington."" The conservative caterpillar is becoming a general-election butterfly....Then there are the gauzy new references in his public remarks. The speech he had prepared for the network cameras the night he won Wisconsin included a quote from former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill about ending the quarrel between past and present to focus instead on the future. He would even quote Democratic President John F. Kennedy, who Cruz has long argued, improbably, would be a conservative Republican if he were alive today. ""We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future,"" Cruz said, repeating Kennedy's words.But it is another President who he said gave him hope his gambit could succeed. ""Throughout the course of this campaign, as others have gotten nasty and gotten personal, have engaged in a war of insults and petty personal attacks, I haven't responded in kind,"" Cruz explained, referencing, among other things, Trump's recent attack on the appearance of his wife Heidi. ""That is very much the model of Ronald Reagan, even when Reagan primaried Gerald Ford in '76.""...Meanwhile, there is little mystery about who has the best operation for wrangling, recruiting and securing delegates. From Tennessee to Colorado, Cruz's delegate-hunting operation has dominated, with his aides confident that around 200 Trump delegates will swing to Cruz after the first ballot. In Virginia, where Cruz finished a distant third, the campaign is hustling to install supporters in the state's 13 at-large delegate slots. In Louisiana, Cruz is set to pick up as many as 10 more delegates than Trump, despite losing the Bayou State primary by four points. In a show of organizational muscle, 18 of 25 delegates elected at the North Dakota state convention backed Cruz. In Georgia, where Cruz finished a distant third, his allies have dominated preference polls of the party activists showing up at precinct and county meetings. ""We're going to make sure we get dealt four aces,"" says a member of Cruz's delegate operation. ""You don't just want Cruz supporters. You want fighters. At the national convention, there will be more browbeating and arm twisting than you can imagine."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 15, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: New York Sun: Ted Cruz's New York Values,"Editorial board endorses Ted CruzHOUSTON, Texas - Today, The New York Sun editorial board endorsed Ted Cruz for President. The editors write that Cruz ""has emerged from a crowded field by dint of his fidelity to principles  limited, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a strong foreign policy  that couldn't be at higher premium.""See excerpts below and view the full article here.Ted Cruz's New York ValuesNew York SunIn the Republican presidential primary in New York, the Sun urges a vote for Senator Ted Cruz. It hasn't been our normal practice to endorse in the primaries, but this year the vote, set for Tuesday, will take on outsized importance as we career toward a contested convention. The junior senator from Texas has emerged from a crowded field by dint of his fidelity to principles  limited, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a strong foreign policy  that couldn't be at higher premium. They are the true New York Values.The first thing we are looking for, in any event, is a candidate who grasps, is committed to, and is excited by America's constitutional principles. The Constitution ought to be a unifying instrument; it is, after all, the only thing that all of our legislators, officers, and judges  from the President to the county sheriffs  must be bound by oath to support. Our ideal candidate is someone who thinks in constitutional terms and who references and reveres the principles in our national parchment.On this head, Senator Cruz laps the field. He has done a better job than any other Republican at building a constitutional approach. He has also done a better job on the economy, though we wish that all candidates in both parties would grasp that the bitterness over illegal immigration into America can be permanently addressed only by economic growth. It is not the abundance of labor that has stunted our progress but rather the dead hand of government upon our economy.Mr. Cruz has put forth a more principled approach to taxes than another fine senator, Marco Rubio. Mr. Cruz's flat tax is more strategic, more equitable, more pro-growth. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump would seek the cuts in corporate taxes that have exiled to foreign countries trillions of dollars in corporate reserves. But Mr. Cruz has been far ahead of any other candidate in marking what for us is an essential element restoring American growth and employment  monetary reform.The Texan was the first to declare for sound money. He did this in the Republican debate in Colorado, when the question was put by Rick Santelli. Mr. Cruz declared that the Federal Reserve ""should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold."" Mr. Trump, too, has spoken, en passant, of the virtues of the gold standard. But Mr. Cruz has been actually pursuing monetary reform within the Senate.The American Founders rejected a king. Their republican vision was a democracy in which the business of government is conducted by elected delegates, who are accountable to the law, tempered by an independent judiciary. Millions of Americans sense that the Democrats have become unmoored from the constitutional principles. Mrs. Clinton would re-write the First Amendment; New York, in 1788, ratified the Constitution only on the caveat that a Bill of Rights would be included. Those are the true New York values, and Mr. Cruz has been the most faithful to them in the current campaign."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 21, 2016",Press Release - Cruz Responds to Trump Support of Grown Men Using Women's Restrooms,"CRUZ: ""Donald Trump isn't going to defeat political correctness; today he bowed down to it""HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued the following response to Donald Trump's statement advocating for genderless bathrooms:""Donald Trump is no different from politically correct leftist elites. Today, he joined them in calling for grown men to be allowed to use little girls' public restrooms. As the dad of young daughters, I dread what this will mean for our daughters  and for our sisters and our wives. It is a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.""Yet Donald stands up for this irresponsible policy while at the same time caving in on defending individual freedoms and religious liberty. He has succumbed to the Left's agenda, which is to force Americans to leave God out of public life while paying lip service to false tolerance.""This is not real tolerance. The Left wants to force its belief system onto Americans across the country and silence people of faith in the public square. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump is all too eager to join them. This simply confirms that the same man who favored partial-birth abortion and still supports public funding for Planned Parenthood will sacrifice principle on the altar of political correctness. Trump will not defeat political correctness. Today he bowed to it.""Cruz also spoke about this on Glenn Beck's radio show today. Full interview may be viewed here, excerpts below.BECK: Let's just start with the genderless bathrooms because we were talking about this. North Carolina, Mississippi standing up for the right to practice your religion You can go get a wedding cake at another store just down the street, I'm sure. Practice your religion and the genderless bathrooms the UK has just come out with a travel advisory to LBGT in London, in England, that you should be warned about North Carolina and Mississippi.CRUZ: Well, listen, we have gone off the deep end. This is absurd. Number one, religious liberty is our founding liberty, this country was literally founded by men and women who were fleeing religious oppression and coming to a land where we could live according to our faith and conscience without government getting in the way. It wasn't too long agoBECK: Go aheadCRUZ: that religious liberty was a bipartisan commitment. It has only been in recent years that the modern democratic party, aided and abetted by the mainstream media and Hollywood, has decided religious liberty is inconsistent with their extreme political protections -political biasand that's just wrong. I think that the 2016 election will be about many things but one of the things it will be is a religious liberty election. If you believe that the first amendment protects the rights of all of us of Jews, Christians, Muslims, of atheists, of all of us, to live according to our faith, then there is only one candidate running who has spent his entire adult life fighting to defend religious liberty and the first amendment, and the bill of rights, and the constitution.BECK: OK Ted, tell me this, how do you, and, I'm sorry, we need to move as quickly as we can. How do you make the case to people, this isn't because I hate transgendered people? I'm concerned about my daughter and my wife in a bathroom not from the transgendered people but from the heterosexual pervert, yes, the heterosexual pervert that will use this.CRUZ: Well, a part of it, Glenn, this is not complicated to make the case Most people know this intuitively and, as you know, my daughters are five and eight. My five-year-old knows the difference between boys and girls. You've got the Obama education department suing to try to force junior highs to let teenage boys shower with teenage girls.BECK: Oh my gosh.CRUZ : That's crazy. It's just, that's not a reasonable position. It is simply crazy. The idea that grown men would be allowed alone in a bathroom with little girls you don't need to be a behavioral psychologist to realize bad things can happen and any prudent person wouldn't allow that. It is only the lunacy of political correctness -if he had fired Curt Schillingfor making the rather obvious point, that we shouldn't allow grown adult men strangers alone in a bathroom with little girls... That's a point anyone who is rational should understand.BECK: I will tell you that we always hear from the left on gun control if it would just save one person then we should do it. If this would just save one little girl from being molested by a heterosexual pervert, we should do it.CRUZ: Glenn, I was the Solicitor General of Texas for five and a half years. I handled case after case after case of child molesters, of pedophiles, of people who abused little kids. These are serious issues and when you deal with people who are repulsive perverts and criminals there are some bad people in the world and we shouldn't be facilitating putting little girls alone in a bathroom with grown adult men. That is just a bad, bad, bad idea."

Trump also came out against the federal government's plan to replace President Andrew Jackson with the civil-rights figure Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.The developments came as the GOP's messy fight for the White House spilled into a seaside resort in south Florida. While candidates in both parties fanned out across the country before important primary contests in the Northeast, Hollywood's Diplomat Resort & Spa was transformed into a palm-treed political battleground.Trump's newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, made the case to Republican National Committee members that Trump has two personalities: one in private and one onstage.""When he's out on the stage, when he's talking about the kinds of things he's talking about on the stump, he's projecting an image that's for that purpose,"" Manafort said in a private briefing."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 24, 2016",Press Release - Senior Reagan Administration Official Elliott Abrams Urges Pennsylvanians to Support Ted Cruz,"Abrams: ""If Israel's security and its relationship with the United States are a key concern, Ted Cruz should get your vote.""HOUSTON, Texas- Elliott Abrams, a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, penned an op-ed forThe Philadelphia Inquirerurging voters who are concerned about America's leadership in the world and our relationship with Israel to support Cruz. Abrams writes that Cruz understands the intricacies of Mideast politics and that ""Unlike Trump, the concept of American ""neutrality"" regarding Israel never crossed his mind.""Excerpts below, view full articlehere.Commentary: Cruz understands dangers, realities of MideastThe Philadelphia InquirerElliott AbramsTwo things were immediately clear in my meetings with Cruz. First, the reputation he has for sheer intelligence was obviously well-deserved. His grasp of the dangers facing American interests in the Middle East and facing Israel was broad and deep. He had the facts and he got the nuances. That's not to say we agreed all the time. We sometimes disagreed and debated, and I came to appreciate that he wanted to be challenged by someone else who knew the region and also had strong views. He wanted to think it all through.Second, his commitment to Israel's security was readily apparent and deeply felt. That was one reason he so strongly opposed the nuclear agreement with Iran: because it would legitimize its nuclear program and lead it in only 10 years to a possible nuclear weapon. While Donald Trump is talking about extracting more from Israel for its defense, Cruz wants to beef up the missile defense programs like Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow that are crucial for Israel  and immensely valuable for the United States, with our bases all over the globe.Cruz also understood fully the history of the ""peace process"" between Israel and the Palestinians, with generous Israeli offers (in 2000 and 2008) being rejected by the Palestinian leadership. He understands fully how deeply Israelis seek peace  but how dangerous a bad deal would be to their security, with Hamas in Gaza, ISIS in Syria, and violence throughout the region. Unlike Trump, the concept of American ""neutrality"" regarding Israel never crossed his mind."
Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 25, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: It's Time to Ignite Economic Growth and Opportunity,"HOUSTON, Texas- Presidential candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed inUSA Todayoutlining his positive plan for more jobs, higher wages, and greater opportunities for all Americans.Tax Freedom Day comes way too lateUSA TodayTed CruzSundaywas Tax Freedom Day,marking the first point in the year in which Americans have earned enough to pay their 2015 tax bill. Four straight months  that's how long it takes for the hardworking people of this country to fund the bloated government.It shouldn't take us a third of the year simply to pay the government, much less spend billions of hours and dollars of our time to do so. According to one study, tax compliance took Americans6.1 billion hours; another study estimatestax compliance carries hidden economic costs ofbetween $215 billion and $987 billionannually.Instead, I have proposed the Simple Flat Tax, which scraps the existing tax code and replaces it with a much simpler, fairerand more pro-growth system.Itcollapses the existing seven individual rates into one flat rate of 10%for everyone, abolishes the IRS as we know it, and dismantles the Washington Cartel by cutting off their access to the tax code as a political weapon. All Americans will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard or phone app  in a matter of minutes.The average family will pay no taxes whatsoever on the first $36,000 of income.Individuals will be able to save up to $25,000 per year tax-deferredfor any purpose whether it's saving for college, investing in a small business, or just building your nest egg.According to thenon-partisan Tax Foundation, within a decade the Simple Flat Tax wouldincrease take-home pay by $7,600 for the median household, create 4.9 million jobs, and increase after-tax income by double-digits for all income groups.But tax reform is only one element of our growth platform. In a Cruz administration, we will also audit the Federal Reserve and stabilize the dollar so that we don't set ourselves up for another crash as we saw during the 2008 housing crisis.Additionally, I have laid out a detailed plan for cutting government waste in theFive for Freedomplan, which gets rid of departments and unnecessary agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauand returns dollars and decisions back to the states and the people.We will rein in the federal regulators who are stifling growth starting with repealingObamacareand replacing it with care that's more personal and accessible. We will halt President Obama's federal agencies from adopting liberal agendas such as the ""Clean Power Plan,""which raises energy prices for all, prevents companies from hiring more workersand gives more power to the government. We're going to wipe away these costly programs and empower the people to once again thrive and prosper.Together, we will reduce the burdens on every individual, every small business, and every industry so that they will be free to expand and create new jobs. When it comes to energy, we will expand exploration, and pipeline infrastructure - which will create millions of new jobs. When it comes to manufacturing, the Simple Flat Tax is border adjustable, which levels the playing field and makes exports tax-free.That will bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to America. It also allows for immediate expensing of equipment, which is a powerful catalyst for job creation. When it comes to farming, we will get rid of the EPA's overreach and stop picking winners and losers.This pro-growth platform is not a fanciful new idea. We know it works. When President Reagan took office in 1981, his agenda of lower taxes faced strong opposition from the Democratic speaker of the House. But Reagan took the case to the people and they rose up to reform our economy because they knew after Jimmy Carter's term that the answer to growth was not the government  it was just the opposite. And they were right.During the 1980s, as the lateWall Street Journaleditorial-page editor Robert Bartley wrote in his 1992 bookThe Seven Fat Years,the overall economy grew by 30%,household disposable income increased by 20%,and18 million new jobs were created.That's the kind of revolutionary growth we can ignite once again if enact fundamental reforms to reduce Washington's power and return opportunity to the American people  the greatest force for innovation the world has ever known."

""Forty-six days. A month and a half. The Democrats have debated. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have showed the respect the voters are due by subjecting themselves to the scrutiny of the voters. Indeed, the Democrats are talking about scheduling a second debate, and yet Donald Trump continues to cower in Trump Tower, afraid to defend his positions. The reason he's been afraid to do so is he has no answer when he's asked how to bring jobs back to America. He has no answer when he's asked how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism. This is a serious time. The American people want and deserve a serious leader focused on jobs, freedom, and security. That's exactly what I will be and what I will do as President."""

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 29, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: Britain Will Be at the Front of the Queue for a US Trade Deal,"HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed in The Times of London expressing his intent to strengthen, rather than compromise, the United States' special relationship with Britain regardless of the outcome of the vote on Brexit.Britain will be at the front of the queue for a US trade dealThe Times of LondonTed CruzInstead of standing with our allies President Obama routinely hurls insults at them. Sadly, it happened in London last Friday, when the President of the United States informed the British people they would be at the ""back of the queue"" for a US-UK free trade deal if they dared to vote to leave the EU on June 23. This was nothing less than a slap in the face of British self-determination as the president, typically, elevated an international organisation over the rights of a sovereign people.I believe Britain's future in Europe is a matter for the British people to decide. If Britain does vote to leave the EU, the United States should respect that decision  and treat it as an opportunity for our own country.If I am elected to be the next president of the United States, we will ensure that the special relationship is strengthened rather than weakened, and that America works closely with Great Britain to address the myriad challenges faced by the free world, from Islamist terrorism to a resurgent Russia.If Brexit takes place, Britain will be at the front of the line for a free trade deal with America, not at the back. There is a vast amount of trade, commerce and investment between our two nations. And, as I explained when I delivered the Margaret Thatcher Freedom Lecture in 2014: ""Such an agreement between the US and the UK would be an opportunity to mutually deregulate our economies  in contrast to the TTIP, which is proving an exercise in harmonising' regulations . . . Deregulation is a powerful, liberating economic force that can lead to significant economic growth  something Lady Thatcher understood all too well. Such an agreement can also be an aspirational model for other nations, encouraging them to look to bedrock principles of conservatism and individual liberty.""In marked contrast, Barack Obama has appeased America's enemies, and has taken every opportunity to curry favour with those who seek to threaten our interests. The reality is that Obama reserves his harshest language for our friends while offering generosity and platitudes to our enemies.Compare, for example, his menacing words in London last week with his cordial March 21 press conference alongside President Raul Castro in Cuba. Mr Obama refused to confront the vicious Castro dictatorship over its brutal torturing and jailing of political prisoners. He left unmentioned its systematic economic exploitation of its people. The Castros' half-century of sponsoring violent terrorism was ignored. Instead, the president praised ""the values that we share"" and spoke of a ""new hope for the future."" Most astoundingly, he affirmed ""that Cuba's destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation. Cuba is sovereign . . . and the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans, not by anybody else."" This could have been a ""tear down this wall"" moment, standing with the Cuban people fighting for their freedom. Instead it was an act of humiliating abasement before a grizzled tyrant who loathes America.As usual, Mr Obama has the situation exactly backwards. We should be respecting the rights of the British people to participate in their democratic process, and denouncing the Castros' illegitimate oppression of their own people. And rather than trying to eke some meagre profits out of Cuba's anaemic, state-run system, we should be exploiting the opportunity to partner with the far more powerful British economy.The British people will shape their destiny, and we will stand with them regardless of the outcome of the referendum. As president, I will work to ensure that our special relationship is reinvigorated  and the Obama doctrine of coddling tyrants while castigating democratic allies will finally be at an end."

Anthony (SBA) list applauded Ted Cruz for selecting Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate. SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser made the following remarks ""Carly Fiorina is the ideal choice for a Vice Presidential candidate. She will take Hillary Clinton head on. Carly is ideally suited to challenge Hillary Clinton's entire platform, especially issues related to women. ""Hillary has claimed the women's advocate' mantle, without offering any compelling fresh perspective. Carly on the other hand, has challenged and bested the entrenched feminist politicos who purport to advance women's rights even as they advance the usurpation of the rights of children.""In an article earlier this month, Dannelfelser had written, ""the best vice-presidential choice for any candidate is Carly Fiorina."" ""In her own presidential campaign, Fiorina emerged as a smart and tough leader with an impressive command of the issues. She demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of foreign and domestic policy that was firmly rooted in principle, and her classy campaign earned the respect of her supporters and opponents alike. Carly really is Hillary's worst nightmare.""As reported by SBA, the Susan B. Anthony List and its affiliated committees spent $16.71 million in the 2014 election cycle to defeat pro-abortion incumbents and elect pro-life candidates to federal and statewide office. The SBA List is a network of more than 465,000 pro-life Americans nationwide, emphasizing the education, promotion, mobilization, and election of pro-life women."

Ted Cruz,R,p,"April 30, 2016",Press Release - Trump Supports Top Democrats in California,"Thousands in Political Contributions to Extreme Liberals Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala HarrisHOUSTON, Texas - Donald Trump has financially supported the top three statewide elected Democrats in California, giving them thousands of dollars for various campaigns reaching back more than a decade. The current Democrat Governor Jerry Brown, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, and Attorney General Kamala Harris are perhaps the most liberal group of top state officials in the country, supporting numerous failed policies that have weakened the state's economy and security. Trump backed their various electoral bids against leaders in the California Republican Party.""Donald Trump has consistently financed the campaigns of some of the most liberal politicians in the country,"" said presidential candidate Ted Cruz. ""California is perhaps one of the more egregious examples. From supporting high taxes and heavy regulation to amnesty and sanctuary cities, the top three officials in California have been a disaster for the state. A number of qualified Republican candidates ran to fix California's problems, but Trump decided to back liberal Democrats against them. This is an insult to every Republican candidate, activist, official and volunteer who spent countless hours knocking doors, filling envelopes, making calls, and raising money to prevent these far-left liberal extremists from taking office. It is a betrayal to all that Republicans across California have worked for.""In 2004 and 2006, Trump helped reignite Brown's career with $3500 in donations to his campaign for Attorney General. He gave $2500 to America's most liberal mayor, Gavin Newsom, in 2009 to boost his political bid for higher office. And shockingly, Kamala Harris, the Queen of Sanctuary Cities, received $6000 from Trump in 2011 and 2013 to run as California's chief law enforcement officer. Trump has not donated to the CAGOP since 2005.The results have been disastrous for California. The Golden State ranks 48th on the Tax Foundation's State Business Climate Index. Burdened by some of the highest taxes and heaviest regulations in the country, businesses and jobs are fleeing to states like Utah and Texas. California's unemployment rate remains higher than the national average.California's support for amnesty and sanctuary cities has encouraged lawlessness and threatened the lives of its citizens. In 2015, Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times, but was living in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. After the murder sparked national outrage, Ted Cruz introduced ""Kate's Law"" to stiffen penalties for illegal aliens reentering the country."

Mike Pence: Why I will vote for Ted Cruz,"HOUSTON, Texas- Indiana Governor Mike Pence today penned the following op-ed in theIndy Starin support of presidential candidate Ted Cruz as the leader who will restore constitutional liberties and bring back jobs and opportunity.Why I will vote for Ted CruzIndy StarGov. Mike PenceOn Tuesday, the eyes of the nation will focus on Indiana as Hoosiers head to the polls to play a critical role in the selection of candidates vying to serve as the next president of the United States. It has been a true joy to watch the people of our state play host to candidates from both parties and for Hoosiers of all backgrounds and beliefs to share their thoughts about the future of this great nation. To lead is to choose and this is our state's time for choosing.I had the pleasure to meet with all three candidates running for the Republican nomination and to hear their plans for America. We discussed the great progress taking place in Indiana's economy and how our state needs a partner in the White House.In making my decision to support Ted, I am guided by the principles best espoused by former President Ronald Reagan. I am a Reagan Republican; drawn to his vision of less taxes, less government, traditional values and a strong military. Ted articulates that same agenda with an unwavering devotion to our Constitution, the sanctity of life, and the freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights.Ted's plan to lower and simplify taxes also favors manufacturers: they pay no tax on exports, encouraging more companies to come to Indiana and the rest of America's heartland, rather than transport jobs overseas.Indiana needs a partner as president who will reform the burgeoning regulatory state that has cost good-paying jobs while increasing the cost of living for hardworking Americans. President Obama's Clean Power Plan and Hillary Clinton's promised war on coal, with the support of Democrat gubernatorial candidate John Gregg, is projected to eliminate thousands of mining jobs in southwest Indiana, 20,000 manufacturing jobs across the entire state, and increase Hoosier's electric bills by 16%.Ted has a plan to eliminate excessive government programs and has taken on big-government overreach. He led the fight to repeal Obamacare, one of the greatest burdens on families and small businesses and I have no doubt he will follow through in checking government power to restore prosperity to the people.This is an exciting time for Hoosiers. The eyes of the nation are looking to Indiana to make a choice. I encourage every Hoosier to evaluate each of the candidates and exercise your right to vote in the May 3 Primary. My vote goes to Ted Cruz because he is a principled conservative who will work to protect our constitutional liberties, bring back better-paying jobs, and serve all Americans with the character and judgment needed to revive our national strength."
