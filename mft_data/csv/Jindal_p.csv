Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Bobby's Top Eight Op-Eds on Repealing Obamacare,"Repeal All of Obamacare? Nah, Just KiddingFebruary 25, 2015""If you are one of those unsophisticated voters out there in America who thought that you voted for Republican candidates last November so that they will repeal and replace Obamacare, I have bad news for you  Many of the ""thinkers"" on the Republican or conservative side in Washington are too scared to do it.""The GOP Mustn't Offer Obamacare LiteFebruary 1, 2015""There is a secret that people outside of Washington, D.C., aren't aware of right now: Some Republicans in Congress are on the verge of proposing an alternative to Obamacare that imposes new tax hikes on the American people.""Another Broken Promise: Obamacare and AbortionSeptember 23, 2014""It was bound to happen. After all the secret deals with special interests and Cornhusker Kickbacks used to pass Obamacare, after the extralegal waivers of Obamacare's new insurance regulationsa majority of which went to participants in union plansafter the multiple delays of an insurance mandate for big businessbut not for individualsyou just knew that Planned Parenthood and the pro-abortion lobby would get their political payback for supporting the Democrat machine.""Your health care: Obama's $18,000 broken promiseJuly 15, 2014""... The administration also now claims that Obamacare is working, because premiums are ""only"" rising by 6 or 8 percent per year. But that's not what then-candidate Obama himself promised in 2008; he spoke frequently of ""cutting,"" ""reducing,"" and ""lowering"" premium costs. Whether premiums go up by 1 percent or 101 percent, any increase represents a promise broken.""Yes, we can still repeal ObamaCare  let's get to workMay 19, 2014""Many families struggling with rising premiums and co-payments might believe that they will never see relief. But the notion that we can't slow the growth of health spending is just as fanciful as the idea that ObamaCare cannot be repealed. The only reason we can't accomplish both objectives is political willbecause Washington needs a Beltway-sized reality check.""What Hillary KnewIn 1993May 13, 2014""It is a well-known fact that Clinton came to strenuously support an individual health insurance mandate in her 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama. Less well-remembered, however, is that Clinton considered an employer mandatenot an individual mandatethe best way to achieve ""universal coverage"" in her health care task force's ill-fated 1993 proposal, put forth while she was first lady.""Obamacare Is Anything But CompassionateFebruary 9, 2014""Obamacare's Medicaid expansion doesn't just discourage work; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities. That's a dirty little secret the Obama administration and its liberal allies, in their rush to expand government-funded health coverage to millions more Americans, won't tell you. And it's yet another reason why states should resist the siren song of the administration and its leftist supporters, who plan to spend 2014 persuading them to embrace the expansion.""Obamacare flaws go beyond its executionNov 27, 2013""For two years in Washington, President Obama and left-wing radicals ran wild. The result  Obamacare  a new federal entitlement program leading to government-run health care. We're now starting to see the fruits of this disastrous policy in a website filled with glitches."""
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Repeal and Replace Obamacare,President Obama's grand program has failed to deliverreal healthcare outcomes that America needs. I am the only presidential candidate who has a detailed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with a conservative and effective alternative. We must empower patients rather than bureaucrats. My healthcare plan focuses on patient freedom and reducing costs. Sign the petition if you believe we can repeal and replace Obamacare.
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Top Achievements as Governor,"Government on a Diet:When Bobby took office, Louisiana state government was bloated, inefficient and far too expansive. The Governor went to work trimming the excess and giving the taxpayer more bang for their buck. Since 2007, Bobby has cut state government workers by 34%; over 30,000 bureaucrats. Along with cutting unnecessary employees,Jindal cut the total overall Louisiana budget by 26%. The tough fiscal decisions the governor made have been rewarded with 8 consecutive credit upgrades, highest in recent state history.Homecoming Dance:In the 25 years leading up to the Jindal taking office, Louisiana kept losing citizens to neighboring states and beyond because jobs weren't available. Since Governor Jindal took office 7 years ago, the pattern of out migration has been reversed, with more people moving to Louisiana than leaving it. Today, Louisiana has more people living and working in the state than ever before, with the highest incomes in the history of the state. Conservative governing works.Now Hiring:Under his administration, economic development wins have resulted in more than 91,000 new jobsand more than $62 billion in private capital investment. Louisiana now ranks higher in every national business-climate ranking than it ever did prior to January 2008. Today in Louisiana, more than 2 million people are working  the highest number in Louisiana history.School's in Session:One of the lasting legacies of the Jindal years will be education reform. Children can only grow up once, so Bobby took on the tough task of implementing a major K-12 education system overhaul. Governor Jindal made education reform his top priority and pushed a bold plan to provide more choices for families, reward quality teachers, increase school accountability, and give school leaders more flexibility with funding and personnel. Louisiana now has a statewide school choice scholarship program that gives parents the option to remove their children from a failing school and enroll them in a new school of their choice. What resulted is nothing short of a miracle. The number of failing schools fell by 50% and high school graduation rates rose to an all-time high. The statistic that cannot be measured is the number of parents who are no longer scared for their children in school, or the number of children who are looking at furthering their education after graduation.An Ethical Dilemma:Louisiana has a checkered and colorful past when it comes to political corruption. Numerous politicians have been convicted of corruption, fraud and a litany of other charges. Businesses were afraid to invest in Louisiana because under corrupt state leaders, far too often, who you know is more important than what you know. Ethics was a top priority for Bobby and shortly after taking office he called a special session to address comprehensive ethics reform, immediately fulfilling a campaign promise and removing a blemish that had marked Louisiana for far too long. Since the conclusion of that special session, the Better Government Association and the Center for Public Integrity announced that Louisiana's new ethics laws are among the best in the nation. Money Back Guarantee:When wasteful spending gets reigned in, and a government starts to run efficiently and effectively, more money can stay with the taxpayer. In 2008, Governor Jindal enacted the largest single tax cut in Louisiana history by lowering income tax rates and restoring the full deduction for excess federal itemized personal deductions. This tax cut was estimated to save Louisiana taxpayers more than $1.1 billion over five years and save individual taxpayers as much as $500 per year. This was one of the dozens of times Bobby has cut burdensome taxes for the people and businesses of Louisiana. Governor Jindal has signed tax cuts into law totaling more than $2 billion."
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Bobby's Top Five Op-Eds on Education,"An education system for the 21st centuryFebruary 25, 2015""We need to create a modern educational system for the modern challenges future generations will face  a competitive, interconnected global economy, where students from Charleston and Baton Rouge will compete with those from Chengdu and Bombay. Creating that system involves reforms large and small  but three guiding principles.""School choice week is freedom weekJanuary 29, 2015""On the most basic level, school choice represents the freedom to choose  empowering parents to select the best educational options for their sons and daughters. That could be a charter school, a private school, a religious school, home schooling, or even online learning. Governments should provide parents with the personalized and individualized tools they need to help their children excel academically.""Why I fight for local control of educationJuly 23, 2014""... there is one issue we have tackled that stands out to me above all others  education reform  specifically, our efforts to put a great teacher in every classroom and to fight for equal opportunity in education for Louisiana children. We have made great strides on this front, but there is still much room for improvement. Our kids only grow up once, and we only have one shot at providing a child with access to a great teacher and a quality education.""What's Obama's Problem With School Choice?July 8, 2014""Why would the federal Department of Justice cite the Civil Rights Act and the specter of segregation to try and block a school choice program where more than nine in 10 participants come from racial minority groups? Or use the Americans with Disabilities Act to claim another school voucher program discriminates against individuals with disabilities, without so much as a single complaint from a student or parent to prove their case?""Obama should drop suit opposing school choiceSeptember 4, 2013""The Justice Department has challenged my state in court for having the temerity to start a scholarship program that frees low-income minority children from failing schools. In other words, Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder would rip children out of their schools and handcuff them to the failing schools they previously attended. And, in the ultimate irony, they are using desegregation orders set up to prevent discrimination against minority children to try to do it."""
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Let's Shrink the Government and Grow the Private Sector,"The Federal Government bankrolls so many unnecessary and opulent programs, yet it constantly fails to accomplish it's basic duties, and the private sector suffers as a result.

This is gravely concerning."" -Bobby Jindal 07/08/15America's stature in the world has drastically diminished.

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"June 24, 2015",Press Release - Seven Things You Didn't Know About Bobby,"He first asked his wife out in HS. She said no:In high school, Bobby asked Supriya out, but was kindly turned down. Both of them moved on, graduated high school and went on to college, Bobby to Brown and then on to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, while Supriya got a chemical engineering degree and an MBA from Tulane. In 1996, when his Mardi Gras ball date cancelled, Bobby found Supriya's number, called her and left a message saying, ""If you're married, delete the rest of this message, but if you're not, give me a call back."" A few months later Bobby proposed, and the rest is history.Call me Bobby:Growing up, Governor Jindal loved The Brady Bunch. Everyday after school he would watch, and instantly identified with the youngest Brady boy, Bobby. As a 4 year old, the Governor decided to rename himself after his favorite TV character. One day his teacher told his mother, 'Well, your son has got a new name.' His self-imposed nickname stuck and he has been Bobby Jindal ever since. Daily Routine:Being governor and being a dad is a non-stop job. Natural disasters, baseball games, last second meetings; no two days are the same. Try as he might, the new challenges each day brings can't be predicted. In the midst of the job, two things are consistent in keeping the governor going: daily exercise... and daily chocolate chip cookies. Bobby starts each morning with a hard workout, and recovers with a recovery meal of chocolate, carbs and sugar. Bobby is a scientific anomaly; and scientists should probably study him. Dr. Jindal:Growing up, Bobby's dad always told him he could study whatever he wanted to in college. When Bobby inquired about studying, history, or philosophy or art history, his father replied, ""No you can be whatever kind of doctor you want to be."" Growing up, Bobby always planned on being a doctor, but in college as a pre-med student, he took more of an interest in healthcare policy than healthcare practice. Father Jindal:Bobby was raised Hindu, and converted to Christianity in high school. When he received a personalized Bible as a birthday present he dismissed it as a boring gift that he couldn't even re-gift. Friends grew tired of trying to convert him, but they didn't give up. Throughout high school, Bobby wrestled with the Lord and the work that He was doing in his life. He dug out his Bible and read it cover to cover. In high school, while watching a grainy film about the Crucifixion of Jesus, Bobby surrendered his life to Christ and has never looked back. Dr. Jindal Part 2:While Bobby never attended medical school, that didn't stop him from successfully delivering a baby in 2006. It wasn't just any baby, but his youngest son Slade. Meticulous planning was thrown out, and speeding to the hospital wasn't an option. With a little coaching from the 911 operators, Bobby delivered a healthy 8-pound baby boy in his bathroom.Snack shopIn high school, Bobby could be seen at LSU home football games, not because his family had season tickets, but because he worked in the concession stands. It was just another example of Bobby working for everything he ever got."

The Governor went on the show by satellite from the campaign trail to discuss the ACLU lawsuit that was filed against his executive order protecting religious freedom rights. You can watch a clip of the interview here.Governor Jindal said, ""We did the executive order on May 19th in anticipation of the Court's awful ruling. I think their long game is, the ACLU used to be for religious freedom before they were against it. I think they want to get to a point where we no longer have First Amendment religious freedom rights... The ACLU, on their website, says religious liberty is a fundamental right. Here's the hypocrisy: they've actually used Louisiana's Religious Freedom Information Act (RFRA) to defend the rights of other religious minorities, and good for them for doing that  but now that it's evangelical Christians, now that it is Catholics who object to redefining marriage, who are simply saying we don't want to participate in weddings that violate our conscience and our beliefs, now the ACLU is saying you can't have the same rights, the same First Amendment protections we want for other religious minorities... I think the Left wants to take God out of the public square, I think they want to redefine America to a much more secular society."""

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"July 22, 2015",Press Release - Op-Ed: It's Time to Stop Pretending on Radical Islam,"Op-Ed by Gov. Bobby Jindal in Conservative ReviewLet's be honest here. The President's inability to say the words Radical Islam is threatening our national security and the safety of the American people. It's time to stop pretending.Radical Islam has brought terror and death across the Middle East and the worldand on American soil  yet this president calls it just ""violent extremism"" or something similar. He gets it wrong nearly every time.Yesterday, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron got it right. He had the courage to say what President Obama will not, when he said that, ""We need to confront and expose Islamist extremism as a belief system that glorifies violence and subjugates people."" This leaves President Obama as pretty much the only leader in the free world who refuses to speak the truth about Radical Islam.Our President's political correctness and fear of speaking the truth are no longer amusing, they are just plain dangerous, because you cannot defeat an enemy you refuse to name.President Obama cannot claim to be working with our allies when he refuses to join them in naming our common enemy. He has proven himself incapable as Commander-in-Chief.This is one case where President Obama should lead from behind  he should follow the lead of our British ally, name the enemy and resolve to destroy Radical Islam.Defeating Radical Islam can be done and must be done. It will take American leadership and military strength, and it will take leadership from Muslim leaders as well as the West. Right now, we have neither.This is one case where President Obama should lead from behind  he should follow the lead of our British ally, name the enemy and resolve to destroy Radical Islam.We also must strengthen our immigration policy. If people want to come to America in order to use our freedoms to undermine our freedoms  we have the absolute right to say no thanks. This should be obvious to everyone and is basic common sense.If you claim that you want to carry out these attacks because of your so-called religion, that's ridiculous and we don't have an obligation to honor your request. There are many American citizens who are Muslim and who believe in America, and they are tremendous.But let's not pretend that there are not many people in the world today who are Radical Islamists  who use their religion to justify savage violence and treating women like property.We should not let people like that immigrate to our country, we would be fools to do that. And only a lemming would fail to see that Europe has a terrible problem in this regard.They have too many immigrants who do not want to assimilate into their culture, but instead want to establish their own culture and laws in direct opposition. That is just fact, and everyone knows it, and I will not be intimidated on this.We have no idea how many people are being wooed by Radical Islam, with the sick and deceitful promise of glory in the afterlife if they will murder innocent people.Frankly, our President needs to be honest about it and take action to protect our people. That's his job.He must also call on Islamic leaders to do more than simply condemn violence. We have no idea how many people are being wooed by Radical Islam, with the sick and deceitful promise of glory in the afterlife if they will murder innocent people. Muslim leaders must make clear that anyone who commits acts of terror in the name of Islam is in fact not a martyr who will enjoy a reward in the afterlife, but rather is going straight to Hell. If they refuse to say this, then they are condoning these acts of barbarism. There is no middle ground.Islamic leaders must put a stop to this, and it's not too much to ask.But President Obama has failed to demand this of Islamic leaders. Instead, he hides behind political correctness. He's afraid of calling a spade a spade, but it's simply stating the truth. And the reality is that Radical Muslim leaders benefit from this free pass. They can continue wooing followers with the siren song of a new caliphate and glorious afterlife. This must come to an end.One of the great things about America is it doesn't matter if you've been here five minutes or a hundred years. For the most part, folks that come here want to be Americans. They understand and value that America offers an opportunity at a better life. They join our military, they start companies, and they work to create a better community. That is the American Dream.What's not acceptable is people that want to come and conquer us. These immigrants want to come here and change our fundamental culture and values and set up their own. That's not immigration, it's invasion.Of course, the politically correct crowd will call you a racist for saying things like that. But it's reality. This is the particular threat we face. And if we're not serious about this, we're going to see more lone-wolf actors.Europe has learned this lesson the hard way. They have not assimilated many of their immigrant populations and the result is that there are pockets of immigrant communities that never really ""get"" what the country they've moved to is all about. That is not America. In America, we are all Americans because being American is about a set of values: hard work, freedom, and opportunity.But the first step to fixing this problem is identifying it. We first have to call Radical Islam what it isevil. I hope the President steps up, does the right thing and helps us defeat Radical Islam once and for all."

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"August 21, 2015",Press Release - Jindal: Time for Republican Party to Man-Up,"Today, Governor Jindal will address the Defending the American Dream Summit hosted by Americans for Prosperity. He will say it is time for the Republican Party to man-up and embrace it's own conservative principles, instead of caving to the demands of the left. He will specifically call out Governor Scott Walker for proposing a new health care entitlement program that provides universal coverage. Below the excerpts is a graphic that illustrates the similarities between Obamacare and Governor Walker's new entitlement program. The graphic also shows how Governor Jindal's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is different  it focuses on using the free market to lower health costs rather than provide universal coverage, and it lays out how the plan will be paid for (unlike Governor Walker's new entitlement program).EXCERPTS FROM JINDAL AFP SPEECHI'm going to switch gears now and speak very frankly about what it means to stand up for conservative ideals. I introduced a replacement plan for Obamacare last year...and I've been calling on other candidates to write their own plans and release them...finally...Governor Walker did that this week. Every person running for President should tell the voters what his or her plan to replace Obamacare is.I want to see if we can establish some common ground here today, so let me take an informal poll of the audience on some big picture principles regarding health care and Obamacare.How many of you agree that we should NOT create a new federal entitlement program, when we can't pay for the ones we already have?  Looks like an overwhelming majority.  How many disagree? Not many, as long as the reporters here don't get a vote.How many of you agree that the federal government should NOT pay for Universal Coverage for every person in America? Looks like a big majority.  How many disagree and believe that the government should pay for Universal Coverage for every person in America? Not many, I don't know where the Democrat Party trackers are, but I assume they raised their hands.Well folks, I have good news and I have bad news.The good news is that my health care plan does NOT create a new federal entitlement program, and my plan does NOT try to mimic Obamacare's pledge of government spending to give universal coverage for all. In fact, my plan attacks the real problem with American health care  which is not access, it is cost.And now the bad news....Scott Walker's plan does create a new federal entitlement, and it does provide universal coverage with a guarantee of government coverage for everyone. His plan would likely cost over 1 Trillion dollars, and he does not indicate how he would pay for it, which of course is the Washington way.But I'm going to stop picking on Walker and make a much bigger point to you all here today. We have to stand up for our principles, we have to stop being intimidated and bullied by the left. You've heard Jeb Bush say that we have to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general election. Let me translate that into English for you  that is the establishment in Washington telling us we have to hide our conservative views in order to try to get the left and the media to like us, so we can win the election. That is nonsense and it won't work.If we try that again, we will lose again, and we will deserve to lose.When did we decide to quite fighting for our conservative ideals? When did we throw in the towel? I didn't get the memo on that. Conservative ideals haven't' died out here in America...but they are dead in Washington. The so called conservatives in Washington are too scared to get rid of this entitlement programThey were relieved when we lost the Supreme Court case against ObamacareThey are too scared to oppose universal coverageThey are too scared to believe in the free marketThey are too scared to stand up for freedomThey are too scared to break the yoke of government dependence. Here's the sad truth  The so-called conservatives in DC aren't very conservatives any more. There's a better way  we can endorse our own principles for a change. We can win this election and win this century by embracing freedom, embracing economic growth. Obama and Clinton want to turn the American Dream into the European Nightmare. Government dependence is not the American Dream. That's not what my parents came to America for. The American Dream is Independence and freedom and growth and opportunity for all. That's the American Dream and it's time for the Republican Party to man-up and boldly claim it."

The Chinese market dropped 8% overnight, leading to the Dow and S&P; 500 falling 5% and Nasdaq falling 8% within the first few minutes of opening this morning. European markets were down 4% by early afternoon their time.Governor Jindal will say:""By increasing taxes and creating new entitlements when we can't afford the ones we've got, the Obama administration has structurally weakened our economy. Flooding the markets with printed dollar bills is a recipe for short term gains, followed by volatility and losses.""While there are always ups and downs in the markets, Obama's policies will crash our economy; it's only a matter of time.""The Obama economy is a house of cards built on sand, with anemic growth and record numbers of Americans not even in the work force. If we don't change course, our economy will eventually crumble, it's basic math.""Why? It's because we've doubled our national debt, increased our taxes, and massively grown the size of the federal government.""We cannot grow the government economy and the American economy at the same time. You have to choose. Obama and Clinton chose the government economy, I choose the American economy.Governor Jindal will also tell voters what he will do as President to right the course of our economy:""I will do four things to undo the damage done by the Obama economy:Lower individual rates;Lower corporate tax rates;Fire the EPA and let America become the world's superpower on energy; andShrink the federal government - not slow the rate of growth, but actually cut it in real terms.\t""I'm the only one who has done it. The other 8 governors running all say they will shrink government as President, but they didn't do it as Governor, and it's even harder as President. It is nave and absurd to believe that people who failed to cut government as Governor will somehow magically do it as President. I did it, they did not. I will, they will not.""We cannot choose between Hillary Clinton continuing the Obama economy and a Republican who will just be a cheaper version of the Democrats.

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"September 9, 2015","Press Release - Trump is ""Winning""",
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"September 10, 2015",Press Release - Text: Jindal Speech on Donald Trump,"I. INTRODUCTIONToday I'm going to put my own political mission aside and talk about something more important than myself, more important than any single candidate or person.Our country is slipping away right before our very eyes. We are descending down the path to socialism, dependence on government is becoming the new American Dream, we are unfazed by the selling of body parts as commodities, and we are pathetically weak in international affairs. America is slipping away, right in front of us in real time.And yet this is a moment of great opportunity for America. This is a time when we can make dramatic changes, we can embrace conservative ideals, and we can literally turn our country around.I believe the country is ready for that. You can see it in people's eyes, you can read it in the polls, America is ready for a politically incorrect conservative revolution.The liberalism and incompetence of the Obama Administration have pushed us to the edge, to the point where you can literally see the idea of America slipping away  and people are dreading it, and they are ready to stop that from happening.The American people have a massive appetite for a rebirth, a massive appetite for making America Great again.So that is the context and the reason for what I'm going to say next.II. I like The Idea of Donald TrumpI like the idea of a DC outsider.I like that he doesn't care about political correctness.I like the fact that he says things people are thinking but are afraid to say.I like that he uses Ronald Reagan's theme of making America Great Again.Trump's diagnoses is correct  the professional political class in Washington, including the Republicans, is incompetent and full of nonsense. He is right. The political class in Washington has abandoned us. Trump has performed an important service by taking on the political class and exposing them for being completely full of nonsense.III. But, here's the problem. Donald Trump is also full of nonsense.Don't get me wrong  His act is tremendous. It's a sellout show, and I've enjoyed it.I laughed out loud when he read Lindsey Graham's cell number on live TV.I got a kick out of him giving kids helicopter rides at the Iowa state fairAnd I was amused when he said the people at Jeb's townhall were sleeping.But, it is now time for us to do what Donald would do, and say the thing that everyone is thinking, but is afraid to say out loud. So I'm going to do it.The Donald Trump Act is great, and the idea of Donald Trump is great  BUT the reality of Donald Trump is absurd, he's a non-serious carnival act.IV. So here's the truth about Trump that we all know, but have been afraid to say....Donald Trump is shallow. Has no understanding of policy. He's full of bluster but has no substance. He lacks the intellectual curiosity to even learn.It's silly to argue policy with this guy, he's doesn't know anything about it, he has no idea what he is talking about, he makes it all up on the fly. According to him his health care plan will be ""fabulous"" and his tax plan will be ""really, really terrific."" He's shallow, no substance.He does not believe in limited government and he has told us that over and over. From his belief in socialized medicine to his desire for tax increases, he's told us over and over that he's got no problem with big top-down style government. He's only got one real problem with Washington  that he's not running it.Donald Trump is for Donald Trump. He believes in nothing other than himself. He's not a liberal, he's not a moderate, and he's not a conservative. He's not a Republican, Democrat, or Independent. He's not for anything or against anything. Issues and policies and ideals are not important to him. He's for Donald.Donald Trump is a narcissist and an egomaniac. That may sound like a serious charge to make, but it is also something that everyone knows to be true, and he knows it too, and he celebrates it. He told us the other day that he's likes Kanye West, why? ""Because Kanye loves Trump."" He may be an entertaining narcissist, but he is one nonetheless.Like all narcissists, Donald Trump is insecure and weak, and afraid of being exposed. And that's why he is constantly telling us how big and how rich and how great he is, and how insignificant everyone else is. We've all met people like Trump, and we know that only a very weak and small person needs to constantly tell us how strong and powerful he is. Donald Trump believes that he is the answer to every question.Donald Trump is But not in the way you think. Many say he's dangerous because you wouldn't want a hot head with his fingers on the nuclear codes. And while that's true, that's not the real danger here.The real danger is that, ironically, Donald Trump could destroy America's chance to be Great Again.As conservatives, we have a golden opportunity in front of us. The Democrats have terribly screwed things up, and are basically giving us the next election.If we blow this opportunity  we may never get it again, the stakes are incredibly high.Donald Trump is not a serious person. It's all a solo act, it's all just a show, and the joke is on us. He's laughing all the way to the bank, or to the polling location. P.T. Barnum was never more right.You may have recently seen that after Trump said the Bible is his favorite book, he couldn't name a single Bible verse or passage that meant something to him. And we all know why, because it's all just a show, and he hasn't ever read the Bible. But you know why he hasn't read the Bible? Because he's not in it.V.CONCLUSION  Now What?The Democrats have practically gift wrapped this election for us. It's as if they know they've run the country into the ground, and they are running their worst possible candidate who is running the worst possible campaign.The whole thing is set up for us to win  and yet we are flirting with nominating a non-serious, unstable, substance-free narcissist.Nominating Donald Trump is a certain way for us to miss our opportunity to make America Great Again.Summer is over, it's time to get serious about saving our country. It's time to send Donald Trump back to reality TV  it's time to tell Donald Trump  it's been great, you've been great for ratings, you are almost as fun as Don Rickles, the show has been a blast.We do in fact need to make America Great Again. We do in fact need to fire everybody in Washington. We do in fact need to get rid of political correctness. That is all true. And we can make America Great again. But we will not do that by putting an unserious and unstable narcissist in the White House.Our country is worth saving, and this is our time to save it.The conservative cause deserves more than a power-hungry shark who eats whatever is in front of him...because sooner or later, we will be his next meal.This is our moment, this is our time. We can win right now, or we can be the biggest fools of all time and put our faith not in our principles, but in one egomaniacal madman who has no principles.If we nominate him, he will self-destruct in a massive way in a general election. He may be Hillary Clinton's only hope.Even worse, if you are a conservative, it wouldn't matter if he won. He believes in nothing, we have no idea what he would do.It's time to get serious about making America Great Again, so it's time for Donald Trump to take the ride down his own elevator  It's time to tell Donald Trump  no, we will not put an egomaniacal unserious person in the White House  ""you're fired"".We have to put a committed conservative in the White House who will make our country great again and will ignore the professional political class in Washington.Donald Trump's campaign is not about making America Great Again, it is about making Donald Trump Great.Obviously I think I am the right man for the job, but the voters will make that decision. America is ready for a politically incorrect conservative revolution."

Louisianians, and people across America, will not be fooled.""After all, Secretary Clinton is the godmother of socialized medicine. The government takeover of our healthcare system started with HillaryCare in the 1990's.""Obamacare was sold to the American people based on lies that it would improve quality and lower costs. It has done none of that and needs to be repealed. Secretary Clinton started spouting these same lies two decades ago so I am sure she will have no problem continuing to market ObamaCare the same way President Obama did.""I have a plan that repeals Obamacare and replaces it with something that preserves freedom, empowers patients, lowers costs and reduces the role of both federal government and insurance company bureaucrats.""Instead of battling through press releases though, I have an idea for Hillary Clinton, let's have a debate about healthcare.

Today's post is inspired by the #ILookLikeAnEngineer movement which showcases diversity in the field of engineering. Mrs. Jindal is the only First Spouse in the country that holds a degree in engineering. As a mother of three young children, Supriya has taken an interest in issues regarding children's education and enjoys encouraging children to build a strong foundation in math and science - no matter what path they hope to pursue in life. She is also the founder of the Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana's Children, a foundation that seeks to foster an interest in science and math among Louisiana's students. Why did you become an engineer?At a young age, I felt drawn to math and science. The idea of innovation and its impact on our lives truly inspired me. I am also blessed with several engineers in the family, including my father, who helped show me the power of engineering. Why is STEM/STEAM so important?For Louisiana, and the United States to be competitive in a global economy, our children must have a solid foundation in math and science. Vital industries to our economy, our security and our wellbeing such as defense, medical, pharmaceutical and agriculture all need a new generation of thinkers to stay on the cutting edge.What is the key to getting students immersed in STEM/STEAM?Like anything, you need to make it fun. One of the things we have really tried to do with the Jindal Foundation is to encourage hands on learning and bringing interactive tools into as many Louisiana classrooms as possible. You also need to make STEM/STEAM relatable. That helps show how important it is. We have welcomed engineers from NASA, The Dow Chemical Company, LSU and other great companies to help us give students hands-on demonstrations which help them to realize that math and science is all around them. It's exciting.Tell us a little bit about the Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana's ChildrenI created the Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana's Children to harness the power of technology in Louisiana classrooms, to emphasize the importance of science and math, and to help develop the Louisiana workforce of tomorrow.Through the generosity of many wonderful partners, the Foundation has raised over $2.3 million to positively impact over 1,200 classrooms across Louisiana, brought twenty-first century learning tools into classrooms, encouraged students to pursue careers in math and science, promoted healthy lifestyles, donated school supplies to children affected by the Oil Spill, inspired a love for reading and offered new parents guidance regarding the development of their young child. With these initiatives, the Foundation was able to directly impact almost 300,000 people!"
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"September 28, 2015",Press Release - Jindal Slams 'Trumpcare'  Government Dependence for All,"BATON ROUGE  On 60 Minutes Sunday, Donald Trump made one thing perfectly clear  he supports a new federal entitlement program to give free government funded health care to every American. This is how the Donald described 'Trumpcare' on 60 Minutes:Scott Pelley: Universal health care.Donald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.Scott Pelley: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How?Donald Trump: They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably-Scott Pelley: Make a deal? Who pays for it?Donald Trump: -the government's gonna pay for it....Governor Jindal said, ""In other words, Trump agrees with Obama and Clinton on the government takeover of health care, he agrees with Obama and Clinton on the need for socialized medicine.""Policy disagreements are part of politics of course. But this is not just some random policy difference. This is a basic question of whether we as a country will continue the Obama slide toward government dependence, or whether we as a country will embrace personal freedom and responsibility.""Trump has of course endorsed socialized medicine in the past, but in the past he has also endorsed abortion, Hillary Clinton, the Democrat Party, and every other liberal thing you can think of. It was good of Trump to reaffirm his support for the government takeover of health care for Republican primary voters. This will likely accelerate Trump's downward slide in the polls. ""Gov. Jindal remains the only Presidential candidate who has written a health care plan."

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"October 1, 2015",Press Release - Jindal: Donald Trump Doesn't Get it. Health Care is the GOP's Alamo,"In December last year, The People's Republic of Vermont, the only state that sends a self-described socialist to the U.S. Senate, rejected a proposal from Democrats for a single payer health care system, because it was just too expensive.They had ignored a basic economic principle: socialism doesn't work because, to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, Britain's ""Iron Lady,"" you always run out of other people's money.Sunday on ""60 Minutes,"" he made it clear that he supports the government takeover of health care and wants to give free care to every American.He announced he will ""...take care of everybody..."" promising that ""...the government's gonna pay for it.""Putting aside the implications of ""TrumpCare"" for our taxes, economic growth and the national debt, the implications for conservatism are deadly.The Republican presidential primary is being dominated by someone who agrees with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton about the defining domestic policy issue of our time.The problem is this: Donald Trump is not a conservative. If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy. He inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us.The danger is, if he persuades Americans that government controlled health care is acceptable, he will have opened the door for a nanny state and made the Republican Party irrelevant.It would hand the Left a rationale for interference in every aspect of our lives. If government pays for your health care, they will claim it should have a say in your lifestyle: whether you smoke or drink, your salt and sugar intake, how you exercise and even whether you own a firearm. It would be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's big gulp campaign  supersized.Since our country's founding, the bulwark against socialism's empty promises and this kind of state control, has been the good sense of the American people and the steel spines of conservatives.Yet almost eight years of the Obama presidency and the passage of ObamaCare has put that defense in jeopardy. Not because Democrats are suddenly winning the argument, but because Republicans have stopped fighting.The Washington establishment is telling us that we must accept a 'post-ObamaCare reality,' that the government should ensure coverage for every American.Now the establishment is enabling Donald Trump with their silence and making him think his position is acceptable.Even conservative senators like Ted Cruz are complicit. He has distinguished himself by praising Trump's positions and clinging to his events, in the hope of picking up his votes when he eventually fades.Read the full Op-Ed"

How did we get to this place?These shootings are a symptom of deep and serious cultural decay in our society.Let that sink in for a minute.These acts of evil are a direct result of cultural rot, and it is cultural rot that we have brought upon ourselves, and then we act like we are confounded and perplexed by what is happening here.Consider the following brew of decay, and you will realize exactly what is happening here:We glorify sick and senseless acts of violence in virtually every element of our pop culture, and we have been doing that for at least a generation.Our movies and TV shows feature a continuous stream of grotesque killing of every kind imaginable. And this is true of virtually every genre, from horror to drama to comedy.We celebrate and document every kind of deviant behavior and we give out awards to producers who can push the envelope as far as possible. Rape, torture, murder, mass murder, all are cinematic achievements.Our music does the same thing, we promote evil, we promote the degradation of women, we flaunt the laws of God and common decency and we promote it all and we flood our young people with it.We have generations of young boys who were raised on video games where they compete with other young boys around the country and the world to see who can kill the most humans. We make it so fun, so realistic, so sensational.We devalue human life, we have no regard for the sanctity of human life in any regard, from the unborn, to the old, and to every single person in between, we devalue it and act as if we have almost no regard for humanity.Our families are a complete mess, and we have raised tens of millions of young boys who will never become real men because they have no values whatsoever, they have no truth in their lives, and they have no regard for common decency.Oh, we make sure that we stop them from bullying at school, but we are completely fine with them watching people get murdered and raped on the internet after school, and we are willing to let them go to the basement and join a fantasy world where they pretend they are killing people for 2 hours after school.And who is it that generally commits these evil acts of mass murder that are becoming routine? It's almost always young men who have either no father figure in their lives, or a broken relationship with their father. Is this just a coincidence? Of course not.Now, let's get really politically incorrect here and talk specifically about this horror in Oregon. This killer's father is now lecturing us on the need for gun control and he says he has no idea how or where his son got the guns.Of course he doesn't know. You know why he doesn't know? Because he is not, and has never been in his son's life. He's a complete failure as a father, he should be embarrassed to even show his face in public. He's the problem here.He brags that he has never held a gun in his life and that he had no idea that his son had any guns. Why didn't he know? Because he failed to raise his son. He should be ashamed of himself, and he owes us all an apology.When he was asked what his relationship was with his son, he said he hadn't seen him in a while because he lived with his mother. Case Closed.This mess is not nearly as complicated as we pretend.It's the old computer axiom  garbage in, garbage out. We fill our culture with garbage, and we reap the result.If anyone is at all serious about changing any of this, they must address the root problems, and those are cultural decay, the glorification of evil, the devaluation of human life, the breakdown of the family, and specifically the complete abdication of fathers.Meanwhile, the shallow and simple minded liberals will continue to blame pieces of hardware for the problem, and they will long for the days before firearms were invented.But the simple truth is, as long as we place no value on human life, as long as we glorify senseless violence and evil, we will get the exact same result."
Bobby Jindal,R,p,"October 8, 2015",Press Release - What They Are Saying About #LetBobbyDebate,"As Bobby Jindal surges in Iowa, more leading Republicans are calling for him to be on the main debate stage. As it stands now, Kasich, Paul, Christie and Huckabee are all polling lower than Jindal in Iowa, yet they make the cut anyway due to current flawed debate criteria that diminishes the role of early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Here's what they are saying about #LetBobbyDebate:Erick Erikson, Red State: Bobby Jindal Should Be on the Debate StageErick Erickson, Red State: I continue to be appalled that Bobby Jindal is not on the main debate stage with the other candidates. He is doing it again  proposing actual substance and thinking out of the box. This time it is his tax plan.Erick Erickson, Red State: I think it is a travesty that CNBC is further restricting the debate stage at a point candidates are already starting to drop out. I think the American people deserve to hear from Jindal who, by the way, is the only candidate to aggressively stand up to Trump... The two-term Governor of Louisiana deserves to be heard...Political analyst Eric Fehrnstrom in the Boston Globe: Jindal Needs Opportunity to Be On Main StagePolitical analyst Eric Fehrnstrom for the Boston Globe: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has put all his marbles into winning Iowa. This week, a new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows him moving up and tied at 6 percent with Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the first caucus state. Yet, under CNBC's debate rules, a candidate's showing in the national polls is what matters, not the early states. Thus, the little-known Jindal won't be on the main stage, while Rubio, Cruz, and several other candidates polling below them in Iowa will make the cut.Political analyst Eric Fehrnstrom for the Boston Globe: But winning Iowa can catapult a candidate into the spotlight and put him on the road to more victories. Jindal needs his opportunity on the main stage ...Last year, when the new rules governing debates were passed, Priebus said, ""the mainstream media is no longer in charge."" But that can't be true if what's happening at the grass roots takes a back seat to the media's arbitrary decrees.Shane Vander Heart, Iowa's Caffeinated Thoughts: Current Debate Process Doing Voters a DisserviceShane Vander Heart, Iowa's Caffeinated Thoughts: The process that the Republican National Committee has thrust onto the 2016 Republican field is doing voters a disservice.Shane Vander Heart, Iowa's Caffeinated Thoughts: Jindal is a policy wonk. He stands out in terms of offering substantive domestic policy positions. His experience runs deep and his presence on the primetime debate stage would enhance a discussion on those issues and expose Americans to a sound, experienced candidate.Stuart Rothenberg in Roll Call: Early Iowa Presidential Polls a Better Predictor Than National OnesStuart Rothenberg, Roll Call: ... if history is any guide, early national polls are far less valuable in understanding what is happening in the presidential contest than are reliable surveys of Iowa voters, such as the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls.Stuart Rothenberg, Roll Call: Iowans get the first glimpses of the candidates up close, and they take their role as the first step in the party nominating process remarkably seriously. Given that, their opinions are more informed than are those of most Americans, who pay far less attention to politics and who have not seen the candidates close-up.Stuart Rothenberg, Roll Call: National polls... they tend to be over-valued by those in the national media and behind the curve compared to public opinion trends in Iowa. So if you want to know not only where the race is now but also where it is going, pay particular attention to Iowa surveys from proven pollsters over the next four months.Ben Domenech, The Federalist: Preventing Jindal from Joining Main Stage UnfairJindal tied with Rubio and Cruz in Iowa - lack of national name ID preventing him from joining main debate stage.

In April 2014, Governor Jindal was the first candidate to propose a detailed plan to repeal and replace all of Obamacare.Governor Jindal said, ""I applaud Governor Bush for introducing a health care plan. I released my plan over a year ago, and I continue to be amazed that no other candidates have demonstrated enough policy interest or depth to even attempt to introduce a plan.""Unfortunately, both Jeb's plan and Obamacare are both new federal entitlement programs in which the federal government pays for universal health care for all Americans. This is not an opinion, it is a fact.""Jeb's plan is rejection of the American ideal of individual independence, and an acceptance of the left's demand for more government dependence. Jeb's plan is Obamacare lite.""President Obama succeeded in doing what Hillary had failed to do years before  to create a new federal entitlement program where the government pays for health care for all Americans. Never mind the fact that our existing entitlement programs are on the verge of bankruptcy.""If Jeb's health care plan were to become the Republican alternative, it will mean that Obama and the left have won the fundamental debate about health care in America. It will mean that Republicans have decided to surrender and to accept the idea that taxpayers must pay for a new federal entitlement program providing health care for all.""There is an empty podium available tonight for Joe Biden in the Democrat debate. Jeb should take that spot in order to argue for his Obamacare-lite health care proposal.""My plan focuses on the real problem with health care in America  the need to reduce costs.""Finally, it appears that Jeb's plan is silent on the little detail of what it will cost, which is a hallmark of all things Washington."""

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"November 6, 2015",Press Release - We Endorse Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for President,"President Barack Obama kept his promise eight years ago that he would fundamentally transform America. He certainly has, but not for the better. Our national debt has skyrocketed. Our Constitution has been largely ignored, and our nation has become a nation governed by rule and court opinion rather than by law. We have seen incredible encroachment by our government into our liberty, in particular religious liberty, and it appears that it will only get worse.We face extraordinary times, so our nation needs an extraordinary leader.Looking for this leader has been a difficult process, but not because of a lack of choices. To the contrary, the current GOP field of presidential candidates is the strongest we've seen in decades. There are a number of candidates we believe could serve with distinction and honor in the White House, but there is one who we believe stands out.Caffeinated Thoughts is proud to endorse Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for President of the United States.Governor Jindal has an impressive resume by any standard, but considering he is 44-years-old it is truly remarkable. Graduating from Brown University as a double major with honors at the age of 20, Jindal went on to study as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University where he would later earn his master's degree. Jindal, at the age of 24, was appointed head of Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals. He was later appointed by President George W. Bush as Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. He served two terms representing Louisiana's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives after which he was elected Governor of Louisiana and is currently serving his second term.Jindal speaks of a seven-year long spiritual journey that began while he was in high school, and, at Brown University, culminated in a personal faith and acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. He freely speaks of the realization that he had that Christ died for sin not in some generic way, but for him and his sin personally. He points to the time of that realization as the ""most important moment in my life."" Having such a clear profession of faith in Christ is something that we are pleased to see in a presidential candidate.Jindal also makes it plain that his faith is not something that he keeps put away except for Sundays. His worldview is built upon his faith, and his governance is guided by his worldview. An example of that is his support of the Louisiana Marriage and Conscience Act, in which protections would be given to individuals or businesses who oppose same-sex marriage. A number of corporations opposing the bill expressed their disapproval to him, but his reply was firm: ""They are free to voice their opinions, but they will not deter me.""According to the Cato Institute, of the governors that were or still are GOP candidates for the presidential nomination, Jindal is the only one that has actually cut spending in his state. Cato Budget Analyst Nicole Kaeding wrote this: ""Louisiana general fund spending has fallen during Bobby Jindal's tenure as governor. At a time when states were increasing spending, Jindal instituted reforms that cut the state workforce and lowered per capita spending. This feat makes Jindal unique among Republican contenders for the presidency."" We are confident that when Jindal says he intends to reduce federal spending, he will succeed in getting it done. He has a unique credibility in that regard.Louisiana, under his leadership, was named by Americans United for Life as the most pro-life state in the nation six years in a row. He has signed numerous pro-life bills as Governor that led to his state's status. In light of recent videos exposing Planned Parenthood's involvement in harvesting fetal body parts for profit, Jindal ordered an investigation of Planned Parenthood. He also rescinded Medicaid contracts his state had with the abortion provider that fully defunded Planned Parenthood of all taxpayer funds that provided a model for governors in other states to follow. He has stood and fought in federal court over his decision, and we applaud the fortitude he has shown that is unfortunately rare among many governors and in Washington, DC.With Jindal at the helm, Louisiana has consistently been graded an A+ by the National Rifle Association. As Governor he signed legislation that strengthened Louisiana's stand your ground and castle doctrine laws. In 2012 Louisiana also passed its own constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms. As a member of Congress, Jindal received the NRA's Harlon B. Carter award for working to address gun confiscations that took place in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in order to prevent them from happening again.Read the full article here."

Bobby Jindal,R,p,"November 13, 2015",Press Release - RedState: Conservative Voters Should Give Bobby Jindal A Chance,"While we are still a few months from the start of the voting and the need to get this down to a 2 or 3 candidate race (as it should be by early/mid March), time is already running short for the oversized 2016 GOP field to contract and winnow out at least 6 or 7 of the dark-horse candidates. For the good of the party, given the sprawling size of the 14-candidate field (originally 16, before Rick Perry and Scott Walker honorably bowed out), people need to step aside and stop draining money, polling support and TV time away from center stage, and let the voters decide among the survivors who have a real chance of soldiering on through the spring. Along the way, some interesting and/or qualified candidates who might have gone further in another year  Chris Christie, John Kasich, even onetime poll frontrunners Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)  may fall by the wayside. So may two candidates who actually did go further in past years: Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. But as that winnowing process kicks into gear, conservatives and Republicans ought to give another long look at the best candidate in either party's 2016 field: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.Jindal is both the youngest and most experienced candidate in the race, the one with the best record of conservative accomplishment, the best and most detailed conservative platform, and the proven character and ability to lead the nation in crisis and to turn policy proposals into actual results. He is both the best potential President in the 2016 GOP field and a better general election candidate than any of the alternatives who might be considered more conservative or more anti-establishment. No candidate is perfect, but Jindal deserves to be among the finalists in this race, and should certainly be a significant part of the next Republican Administration.Read the full article."
